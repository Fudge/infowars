[00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:15.038]  It's Monday, September 25th, 2023.
[00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:21.141]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this is going to be the most jam-packed broadcast ever.
[00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.162]  The quickening is here.
[00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:25.744]  The political planets have aligned for the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:00:25.744 --> 00:00:31.687]  We are entering a time of increased insanity, a singularity of corruption.
[00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:43.649]  So let me boil down what's coming up in this first hour in this short first segment and then we'll break down each one of these subjects that all tie together coming up after this first break.
[00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.169]  Obviously,
[00:00:45.245 --> 00:01:04.892]  The big story because it's so illustrative of the truth and how the public has been put into a trance and that real Nazis are hiding in plain view while the same globalist establishment labels anybody that doesn't accept the WEF and the New World Order's real fascist policies as Nazis.
[00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:05.733]  You have an SS
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:22.434]  Soldier of the Waffen SS, the armed Nazi special forces of special forces, whose jobs in occupied countries was to carry out torture, execution, extermination.
[00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:24.136]  Getting a standing ovation.
[00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:29.523]  With Trudeau and Zelensky who brought him there to the event.
[00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:39.287]  And you've got the parliament members that are so historically ignorant, they don't know when they say, and this hero who fought against the Russians in World War II in Ukraine.
[00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:45.580]  Well, the people that fought against the Russians in Ukraine in World War II were the Nazis.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:02:07.478]  Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis, and it's their great-grandsons and grandsons that are the main fighting force today, and who have an actual Nazi symbol on their official uniforms, and most of them have Waffen-SS twin lightning bolt tattoos and swastikas, and they do the Hitler blood and soil rituals.
[00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:13.838]  If you know World War II history, like I do, I'm quite the buff on it.
[00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:15.238]  It's just blaringly obvious.
[00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:17.639]  But it's like if you know a language and somebody else doesn't.
[00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:26.783]  Like if you know what Crip and Blood or MS-13 gang signs are, and you see it tattooed on somebody, you know they're a former prisoner, an ex-con.
[00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:32.045]  But for somebody that doesn't know what those tattoos mean, they have no idea what they're dealing with.
[00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.311]  And so this is ignorance is bliss, but really what it is is incredibly destructive.
[00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:53.735]  So that's the first massive, massive story that we're going to be covering because here's Zelensky, who's Jewish with an actual SS member who they now admit that battalion he was in helped run the extermination
[00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:54.495]  Yes.
[00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:16.610]  Putting up a big occultic memorial there.
[00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.431]  Can't make that up.
[00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:20.874]  By the way, he's hiring her as the ambassador, quote, to the children.
[00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:23.136]  The world's greatest, most famous witch.
[00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.698]  And Aleister Crowley, high priestess.
[00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:28.360]  And then over here he's doing that.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.123]  And then over on the other side he brings a 98-year-old Nazi.
[00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:33.044]  to
[00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:51.296]  So it just goes on and on and on.
[00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:56.002]  It moves the US Embassy back to Jerusalem.
[00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.364]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:03:57.364 --> 00:03:58.746]  So he's a Nazi.
[00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:05.235]  And then you've got the ADL worshipping, as usual, George Soros, who is an actual Nazi collaborator as well.
[00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:05.815]  That's
[00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:25.245]  Human smugglers now and they're trying to follow their oath and even having internal protests.
[00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:26.345]  That's coming up.
[00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:28.527]  Also, Zelensky's demanded a total blank check.
[00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:31.028]  Senator Josh Hawley has been given classified briefings.
[00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:32.069]  It's gone public.
[00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.232]  Said they want unlimited funds even though they admit the Ukrainians are losing internally.
[00:04:37.232 --> 00:04:39.854]  They've been briefed on that, losing bad, but then they lie.
[00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:42.115]  To the American people.
[00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.396]  That's all coming up.
[00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.757]  It's just a massive, massive broadcast today.
[00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:46.698]  Tell everybody you know.
[00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:47.558]  Tune in now.
[00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.119]  We'll play all the video clips and more.
[00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:50.140]  The start of the next segment.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.342]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, BandOffVideo.
[00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:54.663]  Those are the coordinates of freedom.
[00:04:54.663 --> 00:05:01.086]  Share those links now.
[00:05:01.086 --> 00:05:07.130]  My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.
[00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.331]  Many of these products have been sold out
[00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:10.208]  We're good to go.

[00:05:53.627 --> 00:06:03.036]  It's the Trifecta Sale, 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com, and it keeps us on air.
[00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:17.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now an absolute fact, it cannot be doubted, that there is a massive, exploding, accelerating, global awakening to the entire globalist New World Order agenda.
[00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.453]  And everything they touch is turning to pure crap.
[00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:35.583]  All o' the Western world, nationalist and populist and anti-globalist, who are both right-wing and even left-wing, are surging in the polls and winning elections everywhere.
[00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:45.515]  The few places they're not winning, there's clear election fraud, like here in the United States and in Brazil, where they stole it from Bolsonaro.
[00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:52.244]  And in both countries, they're trying to bar both men, Trump and Bolsonaro, from being able to run for office again.
[00:06:53.445 --> 00:07:10.774]  Hey, the globalists can try to hold the damn back, but they're never going to be successful unless they're able to manipulate the Russians into starting a nuclear war and the ruling class believes that that might be better for them because their real enemy is the people and progress.
[00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:13.196]  Taking control of the planet.
[00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:15.119]  They want control of human development.
[00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:17.442]  They want control of human destiny.
[00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:20.406]  They want control of the live extension technology.
[00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:25.051]  So again, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:27.535]  Let me break down what we're about to cover.
[00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.742]  Trump is 10 to 15 points ahead in hundreds of polls.
[00:07:33.742 --> 00:07:44.410]  You notice I've been saying this for about a year because I look at the real scientific polls that are done by major institutions, organizations, and groups that never get any media attention.
[00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.414]  But now the Washington Post, ABC News, and others with their skewed polls
[00:07:50.114 --> 00:07:53.855]  Show Trump at least 10 points ahead of Biden.
[00:07:53.855 --> 00:08:05.239]  And when you look at subsects of the polls, he's more than 15 to 20 points ahead of Biden in key demographics like under 35.
[00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:07.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, that has got them
[00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.108]  In total panic mode.
[00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:36.945]  This is just an unprecedented, gigantor lead that we've not seen since polling began in this country over a hundred years ago.
[00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:39.766]  That's one of the giant stories we're going to be covering.
[00:08:39.766 --> 00:08:54.991]  We've got huge Ukraine news from Senator Josh Hawley, who has come out and said that obviously he's been given classified briefings, and we don't need classified briefings to know this, because the evidence is there, but it just further confirms that Russia
[00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:57.612]  Has completely dominated in one.
[00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:59.414]  The Ukrainian military is broken.
[00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.795]  All the NATO funds and weapons have done nothing.
[00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:03.517]  Russia is getting stronger by the day.
[00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:11.903]  But that Zelensky and NATO won a quote blank check of quote hundreds of billions more a year for at least a decade.
[00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:13.664]  I know Holly's telling the truth.
[00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:14.445]  She's a credible guy.
[00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:23.573]  Plus, they've already said, NATO's already said, oh, we're building permanent factories in Poland and places for weapons, because this is going to go on perhaps for more than a decade.
[00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:26.015]  So we've got that huge news.
[00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:31.880]  We've got the Border Patrol videos of their internal meetings where they're saying, we've followed oaths of office.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.182]  We're not going to keep smelling illegal aliens in.
[00:09:35.103 --> 00:09:36.644]  Joe Biden's a criminal.
[00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:37.544]  We're not going to be part of this.
[00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:41.266]  And now the head of the Border Patrol has gone public saying that.
[00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:44.488]  So they're putting their jobs and their futures on the line.
[00:09:44.488 --> 00:09:46.669]  Finally, the American people are doing the right thing.
[00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.151]  Finally, the bureaucrats are doing the right thing.
[00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:51.172]  Finally, the men and women in law enforcement
[00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:52.152]  I think?
[00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:10.206]  And massive resistance.
[00:10:10.206 --> 00:10:12.447]  So let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:15.349]  Yes, I believe these agencies need to be reorganized or abolished.
[00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:18.191]  But at the same time, they're not all our enemies.
[00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:26.257]  And we've got to be ready for more of them to come over to our side, just like we've seen with so many other prominent organizations and groups.
[00:10:26.257 --> 00:10:36.684]  Because as it dawns in the world how evil the New World Order is and how destructive it is, and that your own future rests with resisting them, we've got to be ready to have defectors over to our side.
[00:10:36.684 --> 00:10:38.084]  Freedom is popular, folks.
[00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.368]  Tyranny doesn't ever go on forever.
[00:10:41.368 --> 00:10:51.600]  So when we see all these people talking like Alex Jones, when we see the understanding of the New World Order becoming mainstream, we have to be ready to accept these people.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.683]  We have to be ready to win.
[00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:55.245]  That is so important.
[00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:57.988]  Speaking of ready to win, the biggest
[00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:04.305]  Public humiliation for the globalists that I've seen in a long time just happened.
[00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:09.989]  This is really struck a chord It's really gotten people's attention and that's the first big story.
[00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:23.699]  I'm gonna cover right now We have here in the chamber today Ukrainian Canadians Ukrainian Canadian world veteran from the Second World War who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians and
[00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:29.341]  And continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98.
[00:11:45.123 --> 00:12:02.810]  Yaroslav Junka, 98, fought in one of the most prestigious SS groups of World War II, where much of the war took place and where some of the biggest massacres and Holocaust events were also carried out.
[00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:09.253]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he was a member of the armed SS.
[00:12:09.253 --> 00:12:14.455]  He was a member of the most elite Nazi organization on the planet.
[00:12:16.017 --> 00:12:17.754]  An actual Nazi.
[00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:25.241]  of the 14th Division of the Waffen-SS in the field.
[00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:36.388]  Now, for anybody that studied World War II, and I certainly have, I've probably read 200 books on the subject, found it fascinating when I was very young, and over the years have read over 200 books.
[00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:47.515]  But you would think that when they gave him a standing ovation a few days ago with Zelensky in the Canadian Parliament for, quote, fighting the Russians in World War II,
[00:12:48.752 --> 00:13:00.802]  That the members of parliament would have known that we were on the side of the Russians in World War II and that the Ukrainians were on the side of the Nazis.
[00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:12.491]  But oh, they didn't know that because all they do, like trained SEALs who are given a fish, is salute and praise whatever they're told to promote.
[00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.794]  And this is really blown up in their face because Putin
[00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:31.150]  Has not been lying about the fact that the largest contingent of the Ukrainian military and of the ruling class in the current group that's in control there is Nazis.
[00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.373]  That is the historic factual demographic of Ukraine.
[00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:45.062]  Since World War Two, the Nazis occupied the country for several years.
[00:13:45.062 --> 00:13:54.111]  And the majority of the Ukrainians, around 60%, historians estimate, sided with the Nazis.
[00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:56.053]  So in the East, they were mainly Russians.
[00:13:56.053 --> 00:13:58.997]  In the West, they saw themselves as more Germanic.
[00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:10.538]  And that's why the government of Ukraine officially calls the Russians subhuman and calls them orcs from Border of the Rings.
[00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:23.848]  Because they say Slavs are basically subhuman, even though almost everyone in that country is at least part Slavic with a Slavic background, even the ones that are blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[00:14:23.848 --> 00:14:26.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality.
[00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:44.205]  The New York Times, CNN have covered it up and said that it's a Russian lie, that there are any Nazis over there, despite the fact their official uniforms have the Nazi symbol used by Ukrainians in World War II, and that many of the soldiers have swastikas on their arms.
[00:14:45.526 --> 00:15:05.253]  They do the Hitlerian blood and soil rituals with tens of thousands of troops at initiations where they cut themselves and climb in these graves and rub dirt all over themselves and just weird, bizarre, Germanic rituals that basically Hitler developed.
[00:15:05.253 --> 00:15:06.514]  You cannot make this up.
[00:15:06.514 --> 00:15:09.855]  This is a real live Nazi cult.
[00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:12.296]  But see, when I say the globalists are like Nazis,
[00:15:13.658 --> 00:15:19.122]  I would say Xi Jinping is like a Nazi, or Xi Jinping is like Attila the Hun.
[00:15:19.122 --> 00:15:25.206]  Just because somebody's a different color doesn't mean they can't be a supremist organization.
[00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.627]  Hitler was based on race.
[00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.929]  Xi Jinping in China is based on race.
[00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:40.517]  And if you look at Klaus Schwab, whose father and grandfather were Nazis, his grandfather helped head up the biggest weapons munition facility and was the head executive of the third largest weapons maker.
[00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:41.718]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:47.313]  It's just like the ADL giving awards to George Soros.
[00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:51.374]  George Soros told 60 Minutes the best time of his life was working for Hitler.
[00:15:51.374 --> 00:15:52.674]  They didn't feel bad about it.
[00:15:52.674 --> 00:15:54.715]  And then it was, quote, exhilarating.
[00:15:54.715 --> 00:15:57.736]  Arnold Schwarzenegger told Rolling Stone he loved Hitler.
[00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:00.757]  But that's OK, because they support the leftist agenda.
[00:16:00.757 --> 00:16:04.998]  So I'm not saying that Soros is a Nazi.
[00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:09.480]  What I'm saying is that they're in a cult of evil, and they'll work with anybody.
[00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:13.599]  Who is evil, but anybody who's good they will oppose.
[00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:21.205]  This is the sickening left actually giving a standing ovation to a real live 98 year old Nazi.
[00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:31.493]  And now the ADL and Simon Wiesenthal Center and all of them have a hang on their face because they're busy calling the average American Nazis and demonizing us with no proof or no evidence.
[00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:35.316]  And the left's getting caught all the time creating fake Nazi groups that they control.
[00:16:35.316 --> 00:16:36.858]  And then meanwhile,
[00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:58.638]  They're so ignorant or just such a cult or think we're so stupid that they bring a super rare, that's like finding a leprechaun or something, but a demonic version of it, a 98-year-old actual Waffen-SS guy who took part in massacres of Jews and shoveled 30-something thousand of them into a ravine.
[00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:09.185]  The same place that Zelensky builds memorials to Jews and then he's right there with a guy that helped kill him and shovel him into a ravine?
[00:17:09.185 --> 00:17:19.993]  I mean, maybe this guy will go on 60 Minutes and say he doesn't feel bad he did it and he'd do it again and it was the best part of his life and it was exhilarating and happy making and maybe the ADL will give him an award.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:27.566]  That's how sick these people are, and it's emblematic of everything they do is turning to crap.
[00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:35.535]  Every lie they've put out is blowing up in their face, and the people are seeing through Jack Smith and the UN prosecutors.
[00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:36.696]  That's who they've got.
[00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:41.160]  His team is made up of a bunch of UN prosecutors, not just him, from The Hague.
[00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:44.903]  And it's the same globalist story every day.
[00:17:44.903 --> 00:17:46.323]  The U.N.
[00:17:46.323 --> 00:17:48.364]  taking over our health care and our bodies.
[00:17:48.364 --> 00:17:48.985]  The U.N.
[00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.626]  taking over regulation and censorship of the Internet.
[00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:52.686]  It's all being announced.
[00:17:52.686 --> 00:17:53.227]  The U.N.
[00:17:53.227 --> 00:17:54.768]  taking over control of global energy.
[00:17:54.768 --> 00:17:56.028]  Well, who runs the U.N.?
[00:17:56.028 --> 00:17:57.329]  The big global corporations.
[00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:58.910]  Who created the E.U.?
[00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.450]  The E.U.
[00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.092]  was an idea of Adolf Alois Hitler.
[00:18:03.092 --> 00:18:06.373]  Edward VIII, the King of England, had to advocate because he was a Nazi.
[00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:09.375]  He stayed in Europe during World War II for much of the war in Spain.
[00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:10.885]  He
[00:18:28.342 --> 00:18:32.826]  They manipulated Hitler into thinking that England was going to side with him and they didn't.
[00:18:32.826 --> 00:18:33.627]  That's just a fact.
[00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:36.810]  And they removed Neville Chamberlain and brought in Winston Churchill.
[00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:44.296]  So, World War II set the global order and set up the Bretton Woods system and the whole society we're in today.
[00:18:45.117 --> 00:18:54.041]  And now they're setting up a new order based around the European Union allied with the Communist Chinese that is basically based on many of the ideas that Adolf Hitler came up with.
[00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:55.822]  Hitler relaunched the Olympics.
[00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:58.183]  Hitler created the design of the Volkswagen.
[00:18:58.183 --> 00:19:04.326]  Hitler created the symbol of the Olympics and the symbol of Audi.
[00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:06.947]  All of it, folks, it's all from Hitler.
[00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:08.408]  And so real things from Hitler
[00:19:09.827 --> 00:19:10.868]  We're not supposed to talk about.
[00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:20.694]  But then we project onto America that had nothing to do with Hitler and onto Alex Jones, when both my grandfathers fought in World War II, that I'm a Nazi?
[00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:22.875]  I'm not associated with George Soros.
[00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:24.716]  I'm not associated with Zelensky.
[00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:30.940]  I don't have SS death squad operators in standing ovations with me.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.821]  I have nothing to do with that.
[00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.642]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.533]  Because the evil globalist corporate media with all the blood on their hands from all these wars can sit there and sell this lie as long as the public stays asleep.
[00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:45.574]  And it goes further.
[00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:49.840]  Madeleine Albright was on 60 Minutes one time, and of course she said, 500,000 children dying.
[00:19:53.224 --> 00:19:56.446]  In Iraq, when she tripled the sanctions on them, is a good price to pay.
[00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:57.126]  She'd do it again.
[00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:57.627]  Remember that?
[00:19:57.627 --> 00:19:58.847]  Remember that?
[00:19:58.847 --> 00:20:13.536]  Well, she also, in the same 60 minutes, got in trouble and got sued because on the wall behind her was a famous painting that had been missing since World War II that her father stole from fellow Jews, claiming he'd help them get out of the country.
[00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:18.659]  And he stole their wealth, the equivalent of billions, and then handed Jews over to the Nazis.
[00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:19.880]  So he was a big version
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.801]  Of George Soros.
[00:20:51.901 --> 00:20:54.682]  A lot of Jews were able to get out and go to Israel and go to the U.S.
[00:20:54.682 --> 00:20:55.842]  and go other places.
[00:20:55.842 --> 00:21:06.607]  But they had to pay money, ladies and gentlemen, Palestine at the time, they had to pay money to the brokers, who were Jewish in many cases, to do it.
[00:21:06.607 --> 00:21:11.689]  And that's the dirty secret of Madeleine Albright and George Soros and the ADL.
[00:21:11.689 --> 00:21:14.150]  And now there's their God, Zelensky.
[00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:17.543]  Saying, oh, I'm a Jewish president, so it's okay.
[00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:19.603]  We've got an army made up of Nazis.
[00:21:19.603 --> 00:21:23.464]  Zelensky last year told the New York Times, yeah, a lot of our people are Nazis.
[00:21:23.464 --> 00:21:24.064]  They're good people.
[00:21:24.064 --> 00:21:26.065]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:37.988]  So that's why they arrogantly brought this guy up there was to celebrate it and to rub it in our faces over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:21:37.988 --> 00:21:39.068]  So what is Madeleine Albright?
[00:21:39.068 --> 00:21:40.429]  Is she a Nazi?
[00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:44.110]  No, she's a monstrous, cutthroat, ruthless killer.
[00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:47.337]  Because that stuff existed before the Nazis.
[00:21:47.337 --> 00:21:48.597]  It exists now today.
[00:21:48.597 --> 00:21:49.857]  It's just called evil people.
[00:21:49.857 --> 00:21:50.877]  Madeleine Albright's evil.
[00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:52.438]  Xi Jinping's evil.
[00:21:52.438 --> 00:21:54.118]  The ADL's evil.
[00:21:54.118 --> 00:21:55.338]  Zelensky's evil.
[00:21:55.338 --> 00:21:56.899]  The Azov Battalion's evil.
[00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.599]  And they're starting World War III.
[00:21:58.599 --> 00:22:01.800]  So that's our first big report.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.600]  Look at the photos.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.741]  See the videos.
[00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:06.101]  See it all for yourself on InfoWars.com.
[00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:08.082]  But the world is awakening.
[00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:11.402]  And the globalist tyrants know that their time is short.
[00:22:11.402 --> 00:22:13.223]  Now let's move on to our next big story.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.783]  Oh wait, before I move on to the next story, I forgot this one last little tidbit.
[00:22:18.783 --> 00:22:21.844]  I mean, there's so many, we'll talk about it more later.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:34.632]  Here is one member of the Canadian Parliament a few years ago during the Canadian trucker protest against the endless lockdowns and forced injections saying that honk, honk, honking your horn is code for Heil Hitler.
[00:22:34.632 --> 00:22:38.574]  And it wasn't just this kook, it was a bunch of others saying it as well.
[00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:40.555]  So, the OK hand symbol,
[00:22:41.836 --> 00:22:42.717]  All of that's bad.
[00:22:42.717 --> 00:22:44.279]  All of that's Nazi.
[00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:46.501]  Being white's inherently evil, says the ADL.
[00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:50.404]  Just white people are inherently bad, except for ADL members.
[00:22:50.404 --> 00:22:53.507]  But if you honk your horn, that's also Hal Hitler.
[00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:55.850]  Here it is.
[00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:06.440]  How much vitriol do we have to see of Honk Honk, which is an acronym for Hail Hitler, do we need to see by these protesters on social media?
[00:23:08.399 --> 00:23:09.462]  Now you heard her.
[00:23:09.462 --> 00:23:12.029]  She's a member of the Canadian Parliament.
[00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:15.278]  And if you honk your horn in protest, you are hailing Hitler.
[00:23:16.072 --> 00:23:26.617]  Now if you give a standing ovation to an actual SS commander who helped round up Jews and shoot them in the back of the head and throw them into pits, no problem.
[00:23:26.617 --> 00:23:27.677]  No problem.
[00:23:27.677 --> 00:23:36.781]  But if you don't want to be locked down in your house, don't want kids to have to wear masks forever, don't want to be locked down, don't want to starve everybody to death, you are a Nazi.
[00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:38.262]  But if you want to lock people up in their houses,
[00:23:40.963 --> 00:23:52.148]  And remember, all of this is interconnected.
[00:23:52.148 --> 00:24:02.473]  Once you understand history, once you understand the globalist roots, once you understand their aims and their goals, then you can study each section of their attacks, each head of the Hydra, and understand how to defeat them.
[00:24:02.473 --> 00:24:04.815]  So segueing out of the actual SS
[00:24:07.142 --> 00:24:08.722]  Let's segue to what's happening currently.
[00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:30.897]  Cy Hirsch has reported from his sources.
[00:24:30.897 --> 00:24:32.878]  You can see it for yourself.
[00:24:32.878 --> 00:24:34.578]  They lied to us about Ukraine.
[00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:36.099]  They lied to us about the history of the war.
[00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:41.461]  And they lied to us about the offensive and that the Ukrainians were winning.
[00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:44.162]  And some numbers are at 113 billion.
[00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:46.643]  The real numbers are closer to 200 billion.
[00:24:46.643 --> 00:24:51.365]  But regardless, Senator Josh Hawley has been given a quote classified briefing.
[00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:52.305]  We're good
[00:25:12.486 --> 00:25:16.589]  German military bases for wounds sustained in Ukraine.
[00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:18.951]  They simply put on Ukrainian uniforms.
[00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:23.274]  So we're officially at war with Russia.
[00:25:23.274 --> 00:25:24.595]  It's escalating every day.
[00:25:25.652 --> 00:25:30.294]  And now you can go to InfoWars.com and read the very important article.
[00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:33.595]  Senators shocked by classified briefing on Ukraine.
[00:25:33.595 --> 00:25:37.257]  Warhawks want blank check with no victory in sight.
[00:25:37.257 --> 00:25:51.743]  Senator Josh Hawley, Republican Missouri, known for his efforts to force the Biden administration to classify information related to COVID's possible lab origins at Wuhan, exited a classified briefing this week on the situation in Ukraine and expressed a feeling of shock.
[00:25:52.543 --> 00:25:54.784]  Well, if he was listening to my show, he wouldn't be shocked.
[00:25:54.784 --> 00:25:58.226]  If there is some path to victory in Ukraine, I didn't hear it today.
[00:25:58.226 --> 00:26:03.468]  I also heard that there's going to be no end to the funding request.
[00:26:03.468 --> 00:26:09.391]  He went on to say they want hundreds of billions of dollars a year and that it could last for a decade.
[00:26:09.391 --> 00:26:11.732]  Well, again, classified briefing?
[00:26:11.732 --> 00:26:12.713]  These are just synopsis.
[00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:17.114]  The head of NATO said it could last 10 years just a few months ago, publicly.
[00:26:17.114 --> 00:26:27.798]  So, all this quote Intel stuff, oh you need the intelligence agencies to tell you the senators are just now learning that the Russians are winning?
[00:26:27.798 --> 00:26:31.480]  They've been winning the entire time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.602]  So, remember the corporate media lied to you, they brainwashed you, Senator Josh.
[00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:47.017]  Holly also has exposed that the CIA was involved brainwashing the public concerning COVID and elections and everything else.
[00:26:47.017 --> 00:26:48.498]  It's illegal.
[00:26:48.498 --> 00:26:50.499]  The agencies have taken over.
[00:26:50.499 --> 00:26:53.340]  They've been put in place by the big banks, by BlackRock.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.361]  We're occupied.
[00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:56.062]  We're conquered.
[00:26:56.062 --> 00:26:57.863]  And now they're starting fights with Russia.
[00:26:57.863 --> 00:26:59.864]  Now they're starting nuclear wars.
[00:26:59.864 --> 00:27:01.185]  They're insane.
[00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:03.946]  They're dangerous.
[00:27:03.946 --> 00:27:06.688]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of the senator
[00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:08.387]  We're good to go.
[00:27:23.573 --> 00:27:25.554]  The Senators can act like they don't know what's going on.
[00:27:25.554 --> 00:27:28.116]  They do know what's going on, and it needs to stop.
[00:27:28.116 --> 00:27:34.040]  We have a bunch of psychotic, disconnected lunatics running this country and much of the world, and it's got to stop.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:43.366]  Because Senator Hawley said, well, you know, the CIA said we've got to keep the war going or it'll embarrass America's standing in the world.
[00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:44.747]  Embarrass our standing?
[00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:48.910]  The whole world sees through this and who we're backing, and these crazy Nazis.
[00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.033]  And how's it going to help America's standing if there's a huge nuclear war and most of us are dead?
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.681]  How about that standing?
[00:27:55.681 --> 00:27:59.023]  So, no, America's standing was strong when we weren't the bad guy.
[00:27:59.023 --> 00:28:00.564]  And we're becoming the bad guy.
[00:28:00.564 --> 00:28:03.446]  We certainly are run by the bad guys and it needs to stop.
[00:28:03.446 --> 00:28:08.088]  So here's the senator talking about the CIA brainwashing the American people.
[00:28:08.088 --> 00:28:09.149]  By the way, that's illegal.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.861]  Intelligence dangerously compromised warrants CIA and FBI whistleblowers.
[00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:20.802]  You're not the only one to report this, of course, but I was reading your report on it this morning.
[00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:32.564]  This is something that you have been warning about for quite some time, and the allegations stem from a whistleblower who has come forward to the House, a whistleblower from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:28:32.564 --> 00:28:37.145]  I have the letter, the relevant letter, here from the House Oversight Committee.
[00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:38.225]  The whistleblower alleges
[00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:46.052]  That a CIA team was paid to change its assessment of the origins of COVID-19.
[00:28:46.052 --> 00:28:50.476]  Do I have that broadly correct to set your understanding of the report?
[00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:53.959]  This is obviously a bombshell report.
[00:28:53.959 --> 00:28:55.300]  Deeply, deeply troubling.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.583]  I'm glad that the House is going to look into it.
[00:28:57.583 --> 00:28:58.563]  We should look into it.
[00:28:59.943 --> 00:29:01.004]  Don't lie down and take it.
[00:29:01.004 --> 00:29:02.865]  Spread the word about this broadcast.

[00:33:01.252 --> 00:33:16.078]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:19.660]  Breaking through the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:25.767]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:25.767 --> 00:33:33.131]  Again, I want to thank everybody for tuning in and sharing the links to this live Monday broadcast of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:35.733]  Let me tell you what's coming up in the second and third hours.
[00:33:35.733 --> 00:33:50.541]  We've got Ezra Levant, the head of Rebel Media, that does an incredible job, as you know, based out of Canada, but they're also international, joining us to respond to the incredible standing ovation endorsement of an actual SS
[00:33:51.642 --> 00:33:59.046]  Operative from World War II who helped reportedly carry out the mass exterminations of Jews and others.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.208]  The standing ovation that he and Zelensky gave him to rub it in our faces.
[00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:07.490]  And just how insane this is and how it's blown into their face and why would they do such a thing?
[00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.972]  That is coming up, ladies and gentlemen, bottom of the next hour.
[00:34:11.212 --> 00:34:19.240]  Then Edward Dowd has got a lot of new intel on just how bad the vaccine deaths are and what he believes the globalist's next move is going to be.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.561]  I agree with him.
[00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:21.882]  Tucker Carlson agrees.
[00:34:21.882 --> 00:34:23.104]  We're all on the same page.
[00:34:23.104 --> 00:34:23.944]  This is critical.
[00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:48.985]  Information the third hour so tell everyone you know tune in for that information now let me Get into a couple of stories that just illustrate the mindset of the left and remember it's the same programs the same organizations from Australia to the US from Canada to Germany from Wales and England to Burgundy France it the same projects
[00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.713]  The same NGOs, the same organizations, the same programs of absolute tyranny.
[00:34:54.713 --> 00:34:57.395]  So here's what they're up to.
[00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.216]  Let's go to this one first.
[00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:08.823]  Missouri AG sues health provider for allegedly not giving mental evaluations before sex reassignments, including in children.
[00:35:08.823 --> 00:35:13.426]  Now, normally somebody shows up and wants something cut off, you know, like, well, are you mentally ill or something wrong?
[00:35:13.426 --> 00:35:14.127]  But instead they're
[00:35:15.129 --> 00:35:27.571]  Exacerbating the mental illness, and then the government and media are going along with it for giant profits, and at the same time it sterilizes the person, so that's good for depopulation.
[00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:41.094]  So that's loving and liberal, and now there's news articles coming out everywhere, again from Europe to the US, where the schools as young as five tell the kids they're transgender, get them to agree they are, then put them in a database
[00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:44.581]  And then keep that information from the parents.
[00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:49.827]  So that's directly taking control of the children's sexual development, of their biology.
[00:35:51.334 --> 00:36:14.096]  And their bodies from the parents in a state-run cult with guidelines and manuals of how to keep it secret and how to keep files on the parents to build a case against them to take the child when they hit seven and the chemical sterilization begins or the physical mutilation, castration, removal of the breast, testicles, ovaries, uteruses.
[00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:16.184]  You name it.
[00:36:16.184 --> 00:36:19.808]  So this is a nightmare situation, but that's who they are.
[00:36:19.808 --> 00:36:24.433]  But more and more pushback is happening, and more and more victims are filing lawsuits.
[00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:28.818]  And so the worm is starting to turn, and we're protecting our children, and that's what this is all about.
[00:36:28.818 --> 00:36:29.299]  But boy...
[00:36:30.393 --> 00:36:37.378]  They have really taken us down a dark, dark road and it shows where they're going to take us if we don't start standing up.
[00:36:37.378 --> 00:36:46.824]  Now, that's wonderful and good to mutilate children and chemically sterilize them and keep it secret from the parents and take the kids away when they're 10 and take them off to be sterilized.
[00:36:46.824 --> 00:36:48.405]  Washington State's passed a law to do that.
[00:36:48.405 --> 00:36:50.386]  They're trying to pass laws in Illinois to do it.
[00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:51.687]  I mean, this is a cult.
[00:36:52.907 --> 00:36:59.051]  Now HBO's got shows that simulate little girls being raped by men when they're eight years old.
[00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:04.654]  I mean, they're just selling this garbage everywhere because they want our souls.
[00:37:04.654 --> 00:37:08.137]  But that is all bad, you see.
[00:37:08.137 --> 00:37:09.838]  It's... it's... it's...
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:16.844]  It's bad to not want to chop a child's genitals off.
[00:37:16.844 --> 00:37:21.148]  It's virtuous to want to do it.
[00:37:21.148 --> 00:37:22.789]  But what else is happening?
[00:37:22.789 --> 00:37:25.031]  Well, what else is the left up to?
[00:37:25.031 --> 00:37:33.639]  Anti-religious group threatens to warn Auburn University after 200 kids baptized on campus
[00:37:35.217 --> 00:37:36.258]  Absolute joke.
[00:37:36.258 --> 00:37:57.549]  So because the football coach and some of the professors who are Christians have their own personal relationships with adult students, they're not trying to cut their penises off, they're not trying to put them on chemicals, they're not trying to get them to go to orgies, but they are Christians, they're allowed to have Christian private associations at state-funded colleges.
[00:37:57.549 --> 00:38:00.191]  Separation of church and state means you don't have a state-run religion.
[00:38:00.791 --> 00:38:07.299]  But it doesn't mean that a valedictorian can't say, I gave my heart to Christ and I think Jesus Christ.
[00:38:07.299 --> 00:38:12.465]  Or it can't say that a football player can't say a prayer before or after a football game.
[00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:14.364]  in the
[00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:43.920]  Saying it's inappropriate for hundreds of students to go and get baptized in the river there by the school with some of the Christian members of the school.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.783]  No, that's their free association.
[00:38:47.783 --> 00:38:58.033]  The Freedom From Religion Foundation says it was inappropriate and unconstitutional for Auburn employees like head coach Hugh Freeze to have participated.
[00:38:59.306 --> 00:39:08.735]  An anti-religious group attempting to throw cold water on an Alabama university after the school's football coach was filmed assisting with the baptism of students.
[00:39:10.256 --> 00:39:14.639]  Has a twisted interpretation of the First Amendment, a legal expert says.
[00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:31.332]  On Friday, the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter to the university president, Christopher Roberts, warning that more than 200 student baptisms, one of which was assisted by Auburn Tigers head coach Hugh Freeze, somehow violated the Constitution's establishment clause.
[00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:33.354]  So it just goes on from there.
[00:39:33.354 --> 00:39:34.475]  They're putting up satanic
[00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:36.118]  I think?
[00:39:57.847 --> 00:39:59.388]  Touch their heart and make them be born again.
[00:39:59.388 --> 00:40:00.809]  That is the worst thing ever.
[00:40:00.809 --> 00:40:03.170]  Because these aren't anti-religion groups, folks.
[00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.191]  These are occultic groups.
[00:40:05.191 --> 00:40:10.974]  You scratch one of these atheists, you scratch one of these people, they're communists, they're globalists, they're you name it.
[00:40:10.974 --> 00:40:12.975]  And they are marching forward.
[00:40:13.695 --> 00:40:27.124]  In fact, I just saw another clip, I'm going to get to it in a few minutes, of a prominent leader speaking to a parliament, a communist, saying, you're not going to stop the New World Order, the ESGs, the carbon taxes, it's our time.
[00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:33.448]  Because it is a communist movement, ladies and gentlemen, run by ultra-rich who are exempt from their own policies.
[00:40:33.448 --> 00:40:36.050]  So, they are so scared of Christians getting together.
[00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.011]  They are so scared of people coming together.
[00:40:38.011 --> 00:40:38.991]  They are so scared
[00:40:40.192 --> 00:40:44.515]  Of a chain reaction of coming back to God to counteract this poison.
[00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:46.737]  But there is a new revival happening.
[00:40:46.737 --> 00:40:49.899]  And it's not happening in these controlled corporate 501c3 churches.
[00:40:49.899 --> 00:40:59.325]  It is happening in real churches and in businesses and in colleges and just as people realize there is good and evil and we need God.
[00:40:59.325 --> 00:41:06.190]  So I salute that university and I tell them stand up to these tyrants and don't let these monsters tell you that you can't freely associate.
[00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.893]  Remember how during the COVID lockdowns, Black Lives Matter could march, but nobody else could?
[00:41:10.893 --> 00:41:15.236]  They'd beat you up for not wearing a mask or being out in public, but Black Lives Matter could.
[00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:19.960]  And then they had a fake study saying, when Black Lives Matter marches, it cuts COVID.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.881]  But when you go out, it increases COVID.
[00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:26.184]  And by the way, don't look at the sun, don't talk to your neighbors, don't watch the sunset.
[00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:32.169]  These are cults trying to see how much ridiculous crap they can get you to follow and go along with.
[00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:41.945]  Migrant encounters at the southern border are surging once again after a lull this summer with cities straining to host more asylum seekers.
[00:41:41.945 --> 00:41:52.015]  To alleviate the pressure, President Biden granted temporary legal status to nearly half a million Venezuelans already in the country, allowing them to legally work.
[00:41:52.455 --> 00:41:59.336]  But thousands more migrants are arriving daily, testing the Biden administration's migration strategy.
[00:41:59.336 --> 00:42:04.657]  ABC's Matt Rivers is in El Paso with the new Border Chief in charge there.
[00:42:04.657 --> 00:42:07.338]  Good morning, Matt.
[00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:08.098]  Good morning, Martha.
[00:42:08.098 --> 00:42:19.140]  We had an exclusive conversation with the new Border Patrol Chief, Jason Owens, who laid out the myriad challenges facing his organization amidst unrelenting historic migration.
[00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:23.328]  The crisis continues at the U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:25.971]  The highest total of migrant encounters since December.
[00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:29.655]  And this month, reportedly on pace to surpass that figure.
[00:42:29.655 --> 00:42:32.858]  And this morning, exclusive access to the top U.S.
[00:42:32.858 --> 00:42:34.580]  official on the front line.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:41.387]  Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens giving ABC News his first interview since taking over the top job nearly three months ago.
[00:42:41.747 --> 00:42:50.091]  In terms of flow and the threats that we're seeing with fentanyl and with criminal organizations that are our adversary, it's about as bad as I've ever seen it.
[00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:52.812]  The last week has been intense, to say the least.
[00:42:52.812 --> 00:42:56.574]  Thousands crossing per day in the latest spike in migration.
[00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:06.699]  We haven't seen these numbers since the end of Title 42, the pandemic-era policy that allowed officials to quickly expel most migrants at the border without allowing asylum claims.
[00:43:07.339 --> 00:43:13.123]  How sustainable is this, your ability to respond to this amount of people at the border?
[00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:14.124]  This isn't sustainable.
[00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:18.667]  This is, up and down the system, everybody is overwhelmed.
[00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:21.749]  Even the government of Mexico, which have been great partners for us.
[00:43:21.749 --> 00:43:22.170]  The U.S.
[00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.472]  Border Patrol, a lot of times our facilities are already over capacity.
[00:43:25.672 --> 00:43:33.299]  Nowhere more overwhelmed than the small town of Eagle Pass, Texas, where thousands of migrants converged and crossed over the last week.
[00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:35.942]  Behind that, in part, organized crime.
[00:43:35.942 --> 00:43:40.366]  Officials say human smugglers surged migrants to that area for a reason.
[00:43:40.366 --> 00:43:46.692]  So you believe what's happening in Eagle Pass is directly a distraction to occupy your time instead of looking at something else?
[00:43:46.992 --> 00:43:52.377]  I believe it's a money-making opportunity for those smugglers, and I believe it's a distraction for them to cross other things into the country.
[00:43:52.377 --> 00:43:53.458]  Other things like?
[00:43:53.458 --> 00:44:01.104]  Narcotics, fentanyl, bulk cash, weapons, people of interest, whether it be hardened criminals, gang members, convicted sexual predators.
[00:44:02.205 --> 00:44:10.171]  Owen says his agents should be focused on stopping those kind of things, but instead must deal with unrelenting flows of migrants.
[00:44:10.171 --> 00:44:16.055]  It's quickly overwhelmed federal facilities, with officials forced to release thousands of migrants into the U.S.
[00:44:16.055 --> 00:44:18.237]  to await immigration proceedings.
[00:44:18.237 --> 00:44:23.901]  Human smugglers promising migrants they'll simply just be let in, which Owen says is not true.
[00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:29.706]  They're still facing removal and deportation, so it is not this open gate that the smugglers are promising.
[00:44:29.706 --> 00:44:30.626]  But that's what they're saying.
[00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:31.387]  That's what they're saying.
[00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:35.070]  Immigration law aside, migrants are going to keep coming.
[00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:44.358]  A record 81,000 plus migrants crossed the notorious Darien Gap from Colombia to Panama last month, eventually joined on the route to the U.S.
[00:44:44.358 --> 00:44:47.240]  by those from Central America and Mexico.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.505]  Owens is keenly aware of the political debate, but says his agency just follows the law.
[00:44:52.765 --> 00:44:56.047]  We see a lot of folks say, just push people back.
[00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:59.269]  Just don't let them cross or send them back immediately.
[00:44:59.269 --> 00:44:59.590]  The U.S.
[00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.331]  Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency.
[00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.672]  We enforce the laws that are on the books.
[00:45:03.672 --> 00:45:10.297]  We don't have the right, nor should we, of denying somebody due process once they are on American soil.
[00:45:10.856 --> 00:45:18.039]  And Martha, the thing that Owens kept coming back to is that it is not the job of Border Patrol agents to process migrants, or at least it shouldn't be.
[00:45:18.039 --> 00:45:32.346]  It's their job to stop deadly, harmful things from coming into the country, but they can't do that as long as this kind of migration keeps happening, and as long as Congress doesn't pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix what is unquestionably a broken system.
[00:45:32.346 --> 00:45:34.027]  Martha?
[00:45:34.027 --> 00:45:35.587]  Matt Rivers, thank you.
[00:45:35.587 --> 00:45:37.128]  We stay focused.
[00:45:37.128 --> 00:45:39.129]  We continue to do the job and the mission.
[00:45:40.135 --> 00:45:41.956]  We signed up for it.
[00:45:41.956 --> 00:45:43.016]  We all signed up for it.
[00:45:43.016 --> 00:45:44.096]  We all raised our hand.
[00:45:44.096 --> 00:45:46.037]  It's kind of hard to say that.
[00:45:46.037 --> 00:45:47.437]  It's in the present constitution.
[00:45:47.437 --> 00:45:48.857]  It's not hard to say it.
[00:45:48.857 --> 00:45:52.338]  It may be hard for you to say it, but I've been doing it for 31 years.
[00:45:52.338 --> 00:45:54.259]  It's not hard for me to say it.
[00:45:54.259 --> 00:46:00.060]  Every day I wake up and I'm committed to this organization and I'm committed to each one of y'all.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.761]  You say the exact same thing, but there's been a lack of policies now.
[00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:04.342]  But then you keep releasing it.
[00:46:04.342 --> 00:46:09.163]  You're getting bogged down in the policies and apologies that you say illegally.
[00:46:10.209 --> 00:46:11.950]  What's happening?
[00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.251]  That's why Chief Scott left.
[00:46:13.251 --> 00:46:14.672]  You just said it!
[00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:16.873]  You can't say that didn't happen to you!
[00:46:16.873 --> 00:46:18.134]  You just said it!
[00:46:18.134 --> 00:46:20.315]  You're an old generation, old generation.
[00:46:20.315 --> 00:46:24.617]  Why are you guys getting caught up in some mantles?
[00:46:24.617 --> 00:46:25.177]  Right?
[00:46:25.177 --> 00:46:26.938]  There's a mission out there to meet you.
[00:46:26.938 --> 00:46:29.160]  There's a mission out there to see what we're doing.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.322]  We can sit here and argue about it till we're blue in the face.
[00:46:33.322 --> 00:46:34.322]  Right?
[00:46:34.322 --> 00:46:36.684]  I've been doing this job as long as y'all.
[00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:37.744]  That's a problem.
[00:46:37.744 --> 00:46:38.105]  What's that?
[00:46:38.105 --> 00:46:38.745]  That's a problem, Chief.
[00:46:39.842 --> 00:46:42.323]  For evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[00:46:42.323 --> 00:46:43.204]  I can't hear you, Kevin.
[00:46:43.204 --> 00:46:45.505]  For evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[00:46:45.505 --> 00:46:46.866]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:48.286]  Good men are doing nothing.
[00:46:48.286 --> 00:46:50.507]  You're allowing the middle ages to be dropped off their knees.
[00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:51.928]  You are doing something.
[00:46:51.928 --> 00:46:52.708]  No, sir, we're not.
[00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:53.469]  You are.
[00:46:53.469 --> 00:46:55.030]  You're rescuing people every day.
[00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.231]  You're taking fentanyl off the streets every day.
[00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:58.771]  You're taking fentanyl seizures.
[00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:04.014]  Under this administration, for the last year, we've got the highest fentanyl death in the history of our country.
[00:47:04.014 --> 00:47:05.034]  In one year.
[00:47:05.034 --> 00:47:05.575]  In this country.
[00:47:05.575 --> 00:47:08.076]  You know, we've made more fentanyl seizures
[00:47:08.863 --> 00:47:09.803]  Already this year?
[00:47:09.803 --> 00:47:10.804]  Then we made last year?
[00:47:10.804 --> 00:47:16.505]  How many of them do not actually?
[00:47:16.505 --> 00:47:21.487]  We're focusing on the standards.
[00:47:21.487 --> 00:47:29.869]  You just saw or slash listened to clips of the Border Patrol head saying the agency cannot protect the U.S.
[00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:34.771]  because they are forced to process so many illegals.
[00:47:34.771 --> 00:47:36.011]  And we also have internal video.
[00:47:37.873 --> 00:47:46.036]  of senior border patrol having meetings with the other officers, the other agents, and saying, we have an oath.
[00:47:46.036 --> 00:47:46.936]  We've got to stop this.
[00:47:46.936 --> 00:47:50.417]  We're literally completing the smuggling process.
[00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:55.999]  Well, what's really happening here is the process of awakening and realizing that the bottom's fallen out of this country.
[00:47:55.999 --> 00:48:02.382]  We literally have globalists running the nation that are working against it and dissolving it.
[00:48:02.382 --> 00:48:05.583]  Again, the earlier story, leftist groups threatening to sue
[00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:20.734]  If the football coach who's a Christian goes in his off spare time and goes to a river by the college and hundreds of young people come together in Christ, that's our free association, you monsters, you cult members.
[00:48:21.775 --> 00:48:26.537]  I mean, again, only in places like communist China where they restrict Christians from doing that.
[00:48:26.537 --> 00:48:28.598]  Or say you can't do that at a university.
[00:48:28.598 --> 00:48:29.119]  What's next?
[00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:31.080]  Send us to re-education?
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.521]  And yes, that's what the whole COVID lockdowns are about.
[00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:36.902]  The smokescreen to start disappearing their political enemies.
[00:48:36.902 --> 00:48:45.747]  And now all over the globalist world, they are saying the next time there's a virus, we're going to lock up people that don't go along with it in the COVID camps.
[00:48:47.168 --> 00:48:48.328]  They're going for broke.
[00:48:48.328 --> 00:48:50.409]  They're trying to put everybody in prison.
[00:48:50.409 --> 00:48:51.189]  They're criminals.
[00:48:51.189 --> 00:48:59.532]  And I know as a general audience, you get that, but we cannot get punch drunk here in this fight and just become complacent and just accept we live in tyranny.
[00:48:59.532 --> 00:49:09.895]  We have to understand it's only going to get worse until we wake up and say no and break free of the system of lies, the empire of lies.
[00:49:10.967 --> 00:49:15.090]  That is Hollywood, that is the left, that is the CIA, that is the globalists.
[00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.030]  They have to be stopped.
[00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:17.351]  They're not Americans.
[00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:18.332]  They're anti-Americans.
[00:49:18.332 --> 00:49:20.113]  Everything they do is destroy this country.
[00:49:20.113 --> 00:49:21.073]  They're not our leaders.
[00:49:21.073 --> 00:49:24.916]  They are a fraud working against us.
[00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:37.284]  Speaking of fraud, the big national polls that you see pushed in the last couple of years showing Biden ahead of Trump or Trump and Biden in a dead heat are fraudulent.
[00:49:38.044 --> 00:49:41.205]  You can go read the methodology of these big national polls.
[00:49:41.205 --> 00:49:43.946]  It's the groups they sample that they've sampled before.
[00:49:43.946 --> 00:49:45.867]  They know how they're going to vote.
[00:49:45.867 --> 00:49:53.550]  It's also the fact that they'll sample 10 to 15% more Democrats saying that they believe there's quote more Democrats in America than Republicans.
[00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.612]  There's a lot of other ways they manipulate it.
[00:49:56.612 --> 00:50:06.456]  But even in those manipulated polls by the Washington Post and others, Trump is now 10 to 20 points, depending on the demographic, ahead of
[00:50:07.711 --> 00:50:09.132]  Joe Biden.
[00:50:09.132 --> 00:50:16.198]  So imagine, even though there's all that fraudulent methodology being put in, garbage data, Trump is still way ahead.
[00:50:16.198 --> 00:50:18.299]  They are in complete panic mode.
[00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:24.985]  I could have told them, and I did on air, that indicting Trump would supercharge him because America is in an awakening.
[00:50:24.985 --> 00:50:26.786]  America is in a realignment.
[00:50:26.786 --> 00:50:29.288]  America is breaking with the system.
[00:50:29.288 --> 00:50:30.569]  It's beyond political.
[00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:32.651]  People know we've got a hijacked government.
[00:50:33.424 --> 00:50:34.745]  And they're upset about it.
[00:50:34.745 --> 00:50:41.513]  And so now the articles on Infowars.com, the Washington Post has come out and said, oh, our poll wasn't correct.
[00:50:41.513 --> 00:50:42.874]  Our poll's not accurate.
[00:50:42.874 --> 00:50:45.978]  Really, Joe Biden is in a dead heat with Trump.
[00:50:45.978 --> 00:50:51.864]  So even their skewed polls show that Biden's losing and is super unpopular.
[00:50:51.864 --> 00:50:54.627]  And he was unpopular two and a half years ago when he stole the election.
[00:50:55.228 --> 00:50:56.069]  And we all know that.
[00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:59.553]  That's why they're trying to outlaw questioning it, because it's so popular.
[00:50:59.553 --> 00:51:03.538]  80 plus percent of Americans who are Republicans believe it was stolen.
[00:51:03.538 --> 00:51:05.761]  Upwards of 50 percent of Democrats believe it was stolen.
[00:51:06.493 --> 00:51:07.433]  Are you going to arrest us all?
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.601]  I don't think so.
[00:51:43.897 --> 00:51:44.277]  I think?
[00:52:02.293 --> 00:52:05.435]  It still overtakes even the fraud they've got baked into the cake.
[00:52:05.435 --> 00:52:12.721]  So they're going to have to up the fraud even more and now discredit their own poll telling you that Trump is way ahead.
[00:52:12.721 --> 00:52:14.702]  They're losing the hearts and minds.
[00:52:14.702 --> 00:52:16.363]  They're losing the people.
[00:52:16.363 --> 00:52:18.104]  The people know we're being de-industrialized.
[00:52:18.104 --> 00:52:20.126]  The people know that the globalists are at war with us.
[00:52:20.126 --> 00:52:28.372]  And as long as we hang on and continue to speak out at city councils and school boards and everywhere else, we're going to win.
[00:52:28.372 --> 00:52:29.553]  We're going to come together.
[00:52:29.553 --> 00:52:30.914]  Now they're going to launch some false flags.
[00:52:31.817 --> 00:52:33.438]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[00:52:33.438 --> 00:52:39.421]  Race-based false flags, cyber attacks, power outages, expanded wars, stock market crashes.
[00:52:39.421 --> 00:52:40.901]  It's all in the cards.
[00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:44.463]  That's why we've got to understand they're the ones behind it.
[00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:46.184]  They're the ones exacerbating it.
[00:52:46.184 --> 00:52:47.264]  They're the enemy.
[00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:49.385]  Our government has been hijacked.
[00:52:49.385 --> 00:52:51.086]  The government's not the enemy.
[00:52:51.086 --> 00:52:55.928]  We've got to take control of our government and remove the criminals and have real reform.
[00:52:55.928 --> 00:52:57.349]  That is the secret.
[00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:58.449]  That is the key.
[00:52:58.449 --> 00:52:59.210]  That is the answer.
[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:08.859]  And that's why this broadcast is so critical, and that's why you're so critical, and that's why we need your word of mouth, we need your prayer, and we need your financial support now.
[00:53:08.859 --> 00:53:11.681]  We have the trifecta sale going, the biggest sale of the year.
[00:53:11.681 --> 00:53:14.643]  Our three best-selling products have been sold out for a long time.
[00:53:14.643 --> 00:53:17.144]  It's been over a year since all three were in together.
[00:53:17.144 --> 00:53:21.707]  Real Red Pill Plus, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:53:21.707 --> 00:53:30.253]  What this does for every part of your body, your immune system, your joints, your bones, antioxidant, inflammation, libido, focus, stamina,
[00:53:30.753 --> 00:53:30.873]  Yeah.
[00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:01.274]  We're fighting for you.
[00:54:01.274 --> 00:54:02.615]  You're fighting for us.
[00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:07.538]  It is a win-win symbiotic relationship, but the machine doesn't work.
[00:54:07.538 --> 00:54:08.859]  The engine doesn't work.
[00:54:08.859 --> 00:54:09.939]  The dog doesn't hunt.
[00:54:09.939 --> 00:54:17.164]  If you don't make the decision to go to info or store.com now and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[00:54:17.164 --> 00:54:19.586]  There's a lot of other great quality supplements.
[00:54:19.586 --> 00:54:21.807]  Amazing CBD oil.
[00:54:21.807 --> 00:54:24.009]  We've got thousand milligram, 3000 milligram.
[00:54:24.009 --> 00:54:28.612]  The strongest best there is thousand milligrams salve for your joints and bones.
[00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:29.973]  CBD rebels in.

[00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:06.731]  Jonescrowder.com.
[00:55:06.731 --> 00:55:09.053]  That's jonescrowder.com.

[00:55:12.836 --> 00:55:13.597]  Jonescrowder.com.
[00:55:13.597 --> 00:55:15.399]  Now I'm going to hand the baton to Owen Schroeder.
[00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:22.573]  And he's going to have Ezra Levant on from Canada with this Nazi at Parliament that's blown up in their face like nothing I've ever seen.
[00:55:22.573 --> 00:55:25.355]  Talk about getting the reality out there.
[00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:29.998]  And then of course we've got Edward Dowd with some very important information coming up in the third hour.
[00:55:29.998 --> 00:55:31.098]  Infowars.com.
[00:55:31.098 --> 00:55:32.339]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:55:32.339 --> 00:55:33.220]  Now take action.
[00:55:34.525 --> 00:55:35.525]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:58.675]  And the French Revolution, and j'accuse, j'accuse, and then they would just behead you in the street.
[00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:00.076]  And that's where the left is going.
[00:56:00.076 --> 00:56:02.518]  They just want to be able to accuse you and then behead you in the street.
[00:56:02.518 --> 00:56:07.582]  Now, they haven't gone to beheading us in the street yet, but they do the digital decapitation.
[00:56:07.582 --> 00:56:09.204]  They do the digital defamation.
[00:56:09.204 --> 00:56:11.586]  They do the digital assault.
[00:56:11.586 --> 00:56:17.211]  But so they've weaponized rape accusations that are illegitimate to hurt their political opposition, and so now who suffers?
[00:56:17.211 --> 00:56:18.192]  Real victims of rape.
[00:56:19.264 --> 00:56:26.112]  Because now, whether Russell Brand is guilty or not, or Tim Ballard is guilty or not, I don't believe them.
[00:56:26.112 --> 00:56:28.455]  And I never will.
[00:56:28.455 --> 00:56:33.201]  Because they're the Jesse Smollett's of political operations.
[00:56:33.201 --> 00:56:39.288]  And we got another example, and this one might be the most hurtful, because it's now the youth.
[00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:51.114]  It's now the Democrat youth that are looking at the Jussie Smolletts, and that are looking at the fake rape accusations to hurt their political opposition, and now they're faking things.
[00:56:51.114 --> 00:56:55.035]  Because they think, oh this is how you get ahead in politics, oh this is how you hurt the right wing in politics.
[00:56:55.035 --> 00:56:56.795]  But see, it's the boy that cried wolf.
[00:56:56.795 --> 00:56:57.616]  It's like they never...
[00:56:58.755 --> 00:57:00.477]  Heard the story about the boy that cried wolf.
[00:57:00.477 --> 00:57:01.799]  Well, that's now the left.
[00:57:01.799 --> 00:57:03.741]  So they weaponize rape accusations.
[00:57:03.741 --> 00:57:07.005]  They false flag events to try to hurt their political opposition.
[00:57:07.005 --> 00:57:08.406]  But it's all blowing up in their face.
[00:57:08.406 --> 00:57:09.768]  But it's the same thing with Nazis.
[00:57:09.768 --> 00:57:10.589]  Oh, you're a Nazi.
[00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:11.350]  Trump's a Nazi.
[00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.832]  Honk means hail Hitler and all this other crazy stuff.
[00:57:13.832 --> 00:57:18.017]  But then they have an actual literal Nazi out there and you say, hey, that's a Nazi.
[00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:19.319]  And it just it falls on deaf ears.
[00:57:21.459 --> 00:57:31.545]  But we're going to have another report from Alex Jones coming up with a Tucker Carlson video, and it's just very powerful, this message from Tucker.
[00:57:31.545 --> 00:57:35.848]  And that's it, folks.
[00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:46.334]  We have to tell the truth now, because the cost of telling the truth now is slim compared to what the cost of telling the truth will be down the road, if we don't tell it now.
[00:57:46.334 --> 00:57:48.736]  And it will be the French Revolution j'accuse phenomenon.
[00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:50.334]  Lie down and take it.

[00:58:58.267 --> 00:59:03.750]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:08.693]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:59:10.054 --> 00:59:14.898]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:55.904]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.904 --> 00:59:57.205]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:03.052 --> 01:00:19.656]  So after the FBI plot, the fake plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer was an entrapment, where all the defendants were acquitted by a jury, how does this play into the January 6th narrative, where now a Capitol Police chief is testifying.
[01:00:19.656 --> 01:00:23.296]  He's confused why the Democrats stood down security that day.
[01:00:23.296 --> 01:00:26.457]  Here is his testimony in front of Congress.
[01:00:27.572 --> 01:00:29.513]  A second set here.
[01:00:29.513 --> 01:00:35.994]  In a press conference on January 7th, Speaker Pelosi called for your resignation on national television.
[01:00:35.994 --> 01:00:40.516]  Speaker Pelosi also stated that she had not talked to you since the initial breach of the Capitol.
[01:00:40.516 --> 01:00:46.657]  But according to your transcribed interview, you were on the phone with Speaker Pelosi a few times.
[01:00:46.657 --> 01:00:48.398]  Can you explain that discrepancy?
[01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:50.338]  Yeah, that is correct.
[01:00:50.338 --> 01:00:53.099]  I spoke to Speaker Pelosi three times.
[01:00:53.759 --> 01:00:55.019]  Uh, that, that evening.
[01:00:55.019 --> 01:01:00.181]  And, uh, she went on national TV and said I'd never spoken to her, but I spoke to her three times.
[01:01:00.181 --> 01:01:08.343]  Um, the three, uh, three times were the first time when I went over to brief, uh, President, uh, Vice President Pence at the secure location.
[01:01:08.343 --> 01:01:14.065]  Um, I'd called, uh, um, House Sergeant Arms Irving, told him I was going over to brief the, uh, Vice President.
[01:01:14.065 --> 01:01:16.765]  I was also going over to do a personal assessment of the Capitol.
[01:01:16.765 --> 01:01:18.266]  At that point, things were getting under control.
[01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:25.549]  I went over there and briefed him on when we can get them back into chambers with Mr. Irving being fully aware.
[01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:27.450]  He said he wanted to get Speaker Pelosi on the phone.
[01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:34.333]  He made a phone call from his cell phone at approximately 534 where I first briefed Speaker Pelosi.
[01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:36.455]  The second call was when I left that location.
[01:01:36.455 --> 01:01:45.719]  As I was walking away, I met up with Mr. Stenger and we started walking over to the Senate to go brief the Senate when Jennifer Hemingway, I believe it was Jennifer Hemingway, handed me his cell phone
[01:01:46.514 --> 01:01:50.396]  And it was Emily Barrett's cell phone calling her, and it was Speaker Pelosi on the other line.
[01:01:50.396 --> 01:01:57.841]  This is my second call with Speaker Pelosi, questioning the information I'd given to Vice President Pence about when we can get back into chambers.
[01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:59.922]  I assured her that information was correct.
[01:01:59.922 --> 01:02:03.984]  I could get them back into chambers by 7 p.m., and the call ended.
[01:02:03.984 --> 01:02:05.285]  That was call number two.
[01:02:05.285 --> 01:02:07.126]  Call number three was 625 p.m.
[01:02:07.126 --> 01:02:11.569]  I was over at the Senate from the secure location, I mean from where the Senate had been sequestered.
[01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:22.473]  Uh, and on a, uh, cell phone, using Robert Karam's cell phone, they dialed leadership, who was over or off site at a secure location, and I briefed all of the leadership of the plans to get them back into chambers.
[01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.795]  That would have been call number three with Speaker Pelosi.
[01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:27.757]  So you didn't have one call, you didn't have two calls, you had three calls.
[01:02:27.757 --> 01:02:31.159]  So, Speaker Pelosi's comments that she didn't speak to you are inaccurate.
[01:02:31.159 --> 01:02:31.720]  That is correct, sir.
[01:02:32.242 --> 01:02:33.744]  This is on January the 3rd.
[01:02:33.744 --> 01:02:42.952]  I believe this was in your book that you met with both Stanger and Irvin and requested National Guard assistance to be ready on the 6th.
[01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:48.321]  Can you explain what happened in those two meetings with Irving and Stenger?
[01:02:48.321 --> 01:02:49.122]  Absolutely.
[01:02:49.122 --> 01:02:59.310]  So on the morning of the 3rd at 924 AM, I specifically went to see him because I know what a big deal it is to have National Guard come and assist us on the hill.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:08.357]  I went into his office again, 924 in the morning, went up and immediately went up and said, hey, I'd like to bring in the National Guard to support me on, to assist me on the perimeter.
[01:03:08.357 --> 01:03:11.760]  Because when we have a joint session of Congress, it takes a lot of our personnel inside, but
[01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:18.696]  Immediately, as soon as I asked him, his first response was, I don't know, I don't like the optics of that.
[01:03:18.696 --> 01:03:22.199]  And his second response was, besides the intelligence doesn't support it.
[01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:27.705]  He immediately, then we began talking, he said, have you reached out to Mike Stinger on this?
[01:03:27.705 --> 01:03:29.547]  I said, no, I have not talked to him about it yet.
[01:03:29.547 --> 01:03:32.550]  He said, why don't you talk to Stinger and see what he has to say?
[01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.932]  So then I left, went over to Mike Stinger's office at 9.35 in the morning.
[01:03:36.576 --> 01:03:38.097]  Walked into his office, he wasn't there.
[01:03:38.097 --> 01:03:47.561]  I came back, he showed up at 1113, I showed back up at 1153 and went in to immediately ask him, I'd like to request the National Guard.
[01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:50.483]  He said, you know, let's come up with another idea.
[01:03:50.483 --> 01:03:52.664]  Why don't you call, do you know somebody at the National Guard?
[01:03:52.664 --> 01:03:54.625]  I said, yes sir, I know General William Walker.
[01:03:54.625 --> 01:04:00.588]  He said, why don't you call Walker and see if we need them, how quickly could they get here and how many people could they send us?
[01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:03.910]  So I called William Walker 614 PM that night.
[01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:07.312]  He told me they have 125 people assisting with COVID response.
[01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:12.275]  He could reallocate those fairly quickly once he got Secretary of Defense approval and send them over.
[01:04:13.624 --> 01:04:19.786]  When you met with Stenger, had Irvin given him heads up that you were coming to ask for National Guard?
[01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:28.289]  Yeah, later on, after January 6th, specifically on April 8th, I went and had lunch with Mike Stenger.
[01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:32.371]  And I asked him, because it was kind of unusual, he came up with that idea so quickly when I went walking in.
[01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:38.253]  And I asked him, I said, Mr. Stenger, you came up with that response fairly quickly for me to call General Walker.
[01:04:38.897 --> 01:04:45.141]  And he told me Paul Irving had called him ahead of time and said, son came here looking for the National, asking for the National Guard.
[01:04:45.141 --> 01:04:47.042]  We got to come up with another plan.
[01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:49.043]  Pelosi will never go for it.
[01:04:49.043 --> 01:04:52.865]  So why did Nancy Pelosi lie about those communications?
[01:04:52.865 --> 01:05:00.249]  And why won't the mainstream media play that police officer's January 6th testimony?
[01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:06.273]  My fellow patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:07.494]  Many of these products have been sold out.

[01:06:01.984 --> 01:06:07.608]  In 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:06:07.608 --> 01:06:18.716]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[01:06:18.716 --> 01:06:25.301]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[01:06:31.513 --> 01:06:38.379]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're now into our number two Alex Jones here with a breaking news update.
[01:06:38.379 --> 01:06:46.787]  I first saw the report last night and before I even read the full details I knew what I was about to read because I've had similar things happen to me.
[01:06:46.787 --> 01:06:55.294]  I've had the feds try to set me up as a Russian agent I mean there's so much stuff that's not known to the public yet but basically they just list anybody
[01:06:56.161 --> 01:07:01.526]  That is anti-war, anti-open borders, or anti-Biden, or anti-globalist as a Russian agent.
[01:07:01.526 --> 01:07:03.408]  You already know that.
[01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:15.580]  The Steele dossier was fake, and Russiagate was fake, and both impeachments were fake, and so now they've got more fake indictments run by two former head UN war crimes prosecutors, Jack Smith and this other guy they just brought in last week.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.022]  This is global government taking over our bodies.
[01:07:18.703 --> 01:07:22.744]  This is global government taking over our sovereignty.
[01:07:22.744 --> 01:07:33.487]  The White House, quote, approved, they're now our doctor, the latest Pfizer-Moderna experimental shot that was tested on no humans, but only 10 mice.
[01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:35.448]  This is a total criminal takeover.
[01:07:35.448 --> 01:07:37.148]  They're just exercising their power.
[01:07:37.148 --> 01:07:39.249]  So I saw the headline, U.S.
[01:07:39.249 --> 01:07:44.410]  government threatened Tucker Carlson and told him not to go to Russia and not intervene.
[01:07:45.615 --> 01:07:49.923]  And he didn't give the details when he spoke to a European newspaper of why it happened.
[01:07:49.923 --> 01:07:54.371]  I'm going to give him a call later today and try to find out some more details later today.
[01:07:56.744 --> 01:08:08.532]  He said that they basically said, you're not a loyal American if you go there, and you better not go, which is a threat, a threat by the State Department, a threat by the CIA, because I know what groups threaten you.
[01:08:08.532 --> 01:08:19.901]  I got a Russian visa about four years ago, and I was going to go over there and basically cover what was going on during Russiagate because I knew it was so ridiculous, plus I'd never been to Russia.
[01:08:19.901 --> 01:08:24.124]  And I got some similar threats, and some people reached out to me, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:33.357]  And just from me getting that visa, as a journalist, as a media person, I mean, why is that not a big story?
[01:08:33.357 --> 01:08:48.104]  I had the Feds try to set me up as a Russian agent, and of course I blew their cover, went to the FBI, and reported the whole thing, and filed a report with them to another federal agency, you'll say, or another branch of the FBI.
[01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.565]  You would say, why would you do something like that?
[01:08:50.629 --> 01:08:58.753]  To get it on record, ladies and gentlemen, that I knew they'd done it, and I knew what their operation was, and I knew who was behind it, so that they were on record that I wasn't going to be set up by them.
[01:08:58.753 --> 01:09:03.055]  So that's how serious this situation is.
[01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:18.241]  That if you go back to the Gulf War, or Gulf War II, or any of these wars we've had, during the wars, 60 Minutes and other people go interview Saddam Hussein, or they interview the Iranian mullahs, or the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:24.412]  So since when are people not allowed to go interview people?
[01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:31.478]  Since when do they tell the number one talk show host in the English-speaking world, Tucker Carlson, you can't go?
[01:09:31.478 --> 01:09:33.859]  And by the way, Tucker's the most truthful person I've ever known.
[01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:35.661]  I've gotten to know him the last 12 years very well.
[01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:41.845]  Remember he came out a few years ago and said, the NSA is spying on me, a whistleblower told me, high level.
[01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:47.830]  Came out in Congress a month later that indeed they were spying on the emails and phone calls of Tucker Carlson.
[01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:51.793]  Well, what is the NSA doing spying on the American people?
[01:09:51.793 --> 01:09:55.817]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is outrageous.
[01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:59.701]  And NATO and the CIA and all of them are spying on the American people.
[01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:00.963]  They're censoring the American people.
[01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.006]  That came out in Senate hearings just a few weeks ago.
[01:10:04.006 --> 01:10:04.907]  We played clips of it.
[01:10:06.317 --> 01:10:07.157]  Last hour.
[01:10:07.157 --> 01:10:09.898]  If the Russians were trying to invade the U.S., I'd be angry at the Russians.
[01:10:09.898 --> 01:10:11.658]  If the Russians were spying on me, I'd be angry.
[01:10:11.658 --> 01:10:14.139]  If the Russians were trying to put me in jail, I'd be mad at them.
[01:10:14.139 --> 01:10:16.099]  They're not, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:16.099 --> 01:10:19.060]  It's the globalists that are running our country into the ground.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:28.682]  So now, in the year 2023, Tucker Carlson is being threatened not to go to Russia and not get his interview with Vladimir Putin.
[01:10:29.648 --> 01:10:31.930]  Obviously he's interviewed all these other world leaders.
[01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.631]  That's what you're supposed to do as a top news anchor.
[01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:41.256]  But because he's more of a populist, because he's anti-war, he's basically been given an offer he couldn't refuse.
[01:10:41.256 --> 01:10:43.057]  And Tucker's a tough guy.
[01:10:43.057 --> 01:10:47.820]  So I can imagine what they said or what they did.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.201]  Probably something along these lines.
[01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:53.684]  Well, you know, you need to be a loyal American and some really bad things can happen if you go talk to him.
[01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:54.845]  You need to think about your family.
[01:10:56.045 --> 01:10:57.907]  That's how these threats go.
[01:10:57.907 --> 01:11:01.932]  And he basically said they threatened him and said that he wouldn't be a loyal American.
[01:11:01.932 --> 01:11:03.574]  Loyal American?
[01:11:03.574 --> 01:11:14.846]  People running our country have dissolved our border, are massively human trafficking, have depleted the strategic oil reserve, have done all these other countless horrible things to us, and then they sit there while they're globalists.
[01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:23.096]  And wage war against America and our families with a Hollywood machine, and try to castrate our children with a whole transgender cult, and all the rest of the crimes.
[01:11:23.096 --> 01:11:33.548]  Defunding the police, putting in the Soros DAs, releasing violent offenders, putting political dissidents in jail, set to put our own reporter, Owen Schroyer, in federal prison.
[01:11:34.329 --> 01:11:35.669]  For his free speech.
[01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:41.031]  And then they point their finger at us and say we're traitors and we work for Russia.
[01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:41.911]  This is asinine.
[01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:46.232]  Hillary Clinton took millions of dollars from the Russians.
[01:11:46.232 --> 01:11:47.772]  Millions from the Communist Chinese.
[01:11:47.772 --> 01:11:50.753]  They're the people that have sold us out to foreign interest.
[01:11:50.753 --> 01:11:51.973]  They're the people that have done this.
[01:11:51.973 --> 01:11:55.654]  And everybody is waking up to this.
[01:11:55.654 --> 01:11:57.134]  So Tucker's tough.
[01:11:57.134 --> 01:11:59.555]  But I wonder who else they'll tell him he can't interview next.
[01:12:00.885 --> 01:12:05.266]  That's what the FBI did whenever they called Twitter and others and said, don't run the Hunter Biden story, it's fake.
[01:12:05.266 --> 01:12:06.446]  Well, they knew it was real.
[01:12:06.446 --> 01:12:08.427]  It's called election meddling.
[01:12:08.427 --> 01:12:19.670]  It's called legacy dinosaur media teamed up with the agencies, teamed up with the courts, teamed up with the system in lawfare to shut down loyal Americans that are fighting the new world order.
[01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.970]  We are the loyal Americans.
[01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:31.155]  The leftists in this country are useless, idiot, quizzling suckers that serve a multinational, black rock, corporate takeover of the planet and our own physical bodies.
[01:12:31.155 --> 01:12:33.436]  A literal depopulationist death cult.
[01:12:34.301 --> 01:12:36.122]  So I stand with Tucker Carlson.
[01:12:36.122 --> 01:12:38.003]  I stand with Russell Brand.
[01:12:38.003 --> 01:12:39.804]  I stand with everyone being persecuted by this deep state.
[01:12:39.804 --> 01:12:44.067]  And don't ever forget, InfoWars has been persecuted unlike any other organization.
[01:12:44.067 --> 01:12:46.528]  We're not backing down, but we are targets of this evil group.
[01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:49.370]  We're loyal Americans, and we need your financial support.
[01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.011]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[01:12:51.011 --> 01:12:52.592]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:12:55.774 --> 01:12:56.595]  Real Red Pill Plus.

[01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:17.939]  All the way we lose if you don't take action.
[01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:19.620]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:24.282]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:13:24.282 --> 01:13:25.683]  We're not the communist agents.
[01:13:25.683 --> 01:13:26.784]  We're not the Russian agents.
[01:13:26.784 --> 01:13:28.145]  We're not the Chinese agents.
[01:13:28.145 --> 01:13:29.606]  We're not the Nazi agents.
[01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:39.193]  The globalists are like Spectre from James Bond, a multinational corporate criminal syndicate that works with every evil group they can to consolidate power and control for themselves.
[01:13:39.193 --> 01:13:41.074]  Ian Fleming was number two in MI6 OSS.
[01:13:43.069 --> 01:13:49.433]  He wrote the James Bond books, and before he died, he said Spectre is basically a real organization.
[01:13:49.433 --> 01:13:51.074]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:13:51.074 --> 01:14:02.202]  That's why Klaus Schwab looks like Dr. Evil, or looks like Blofeld, because it's based on real characters like Klaus Schwab's father, who literally was the head of Spectre.
[01:14:02.202 --> 01:14:03.803]  You hear me?
[01:14:03.803 --> 01:14:04.903]  This is not fiction.
[01:14:04.903 --> 01:14:07.005]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:07.005 --> 01:14:08.366]  This is going down.
[01:14:08.366 --> 01:14:10.347]  MI6 is Spectre.
[01:14:10.347 --> 01:14:11.788]  The CIA is Spectre.
[01:14:13.012 --> 01:14:13.693]  You understand?
[01:14:13.693 --> 01:14:15.494]  Our government is run by Cobra.
[01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:16.315]  Call it Spectre.
[01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:17.416]  Call it Cobra.
[01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:18.317]  Call it Chaos.
[01:14:18.317 --> 01:14:19.338]  Call it Hydra.
[01:14:19.338 --> 01:14:20.098]  Call it whatever you want.
[01:14:20.098 --> 01:14:21.760]  Call it Red Skull.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.600]  It runs things.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.441]  It's in control.
[01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:24.442]  It wants to get in your body.
[01:14:24.442 --> 01:14:25.223]  It wants to hurt you.
[01:14:25.223 --> 01:14:26.244]  It wants to rob you.
[01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:27.284]  It wants to kill you.
[01:14:27.284 --> 01:14:28.446]  It wants to guinea pig you.
[01:14:28.446 --> 01:14:29.546]  It wants to silence you.
[01:14:29.546 --> 01:14:30.647]  It wants to censor you.
[01:14:30.647 --> 01:14:32.089]  It wants to destroy you.
[01:14:32.089 --> 01:14:33.750]  Wake up or be destroyed.
[01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.631]  Be loyal to humanity.
[01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:35.452]  Be loyal to America.
[01:14:35.452 --> 01:14:36.172]  Be loyal to your children.
[01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.393]  Be loyal to the truth.
[01:14:37.393 --> 01:14:38.094]  God bless you all.
[01:14:38.094 --> 01:14:38.715]  Back to Owen Schroeder.
[01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:50.303]  Coming up next, Segment O will interview Ezra Levant on the actual 98-year-old SS Nazi, part of the same battle group that actually carried out Holocaust operations in Ukraine.
[01:14:50.303 --> 01:14:52.825]  So this is critical historic information.
[01:14:52.825 --> 01:14:53.526]  Please stay with us.
[01:14:53.526 --> 01:14:55.327]  Ezra Levant was joining us from Canada.
[01:14:55.327 --> 01:14:56.208]  Let me just add something here.
[01:14:56.208 --> 01:15:00.992]  Some people are going to say, well, why did you back down when you got threatened by the Feds not to go to Russia as a journalist?
[01:15:00.992 --> 01:15:01.753]  Or why did Tucker do it?
[01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:05.977]  Because they turn loose the whole national security apparatus on you.
[01:15:05.977 --> 01:15:08.322]  If you haven't been in that position, you don't know what it's like.
[01:15:08.322 --> 01:15:09.985]  So I respect Tucker's decision.
[01:15:09.985 --> 01:15:11.067]  That was mine too, because...
[01:15:13.104 --> 01:15:15.086]  It was so weird to be accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:15:15.086 --> 01:15:15.886]  I knew it was a fraud.
[01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:25.794]  But then as they were arresting all these people and doing all this stuff, I realized they were going to come after me as well.
[01:15:25.794 --> 01:15:27.535]  And so why would I give them that?
[01:15:27.535 --> 01:15:30.617]  Even though it wasn't true, it'd be a tool they'd beat me over the head with.
[01:15:30.617 --> 01:15:35.441]  So that's why they called us all Russian agents, knowing that they can silence their political opposition.
[01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:36.542]  Now the public's seeing through it.
[01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:41.826]  I do intend, after this war is hopefully over, before we're all destroyed and killed, to go to Russia.
[01:15:42.782 --> 01:15:45.063]  And actually interview these people and talk to them.
[01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:46.684]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:15:46.684 --> 01:15:48.305]  Doesn't mean I'm a Russian agent.
[01:15:48.305 --> 01:15:49.045]  Never been to Israel.
[01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:49.745]  I want to go to Israel.
[01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.166]  Doesn't mean I'm an Israeli agent.
[01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:52.867]  I've never been to Egypt.
[01:15:52.867 --> 01:15:54.088]  I want to go to Egypt.
[01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:54.928]  I want to see the pyramids.
[01:15:54.928 --> 01:15:56.709]  Doesn't mean I'm an Egyptian agent.
[01:15:56.709 --> 01:16:02.892]  And the idea that Americans can't do this by the CIA run government is just preposterous.
[01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.433]  But Tucker's been honest about it.
[01:16:04.433 --> 01:16:05.973]  I've been honest about it.
[01:16:05.973 --> 01:16:07.294]  This is a big deal.
[01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:08.735]  Back to Owen Schroeder and the live broadcast.
[01:16:11.596 --> 01:16:16.900]  All right, so we are now back live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:32.632]  Once we're taking over, we are going to be joined by Ezra Levant out of Canada, responding to this Canadian Parliament phenomenon of celebrating an actual Nazi.
[01:16:32.632 --> 01:16:40.258]  Now, I do want to preface that with some of the other developing news.
[01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:59.888]  Dealing with Russia, dealing with the war in Ukraine, and now how there's news reports hitting the mainstream media that we've been reporting for months or years that yes, there are Americans fighting Russians in Ukraine, but there's a silver lining to that.
[01:16:59.888 --> 01:17:02.830]  And there's a danger to it as well.
[01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:08.935]  And I'll explain that, but also it comes out this weekend in a 60 Minutes report
[01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:31.265]  That we're not just funding Ukraine's war, we're not just sending them money for war, wherever the money goes, we don't know, there's no oversight, could go right into Zelensky's pockets, could go right into his family's pockets, his oligarch's pockets, that's what people think is really going on.
[01:17:31.265 --> 01:17:33.206]  Maybe it comes right back to the US.
[01:17:33.206 --> 01:17:36.188]  Maybe it goes right in congressmen and women's pockets.
[01:17:36.188 --> 01:17:38.369]  And maybe that's why they voted against the oversight.
[01:17:38.369 --> 01:17:38.909]  But we don't know.
[01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:41.421]  But no, it's not just that.
[01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:51.025]  We now find out that we are funding Ukrainian infrastructure and agriculture.
[01:17:51.025 --> 01:18:02.890]  So while the Biden administration targets our farmers, while the Biden administration targets our infrastructure and our agriculture, it's now building and funding Ukraine's.
[01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:07.292]  This is just beyond ludicrous stuff.
[01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:09.353]  And every American should be outraged
[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.251]  At this betrayal.
[01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.672]  But we'll get to that.
[01:18:15.672 --> 01:18:18.232]  And we'll build that up.
[01:18:18.232 --> 01:18:23.594]  Before we get to Ezra Levant, but.
[01:18:23.594 --> 01:18:26.635]  We had it on the Drudge Report top story.
[01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:32.437]  It was syndicated over all the mainstream news websites last night.
[01:18:32.437 --> 01:18:36.218]  Donald Trump beating Joe Biden by 10 points now.
[01:18:36.218 --> 01:18:38.619]  We have to remember political polls are propaganda.
[01:18:40.319 --> 01:18:44.840]  Political polls are propaganda.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.361]  Donald Trump has always been ahead of Joe Biden.
[01:18:49.361 --> 01:18:55.342]  They use political polls as deception and disinformation and propaganda.
[01:18:55.342 --> 01:19:01.204]  So considering that, why are they now telling you Trump is polling 10 points ahead of Biden?
[01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:02.984]  Well, because they're getting ready to remove Biden.
[01:19:03.902 --> 01:19:12.204]  But the Democrats don't want to do it themselves, so they're going to use the media, and they're going to use Kevin McCarthy, who I believe is now doing the bidding of the Democrats.
[01:19:12.204 --> 01:19:16.465]  And that's why he's now decided to roll out the impeachment inquiry.
[01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:23.306]  Because now the Democrats are ready to get Biden out of the way, and bring in Gavin Newsom, Michelle Obama, who knows.
[01:19:23.306 --> 01:19:30.828]  Won't be RFK Jr., the real candidate, the good candidate, who they should be getting behind, but because he's against the military-industrial complex,
[01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:43.178]  And because he's against the pharmaceutical industrial complex and because he's his own man, the Democrats aren't interested in him, so they're going to make sure that he gets stabbed in the back and cannot get the nomination.
[01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:46.839]  But if it were a legitimate party, it would be RFK Jr.
[01:19:46.839 --> 01:19:50.679]  If we still had a United States of America, it would be RFK Jr.
[01:19:50.679 --> 01:19:53.720]  versus Donald J. Trump.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.160]  But we don't.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.661]  We live in a corrupt country, and so they're trying to keep Trump and RFK Jr.
[01:19:57.661 --> 01:20:01.082]  off the ballot because that's what the people want, not the deep state.
[01:20:02.355 --> 01:20:05.479]  So Trump has always been ahead of Biden.
[01:20:05.479 --> 01:20:10.985]  And we can make all the jokes like, well, show me a Biden rally, show me a Biden hat.
[01:20:10.985 --> 01:20:13.467]  Of course, they don't exist.
[01:20:13.467 --> 01:20:14.909]  And they just want this.
[01:20:14.909 --> 01:20:20.195]  They don't even want the real world to reflect the political world.
[01:20:21.454 --> 01:20:22.715]  Even though that would be common sense.
[01:20:22.715 --> 01:20:25.335]  Yeah, hey, I don't know a single Biden supporter.
[01:20:25.335 --> 01:20:27.496]  Hey, I don't know a single Biden voter.
[01:20:27.496 --> 01:20:28.917]  He doesn't have any rallies.
[01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:30.737]  He doesn't have any merchandise.
[01:20:30.737 --> 01:20:32.698]  I know a lot of Trump voters and supporters.
[01:20:32.698 --> 01:20:36.019]  I see Trump hats and shirts and rallies all the time, but nothing for Biden.
[01:20:36.019 --> 01:20:38.080]  Oh, but he got 81 million votes.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.021]  He's the most popular president of all time.
[01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:44.623]  And then overnight, they just say, oh, Trump's leading Biden by 10 points.
[01:20:44.623 --> 01:20:45.963]  It's all political propaganda.
[01:20:45.963 --> 01:20:49.184]  But here's more proof.
[01:20:49.184 --> 01:20:50.465]  About half an hour ago,
[01:20:52.383 --> 01:21:01.010]  Donald Trump boarded Trump Force One en route to South Carolina.
[01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:07.675]  President Trump is going to be having a rally in Somerville, South Carolina.
[01:21:07.675 --> 01:21:11.098]  And of course, the ticket sold out in seconds.
[01:21:11.098 --> 01:21:17.903]  And before the sun even rose, people were lined up around the arena.
[01:21:20.879 --> 01:21:25.223]  Show me B-roll of clip one, please.
[01:21:25.223 --> 01:21:29.826]  Now, again, this isn't to say, well, let's put all of our eggs in this basket.
[01:21:29.826 --> 01:21:32.448]  This totally proves that Trump is more popular than Biden.
[01:21:32.448 --> 01:21:34.570]  But let's be just honest here.
[01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:38.013]  Biden couldn't do this if he paid people to show up.
[01:21:38.013 --> 01:21:39.454]  And they've tried that, by the way.
[01:21:39.454 --> 01:21:41.556]  And people still don't show up.
[01:21:41.556 --> 01:21:43.758]  They try to get concerts.
[01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:58.676]  They try to do some of the most popular bands, like Foo Fighters, or they get Taylor Swift to do Democrat rally concerts so that they can actually load an arena or a venue with people and then say, see, this is a Democrat rally.
[01:21:58.676 --> 01:22:03.778]  No, it's a Taylor Swift concert, it's a rock concert, it's not actually a political rally.
[01:22:03.778 --> 01:22:07.498]  If the musicians weren't there performing, nobody would show up.
[01:22:07.498 --> 01:22:09.259]  They do the same thing here in Texas.
[01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:12.500]  They get Willie Nelson to perform and then they say, look, it's a Beto rally.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.560]  No, it's a Willie Nelson show.
[01:22:18.115 --> 01:22:21.177]  And it appears now Trump has landed in South Carolina.
[01:22:21.177 --> 01:22:25.119]  But so you can see that video.
[01:22:25.119 --> 01:22:36.426]  You can see in that video that is basically, that is basically dawn this morning and there's already hundreds if not thousands of people lined up.
[01:22:36.426 --> 01:22:39.809]  And I am curious here guys, can we get audio of that?
[01:22:39.809 --> 01:22:42.730]  This is all new breaking news right now.
[01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:45.272]  Donald Trump getting off Trump Force One.
[01:22:45.272 --> 01:22:46.433]  Do we have that audio guys?
[01:22:47.444 --> 01:22:52.471]  Let me hear what Trump had to say as he got off of Trump Force One, headed to a rally in South Carolina.
[01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:56.917]  How you doing, Mr. President?
[01:22:56.917 --> 01:22:58.619]  Nice to see you.
[01:22:58.619 --> 01:23:01.183]  Well, we're glad you're here in South Carolina.
[01:23:01.183 --> 01:23:02.024]  I am indeed.
[01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:03.366]  We're leading by, I guess, 42 points.
[01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:03.826]  That's a lot.
[01:23:05.835 --> 01:23:16.742]  And we're leading by a lot, according to the Washington Post, ABC, against probably the worst president, definitely the worst president, I'd say, in the history of our country.
[01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.044]  He's destroying our country, so we have to change it.
[01:23:19.044 --> 01:23:19.524]  See you later.
[01:23:19.524 --> 01:23:19.804]  Thank you.
[01:23:19.804 --> 01:23:20.365]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:20.365 --> 01:23:26.949]  Okay, so again, you have the audience there already surrounding around the venue before the sun rises.
[01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:28.110]  But where's a Joe Biden rally?
[01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:29.011]  Where's a Joe Biden hat?
[01:23:29.011 --> 01:23:30.071]  Where's a Joe Biden T-shirt?
[01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:31.272]  Where's a Joe Biden support?
[01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:31.913]  A voter?
[01:23:31.913 --> 01:23:32.473]  Anywhere?
[01:23:32.473 --> 01:23:32.993]  Nowhere.
[01:23:32.993 --> 01:23:34.214]  Just the paid ones.
[01:23:34.214 --> 01:23:35.215]  Literally just the paid ones.
[01:23:35.735 --> 01:23:40.639]  And we got a story about one of his paid supporters, by the way, coming up later today.
[01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:44.002]  I've got a ton of news we're going to be covering on The War Room today.
[01:23:44.002 --> 01:23:45.823]  They're going full Jussie Smollett.
[01:23:45.823 --> 01:23:49.046]  It's really a disgusting, despicable thing.
[01:23:49.046 --> 01:23:49.846]  But so there you go.
[01:23:49.846 --> 01:24:00.835]  Now, let me circle back to the issue that we're going to be discussing with Ezra Levant coming up here in just about 10 minutes.
[01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:06.788]  And we're kind of juggling here and taking cues in live time.
[01:24:06.788 --> 01:24:07.929]  This is all a live broadcast.
[01:24:07.929 --> 01:24:09.670]  We don't have teleprompters, nothing scripted.
[01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:14.013]  So sometimes I just kind of got to do an air check with my crew here.
[01:24:14.013 --> 01:24:24.481]  Are we going straight through to this interview or is there a break before that?
[01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:30.305]  Okay, so I guess... Okay, so let me do this then.
[01:24:31.653 --> 01:24:35.754]  Before Ezra Levant joins us.
[01:24:35.754 --> 01:24:40.395]  Because you really have gone into full Twilight Zone.
[01:24:40.395 --> 01:24:43.616]  We've gone even beyond the Twilight Zone, if that's even possible.
[01:24:43.616 --> 01:24:51.158]  Where you have Canadian Parliament with Zelensky giving standing ovations to literal Nazis.
[01:24:51.158 --> 01:24:54.219]  And see, I don't even like... It's so strange because
[01:24:55.831 --> 01:24:56.912]  Oh, Trump's a Nazi!
[01:24:56.912 --> 01:24:58.254]  Trump supporters are Nazis!
[01:24:58.254 --> 01:25:00.956]  They do honk your horn, which means hail Hitler!
[01:25:00.956 --> 01:25:09.485]  I mean, these leftists have completely lost their mind, and what they do is they lie to hurt their political opposition.
[01:25:09.485 --> 01:25:11.387]  They lie and they do rape accusations.
[01:25:11.387 --> 01:25:13.489]  They lie and they do Nazi accusations.
[01:25:13.489 --> 01:25:18.835]  So it's like, I don't want to be a part of the boy that cried wolf phenomenon, even though it's the wolf!
[01:25:20.367 --> 01:25:22.188]  But okay, the left has been screaming, NAZI!
[01:25:22.188 --> 01:25:22.468]  NAZI!
[01:25:22.468 --> 01:25:23.268]  HE'S A NAZI!
[01:25:23.268 --> 01:25:24.449]  HALLELUJAH!
[01:25:24.449 --> 01:25:25.409]  HE'S A NAZI!
[01:25:25.409 --> 01:25:28.271]  HALLELUJAH!
[01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:32.593]  But, okay, that's not a real Nazi.
[01:25:32.593 --> 01:25:33.774]  Trump is not a Nazi.
[01:25:33.774 --> 01:25:35.354]  Trump supporters are not Nazi.
[01:25:35.354 --> 01:25:36.295]  Everybody knows that.
[01:25:36.295 --> 01:25:41.257]  But it's like, oh, okay, here's the actual Nazi!
[01:25:41.257 --> 01:25:43.498]  But it's like, okay, it's the boy that cried wolf.
[01:25:43.498 --> 01:25:45.519]  Oh, there's the actual wolf!
[01:25:45.519 --> 01:25:46.320]  But nobody believes me.
[01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:51.324]  So I don't want to be made a fool of up here screaming, wolf, wolf, wolf!
[01:25:51.324 --> 01:25:55.887]  And then everybody laughs at me and doesn't believe me because they've been lying about a wolf for this entire time.
[01:25:55.887 --> 01:25:58.969]  But it's like, no, that's the actual wolf!
[01:25:58.969 --> 01:26:00.770]  Yeah, the wolf is coming to eat your kids.
[01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:05.353]  The wolf is coming to eat your sheep.
[01:26:05.353 --> 01:26:07.415]  The wolf is coming to tear apart your livestock.
[01:26:07.415 --> 01:26:09.056]  I mean, it's just like, this is the wolf.
[01:26:09.056 --> 01:26:11.037]  This is the Nazi.
[01:26:11.037 --> 01:26:12.078]  You can't even make it up.
[01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:16.869]  But here's some of the preface.
[01:26:16.869 --> 01:26:19.110]  Russia issues new World War III alert.
[01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:22.691]  Reckless Western politicians have forgotten about self-preservation.
[01:26:22.691 --> 01:26:25.872]  See, I don't know if that's an accurate analysis, though.
[01:26:25.872 --> 01:26:28.332]  I think they're in a self-preservation mode.
[01:26:28.332 --> 01:26:36.695]  They're blackmailed, and they're already corrupted, and they think the only way to engage in self-preservation is to just blow the planet up.
[01:26:37.475 --> 01:26:53.218]  And they think the only way to engage in self-preservation from all the crimes and corruption that they've engaged in is to just blow the planet up and destroy the country so that there is no justice system and nobody can come after them for what they've done for crimes against humanity and war crimes.
[01:26:53.218 --> 01:26:55.019]  No, it's not about self-preservation.
[01:26:55.019 --> 01:27:00.980]  It's that they've gone psychotic mad in their corruption and they don't give a damn about the country.
[01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.665]  So, sure, blow it up in a war.
[01:27:04.665 --> 01:27:05.566]  Sure, start a war with Russia.
[01:27:05.566 --> 01:27:06.126]  They don't care.
[01:27:06.126 --> 01:27:07.507]  They hate the country.
[01:27:07.507 --> 01:27:12.191]  They take statues of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, and get rid of them.
[01:27:12.191 --> 01:27:16.754]  They wipe their ass with the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:27:16.754 --> 01:27:19.356]  Senator shocked by classified briefing on Ukraine.
[01:27:19.356 --> 01:27:21.458]  Warhawks want blank check with no victory in sight.
[01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:22.599]  There is no victory in sight.
[01:27:22.599 --> 01:27:25.401]  All there is is World War III nuclear holocaust.
[01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:26.122]  And they know that.
[01:27:26.122 --> 01:27:29.144]  That's been the case since day one.
[01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:30.365]  They're stealing the money.
[01:27:31.715 --> 01:27:35.158]  They're selling out the country.
[01:27:35.158 --> 01:27:35.438]  U.S.
[01:27:35.438 --> 01:27:38.540]  Army Hospital in Germany is treating Americans hurt fighting in Ukraine.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.963]  Now folks, let me tell you why this is dangerous.
[01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:46.887]  These are not official armed forces.
[01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:51.851]  They are not in uniform and so the Geneva Convention codes do not apply.
[01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:54.753]  These are contractors.
[01:27:54.753 --> 01:27:55.814]  And regardless,
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.824]  The world and Russians see this as a direct act of war.
[01:28:03.824 --> 01:28:06.245]  Even though they're not in uniform, they understand what's really going on.
[01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.987]  That's just an end around.
[01:28:07.987 --> 01:28:13.551]  But you do understand how dangerous that is to send contractors over there out of uniform to fight Russians?
[01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:18.182]  And then we get another slap in the face.
[01:28:18.182 --> 01:28:19.324]  60 Minutes report on U.S.
[01:28:19.324 --> 01:28:20.787]  funding of Ukraine, U.S.
[01:28:20.787 --> 01:28:29.561]  paying salaries of 57,000 first responders subsidizing small businesses in war-torn country, funding agriculture and infrastructure.
[01:28:31.127 --> 01:28:39.852]  Meanwhile, our infrastructure is falling apart, and the Democrats are attacking farmers, attacking agriculture, and attacking our energy grid.
[01:28:39.852 --> 01:28:52.859]  But see, they really think that they can just blow everything up, and then they're going to have BlackRock, and the Clinton Foundation, and Marina Abramovich go into Ukraine, and they'll rebuild that, and they'll take all the money from those deals.
[01:28:52.859 --> 01:28:57.121]  And I don't think the world is going to accept that, and I don't think Russia is going to take that either.
[01:28:58.817 --> 01:28:59.598]  Lie down and take it.
[01:28:59.598 --> 01:29:01.479]  Spread the word about this broadcast.

[01:32:00.656 --> 01:32:03.198]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:32:03.198 --> 01:32:05.459]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:32:05.459 --> 01:32:11.744]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:32:11.744 --> 01:32:14.806]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[01:32:15.126 --> 01:32:19.107]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:32:19.107 --> 01:32:23.068]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:32:23.068 --> 01:32:28.629]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:36.331]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:41.972]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:43.173]  Alright, we love you.
[01:32:43.173 --> 01:32:43.793]  We'll be right back.

[01:33:11.044 --> 01:33:18.574]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.574 --> 01:33:21.237]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:22.358 --> 01:33:24.879]  So, the situation in Ukraine has people fuming.
[01:33:24.879 --> 01:33:33.821]  The threat of World War III, nuclear holocaust, the theft of our money, the depletion of our weapons, and just the outright lies.
[01:33:33.821 --> 01:33:40.983]  And then adding to it, saluting Nazi soldiers, and then this report from 60 Minutes over the weekend.
[01:33:51.747 --> 01:33:55.651]  American taxpayers are financing more than just weapons.
[01:33:55.651 --> 01:34:02.176]  We discovered the US government's buying seeds and fertilizer for Ukrainian farmers.
[01:34:02.176 --> 01:34:06.200]  And covering the salaries of Ukraine's first responders.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.363]  All 57,000 of them.
[01:34:09.363 --> 01:34:17.570]  That includes the team that trains this rescue dog, named Joy, to comb through the wreckage of Russian strikes looking for survivors.
[01:34:20.273 --> 01:34:20.313]  So...
[01:34:47.276 --> 01:34:55.962]  You're paying Ukrainian law enforcement, firefighters, farmers, agriculture, infrastructure.
[01:34:55.962 --> 01:35:02.086]  Meanwhile, our police are getting defunded, our infrastructure is falling apart.
[01:35:05.287 --> 01:35:08.528]  In fact, they're shutting down, in many ways, our infrastructure.
[01:35:08.528 --> 01:35:12.008]  They're shutting down our agriculture in the name of climate change.
[01:35:12.008 --> 01:35:24.570]  And then Zelensky, who might be the focal point that kicks off World War III, is lecturing you about how you're not doing enough for climate change.
[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:27.171]  Can it get more offensive?
[01:35:27.171 --> 01:35:32.732]  Can it get more offensive as Bidenomics crushes your economy, but we send $200 billion to Ukraine?
[01:35:35.402 --> 01:35:35.702]  U.S.
[01:35:35.702 --> 01:35:41.106]  soldiers treated worse than garbage while White House keeps throwing money at Ukraine.
[01:35:41.106 --> 01:35:44.588]  Yeah, the only time that this current military leadership cares about a U.S.
[01:35:44.588 --> 01:36:02.699]  soldier is if he has a gay flag, if he wears a puppy sex kink leather daddy outfit, or if he's a hardcore leftist liberal, or if he's a trans woman that gets a job as the paid-for propagandist in Ukraine.
[01:36:02.699 --> 01:36:04.280]  Can it get any more offensive?
[01:36:07.006 --> 01:36:11.868]  I'm sad to say that it can.
[01:36:11.868 --> 01:36:17.511]  I'm sad to say that it can.
[01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:24.434]  Here's a video of not one standing ovation for a literal Nazi, but two!
[01:36:24.434 --> 01:36:26.956]  Two!
[01:36:26.956 --> 01:36:29.797]  And again, I have to report this news with, like,
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:42.667]  I don't even know how to explain it, because we're now part of the boy that cried wolf phenomenon, except we haven't been crying wolf, we're actually now seeing the wolf.
[01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:55.295]  But nobody, it's like you can't even believe it, because psychotic leftists and liberals have been calling everybody they don't like a Nazi for the last five, six, seven years.
[01:36:55.295 --> 01:36:59.298]  I mean, we're talking lowest IQ level of political discourse,
[01:37:00.777 --> 01:37:13.519]  Lowest IQ level of insults, and yet now here we are funding actual Nazis in Ukraine, the Azov Battalion.
[01:37:13.519 --> 01:37:21.761]  They run around waving Nazi flags, they tattoo swastikas on their arm.
[01:37:21.761 --> 01:37:26.541]  And now you have Canadian Parliament with Zelensky honoring an actual Ukraine.
[01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.802]  Not one standing ovation, but two.
[01:37:29.861 --> 01:37:32.383]  Here in clip number seven.
[01:37:32.383 --> 01:37:49.053]  We have here in the chamber today Ukrainian-Canadians, Ukrainian-Canadian world veteran from the Second World War who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians and continues to support the troops today even at his age of 98.
[01:37:49.053 --> 01:37:51.554]  See, see, pause it real quick.
[01:37:51.554 --> 01:37:55.217]  Pause it real quick.
[01:37:55.217 --> 01:37:55.377]  Look.
[01:37:56.993 --> 01:38:02.738]  The Speaker at Parliament there, I'm not going to pretend like I'm the expert and Ezra Levant is supposed to be joining us here.
[01:38:02.738 --> 01:38:03.618]  There's a delay.
[01:38:03.618 --> 01:38:05.720]  I think he's got something going on in an emergency.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.741]  I hope he can still join us.
[01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:16.868]  But, the Speaker of the Parliament there just, they don't really, they play it down the middle and they basically just read what's in front of them.
[01:38:16.868 --> 01:38:23.093]  So I don't know if the Speaker there has any clue about what he's doing or what he's reading or even history in general.
[01:38:23.093 --> 01:38:23.814]  But here's the problem.
[01:38:24.708 --> 01:38:27.469]  Most Americans don't even understand history.
[01:38:27.469 --> 01:38:29.109]  And there's multiple reasons for this.
[01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:32.850]  A, the education system is failing us.
[01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:35.731]  B, they just don't care about it.
[01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:40.952]  In fact, the education system might be misrepresenting even the history as well.
[01:38:40.952 --> 01:38:42.873]  But so, listen to what he says.
[01:38:42.873 --> 01:38:44.073]  Let me play this again because...
[01:38:45.174 --> 01:38:52.456]  It's incredible that he's so ignorant, and that the people are so ignorant that they don't even understand what he just said.
[01:38:52.456 --> 01:38:55.216]  Play this introduction again, and I want you to listen carefully.
[01:38:55.216 --> 01:38:59.257]  Again, if you know history, you know what he just said.
[01:38:59.257 --> 01:39:04.678]  If you're ignorant of history, it just flew right over your head, apparently, like it did he and the rest of this Canadian Parliament.
[01:39:04.678 --> 01:39:07.959]  Play this introduction again, and I want you to see if you catch on here.
[01:39:07.959 --> 01:39:08.679]  Go ahead and play it again.
[01:39:09.582 --> 01:39:22.487]  We have here in the chamber today Ukrainian Canadians, Ukrainian Canadian World Veteran, from the Second World War, who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians.
[01:39:22.487 --> 01:39:23.487]  Okay, pause it.
[01:39:23.487 --> 01:39:27.269]  So it actually, now that I'm watching it, it looks like he might have realized what he just said there.
[01:39:27.269 --> 01:39:30.070]  Because he kind of pauses and goes, whoa.
[01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.630]  Oops.
[01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.611]  What?
[01:39:33.611 --> 01:39:36.312]  Folks, that is the Azov Battalion.
[01:39:36.312 --> 01:39:37.893]  That was the Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:39:39.847 --> 01:39:44.352]  So it's almost like he just realized what he said reading that speech.
[01:39:44.352 --> 01:39:47.957]  It's almost like after he read it, he realized what he actually just said.
[01:39:47.957 --> 01:39:50.860]  He says that the Ukrainians fighting the Russians.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:54.725]  Folks, that was the Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:39:54.725 --> 01:39:59.791]  So, for those that don't understand history, let's even paint it with a broader brush.
[01:40:01.035 --> 01:40:03.217]  Guys, go ahead and look it up right now.
[01:40:03.217 --> 01:40:06.200]  How many Russians died in World War II?
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.762]  Let's just do this in real time.
[01:40:07.762 --> 01:40:09.043]  We'll just do a history lesson here.
[01:40:09.043 --> 01:40:13.187]  I'm not a history buff, but I mean, I passed history class.
[01:40:13.187 --> 01:40:20.815]  I guess I'm... I consider myself lucky and blessed enough that I actually had good history professors that actually knew history, and they didn't even go off the textbook.
[01:40:21.277 --> 01:40:26.621]  I mean, I had history professors in college, I remember they were like, yeah, the textbooks basically lie to you about history.
[01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:33.407]  And so, they would just teach history, they wouldn't even go into the textbook, because they were like, yeah, the textbook isn't even accurate.
[01:40:33.407 --> 01:40:43.895]  So, the Soviet Union, Russia, lost 27 million people during World War II, including 8.7 military and 19 million civilians.
[01:40:43.895 --> 01:40:48.759]  So, there were more Russians that died in World War II than any other country.
[01:40:50.789 --> 01:41:02.092]  And I believe, and guys look this one up too, I believe it was more than a million, not even two million, how many Russians died when they took Berlin?
[01:41:02.092 --> 01:41:04.533]  So let's go ahead and plug that one in now.
[01:41:04.533 --> 01:41:10.475]  Major pivot point, major victory point for World War II defeating the Nazis, it was the Russians.
[01:41:10.475 --> 01:41:18.057]  And I believe it was more than a million Russians died when basically they concluded the war in Berlin and put an end to the Nazis.
[01:41:18.057 --> 01:41:19.117]  That was the Russians.
[01:41:21.018 --> 01:41:26.402]  That was the Russians.
[01:41:26.402 --> 01:41:28.143]  So let's see there.
[01:41:28.143 --> 01:41:31.905]  But I believe it was over a million.
[01:41:31.905 --> 01:41:34.928]  And they took Berlin.
[01:41:34.928 --> 01:41:41.672]  And it was one of the final blows to Hitler's regime and the National Socialist Workers Party.
[01:41:41.672 --> 01:41:45.235]  Okay, so maybe I'm thinking of a different battle then.
[01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:48.036]  They're saying it was 80,000 here.
[01:41:48.036 --> 01:41:48.537]  The point is,
[01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:55.922]  Maybe it was Stalingrad, maybe it was some other German battle.
[01:41:55.922 --> 01:42:01.563]  The point is, millions of Russians died defeating the Nazis.
[01:42:01.563 --> 01:42:04.304]  And that was just on one day, 80,000 died.
[01:42:04.304 --> 01:42:05.324]  On May 2nd, 1945.
[01:42:05.324 --> 01:42:08.525]  One day, 80,000 Russians died.
[01:42:08.525 --> 01:42:14.267]  So I might be thinking about the largest number in Germany.
[01:42:14.267 --> 01:42:19.888]  The point is, more Russians died defeating the Nazis than any other country.
[01:42:21.539 --> 01:42:29.887]  And it was a group of Ukrainian Nazis that were still fighting the Russians, that there was still that blood between them and the Russians to this day.
[01:42:29.887 --> 01:42:32.770]  Yeah, Stalingrad, 750,000.
[01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:33.651]  So, but the point is clear.
[01:42:38.092 --> 01:42:41.915]  So he goes up there and he says, he helped fight the Russians.
[01:42:41.915 --> 01:42:44.676]  The Russians defeated the Nazis!
[01:42:44.676 --> 01:42:47.298]  Like, you are out there promoting Nazism!
[01:42:47.298 --> 01:42:51.781]  I think he, after he read it, you kind of tell, he was like, whoa, oops, what did I just read?
[01:42:51.781 --> 01:42:57.245]  And so now they're cheering literal Nazis, and I have to give this history lesson, I didn't even get to them standing ovation for this clown.

[01:47:34.608 --> 01:47:36.609]  So working on getting Ezra Levant.
[01:47:36.609 --> 01:47:37.990]  He's had an emergency come up.
[01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:41.913]  We're not sure if he'll be able to join us, but we will hopefully be hearing from him soon.
[01:47:41.913 --> 01:47:44.735]  We also have Edward Dowd coming up in the third hour.
[01:47:44.735 --> 01:47:47.977]  But, but again,
[01:47:50.942 --> 01:47:57.247]  It's just like you hear the Twilight Zone music in the background, or you hear the record skip, and you can see it.
[01:47:57.247 --> 01:48:01.350]  I think you can see it in the Parliament Speaker's face once he read that.
[01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:07.594]  He goes, and he helped fight the Russians, and he kind of paused and took back a little bit, like, wait, the Russians were our allies.
[01:48:07.594 --> 01:48:09.015]  The Russians defeated the Nazis.
[01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:10.296]  Wait, what?
[01:48:17.981 --> 01:48:22.785]  There are serious historical debates that go on.
[01:48:22.785 --> 01:48:25.147]  Who was more imperative in defeating the Nazis?
[01:48:25.147 --> 01:48:29.932]  Was it the USA or was it the Russians?
[01:48:29.932 --> 01:48:31.573]  And you could argue it was the Russians.
[01:48:31.573 --> 01:48:33.154]  And they suffered more loss of life.
[01:48:33.154 --> 01:48:34.616]  And it's really not even close.
[01:48:34.616 --> 01:48:41.041]  I mean, that's the look of a man who just realized he read a script supporting a Nazi.
[01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:43.483]  I mean, that's the look on his face right there.
[01:48:44.249 --> 01:48:48.510]  Now again, you have to understand, the way the Speaker in Parliament works is they're just basically like a robot.
[01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:50.391]  They just read it and call it right down the middle.
[01:48:50.391 --> 01:48:51.751]  They don't get political at all.
[01:48:51.751 --> 01:48:53.912]  They don't show any sides or any favoritism at all.
[01:48:53.912 --> 01:49:00.154]  They just go up there and read what they're supposed to read and try to maintain decorum.
[01:49:00.154 --> 01:49:07.897]  But, yeah, buddy, you just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:49:07.897 --> 01:49:11.238]  You just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:49:12.352 --> 01:49:20.739]  So let's play it one more time and then I'll shut up and you can listen to Canadian Parliament with Vladimir Zelensky giving two standing ovations to a literal Nazi.
[01:49:20.739 --> 01:49:21.540]  Not a leftist!
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:24.142]  I accuse everybody I disagree with of being a Nazi.
[01:49:24.142 --> 01:49:26.163]  Everybody wearing a red hat is a Nazi.
[01:49:26.163 --> 01:49:28.065]  Everybody that waves an American flag is a Nazi.
[01:49:28.065 --> 01:49:32.789]  Even though it was the Americans and our great-grandfathers that defeated the Nazis and many of them died and D-Day and everything.
[01:49:32.789 --> 01:49:33.629]  No, no, no, not like that!
[01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:35.011]  Like a literal Nazi!
[01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:36.512]  So here you go, let's play the whole thing.
[01:49:37.232 --> 01:49:44.536]  The Speaker of Parliament realizing that he just read a highlight reel of a Nazi, and then these people give him two standing ovations.
[01:49:44.536 --> 01:49:45.717]  Go ahead.
[01:49:45.717 --> 01:49:57.044]  We have here in the chamber today Ukrainian-Canadians, Ukrainian-Canadian World Veteran from the Second World War who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians.
[01:49:57.044 --> 01:49:58.004]  Nope.
[01:49:58.004 --> 01:49:58.124]  Nope.
[01:49:58.124 --> 01:49:59.765]  And continues to support the troops today.
[01:49:59.765 --> 01:50:01.346]  He just realized what he read.
[01:50:01.346 --> 01:50:02.207]  Even at his age of 98.
[01:50:03.627 --> 01:50:04.688]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:50:04.688 --> 01:50:05.269]  Pause it again.
[01:50:05.269 --> 01:50:06.410]  This is too rich.
[01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:08.071]  This is actually hilarious.
[01:50:08.071 --> 01:50:09.413]  He realizes what he read.
[01:50:09.413 --> 01:50:11.494]  Did you see the reaction there?
[01:50:11.494 --> 01:50:14.477]  He realizes what he just read.
[01:50:14.477 --> 01:50:16.439]  Uh, the Russians were our allies.
[01:50:16.439 --> 01:50:18.661]  The Russians defeated the Nazis.
[01:50:18.661 --> 01:50:21.264]  I just read a highlight reel supporting a Nazi.
[01:50:21.264 --> 01:50:22.425]  You watch his face.
[01:50:22.865 --> 01:50:34.113]  First he gets confused, and then he realizes he's like, he fought the Russians, and then his eyebrows perk up, and his head rears back, and he's like, holy smokes, I just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:50:34.113 --> 01:50:37.715]  Alright, I promise this isn't the last time I'm gonna play it, this is just too rich to me.
[01:50:37.715 --> 01:50:39.116]  This is just too rich to me.
[01:50:39.116 --> 01:50:41.698]  He realizes that he just read a script,
[01:50:42.418 --> 01:50:46.519]  Promoting and hyping up a literal Nazi!
[01:50:46.519 --> 01:50:49.179]  I mean, folks, we are just in complete clown world.
[01:50:49.179 --> 01:50:51.820]  Okay, I'm gonna shut my mic off.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.340]  Here you go.
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:53.340]  He promotes a Nazi.
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:56.121]  Canadian Parliament, two rounds of applause.
[01:50:56.121 --> 01:50:58.921]  We have here in the chamber today, Ukrainian- Just watch the face.
[01:50:58.921 --> 01:50:59.842]  Just please watch the face.
[01:50:59.842 --> 01:51:00.582]  It's priceless.
[01:51:00.582 --> 01:51:06.963]  World veteran from the Second World War who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians.
[01:51:08.993 --> 01:51:12.737]  And continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98.
[01:51:30.230 --> 01:51:39.318]  You know, this is what they do at, like, ball games, like a baseball game, a guy hits a third home run or has a big home run and they do a standing ovation and then he walks in the dugout and then they do another standing ovation!
[01:51:39.318 --> 01:51:41.240]  It's like, yeah, he's a hero!
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.281]  We want a curtain call!
[01:51:43.281 --> 01:51:44.883]  And now they do it for Nazis.
[01:51:44.883 --> 01:51:46.965]  Ezra Levant, I thank you for joining us.
[01:51:46.965 --> 01:51:48.646]  I know you've got some other stuff going on.
[01:51:48.646 --> 01:51:50.007]  I want to give you the floor here because...
[01:51:50.905 --> 01:51:52.566]  Here's some of the headlines in response.
[01:51:52.566 --> 01:51:56.907]  Apology demanded after MPs honor man who fought for Nazis.
[01:51:56.907 --> 01:52:01.689]  Who is Yaroslav Hunk, ex-Waffen SS member, gets applauded in Canadian Parliament.
[01:52:01.689 --> 01:52:05.951]  Trudeau and Zelensky honor 98-year-old veteran who fought alongside Nazis in SS Division.
[01:52:05.951 --> 01:52:08.371]  Alright, we're beyond the pale, total twilight zone.
[01:52:08.371 --> 01:52:09.592]  Ezra Levant, your response.
[01:52:11.258 --> 01:52:26.183]  You know, Trudeau calls everyone he doesn't like a Nazi, and yet he is the first Canadian Prime Minister in history, or first Democratic leader in the world that I know of, that literally invited a Nazi to attend Parliament, and he got a standing ovation.
[01:52:26.183 --> 01:52:34.246]  And I'm not talking about a conscripted guy, or an enlisted man, you know, low down in the pyramid of the Nazi Wehrmacht.
[01:52:34.246 --> 01:52:37.347]  I'm talking about someone who volunteered to be part of the SS.
[01:52:38.667 --> 01:52:43.368]  That's the nastiest, most brutal fighting force in the Nazi regime.
[01:52:43.368 --> 01:52:46.309]  Those are the folks who would hunt for Jews in the attics.
[01:52:46.309 --> 01:52:49.350]  Those are the folks who would shoot people and dump them in a mass grave.
[01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:51.510]  That's the Nazi Waffen-SS.
[01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:53.411]  They actually trained a Dachau.
[01:52:53.411 --> 01:52:56.592]  They took orders directly from Germany.
[01:52:56.592 --> 01:53:02.113]  And this guy sneaked into Canada about 70 years ago by lying about his past.
[01:53:02.633 --> 01:53:06.375]  He said he wasn't with the 14th Waffen-SS Battalion.
[01:53:06.375 --> 01:53:08.436]  He was with the 1st Ukrainian Battalion.
[01:53:08.436 --> 01:53:09.917]  He lied.
[01:53:09.917 --> 01:53:13.579]  He faked the name of his group so we could come to Canada.
[01:53:13.579 --> 01:53:18.601]  Now, Owen, he lived a quiet life for 70 years, keeping a low profile.
[01:53:18.601 --> 01:53:27.306]  Maybe he was worried that some Mossad Nazi hunters would find him, kidnap him, and bring him to Israel for a trial like they did for Adolf Eichmann.
[01:53:27.306 --> 01:53:29.267]  So he lives his whole life in Canada.
[01:53:29.267 --> 01:53:29.927]  He's 98.
[01:53:29.927 --> 01:53:31.288]  There aren't many of these guys left.
[01:53:32.222 --> 01:53:38.504]  And then suddenly he gets a phone call from Trudeau's office saying, come on down to Parliament, you're actually a hero.
[01:53:38.504 --> 01:53:42.285]  I mean, he's got to be thinking, Adolf Hitler would be so proud of me now.
[01:53:42.285 --> 01:53:49.148]  And not a single journalist and not a single politician, not a single person in the establishment said, what?
[01:53:49.148 --> 01:53:51.889]  If this guy was fighting against the Russians in 43, 44, 45, which side was he on?
[01:53:55.808 --> 01:54:00.750]  Because the only people fighting against the Soviet Union then were the Nazis.
[01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:06.832]  Imagine the word trickery necessary to get this guy in, and don't tell me that Trudeau didn't know.
[01:54:06.832 --> 01:54:11.054]  I heard your analogy with baseball, but this is more like a State of the Union address.
[01:54:11.054 --> 01:54:20.598]  When the president calls out this guy in the crowd, an army veteran calls out that guy in the crowd, you know, a small businessman, they know exactly who he was.
[01:54:20.598 --> 01:54:21.898]  He was vetted.
[01:54:21.898 --> 01:54:22.999]  He was their hero.
[01:54:23.619 --> 01:54:28.843]  And he thought, and they just thought they could get away with it, but independent journalists blew the whistle.
[01:54:28.843 --> 01:54:31.044]  Not the regime media, Owen.
[01:54:31.044 --> 01:54:31.945]  Independent journalists.
[01:54:31.945 --> 01:54:33.185]  You know why?
[01:54:33.185 --> 01:54:37.388]  Because the rest of the regime media is in on it.
[01:54:37.388 --> 01:54:42.892]  Yeah, the people that cry Nazi, Nazi, Nazi when someone disagrees with them are now celebrating a literal Nazi.
[01:54:42.892 --> 01:54:44.573]  I just, I can't even believe now.
[01:54:44.573 --> 01:54:47.295]  It's the total boy-that-cried-wolf phenomenon.
[01:54:47.295 --> 01:54:52.038]  But you know, if I'm a body language reader, there's two moments that have me extremely intrigued.
[01:54:52.478 --> 01:54:55.400]  First of all, you have the speaker there, who I think he kind of realizes it.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:58.943]  If you watch his face, his eyes perk up and his head goes back.
[01:54:58.943 --> 01:55:00.625]  He's like, wait, he fought the Russians?
[01:55:00.625 --> 01:55:02.046]  He's like, wait, he fought the Russians?
[01:55:02.046 --> 01:55:02.986]  Like, what am I?
[01:55:02.986 --> 01:55:04.888]  Wait, is this guy the Nazi?
[01:55:04.888 --> 01:55:08.391]  And then the video where he's like wiping his brow of the sweat.
[01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:16.317]  It's like all the stress that he's lived under being a Nazi for 70 years, it's like all the stress is now wiped away.
[01:55:16.317 --> 01:55:19.720]  He's like, oh, I've lived, I'm a Nazi all these years and now it's all relieved.
[01:55:21.403 --> 01:55:23.145]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:55:23.145 --> 01:55:29.591]  And you know, the fact that the Speaker of the House was reading and looked surprised to read goes to the fact that someone wrote that script for him.
[01:55:29.591 --> 01:55:36.779]  The reason I mention that is because this Speaker of the House put out a press release today and made a little statement saying, I'm the only one who knew about this.
[01:55:37.452 --> 01:55:38.893]  Don't ask any more questions.
[01:55:38.893 --> 01:55:40.934]  It definitely wasn't Justin Trudeau.
[01:55:40.934 --> 01:55:47.339]  It definitely wasn't Christia Freeland, our Deputy Prime Minister, whose own grandfather was a Ukrainian Nazi.
[01:55:47.339 --> 01:55:51.422]  I mean, there are some weird Nazi ties in Canada.
[01:55:51.422 --> 01:55:56.125]  Justin Trudeau went to Kiev about three months ago and he met with a Nazi
[01:55:57.055 --> 01:56:00.537]  Uh, apologist that Zelensky himself fired.
[01:56:00.537 --> 01:56:06.719]  There was this Ukrainian ambassador who denied the Holocaust, and it was so crazy that Zelensky himself fired this guy.
[01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:08.700]  His name is, uh, Andrei Melnik.
[01:56:09.258 --> 01:56:11.879]  Trudeau met with him after he was fired.
[01:56:11.879 --> 01:56:13.740]  What were you doing?
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:23.365]  And so there's this weird thing where Trudeau calls every conservative he hates a Nazi, but Trudeau can't get enough of these Nazis.
[01:56:23.365 --> 01:56:30.909]  And today when the Speaker of the House fell on his sword and said, hey everybody, I was the only one who knew, stop asking questions.
[01:56:30.909 --> 01:56:32.750]  I was the guy responsible for this.
[01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:34.251]  Don't pick on Trudeau.
[01:56:34.251 --> 01:56:34.951]  Really?
[01:56:34.951 --> 01:56:38.173]  It was obvious he was reading a speech written for him by someone else.
[01:56:38.713 --> 01:56:44.756]  This goes straight to Trudeau, and it's another humiliation for Canada at the hands of Trudeau.
[01:56:44.756 --> 01:56:48.679]  I think Canadians are starting to get a little bit tired of this guy.
[01:56:48.679 --> 01:56:51.420]  Well, and I kind of want to hone in on this as well.
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.763]  Ezra Levant with us from Rebel News, rebelnews.com, at Ezra Levant on Twitter.
[01:56:56.763 --> 01:57:06.028]  Do you think that Trudeau and his cabinet are just so ignorant that they didn't even realize what they were doing, and they thought this would just be like a good promotional stunt for the war in Ukraine?
[01:57:08.027 --> 01:57:08.627]  I do.
[01:57:08.627 --> 01:57:14.428]  Because remember, he's been going to Ukraine and meeting, for example, with this Andrei Melnik, and he's had no blowback.
[01:57:14.428 --> 01:57:17.129]  So I think he thought, this'll work.
[01:57:17.129 --> 01:57:18.969]  It's worked so far.
[01:57:18.969 --> 01:57:22.810]  I mentioned the Deputy Prime Minister, her name is Chrystia Freeland.
[01:57:22.810 --> 01:57:24.951]  Her grandfather was actually a Nazi.
[01:57:24.951 --> 01:57:30.332]  He expropriated a Jewish newspaper in Ukraine and turned it into a Nazi propaganda bag.
[01:57:30.332 --> 01:57:34.493]  Now, I'm not blaming a granddaughter for what her grandfather did.
[01:57:34.653 --> 01:57:35.794]  Folks, you can't make this up.
[01:57:35.794 --> 01:57:37.135]  I'm sorry, we're up against a short break.
[01:57:37.135 --> 01:57:37.956]  This is a short break.
[01:57:37.956 --> 01:57:39.818]  We got five minutes on the other side.
[01:57:39.818 --> 01:57:41.640]  Stick with me through this break.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.601]  Let's hone in on this.
[01:57:42.601 --> 01:57:44.262]  Folks, this is Twilight Zone level.
[01:57:44.262 --> 01:57:46.645]  I mean, I'm hearing the Twilight Zone music behind me now.
[01:57:48.732 --> 01:57:49.772]  Don't lie down and take it.
[01:57:49.772 --> 01:57:51.653]  Spread the word about this broadcast.

[01:59:23.292 --> 01:59:25.313]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[01:59:25.313 --> 01:59:28.555]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[01:59:28.555 --> 01:59:30.276]  95% curcuminoid.
[01:59:30.276 --> 01:59:31.636]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:59:32.837 --> 01:59:34.678]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[01:59:34.678 --> 01:59:37.600]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.381]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[01:59:40.301 --> 01:59:41.262]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:41.262 --> 01:59:44.203]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.062 --> 02:00:10.472]  Yeah, we should be playing this music when we play that clip from Canadian Parliament where they're celebrating a Nazi, a literal Nazi.
[02:00:10.472 --> 02:00:11.614]  It's the boy that cried wolf.
[02:00:11.614 --> 02:00:14.018]  I mean, it's all so strange.
[02:00:14.018 --> 02:00:15.620]  Ezra Levant with us here.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.842]  RebelNews.com
[02:00:18.536 --> 02:00:20.977]  But talk to me about the backlash here.
[02:00:20.977 --> 02:00:32.660]  Obviously the mainstream media that accuses everybody being a Nazi is not going to be covering this, but the backlash must have been real because the speaker had to issue a statement in a coverage of Justin Trudeau.
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:34.201]  Are they really this ignorant?
[02:00:34.201 --> 02:00:35.681]  Is it all a publicity stunt?
[02:00:35.681 --> 02:00:38.182]  I mean, what the hell goes on that leads to this moment?
[02:00:40.023 --> 02:00:47.308]  Well, I mentioned to you a few months ago, Justin Trudeau went to Ukraine and met with a Holocaust denier named Andrej Melnik.
[02:00:47.308 --> 02:00:50.270]  And it's not just my accusation that he's a Holocaust denier.
[02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:52.812]  He went on TV denying it.
[02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:55.393]  It was so awful, Zelensky had to fire him.
[02:00:55.393 --> 02:00:57.595]  So imagine meeting with that guy.
[02:00:57.595 --> 02:01:00.077]  So Trudeau's meeting with these Holocaust deniers.
[02:01:00.077 --> 02:01:01.838]  He's hanging out with these extremist people.
[02:01:02.618 --> 02:01:03.978]  And nothing happens.
[02:01:03.978 --> 02:01:06.419]  There's no reverberations back home in Canada.
[02:01:06.419 --> 02:01:09.000]  So he's thinking, oh, OK, so that's how it is now.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:09.960]  I can go further.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:10.900]  I can go further.
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:15.002]  And so on Friday, when Zelensky's in Ottawa, this is Trudeau's big moment.
[02:01:15.002 --> 02:01:17.682]  He says, I'm going to show what a guy I am.
[02:01:17.682 --> 02:01:24.564]  I'm going to find this one Ukrainian freedom fighter who's actually a Nazi.
[02:01:24.564 --> 02:01:28.125]  And I'm going to show what a... It was a show-off moment for Trudeau.
[02:01:28.125 --> 02:01:30.366]  And he almost got away with it, Owen, because
[02:01:31.576 --> 02:01:34.977]  At Friday, no one said anything.
[02:01:34.977 --> 02:01:36.798]  Saturday, no one said anything.
[02:01:36.798 --> 02:01:40.779]  And by no one, I mean there were 338 members of Parliament in the room.
[02:01:40.779 --> 02:01:41.920]  No one said anything.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.020]  There were a lot of other guests.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:49.923]  In fact, in the video clip, you can see right near this Nazi were Canadian military brass.
[02:01:49.923 --> 02:01:51.503]  They surely knew what was going on.
[02:01:51.503 --> 02:01:53.064]  They said nothing.
[02:01:53.064 --> 02:01:55.025]  Countless journalists were covering this.
[02:01:55.025 --> 02:01:56.305]  They said nothing.
[02:01:56.305 --> 02:01:58.966]  Trudeau almost got away with it.
[02:01:58.966 --> 02:02:00.767]  But then independent journalists, including myself,
[02:02:01.616 --> 02:02:03.097]  Started putting two and two together.
[02:02:03.097 --> 02:02:06.399]  I did a little bit of a tweet storm late Saturday night.
[02:02:06.399 --> 02:02:10.122]  I got three million impressions on my tweets.
[02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:25.511]  There was a professor who got millions and all these sort of independent people on Twitter and I started tagging the official anti-semitic fighters, the anti-anti-semitic fighters in Canada saying, where are you with this?
[02:02:25.511 --> 02:02:27.052]  How are you okay with this?
[02:02:27.052 --> 02:02:30.735]  And I guess so many people online started making this a thing.
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:45.089]  But the dam broke, and a Holocaust memorial group put out a statement, and then another did, and then it just finally the dam broke, but not because of any mainstream media journalists.
[02:02:45.089 --> 02:02:53.674]  And that goes to show you that whenever they condemn someone as bigoted or racist or Nazi, they don't actually mean it.
[02:02:53.674 --> 02:02:55.735]  Because they don't actually care.
[02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:59.558]  Because a real-life Nazi, whose hands are probably covered in blood,
[02:03:00.521 --> 02:03:06.483]  When he was there, they didn't say a word because they wanted to protect the precious Justin Trudeau.
[02:03:06.483 --> 02:03:10.244]  And it took grassroots independent Twitter journalists to make a difference.
[02:03:10.244 --> 02:03:20.106]  So Owen, never, never, never allow the establishment to get away with calling you names because odds are it's projection.
[02:03:20.106 --> 02:03:23.207]  They accuse you of what they are doing themselves.
[02:03:23.647 --> 02:03:29.451]  And thank God for Rebel News and Ezra Levant to be there to push this over the dam.
[02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:34.995]  And so, I mean, again, like, this is beyond the pale.
[02:03:34.995 --> 02:03:38.137]  What is the breaking point, though, for the Canadian people?
[02:03:38.137 --> 02:03:40.518]  I mean, Trudeau is not popular.
[02:03:40.518 --> 02:03:42.680]  He was nowhere near winning the popular vote.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.641]  But, I mean, what is the breaking point?
[02:03:44.641 --> 02:03:48.964]  The arresting of journalists, the arresting of pastors, the crushing of dissidents.
[02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:52.910]  Well, I think a couple things are turning.
[02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:54.731]  First of all, the economy.
[02:03:54.731 --> 02:03:56.752]  Inflation is out of control.
[02:03:56.752 --> 02:03:58.953]  Housing prices are skyrocketing.
[02:03:58.953 --> 02:04:03.215]  Housing prices are twice as expensive, proportionately, here as they are in America.
[02:04:03.215 --> 02:04:05.095]  Young people just can't buy homes.
[02:04:05.095 --> 02:04:08.437]  And Trudeau has doubled immigration in the last year.
[02:04:08.437 --> 02:04:11.498]  It's the equivalent of 10 million people a year in America.
[02:04:11.498 --> 02:04:12.679]  It's 1 million a year in Canada.
[02:04:12.679 --> 02:04:14.240]  We're one-tenth your size.
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.001]  So you've got out-of-control inflation, unaffordable homes,
[02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:21.462]  Doubling immigration, and then you've just got scandal after scandal.
[02:04:21.462 --> 02:04:23.763]  I think people are getting sick of Mr. Woke.
[02:04:23.763 --> 02:04:25.564]  He's like Gavin Newsom.
[02:04:25.564 --> 02:04:26.884]  He runs a failed state.
[02:04:26.884 --> 02:04:29.225]  Imagine if Gavin Newsom were your president.
[02:04:29.225 --> 02:04:30.566]  That's what Trudeau means.
[02:04:30.566 --> 02:04:33.307]  Well, we might not have to imagine.
[02:04:33.307 --> 02:04:36.208]  Ezra Levant, at Ezra Levant on Twitter, rebelnews.com.
[02:04:36.208 --> 02:04:38.148]  Folks, I'm really appreciative of him joining us.
[02:04:38.148 --> 02:04:39.009]  This is how it is in media.
[02:04:39.009 --> 02:04:42.630]  He's literally eating his lunch in the break, but he just had to come on with us.
[02:04:42.630 --> 02:04:42.890]  It's okay.
[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:44.852]  Okay, we respect that, Edra.
[02:04:44.852 --> 02:04:45.453]  We love you.
[02:04:45.453 --> 02:04:47.334]  Thank you for joining us on short notice.
[02:04:47.334 --> 02:04:49.336]  We're going to be right back with Edward Dowd.
[02:04:49.336 --> 02:04:52.239]  I mean, folks, we are just... Trump said it right.
[02:04:52.239 --> 02:04:54.161]  Everything woke turns to shit.
[02:04:54.161 --> 02:04:55.082]  That's all I can say.
[02:04:55.082 --> 02:04:59.106]  That's it.
[02:04:59.106 --> 02:05:05.132]  My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.
[02:05:05.132 --> 02:05:06.333]  Many of these products have been sold out
[02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:08.211]  We're good to go.
[02:05:24.961 --> 02:05:30.103]  All three of these products are back in stock right now for a limited time at 40% off.
[02:05:30.103 --> 02:05:36.785]  It would take me an hour to tell you about what's in DNA Force+, or Real Red Pill+, or Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:57.979]  It's the Trifecta Sale, 40% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com, and it keeps us on air.
[02:06:24.878 --> 02:06:29.562]  You know, I'm thinking about just letting this siren play for a minute here.
[02:06:29.562 --> 02:06:36.367]  Edward Dowd is about to join us because, you know, here's the thing, folks.
[02:06:36.367 --> 02:06:42.332]  Donald Trump gets 50,000 people at a rally, Joe Biden gets 50, somehow wins the election.
[02:06:42.332 --> 02:06:45.755]  I got speeches from Joe Biden, he can't even talk, okay?
[02:06:45.755 --> 02:06:47.777]  There's clips from Biden speaking yesterday.
[02:06:47.777 --> 02:06:50.078]  The guy can't even talk.
[02:06:50.078 --> 02:06:54.202]  If I put 10 scoops of mashed potatoes in my mouth, I'd sound like Joe Biden.
[02:06:55.546 --> 02:07:06.488]  I got, this is breaking news, in Oklahoma, somebody just smashed into an oil line, it's literally spewing and squirting and spouting oil, and it's just a lake of oil right now in Oklahoma.
[02:07:06.488 --> 02:07:10.029]  I mean, our infrastructure is falling apart, it's under attack.
[02:07:10.029 --> 02:07:11.789]  I've got Canadians saluting literal Nazis.
[02:07:11.789 --> 02:07:20.431]  Okay, well, now we're going to be joined by Edward Dowd, and let me just, let me just give a little preface here.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:31.647]  Embalmer reveals 50% of bodies containing white fibers, blood clots, since April-May 2021.
[02:07:31.647 --> 02:07:33.868]  Now, obviously, the timing here is clear.
[02:07:33.868 --> 02:07:36.751]  That's post-COVID vaccine.
[02:07:36.751 --> 02:07:37.852]  I mean, holy smokes!
[02:07:37.852 --> 02:07:47.559]  Now, Edward Dowd is an expert when it comes to analytics and data, and so all he's doing is studying the data.
[02:07:48.584 --> 02:07:56.912]  And he's here to reveal big news on what he's seeing as far as what can only be described as vaccine side effects.
[02:07:56.912 --> 02:08:05.819]  And so, Edward, you have obviously broken a lot of various news stories dealing with the data post-vaccine.
[02:08:05.819 --> 02:08:10.143]  You've got more troubling data you want to reveal now.
[02:08:10.143 --> 02:08:11.825]  Yeah, at this point,
[02:08:12.481 --> 02:08:14.461]  It's a joke, in my humble opinion.
[02:08:14.461 --> 02:08:16.462]  The regulatory authorities see what we see.
[02:08:16.462 --> 02:08:21.923]  There are signals everywhere, and yet they continue to march on as if nothing's going on.
[02:08:21.923 --> 02:08:24.083]  This is the biggest fraud I've ever seen in my life.
[02:08:24.083 --> 02:08:26.064]  Unfortunately, it's tragic.
[02:08:26.064 --> 02:08:28.344]  We just dropped a study last week.
[02:08:28.344 --> 02:08:33.665]  My partners, who are PhD physicists, and we have some data scientists working with us.
[02:08:33.665 --> 02:08:34.625]  Now our team has grown.
[02:08:34.625 --> 02:08:37.266]  We're still doing this work pro bono, but this is what we put out.
[02:08:38.212 --> 02:08:46.777]  From a UK study on cardiovascular events, deaths, excess cardiovascular deaths.
[02:08:46.777 --> 02:08:49.298]  So we did a statistical analysis.
[02:08:49.298 --> 02:08:54.221]  In 2020, there were 13% increase in cardiovascular deaths.
[02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:55.402]  Okay, fair enough.
[02:08:55.402 --> 02:08:56.803]  But then it shot up to 30 in 2021.
[02:08:56.803 --> 02:08:57.543]  It's 44% in 2022.
[02:08:57.543 --> 02:08:58.864]  We suspect it will be higher in 2023.
[02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:13.253]  When we looked at the trend, the long-term trend of this, we could see that it was well off-trend.
[02:09:13.253 --> 02:09:15.614]  Cardiovascular deaths are actually trending down in the UK.
[02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:16.454]  There's about 8 per 100,000.
[02:09:16.454 --> 02:09:19.495]  We're now back up to 11 in 2022, probably go higher in 2023.
[02:09:19.495 --> 02:09:21.175]  And statistically speaking, the standard deviation
[02:09:26.937 --> 02:09:32.260]  Uh, uh, that we see in 2022 is about 10, 10 and a half standard deviations above.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:38.422]  The historical trend line and, uh, what does that mean to your audience?
[02:09:38.422 --> 02:09:39.763]  Under deviations real quick.
[02:09:40.922 --> 02:09:42.604]  A lot of people don't understand what it means.
[02:09:42.604 --> 02:09:45.926]  In my world, a 3 standard deviation event is rare.
[02:09:45.926 --> 02:09:47.568]  It happens 0.3% of the time.
[02:09:47.568 --> 02:09:54.454]  A 3.8% standard deviation event is the same as you getting struck by lightning at least once in your lifetime.
[02:09:54.454 --> 02:09:56.315]  So it's rare, okay?
[02:09:56.315 --> 02:10:00.239]  So we have 10.5 standard deviation events of cardiovascular deaths.
[02:10:00.239 --> 02:10:01.600]  They seem to be accelerating.
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:05.804]  A lot of the data that I'm tracking seems to be accelerating.
[02:10:05.804 --> 02:10:10.928]  In June, disabilities in the U.S., as measured by the U.S.
[02:10:10.928 --> 02:10:14.071]  Bureau of Labor Statistics, shot up a million.
[02:10:14.071 --> 02:10:19.677]  So we've added about 4.2 million disabled Americans since the rollout of the vaccines.
[02:10:21.551 --> 02:10:25.413]  It was running around 29 to 30 million for the prior 5 years.
[02:10:25.413 --> 02:10:26.993]  More than half of those are employed.
[02:10:26.993 --> 02:10:34.776]  Our excess mortality seems to be focused in the young, especially those who are employed who are subjected to vaccines.
[02:10:34.776 --> 02:10:38.238]  So the evidence just keeps rolling out and it keeps getting worse and worse.
[02:10:38.558 --> 02:10:46.606]  Well, let me just dumb this down for the audience, because I like to make the sports analogy, because I think it applies in more ways than one, ironically.
[02:10:46.606 --> 02:10:52.411]  This is like, in Major League Baseball, guys, the best home run hitters were hitting 40 home runs a year.
[02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:56.055]  And then the best home run hitters, out of nowhere, were hitting 70 home runs a year.
[02:10:56.055 --> 02:10:58.317]  Okay, well that's a deviation, what did we find out?
[02:10:58.317 --> 02:11:00.098]  It was from an injection, steroids.
[02:11:00.098 --> 02:11:03.962]  So that's a mundane dumbing it down, but folks, that's what this is like.
[02:11:04.002 --> 02:11:05.563]  Because they're like, oh, we're hitting 40 home runs a year.
[02:11:05.563 --> 02:11:06.983]  Oh, now we're hitting 70 home runs a year.
[02:11:06.983 --> 02:11:08.004]  What's causing this?
[02:11:08.004 --> 02:11:09.104]  It was steroids.
[02:11:09.104 --> 02:11:16.488]  But this, what you're talking about, is death rates, myocarditis, cardiovascular issues, post-vaccine.
[02:11:16.488 --> 02:11:17.969]  Correct.
[02:11:17.969 --> 02:11:18.589]  And there's a signal.
[02:11:19.261 --> 02:11:29.389]  And, you know, we pay billions of dollars to these supposed watchdogs, the CDC, the FDA, the equivalents in the UK, Australia, Europe.
[02:11:29.389 --> 02:11:30.730]  Billions of dollars.
[02:11:30.730 --> 02:11:33.713]  And they have statisticians on staff.
[02:11:33.713 --> 02:11:42.900]  And we're seeing, you know, a bunch of guys downloading publicly available data or seeing ten and a half standard deviation events consistently across all sorts of different things.
[02:11:43.567 --> 02:11:52.015]  And yet there's no, there's nary a peep from anybody in these billion-dollar budget institutions.
[02:11:52.015 --> 02:11:54.697]  And the question we need to ask is why?
[02:11:54.697 --> 02:11:56.099]  They see the same data we see.
[02:11:56.099 --> 02:11:57.100]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:12:00.903]  Regulatory capture and the system's been corrupt for years.
[02:12:00.903 --> 02:12:05.267]  We just didn't know it because there was nothing to see in terms of the numbers.
[02:12:05.267 --> 02:12:08.050]  But this vaccination program was so widespread
[02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:15.042]  The death and destruction that's probably been going on with other pharmaceutical products is now there for everybody to see, and it's a disaster.
[02:12:16.823 --> 02:12:27.926]  Now as far as, let's say, healthcare providers and doctors are concerned, we have had some groups step forward, the frontline doctors, we've had some other groups, or individuals rather, step forward to call this out.
[02:12:27.926 --> 02:12:44.671]  Is there a panic amongst the medical establishment, amongst doctors, hospital boards, or are they going to be involved in trying to cover this up too because maybe fear of punishment, retribution, or just their involvement with getting these vaccines in people's arms?
[02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:48.175]  Well, there's a couple things going on.
[02:12:48.175 --> 02:12:49.538]  Word of mouth.
[02:12:49.538 --> 02:12:54.552]  So, some doctors are quietly whispering to some of their patients, don't take any more boosters.
[02:12:55.083 --> 02:12:57.344]  I'm hearing those types of stories.
[02:12:57.344 --> 02:13:02.006]  But people in positions of authority are going to keep their mouths shut as long as possible.
[02:13:02.006 --> 02:13:09.370]  And then if there is ever a eureka moment, they're going to pull a 180 and say they were deceived as well.
[02:13:09.370 --> 02:13:20.835]  But there was so much money involved in this COVID rollout, so many windfalls for so many individuals, especially hospitals that received COVID goodies from the government.
[02:13:20.835 --> 02:13:23.176]  They're being paid to keep their mouth shut at the moment.
[02:13:25.376 --> 02:13:29.958]  Now, this is a phenomenon that goes with a lot of different products.
[02:13:29.958 --> 02:13:37.262]  I mean, I think another issue we have, not to get off course, because I think it all ties in, we saw this push from doctors.
[02:13:37.262 --> 02:13:39.043]  We got to get all the kids on Ritalin.
[02:13:39.043 --> 02:13:41.284]  We got to get all the kids on ADHD medicine.
[02:13:41.284 --> 02:13:46.087]  Oh, we've got to get all these painkillers and all these other pharmaceutical products into people's cabinets as well.
[02:13:46.767 --> 02:13:57.231]  Talk about the phenomenon of, hey, they get the kickbacks from these pharmaceutical companies, so they have a incentive, they have a motive to prescribe ADHD medicines.
[02:13:57.231 --> 02:14:05.294]  They have a motive to describe these painkillers, which we know have caused tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of deaths in this country.
[02:14:05.294 --> 02:14:07.735]  Is that the phenomenon you're talking about with these vaccines?
[02:14:09.535 --> 02:14:21.002]  The vaccines, it's been documented that certain insurance companies that run hospitals and have doctors working for them, were incentivizing these doctors to push the COVID vaccine.
[02:14:21.002 --> 02:14:28.005]  And if there were accelerators on their bonuses, if they were able to get 95% of their practice the COVID-19 shot, they received $50 to $100 per
[02:14:32.808 --> 02:14:43.593]  Patient injected neck that could amount to you know 25 $50,000 bonus So there were definitely there definitely hidden monetary incentives throughout the whole health care system.
[02:14:43.593 --> 02:14:56.540]  They're starting to come to light You know one thing you need this started years ago with the the diagnostic Journals where they indicate sites, you know psychological disorders
[02:14:57.239 --> 02:15:00.784]  Prior to Prozac, it was X amount of inches thick.
[02:15:00.784 --> 02:15:06.391]  Since Prozac, they've discovered new disorders and what they create disorders to then medicate.
[02:15:06.391 --> 02:15:08.534]  So this has been going on forever.
[02:15:08.534 --> 02:15:11.979]  It's a, let's create a disorder, let's find a drug and let's sell it.
[02:15:13.976 --> 02:15:16.278]  Now, I guess you could say that same thing goes on with COVID.
[02:15:16.278 --> 02:15:19.440]  They inflate the numbers, and now they're trying to do that again, by the way.
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:21.321]  Oh, we gotta get tests in people's houses.
[02:15:21.321 --> 02:15:23.462]  Well, okay, why do they want tests in your house?
[02:15:23.462 --> 02:15:32.908]  So that you test positive, and then they get another positive case, and then they drive up the fear-mongering, they drive up the numbers, and then they drive up the vaccine sales, and then they drive up their profits.
[02:15:32.908 --> 02:15:37.471]  So, I mean, even COVID-19, in a way, is that same phenomenon.
[02:15:37.471 --> 02:15:41.134]  Hey, let's take the normal flu, or whatever it is, and let's call it COVID-19.
[02:15:43.395 --> 02:15:45.297]  There was definitely a rebranding.
[02:15:45.297 --> 02:15:48.700]  I view this as a rebranding of the flu.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:52.723]  There were 500,000 excess deaths in 2020, mostly old people.
[02:15:52.723 --> 02:16:00.649]  You could make the case that most of those 500,000 excess deaths were due to improper hospitalization protocols.
[02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:06.694]  Ventilation, which turned out to kill people, and remdesivir, which we know causes kidney and liver failure.
[02:16:07.214 --> 02:16:09.395]  So, a lot of these numbers were inflated.
[02:16:09.395 --> 02:16:29.506]  Let's also talk about the scandals that were swept under the rug, where Governor Cuomo and other governors sent COVID patients into nursing homes because, quote-unquote, the hospitals were overflowing, which we all know was a joke because they were doing TikTok videos dancing around in empty hospitals, you know, during COVID.
[02:16:29.506 --> 02:16:32.428]  This whole thing smelled of fraud from the get-go.
[02:16:40.735 --> 02:16:47.418]  Edward, I really appreciate you coming on today, and I'm tuned into you right now as I'm coming back to Austin, Texas.
[02:16:47.418 --> 02:16:53.440]  And I'm really blessed to have you here to talk about the incredible excess mortality and all the news that's coming out.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.062]  But the main reason I wanted to get you on was a breakdown you did a few days ago.
[02:16:57.062 --> 02:17:06.226]  We had an article on Infowars.com that I covered yesterday, where you concurred with myself and Tucker Carlson and others and said, the globalists have got to plan something big.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:10.182]  Something big to cover up all the COVID death.
[02:17:10.182 --> 02:17:11.283]  A new bigger crisis.
[02:17:11.283 --> 02:17:12.925]  A permanent emergency.
[02:17:12.925 --> 02:17:14.687]  And Jack Posobiec is saying the same thing.
[02:17:14.687 --> 02:17:16.148]  I'm saying the same thing.
[02:17:16.148 --> 02:17:17.689]  An expanded war with Russia.
[02:17:17.689 --> 02:17:19.511]  A cyber attack.
[02:17:19.511 --> 02:17:21.533]  The whole world's waking up like you said.
[02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:24.856]  And so they've got to cover up a big story with another story.
[02:17:24.856 --> 02:17:28.379]  And they say in the SPARS document and other documents that's exactly what they would do.
[02:17:28.379 --> 02:17:33.104]  They even forecasted a big awakening once they launched the sterilization depopulation plan.
[02:17:33.604 --> 02:17:34.545]  That's why I want to get you on.
[02:17:34.545 --> 02:17:36.787]  I know you have limited time.
[02:17:36.787 --> 02:17:37.808]  Can you please speak to that?
[02:17:37.808 --> 02:17:39.449]  Thank you.
[02:17:39.449 --> 02:17:40.190]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:43.953]  I was asked on a podcast with Dr. Naomi Wolf.
[02:17:43.953 --> 02:17:48.897]  We were talking about our new, my team's new cardiovascular data.
[02:17:48.897 --> 02:17:50.739]  She asked me, you know, what's going to happen politically?
[02:17:50.739 --> 02:17:54.082]  And, you know, for me, this is just a
[02:17:55.109 --> 02:17:56.849]  It's not a question in my head.
[02:17:56.849 --> 02:18:01.090]  Under normal times, we'd vote all these people out, but these aren't normal times.
[02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:22.294]  The crimes have been so horrendous, the cover-ups so ridiculous, and the deaths continue, and the gaslighting is so horrendous that once this comes to light, and it will, I mean, this is spreading word of mouth, there'll be an event horizon, I call it the vaccine event horizon, where somebody somewhere, some government, some media person, some media company breaks away and starts reporting on this,
[02:18:22.854 --> 02:18:25.275]  And there's a kind of an aha moment.
[02:18:25.275 --> 02:18:27.995]  These folks cannot relinquish power.
[02:18:27.995 --> 02:18:32.696]  Because if they do, they'll be put in jail or, you know, prosecuted.
[02:18:32.696 --> 02:18:35.377]  So they have to create a distraction.
[02:18:35.377 --> 02:18:40.978]  In my humble opinion, it's either going to be like you said, a war, escalated war with Ukraine.
[02:18:40.978 --> 02:18:42.819]  Don't forget about what's going on in Taiwan.
[02:18:42.819 --> 02:18:45.639]  China wants to do something.
[02:18:45.639 --> 02:18:49.520]  Cyber, cyber shutdown, financial crisis.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:52.041]  Even they even may even bring out the aliens.
[02:18:52.968 --> 02:19:01.174]  I'm looking for something so big that it's going to kind of change the world in that there's going to be a moment for humanity.
[02:19:01.174 --> 02:19:14.024]  Either people are going to buy this event and start another new round of fear or we're going to all call BS on it and their plans go awry and they're all brought to justice eventually.
[02:19:14.024 --> 02:19:14.965]  That's kind of my
[02:19:16.177 --> 02:19:19.019]  You know, 30,000 foot analytical picture of what's going on.
[02:19:19.019 --> 02:19:21.580]  But they cannot lose the elections in 2024.
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:22.420]  They cannot.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.101]  And they know that.
[02:19:24.101 --> 02:19:25.922]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:19:25.922 --> 02:19:33.105]  And I would say, you know, if you let's say you've been laundering money or cooking your books forever and an auditor is about to come in and catch you.
[02:19:33.105 --> 02:19:38.528]  Oh, well, now all of a sudden, look, a fire broke out and now all of our books burned up and now there's nothing for them to audit.
[02:19:38.528 --> 02:19:39.308]  And what do you know?
[02:19:39.308 --> 02:19:40.449]  How convenient.
[02:19:40.449 --> 02:19:44.451]  I mean, I feel like that's going to have to be their phenomenon here for the cover up.
[02:19:46.112 --> 02:19:53.798]  But I also agree, it's going to be something so big, it's going to be changing the entire path of humanity on this planet.
[02:19:53.798 --> 02:19:55.440]  But so, I mean, what?
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:56.220]  Aliens?
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:59.403]  Like, how do they basically burn the house down to cover up the money laundering?
[02:19:59.403 --> 02:20:04.087]  Or how do they burn the file cabinet so nobody can see their cooked books?
[02:20:04.087 --> 02:20:06.569]  Well, you know, let's use the words they've been using.
[02:20:06.569 --> 02:20:13.295]  George Soros and Klaus Schwab and others have been talking and floating the term poly-crisis.
[02:20:13.976 --> 02:20:15.637]  Poly meaning many.
[02:20:15.637 --> 02:20:17.779]  So I think they're going to flood the zone.
[02:20:17.779 --> 02:20:19.401]  I don't think it'll be any one thing.
[02:20:19.401 --> 02:20:23.164]  It'll be a bunch of things all at once to create maximum fear.
[02:20:23.797 --> 02:20:33.565]  And that's how they, you know, if they're able to do that, you know, we'll be back where we were in 2021 with people wanting to lock the unvaccinated in quarantine camps.
[02:20:33.565 --> 02:20:46.094]  So we have to spread the word that what's coming is probably not real or exaggerated or an event to distract us from the crimes that have already been committed.
[02:20:46.094 --> 02:20:50.778]  So I expect multiple events all at the same time flood the zone.
[02:20:52.791 --> 02:21:02.814]  My fear is, you know, I think we both would understand that we're probably dealing with complete psychotics at a leadership level, at many different leadership levels.
[02:21:02.814 --> 02:21:04.315]  I mean, these are complete psychotics.
[02:21:04.315 --> 02:21:12.078]  And so my fear is, and this is to not, believe me, this is to not promote going along with the fraud or the fake alien invasion or whatever they do.
[02:21:12.078 --> 02:21:13.858]  It's not promoting to go along with it.
[02:21:13.858 --> 02:21:14.519]  Definitely not.
[02:21:14.519 --> 02:21:15.159]  But I'm just saying
[02:21:16.099 --> 02:21:25.947]  My fear is that whatever next big fraud they try to run on us, if it does get rejected and completely rebuked by the people, that they just might hit the nuclear holocaust button.
[02:21:25.947 --> 02:21:30.571]  I mean, that's my big fear.
[02:21:30.571 --> 02:21:32.913]  That is a fear that is real.
[02:21:32.913 --> 02:21:37.737]  If you really want to drive fear into the hearts of the globe, start detonating nukes.
[02:21:38.973 --> 02:21:40.514]  And of course, blame the Russians.
[02:21:40.514 --> 02:21:42.254]  You know, oh, it's the Russians this.
[02:21:42.254 --> 02:21:43.355]  Or like you said, I mean, who knows?
[02:21:43.355 --> 02:21:46.416]  They're kind of building up this whole alien thing right now.
[02:21:46.416 --> 02:21:51.758]  And so maybe they say it's alien technology and they just reveal technology that we've never seen before.
[02:21:51.758 --> 02:21:55.939]  Space weapons, you know, hydrogen bombs, whatever.
[02:21:55.939 --> 02:21:57.680]  And so that's my big fear.
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:01.481]  But I'm not a hopeless person.
[02:22:01.481 --> 02:22:03.642]  I believe there's more good people than bad people.
[02:22:03.642 --> 02:22:05.983]  And I think that ultimately the truth is going to win out.
[02:22:07.532 --> 02:22:09.293]  Is there an escape route for us?
[02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:12.055]  I mean, is there enough good people in the medical industry?
[02:22:12.055 --> 02:22:18.558]  I mean, I don't know if there's any enough good people with the balls to do anything in our government, but I mean, let's just talk about the medical industry.
[02:22:18.558 --> 02:22:28.284]  I mean, could we get out ahead of this and actually say, well, wait a second, we need to be investigating the companies that promoted this vaccine that they knew was faulty and gonna have all these deaths.
[02:22:28.284 --> 02:22:32.426]  I mean, is there any way do you think we can curtail this?
[02:22:32.426 --> 02:22:33.007]  I think we are.
[02:22:33.846 --> 02:22:35.307]  We're curtailing it right now.
[02:22:35.307 --> 02:22:41.830]  I mean, the difference in those who are awake prior to 2020 and today is phenomenal.
[02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:47.053]  I mean, in my own friend group, I was called crazy, crazy conspiracy theorist.
[02:22:47.053 --> 02:22:48.834]  Now people seek my opinion.
[02:22:48.834 --> 02:22:50.215]  So word of mouth is spreading.
[02:22:51.111 --> 02:23:07.599]  Shows like yours, Tucker Carlson, Breaking Away from Fox, Joe Rogan, Russell Brand, any voice of reason, despite whatever people's past were, you're speaking truths now, and you're talking about things that are real, reality-based things.
[02:23:07.599 --> 02:23:11.121]  You know, you're in the fight, and the word of mouth is spreading.
[02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:12.542]  So I have a lot of hope.
[02:23:12.542 --> 02:23:13.002]  I'd say
[02:23:15.501 --> 02:23:19.404]  If 5-10% were awake prior to COVID, we're at 25%.
[02:23:19.404 --> 02:23:30.012]  Now, a lot of those 25% aren't brave, and they're not saying what they believe, but they'll be there when the SHIT hits the fan, hopefully, when things go south.
[02:23:30.012 --> 02:23:33.654]  Well, you know, you're kind of like Edward the Grey now.
[02:23:33.654 --> 02:23:35.116]  You've got the beard coming in.
[02:23:35.116 --> 02:23:39.919]  In past interviews, you had the clean face, so you're kind of like Edward the Grey.
[02:23:39.919 --> 02:23:40.820]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:23:42.176 --> 02:23:50.543]  Doing this research and having the realization and the reality sit in from what you've seen, how has that changed your worldview?
[02:23:50.543 --> 02:23:59.231]  How has that changed your spirituality and just how you operate day-to-day and the things you think about?
[02:23:59.231 --> 02:24:01.253]  Look, I was raised a Catholic.
[02:24:01.253 --> 02:24:03.875]  I believed in God, but I'll tell you now, my
[02:24:04.747 --> 02:24:08.170]  Tuning into the spiritual world is a lot greater than it was.
[02:24:08.170 --> 02:24:16.476]  The evil that's on display is something that really makes you think about what's, you know, what's my life?
[02:24:16.476 --> 02:24:17.497]  What's my purpose?
[02:24:17.497 --> 02:24:28.665]  My purpose now is to help as many people not take the vax, wake up as many people as to the evil nature of the system that's been in place for hundreds of years.
[02:24:28.665 --> 02:24:30.647]  And I have a bigger purpose now.
[02:24:30.647 --> 02:24:32.168]  And, you know, ironically,
[02:24:33.166 --> 02:24:44.512]  When I get into the data, I get depressed, but then I get hopeful, and I try to be very circumspect about this and understand that I can only do what I can do.
[02:24:44.512 --> 02:24:50.335]  The results are up to God, and so I don't get too hung up on accomplishments.
[02:24:50.335 --> 02:24:54.837]  I just do what I do and keep doing it, and hopefully I save a marginal life here and there.
[02:24:54.837 --> 02:24:56.898]  That kind of keeps me going.
[02:24:56.898 --> 02:24:59.439]  Yes, I did grow a beard recently.
[02:24:59.439 --> 02:25:02.721]  It's my first beard in my life, and I'm just kind of
[02:25:03.462 --> 02:25:07.792]  Experimenting with different things in my life, doing a lot of different things and trying to have joy.
[02:25:07.792 --> 02:25:12.563]  It's important to have joy in this crazy world of ours.
[02:25:13.474 --> 02:25:18.298]  The world's not going to end, it's just going to change dramatically and you still have to do joyful things.
[02:25:18.298 --> 02:25:23.882]  Date people if you're single, get married, have children.
[02:25:23.882 --> 02:25:34.890]  Life goes on and surround yourself with like-minded individuals who have integrity, who care about others, and your life will just open up.
[02:25:34.890 --> 02:25:37.973]  Before this journey began, I felt isolated and alone, but now
[02:25:38.753 --> 02:25:44.338]  That there was this definitive marker put in the sand with the vaccine.
[02:25:44.338 --> 02:25:50.504]  I've made tons and tons of friends and even some of those are vaccinated who are now regret their choice and now are in the fight.
[02:25:50.504 --> 02:26:01.173]  So humanity is waking up and it's kind of a wonderful thing and there's a different viewpoint on the world like material wealth is kind of, you know, it never brought me any joy.
[02:26:01.173 --> 02:26:04.817]  This is bringing me joy helping others and we get into service.
[02:26:05.698 --> 02:26:09.059]  That keeps you sane and brings real happiness.
[02:26:09.059 --> 02:26:14.341]  The nonsense of accumulating stuff doesn't bring you anything.
[02:26:14.341 --> 02:26:16.042]  I look at Alex, I look at you.
[02:26:16.042 --> 02:26:17.142]  You guys have been under attack.
[02:26:17.142 --> 02:26:20.923]  A lot of Alex's wealth has been destroyed, but he continues to fight.
[02:26:20.923 --> 02:26:23.184]  And I think he's happier now than he was when he had stuff.
[02:26:24.795 --> 02:26:29.558]  See folks, only the observations and the questions that you can get right here at InfoWars.
[02:26:29.558 --> 02:26:31.379]  This is why we've got to keep the show on the air.
[02:26:31.379 --> 02:26:39.383]  Now, I want to get serious again for a second because the embalmer talking about how everybody's coming in with these fiber clots.
[02:26:39.383 --> 02:26:41.704]  It's not blood clots, it's a fiber clot.
[02:26:41.704 --> 02:26:46.947]  We've also heard, you know, morticians and other reports, doctors and everything else.
[02:26:48.408 --> 02:26:50.589]  This is an undeniable phenomenon.
[02:26:50.589 --> 02:26:55.490]  It's something that didn't even exist, that now exists.
[02:26:55.490 --> 02:27:11.015]  Do you think that the mainstream media will be able to keep this thing under wraps, obviously paid for by big pharmaceutical companies, or do you think the alternative media can maybe have their big breaking moment now, where we overwhelm the mainstream, pushing the vaccines, and people see through it?
[02:27:11.015 --> 02:27:14.576]  Well, the mainstream media is dead, in my humble opinion.
[02:27:14.576 --> 02:27:16.057]  Independent alternative media
[02:27:17.145 --> 02:27:20.409]  It is here to stay and the numbers suggest you guys are killing it.
[02:27:20.409 --> 02:27:29.923]  The only reason you're not making the revenue streams that media is is because the corporations that are still in the matrix are supporting this nonsense.
[02:27:31.684 --> 02:27:42.012]  Eventually, I think there's going to come a day where a corporation is going to run as far away from COVID and the establishment as possible, as quickly as possible, because the revenues will come under assault.
[02:27:42.012 --> 02:27:45.295]  More and more of these boycotts are occurring.
[02:27:45.295 --> 02:27:47.377]  Go woke, go broke is a real thing now.
[02:27:47.377 --> 02:27:48.918]  Budweiser has been devastated.
[02:27:48.918 --> 02:27:51.700]  Disney's stock is in the tank.
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:54.603]  So at the end of the day, I think we've won
[02:27:55.503 --> 02:28:04.308]  And the, you know, the revenues that we don't get and you don't get are coming our way eventually, because we have integrity and we tell the truth.
[02:28:04.308 --> 02:28:05.668]  So I think we've won.
[02:28:05.668 --> 02:28:14.212]  It's just the problem is we're about to see a horrendous holly crisis and a flood the zone that's going to create chaos for years to come.
[02:28:14.212 --> 02:28:17.374]  But on the other side of that, I do truly believe there's a renaissance.
[02:28:18.593 --> 02:28:33.421]  I have to agree with everything Edward Dowd just said, and so folks, this is why we're bringing this information, so that you can prepare yourself and get yourself and just be ready for this and not panic and not have the worst happen to yourself and your family.
[02:28:33.421 --> 02:28:36.423]  Edward Dowd, our guest, at DowdEdward on Twitter.
[02:28:36.863 --> 02:28:39.704]  My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.
[02:28:39.704 --> 02:28:41.645]  Many of these products have been sold out.
[02:29:06.138 --> 02:29:06.458]  I'm good.

[02:30:18.307 --> 02:30:19.488]  It's about to sell out.

[02:31:20.537 --> 02:31:22.538]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[02:31:22.538 --> 02:31:25.981]  God gave it to us, and it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[02:31:25.981 --> 02:31:29.443]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[02:31:29.443 --> 02:31:31.785]  Most brands are 5% curcumidin.
[02:31:31.785 --> 02:31:34.066]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[02:31:34.066 --> 02:31:36.908]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[02:31:36.908 --> 02:31:39.029]  95% curcuminoid.
[02:31:39.029 --> 02:31:40.390]  I am so glad this is back.
[02:31:41.571 --> 02:31:43.433]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[02:31:43.433 --> 02:31:46.357]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[02:31:46.357 --> 02:31:48.139]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:31:48.139 --> 02:31:48.920]  Back in stock, 25% off.
[02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:49.661]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:32:06.124 --> 02:32:08.587]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:32:08.587 --> 02:32:09.408]  Hey, what's better?
[02:32:09.408 --> 02:32:10.269]  Knockout?
[02:32:10.269 --> 02:32:11.610]  What's better?
[02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:12.351]  Down-and-out?
[02:32:12.351 --> 02:32:12.871]  What's better?
[02:32:12.871 --> 02:32:15.134]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:32:15.134 --> 02:32:20.079]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:24.725]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:32:24.725 --> 02:32:26.066]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:32:26.066 --> 02:32:27.368]  They're all very diverse.
[02:32:27.368 --> 02:32:37.559]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[02:32:59.289 --> 02:33:05.192]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.616 --> 02:33:16.497]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:33:16.497 --> 02:33:20.620]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this extremely vital Monday transmission.
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:27.165]  You just heard Owen Schroyer interview top analyst and a man that's been very accurate, Edward Dowd.
[02:33:27.165 --> 02:33:30.647]  He concurs with Jack Posubik, myself, Tucker Carlson, and many other analysts.
[02:33:30.647 --> 02:33:33.529]  The globalists have rolled out their poison shots.
[02:33:33.529 --> 02:33:35.831]  They released their new chimeric virus.
[02:33:35.831 --> 02:33:36.912]  The whole world's waking up.
[02:33:36.912 --> 02:33:38.132]  The numbers show that.
[02:33:38.132 --> 02:33:39.013]  The deaths are mounting.
[02:33:39.013 --> 02:33:40.074]  The sterilization's mounting.
[02:33:40.074 --> 02:33:41.095]  The stillbirths are exploding.
[02:33:42.572 --> 02:33:43.632]  They have failed.
[02:33:43.632 --> 02:33:44.973]  Bill Gates admits they've failed.
[02:33:44.973 --> 02:33:46.193]  They admit it's backfired.
[02:33:46.193 --> 02:33:48.113]  The Clinton Foundation admits it's backfired.
[02:33:48.113 --> 02:33:49.394]  The WEF admits it's backfired.
[02:33:49.394 --> 02:33:51.074]  They all admit it, blip on their face.
[02:33:51.074 --> 02:33:52.655]  So what are they going to do?
[02:33:52.655 --> 02:33:54.515]  War in China, Taiwan.
[02:33:54.515 --> 02:33:56.395]  Expanded war in Ukraine.
[02:33:56.395 --> 02:33:57.516]  Cyber attacks.
[02:33:57.516 --> 02:33:58.116]  Power outages.
[02:33:58.116 --> 02:33:59.896]  They're pre-programming it all.
[02:33:59.896 --> 02:34:00.577]  Weather weapons.
[02:34:00.577 --> 02:34:01.477]  Fake alien invasion.
[02:34:02.637 --> 02:34:08.582]  But just like we got ahead of their new rollout for new COVID restrictions and it blew up in their face, we can get ahead of this now.
[02:34:08.582 --> 02:34:12.245]  That's why when we archive this live show today at band.video.
[02:34:13.323 --> 02:34:15.725]  Everybody needs to get this Edward Dowd interview.
[02:34:15.725 --> 02:34:17.646]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[02:34:17.646 --> 02:34:19.748]  These globalists are crazy.
[02:34:19.748 --> 02:34:20.989]  They love throwing it in our face.
[02:34:20.989 --> 02:34:29.915]  That's why they brought a real Nazi that actually helped run mass exterminations to be saluted at the Canadian Parliament with Zelensky and Trudeau.
[02:34:29.915 --> 02:34:31.376]  They're rubbing it in our faces.
[02:34:31.376 --> 02:34:34.859]  I agree with Ezra Levent last hour, who's an expert on this from Canada.
[02:34:34.859 --> 02:34:36.540]  This is part of a larger plan.
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:37.661]  They've got to gaslight us.
[02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:38.682]  They've got to overwhelm us.
[02:34:38.682 --> 02:34:40.083]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:34:40.083 --> 02:34:41.324]  Cut your son's penis off.
[02:34:41.884 --> 02:34:44.866]  All of this is just to make things so weird, we just give up.
[02:34:44.866 --> 02:34:46.367]  But we're not giving up.
[02:34:46.367 --> 02:34:47.187]  We're waking up.
[02:34:47.187 --> 02:34:48.128]  We're taking action.
[02:34:48.128 --> 02:34:48.828]  We're speaking out.
[02:34:48.828 --> 02:34:51.690]  But now we're at the most critical moment.
[02:34:51.690 --> 02:34:53.591]  They are planning something huge.
[02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:55.533]  They are planning something big.
[02:34:55.533 --> 02:34:58.535]  They've pre-programmed what those cards are they're going to play.
[02:34:58.535 --> 02:35:00.055]  We don't know exactly what.
[02:35:00.055 --> 02:35:03.057]  Massive false flag race attacks, mass shootings.
[02:35:03.057 --> 02:35:03.538]  It's all
[02:35:04.278 --> 02:35:05.999]  Join to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:05.999 --> 02:35:07.679]  They've planned to roll it out.
[02:35:07.679 --> 02:35:11.040]  But if we get ahead of it and expose them enough, they may back down.
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:14.921]  But so far, they keep doubling down, but at least we're not flat-footed taking it.
[02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:16.982]  We're standing up and resisting it.
[02:35:16.982 --> 02:35:24.925]  And so I appreciate you all, old, young, male, female, black, Hispanic, white, Asian, it doesn't matter, Christian, Muslim, we are all under attack.
[02:35:26.005 --> 02:35:27.306]  All right, spread those links.
[02:35:27.306 --> 02:35:29.428]  We're back here in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:35:53.428 --> 02:35:55.730]  And it has been a wild day here.
[02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:56.211]  You know what?
[02:35:56.211 --> 02:36:00.995]  Let me just, we've got some breaking Trump news.
[02:36:00.995 --> 02:36:05.520]  He's set to be speaking sometime this afternoon.
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:10.544]  And, but, but let's go to Biden.
[02:36:10.544 --> 02:36:18.272]  Now, if I wanted to sound like Joe Biden, I'd have to stuff 10 scoops of mashed potatoes in my mouth.
[02:36:19.862 --> 02:36:25.467]  And maybe a couple fingerling potatoes as well.
[02:36:25.467 --> 02:36:28.510]  Because this guy is just pathetic.
[02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:35.676]  So here's the latest Mush Mouth Joe moment from yesterday in clip number four.
[02:36:35.676 --> 02:36:42.823]  Two of the great artists of our time representing the groundbreaking legacy of hip-hop in America, LLJ Cool J.
[02:36:45.959 --> 02:36:51.262]  By the way, that boy's got, that man's got biceps bigger than my thighs.
[02:36:51.262 --> 02:36:57.605]  I think he's... And MC Light, both of you, thank you.
[02:36:57.605 --> 02:37:04.368]  Because they both have the light off on the mic, you know you're all here to listen to the new edition.
[02:37:04.368 --> 02:37:10.331]  Mike Bivens, 40 years producing music that lifts our souls.
[02:37:10.331 --> 02:37:11.272]  LLJ Cool J.
[02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:14.760]  That boy.
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.881]  Still, you know, that's what he calls black people.
[02:37:16.881 --> 02:37:18.061]  He calls black people boy.
[02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:21.862]  Because, you know, he's one of them.
[02:37:21.862 --> 02:37:24.522]  It's just, this guy is an international embarrassment.
[02:37:24.522 --> 02:37:25.982]  But how embarrassing is it?
[02:37:25.982 --> 02:37:32.043]  And all the yuppies in the crowd, they laugh because this guy can't even talk.
[02:37:32.043 --> 02:37:32.984]  And that's funny.
[02:37:32.984 --> 02:37:34.624]  And then here he is lying again.
[02:37:34.624 --> 02:37:36.984]  It's just unreal.
[02:37:36.984 --> 02:37:38.365]  He's told this lie 20, 30, 40, 50 times.
[02:37:38.365 --> 02:37:39.165]  I've lost count.
[02:37:42.927 --> 02:37:47.028]  But he's so confused.
[02:37:47.028 --> 02:37:48.389]  He was so confused in the speech.
[02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:50.310]  First of all, he's speaking to the Black Caucus.
[02:37:50.310 --> 02:37:53.211]  He called them the Hispanic Caucus, so he got that wrong.
[02:37:53.211 --> 02:37:56.512]  He can't even pronounce LL Cool J. He can't even read a teleprompter.
[02:37:56.512 --> 02:37:58.512]  He's mush-mouthing the whole way through.
[02:37:58.512 --> 02:37:59.433]  And then he just lies.
[02:37:59.433 --> 02:38:01.694]  And he talks about how he was part of the Civil Rights Movement.
[02:38:01.694 --> 02:38:03.874]  Again, just an outright lie.
[02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:05.155]  Actually, he might be telling the truth.
[02:38:05.155 --> 02:38:06.455]  He was part of the Civil Rights Movement.
[02:38:06.455 --> 02:38:08.016]  He was on the KKK side.
[02:38:08.016 --> 02:38:11.017]  But no, here's Biden pretending otherwise in clip number three.
[02:38:11.869 --> 02:38:14.111]  I started off in a kid.
[02:38:14.111 --> 02:38:14.651]  In a kid?
[02:38:14.651 --> 02:38:21.036]  In the Civil Rights Movement in Wilmington, Delaware when I was in high school.
[02:38:21.036 --> 02:38:24.399]  Play that back for me.
[02:38:24.399 --> 02:38:25.880]  I started off in a kid.
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:27.241]  He started off in a kid.
[02:38:27.241 --> 02:38:31.285]  In the Civil Rights Movement in Wilmington, Delaware when I was in high school.
[02:38:31.285 --> 02:38:35.969]  And the community, we won by a staggering 31 or 3200 votes when I ran the first time for the Senate at 29 years old.
[02:38:42.270 --> 02:38:47.115]  And Nixon won by 64% of the vote in my state.
[02:38:47.115 --> 02:38:52.740]  I won because virtually 90% of the African American community, we have a large community, voted for me.
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:53.240]  I owe you.
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:54.141]  I owe you.
[02:38:54.141 --> 02:38:56.803]  I owe you.
[02:38:56.803 --> 02:38:58.345]  He owes you.
[02:38:58.345 --> 02:39:00.807]  By the way, actually this was in the news today, guys.
[02:39:00.807 --> 02:39:01.147]  Pull it up.
[02:39:01.147 --> 02:39:02.128]  I don't have it on my desk.
[02:39:02.128 --> 02:39:03.369]  I don't think I have it on my desk.
[02:39:04.592 --> 02:39:05.754]  Um, but I know it was in the news.
[02:39:05.754 --> 02:39:14.786]  Guys, go ahead and Google, Joe Biden loses, I think it was 17% of the black vote in latest polls, I think is what it was.
[02:39:14.786 --> 02:39:21.455]  I imagine that speech isn't helping, but it's more about the economy getting crushed, gas prices going up.
[02:39:22.694 --> 02:39:28.535]  The education system collapsing, the infrastructure collapsing, the energy bill is going up, the grocery bill is going up.
[02:39:28.535 --> 02:39:30.776]  I mean, that's really why he's losing the vote.
[02:39:30.776 --> 02:39:38.937]  And he's just a stone-cold lying fraud, phony, supporting illegal immigrants ahead of American citizens.
[02:39:38.937 --> 02:39:42.458]  He says he owes you everything, but then he gives everything to illegal immigrants.
[02:39:42.458 --> 02:39:48.659]  But no, there were stories today in the news how Joe Biden lost like another 17% of the black vote in polls.
[02:39:48.659 --> 02:39:50.720]  So, I guess it's not working, Joe.
[02:39:52.092 --> 02:40:01.338]  And I guess you're referring to black men as boy, because that's how you were brought up, to talk to them, to talk down to them like that, Joe, and say, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black.
[02:40:01.338 --> 02:40:05.361]  So I guess that's not really working for that demographic.
[02:40:05.361 --> 02:40:14.807]  I guess that's not really working for the black vote as he continues to lose more of those votes.
[02:40:14.807 --> 02:40:19.350]  Yeah, Biden grapples with concerns over young black voter support.
[02:40:21.104 --> 02:40:23.246]  So, yeah, these stories were all over the news today.
[02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:28.990]  He's hemorrhaging votes, and so, huh.
[02:40:28.990 --> 02:40:35.996]  There's a couple other things that are going to be hurting him, like this video that's surfacing in clip five, and just the b-roll is fine here.
[02:40:35.996 --> 02:40:44.102]  And understand that we here at InfoWars have already documented this, and we've been documenting this since 2021 when Joe Biden took over.
[02:40:44.102 --> 02:40:47.105]  Here is a member of the Border Patrol at the southern border,
[02:40:47.978 --> 02:40:58.423]  Where there's a line of illegal immigrants and he's dropping a ladder so that they can climb the wall and get over the barbed wire.
[02:40:58.423 --> 02:41:01.664]  I mean, what?
[02:41:01.664 --> 02:41:05.146]  Oh, you're trying to cross the border illegally but you're at the wall on the barbed wire?
[02:41:05.146 --> 02:41:05.826]  Here!
[02:41:05.826 --> 02:41:07.767]  Here's a ladder!
[02:41:07.767 --> 02:41:11.209]  Come on in!
[02:41:11.209 --> 02:41:12.809]  Okay.
[02:41:12.809 --> 02:41:15.751]  But then there's the popularity of Donald Trump.
[02:41:16.761 --> 02:41:17.682]  It is skyrocketing.
[02:41:17.682 --> 02:41:24.546]  The mugshot has certainly added to the cultural benefit of Trump's politics.
[02:41:24.546 --> 02:41:29.690]  And now today, Donald Trump set to speak in South Carolina sometime this afternoon.
[02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:32.652]  Donald Trump buys a Glock.
[02:41:36.906 --> 02:41:38.907]  That's a nice looking Glock.
[02:41:38.907 --> 02:41:40.268]  He wants to buy one badly.
[02:41:40.268 --> 02:41:41.169]  He made that clear.
[02:41:41.169 --> 02:41:43.370]  I think he said it three times he wants to buy one.
[02:42:04.956 --> 02:42:05.997]  One more time, one more time.
[02:42:05.997 --> 02:42:07.539]  Attorney General, Attorney General, jump in.
[02:42:14.226 --> 02:42:17.047]  It's a beautiful Glock.
[02:42:17.047 --> 02:42:18.728]  It's perfectly made for Trump.
[02:42:18.728 --> 02:42:21.709]  We might just put Trump on the side of the Glock.
[02:42:21.709 --> 02:42:25.891]  And I'm thinking about holsters now.
[02:42:25.891 --> 02:42:31.053]  What kind of holster do I want?
[02:42:31.053 --> 02:42:33.974]  Do I want the holster on the belt?
[02:42:33.974 --> 02:42:38.936]  Or some people thinking, you know, maybe for Trump, maybe you get the shoulder holster.
[02:42:40.116 --> 02:42:46.439]  Or maybe you put it in the leg or in the sock with the leg holster.
[02:42:46.439 --> 02:42:49.680]  We've got a lot of things to consider, but look at that beautiful Glock.
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:51.560]  It's my Glock now.
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:55.522]  And so it's my Glock and it's the most beautiful Glock.
[02:42:58.203 --> 02:42:59.264]  Don't lie down and take it.
[02:42:59.264 --> 02:43:01.125]  Spread the word about this broadcast.
[02:43:01.125 --> 02:43:02.086]  Pray for this broadcast.

[02:43:56.232 --> 02:43:56.572]  Go now.
[02:43:58.594 --> 02:44:05.522]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:44:05.522 --> 02:44:14.513]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:44:14.513 --> 02:44:16.736]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:44:17.356 --> 02:44:20.661]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:44:20.661 --> 02:44:29.171]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:44:29.171 --> 02:44:33.317]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:44:33.977 --> 02:44:45.508]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:44:45.508 --> 02:44:51.574]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:44:51.574 --> 02:44:57.740]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:58.829 --> 02:45:06.991]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[02:45:06.991 --> 02:45:12.473]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:45:12.473 --> 02:45:17.415]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:45:18.795 --> 02:45:23.645]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:45:23.645 --> 02:45:29.296]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:45:31.184 --> 02:45:40.047]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[02:45:40.047 --> 02:45:44.828]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[02:45:44.828 --> 02:45:49.970]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[02:45:49.970 --> 02:45:53.011]  Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:45:53.011 --> 02:45:55.232]  Get some today at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:45:57.765 --> 02:45:59.166]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:45:59.166 --> 02:46:00.107]  I thought it was next week.
[02:46:00.107 --> 02:46:04.531]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:46:04.531 --> 02:46:06.753]  Bonnie's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:46:06.753 --> 02:46:10.617]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:46:10.617 --> 02:46:12.498]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:46:12.498 --> 02:46:16.662]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:46:16.662 --> 02:46:19.625]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:46:19.625 --> 02:46:22.187]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[02:46:25.450 --> 02:46:28.312]  Again, most turmeric formulas are five percent.
[02:46:28.312 --> 02:46:29.652]  Some are maybe ten.
[02:46:29.652 --> 02:46:32.334]  The other strongest brands are seventy-five percent.
[02:46:32.334 --> 02:46:36.256]  This is ninety-five percent.
[02:46:36.256 --> 02:46:37.237]  Super constant.
[02:46:37.237 --> 02:46:41.099]  So, like, taking one pill is like taking ten of the average pill.
[02:46:41.099 --> 02:46:42.580]  It's that powerful.
[02:46:42.580 --> 02:46:43.740]  Or more.
[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:45.862]  So, they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:47.267 --> 02:46:59.559]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, filled out for almost eight months, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:59.559 --> 02:47:05.465]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:38.796]  I want to explain what InfoWars is really all about, what the core
[02:47:40.509 --> 02:47:50.958]  Of this crew and this audience and all the work that's been put in here for decades.
[02:47:50.958 --> 02:48:00.527]  And I want to start this off with a meme that was going viral during the Hawaiian wildfires.
[02:48:00.527 --> 02:48:05.872]  And it's a picture of Hawaii burning and it says, only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:48:07.148 --> 02:48:19.956]  Now if you remember, it was law enforcement telling people they couldn't leave and they were blocking the roads and they shut off the water and they kept the power lines charged up, so only those that disobeyed survived.
[02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:27.341]  If you rejected the blockade and said, no, I'm going to get out of this burning hellhole, then you survived.
[02:48:27.341 --> 02:48:33.544]  If you obeyed law enforcement and stayed in the burning inferno, you burned to death.
[02:48:33.544 --> 02:48:35.966]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:48:37.742 --> 02:48:41.243]  And you see, that's everything.
[02:48:41.243 --> 02:48:43.984]  That's the core of what drives InfoWars.
[02:48:43.984 --> 02:48:51.286]  That's the nucleus that is the makeup of our hosts, our crew, our guests, and our audience.
[02:48:51.286 --> 02:48:56.367]  Because we understand that the new world order is death.
[02:48:56.367 --> 02:48:59.528]  And only those who disobey will survive.
[02:48:59.528 --> 02:49:00.609]  Look at the vaccine.
[02:49:00.609 --> 02:49:01.629]  Another perfect example.
[02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:07.753]  Unfortunately, many didn't get the message, and they obeyed.
[02:49:07.753 --> 02:49:10.816]  And now tens of thousands have died from the vaccine.
[02:49:10.816 --> 02:49:14.199]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:49:14.199 --> 02:49:16.961]  But look at the larger issue.
[02:49:16.961 --> 02:49:19.783]  What are we facing next?
[02:49:19.783 --> 02:49:20.504]  It begins.
[02:49:20.504 --> 02:49:25.368]  Australia's fifth largest bank announces digital-only transactions will phase out cash.
[02:49:28.877 --> 02:49:43.106]  And then we have a report coming up shortly from Paul Joseph Watson talking about how the UK governments and these other governments around the world want to force you into the climate change, zero carbon emissions world.
[02:49:43.106 --> 02:49:44.907]  Now what does that actually look like?
[02:49:44.907 --> 02:49:47.629]  You're not going to have access to energy.
[02:49:47.629 --> 02:49:50.791]  You're not going to have access to food.
[02:49:50.791 --> 02:49:57.035]  And the only access that you will get is if you are a good slave and obedient to your masters.
[02:49:59.070 --> 02:50:03.832]  But of course, that is death.
[02:50:03.832 --> 02:50:06.394]  So it's a powerful meme.
[02:50:06.394 --> 02:50:14.298]  And it's the deeper understanding that drives everything we do here.
[02:50:14.298 --> 02:50:16.019]  Take your vaccine!
[02:50:16.019 --> 02:50:18.940]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:20.721]  Stay at home during the wildfire!
[02:50:20.721 --> 02:50:22.202]  Don't leave!
[02:50:22.202 --> 02:50:24.083]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:25.916 --> 02:50:27.417]  Go into the digital currency!
[02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:29.599]  Go into the central bank digital currency!
[02:50:29.599 --> 02:50:30.920]  Stop eating meat!
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.721]  Stop consuming energy!
[02:50:32.721 --> 02:50:35.203]  Stop living!
[02:50:35.203 --> 02:50:42.989]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:42.989 --> 02:50:51.596]  The mad dash to net zero continues to cause chaos across Europe.
[02:50:51.596 --> 02:50:54.979]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:59.184 --> 02:51:03.208]  So, they want you to think that obeying is surviving.
[02:51:03.208 --> 02:51:10.615]  They want you to think that obeying is getting through it and getting along and getting to the other side.
[02:51:10.615 --> 02:51:14.659]  But the other side is death.
[02:51:14.659 --> 02:51:19.845]  The other side is slavery.
[02:51:19.845 --> 02:51:21.406]  Only those who disobeyed
[02:51:22.461 --> 02:51:35.036]  Survived and you see this is why the voices like Alex Jones and Owen Schroer and Russell Brand And so many others have to be shut down We also have an update coming up
[02:51:35.902 --> 02:51:43.865]  From Alex on the Russell Brand situation, where they're trying to do to Russell Brand what they did to Alex Jones.
[02:51:43.865 --> 02:51:50.447]  Firm pulls ads from Rumble platform over Russell Brand videos, so they're trying to hurt Rumble's bottom line.
[02:51:50.447 --> 02:51:51.667]  Rumble won't budge.
[02:51:51.667 --> 02:51:52.988]  At least, I don't think they'll budge.
[02:51:56.397 --> 02:51:57.538]  I'm an online expert.
[02:51:57.538 --> 02:52:03.661]  Russell Brand's Refuge Platform Rumble may be forced offline under new internet safety laws.
[02:52:03.661 --> 02:52:04.841]  Oh, internet safety.
[02:52:04.841 --> 02:52:05.102]  See?
[02:52:05.102 --> 02:52:05.862]  Just obey.
[02:52:05.862 --> 02:52:08.043]  It's for your safety.
[02:52:08.043 --> 02:52:13.406]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:52:13.406 --> 02:52:21.190]  Now, Rumble has built, in many ways, an infrastructure around the parallel economy.
[02:52:22.904 --> 02:52:26.246]  So, I don't think they can take them completely off the internet.
[02:52:26.246 --> 02:52:29.568]  So you'll still have Rumble, like you'll have Banned.Video.
[02:52:29.568 --> 02:52:35.211]  They'll be completely censored, their links will be banned, they'll make it impossible to find, but they'll still be able to operate.
[02:52:35.211 --> 02:52:39.714]  Much like InfoWars and Banned.Video, everyone will get that treatment.
[02:52:39.714 --> 02:52:41.755]  But you know, Rumble has an app.
[02:52:41.755 --> 02:52:44.097]  And Rumble has been developing this app.
[02:52:44.097 --> 02:52:49.100]  They're trying to improve this app, they're trying to make it so you can go live from the app, you can upload HD from the app.
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:55.262]  And they're trying to build it to be a legitimate competitor of YouTube.
[02:52:55.262 --> 02:53:06.205]  But now they're gonna say, you better take Russell Brand off of Rumble or we're removing your app.
[02:53:06.205 --> 02:53:09.926]  Just like they did to InfoWars.
[02:53:09.926 --> 02:53:12.767]  So does Rumble understand?
[02:53:12.767 --> 02:53:16.528]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:53:17.375 --> 02:53:18.877]  I think Rumble gets it.
[02:53:18.877 --> 02:53:24.545]  I think Rumble will stand strong.
[02:53:24.545 --> 02:53:26.848]  But what is the real message here?
[02:53:26.848 --> 02:53:30.033]  Is it that if you're a rapist you don't get free speech?
[02:53:30.033 --> 02:53:31.115]  Of course not.
[02:53:31.115 --> 02:53:31.976]  That has nothing to do with it.
[02:53:34.048 --> 02:53:49.675]  The real argument here is that if you call out the corrupt establishment, if you call out corrupt governments, if you call out the military-industrial complex, if you call out the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, if you dare question elections, you must be silenced.
[02:53:49.675 --> 02:53:51.456]  You must be shut down.
[02:53:51.456 --> 02:53:55.618]  A rape accusation, or even if it is a rape, that's not what this is really about.
[02:53:55.618 --> 02:53:57.358]  These people love Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:53:57.358 --> 02:53:59.479]  These people fly to Jeffrey Epstein's island.
[02:53:59.479 --> 02:54:01.780]  They're there with the minors.
[02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:02.641]  This isn't about rape.
[02:54:03.956 --> 02:54:12.360]  And by the way, they hate victims of rape because they use rape accusations to destroy their opposition, which only hurts victims of rape.
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:16.683]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:54:16.683 --> 02:54:21.885]  So the next big thing is the Zero Carbon Emission Society.
[02:54:21.885 --> 02:54:25.727]  And if you obey, you will not survive.
[02:54:25.727 --> 02:54:27.488]  Do you understand it?
[02:54:27.488 --> 02:54:28.949]  Do you get the message loud and clear?
[02:54:28.949 --> 02:54:30.490]  Was it not obvious with vaccines?
[02:54:31.735 --> 02:54:34.938]  Was it not obvious with the Hawaiian wildfires?
[02:54:34.938 --> 02:54:41.684]  Is it not obvious when they want to cut out your energy and food consumption and treat you like a slave?
[02:54:41.684 --> 02:54:45.107]  Here is the latest video report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:47.059 --> 02:54:49.740]  Billionaire John Cordwell is furious.
[02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:54.621]  Mad at Rishi Sunak for indicating there might be a slight delay in implementing net zero.
[02:54:54.621 --> 02:54:58.783]  He's threatening to pull all his financial support from the Conservatives and give it to Labour.
[02:54:58.783 --> 02:55:01.804]  Cordwell said the environmental apocalypse is coming.
[02:55:01.804 --> 02:55:03.664]  And it's coming very, very rapidly.
[02:55:03.664 --> 02:55:05.265]  I'm very worried about the future.
[02:55:05.265 --> 02:55:08.066]  In fact, the mobile phone magnate is so worried about...
[02:55:08.706 --> 02:55:10.227]  The environmental apocalypse!
[02:55:10.227 --> 02:55:19.512]  But just last month he bragged about how useful his private helicopter was for whizzing quickly between his business in London and his £90 million Staffordshire mansion.
[02:55:19.512 --> 02:55:22.414]  I can do what otherwise would be a four-hour journey in an hour!
[02:55:22.414 --> 02:55:24.495]  John, what about the environmental apocalypse?
[02:55:24.495 --> 02:55:29.478]  The average chopper expels around 340 kilograms of CO2 per hour.
[02:55:29.478 --> 02:55:31.579]  In comparison, an average car expels 8.5 kilograms of CO2.
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:41.246]  So every time John wants to shoot back to his country pile, he's belching out 331 kilograms more carbon dioxide than is necessary.
[02:55:41.246 --> 02:55:45.349]  This is the guy sounding the alarm about an environmental apocalypse.
[02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:47.731]  All those little people with their nasty emissions.
[02:55:47.731 --> 02:55:56.818]  The dude who doesn't even need to travel back from London, because he owns a 45,000 square foot, 250 million pound property in Mayfair too.
[02:55:56.818 --> 02:56:00.301]  Dude's got monthly heating bills greater than your entire net worth.
[02:56:00.301 --> 02:56:02.903]  So he's gonna start lecturing you on your carbon footprint.
[02:56:03.063 --> 02:56:09.606]  We might already be past the tipping point, and who says net zero by 2050 is soon enough?
[02:56:09.606 --> 02:56:11.628]  We need to do everything in our power.
[02:56:11.628 --> 02:56:21.253]  Yeah, I'm sure John's deep concern about you driving a petrol car beyond 2030 is somewhat assuaged by the kind of fun he has on his 73-foot mega superyacht.
[02:56:21.253 --> 02:56:28.316]  A superyacht with permanent crew, helicopter pads, submarines and pools in it's about 7,020 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
[02:56:28.316 --> 02:56:31.318]  More than 1,500 times higher than a typical family car.
[02:56:31.578 --> 02:56:36.904]  Alex Jones exempted himself from contributing to the... environmental apocalypse.
[02:56:36.904 --> 02:56:40.529]  And to be clear, the Tories aren't doing a U-turn on net zero at all.
[02:56:40.529 --> 02:56:51.342]  They're still barrelling full tilt towards an agenda based on hysterical eco-alarmism that'll make everyone poorer, more miserable, than living under the despotic thumb of a technocratic control grid.
[02:56:51.442 --> 02:56:53.563]  Just at a marginally slower pace.
[02:56:53.563 --> 02:57:01.326]  Rishi Sunak's announcement was that he would still be banning the sales of all new petrol and diesel cars just by 2035, not 2030.
[02:57:01.326 --> 02:57:03.127]  That's what Caldwell's mad about.
[02:57:03.127 --> 02:57:10.290]  The media presents all this like there's anything more than a cigarette paper's width distance between the Tory policy and the Labour policy.
[02:57:10.290 --> 02:57:15.972]  They're both fully committed to sacrificing Britain's prosperity and freedom at the altar of green madness.
[02:57:16.152 --> 02:57:21.498]  Refusing to even build new nuclear power plants that would more than meet our energy needs for eternity.
[02:57:21.498 --> 02:57:26.844]  While countries like China and India will continue to blanket their countries with coal-fired power plants.
[02:57:26.844 --> 02:57:33.432]  Laughing at the rest of the world as they belch CO2 to their hearts content like John Cordwell on his super yacht.
[02:57:47.657 --> 02:57:53.660]  My fellow patriots, the Trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[02:57:53.660 --> 02:58:03.345]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three of them at once together at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% off.
[02:58:03.345 --> 02:58:12.730]  This is your best opportunity at the lowest price to support the broadcast, but more importantly, experience DNA Force+, Real Red Pill+, and Body's Ultimate Tumoring Formula.

[02:58:18.652 --> 02:58:25.334]  It would take me an hour to tell you about what's in DNA Force+, or Real Red Pill+, or Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[02:58:57.582 --> 02:59:02.487]  One of the most powerful ingredients in Real Red Pill Plus is Pregnanolone.
[02:59:02.487 --> 02:59:10.415]  Pregnanolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[02:59:10.615 --> 02:59:18.800]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:31.728]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.

[02:59:39.794 --> 02:59:51.003]  Now 25% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:51.003 --> 02:59:54.926]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.645 --> 03:00:06.649]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live here in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[03:00:06.649 --> 03:00:11.512]  The heart of the resistance to tyranny.
[03:00:11.512 --> 03:00:16.155]  Now, let me tell you what we have coming up the rest of the day.
[03:00:16.155 --> 03:00:23.801]  The final hour of the Alex Jones Show will consist of a special report from Alex, a new breaking report from Alex, coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:25.336 --> 03:00:35.779]  We will also then have another breaking report from Alex at the end of this hour, dealing with some breaking news, with some inside information that he has on the Russell Brand situation.
[03:00:35.779 --> 03:00:45.523]  And those will be bookends to the great Gerald Cilente, doing great work as usual with the Trends Journal, hosting here in the fourth hour as well.
[03:00:46.443 --> 03:00:51.829]  We will be monitoring Donald Trump set to speak in South Carolina any moment now.
[03:00:51.829 --> 03:00:55.172]  He's bought himself a nice gold Trump 45.
[03:00:55.172 --> 03:00:56.614]  We showed you that video.
[03:00:56.614 --> 03:01:03.301]  He has spoken to the media and he has also done a meet and greet with South Carolina Trump campaign volunteers.
[03:01:03.301 --> 03:01:04.723]  What has Joe Biden been doing today?
[03:01:05.643 --> 03:01:17.552]  Hmm, well I know he hasn't spoke with the media, I know he has not purchased a Glock, and I know he's not having a campaign event, and so what is the supposed president doing today?
[03:01:17.552 --> 03:01:18.532]  Nothing?
[03:01:18.532 --> 03:01:19.133]  Napping?
[03:01:19.133 --> 03:01:22.195]  Eating tapioca pudding in a cryogenic chamber?
[03:01:22.195 --> 03:01:23.096]  Who knows?
[03:01:23.096 --> 03:01:24.076]  It's Joe Biden.
[03:01:24.076 --> 03:01:26.418]  He doesn't even know, actually.
[03:01:26.418 --> 03:01:27.399]  He's not even aware that
[03:01:28.953 --> 03:01:30.534]  Biden makes border history.
[03:01:30.534 --> 03:01:37.839]  He's making history with the most illegal immigrant encounters in August ever recorded and the most illegal immigrants crossing the border.
[03:01:38.795 --> 03:01:47.517]  Ever encountered in one month, Biden border crisis, El Paso, Texas shelters are so overwhelmed that hundreds of Venezuelans, including children, are sleeping on the streets.
[03:01:47.517 --> 03:01:56.418]  And we've documented this for you as well with our news team at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:01:56.418 --> 03:02:00.019]  So on The War Room, we'll be monitoring Trump's speech.
[03:02:00.019 --> 03:02:04.760]  And then I'll be back hosting as well at the three o'clock hour.
[03:02:05.854 --> 03:02:09.675]  And it looks like, uh, is this Trump Live right now even?
[03:02:09.675 --> 03:02:13.197]  So, um, pop me in for a second here, guys.
[03:02:13.197 --> 03:02:15.097]  Pop me in.
[03:02:15.097 --> 03:02:17.138]  I think she celebrated that night.
[03:02:17.138 --> 03:02:18.598]  Now we call her Beautiful Hillary.
[03:02:18.598 --> 03:02:19.599]  She's a beautiful woman.
[03:02:20.595 --> 03:02:29.799]  Crooked Joe's inflation crisis has raised costs for small businesses like this one by more than 20% already, and it's going much higher.
[03:02:29.799 --> 03:02:38.563]  Biden's energy crisis has hurt sales by nearly tripling the cost to fill up a sportsman's 355-gallon gas tank.
[03:02:38.563 --> 03:02:40.584]  Think of that, three times higher.
[03:02:40.584 --> 03:02:49.208]  Soaring interest rates, which is even a worse problem, make boat loans much more expensive, makes it very hard for people to buy boats, and all of this horrible
[03:02:50.862 --> 03:02:56.447]  Stuff is happening against your incredible American worker.
[03:02:56.447 --> 03:03:04.013]  Under Biden, household incomes have been crushed by nearly $7,400 a year.
[03:03:04.013 --> 03:03:04.914]  Does anyone know that?
[03:03:04.914 --> 03:03:07.216]  Marjorie, did you know that?
[03:03:07.216 --> 03:03:12.701]  Under Trump, incomes increased by more than $8,000 a year with no inflation.
[03:03:12.701 --> 03:03:13.742]  We didn't have inflation.
[03:03:15.228 --> 03:03:20.672]  A vote for crooked Joe Biden is a vote for inflation, taxation, submission, and failure.
[03:03:20.672 --> 03:03:21.573]  That's what it is.
[03:03:21.573 --> 03:03:31.861]  A vote for Trump is a vote for more jobs, higher wages, and more boats, cars, trucks, and airplanes stamped, made in America and made in South Carolina.
[03:03:31.861 --> 03:03:39.887]  I think he should just take his new Trump 45 Glock and just start busting into the air.
[03:03:39.887 --> 03:03:41.668]  You know, just start firing him off.
[03:03:41.668 --> 03:03:43.670]  The burning wreckage of Bidenomics.
[03:03:44.477 --> 03:03:46.338]  As soon as we get back into the Oval Office.
[03:04:14.517 --> 03:04:17.719]  But we got a special report from Alex Jones coming up at the top of the hour.
[03:04:17.719 --> 03:04:20.481]  We got a special report coming up from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[03:04:20.481 --> 03:04:23.043]  We got the great Gerald Salente loaded for bear as well.
[03:04:23.043 --> 03:04:25.084]  Folks, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:04:25.084 --> 03:04:26.785]  That's how everything we do here is possible.
[03:04:26.785 --> 03:04:33.930]  If it wasn't for your support, we couldn't even be on air doing any of this with the great guests and the great crew.
[03:04:33.930 --> 03:04:35.451]  I am eternally grateful for that.
[03:04:35.451 --> 03:04:37.332]  Huge sales happening right now.

[03:04:40.795 --> 03:04:44.017]  That's DNA Force Plus, BODYS, and the Real Red Pill Plus.

[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:07.963]  We really do make it easy for you to support us by having really incredible products.
[03:05:07.963 --> 03:05:17.528]  One of the most incredible, I have to say, is DNA Force Plus, and it's one of these supplements that you really don't know what the effect it's going to have on you is until you try it.
[03:05:17.868 --> 03:05:19.850]  It's different for everybody, but it's always positive.
[03:05:19.850 --> 03:05:25.096]  Essentially, it just helps in a variety of different ways and whatever way that your body needs, it'll help in that way.
[03:05:25.096 --> 03:05:31.564]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:05:31.564 --> 03:05:35.969]  That's why DNA Force Plus has exactly what you need to provide your cells with protection.
[03:05:36.229 --> 03:05:42.653]  By taking something like DNA Force Plus, you're just upping the game on all of your body's functions in a way that is holistic and complete and really incredible.
[03:05:42.653 --> 03:05:52.900]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and of course, best of all, you keep us on air and in the fight and fighting back against the mental, spiritual, and physical poisoning that we contend with on a daily basis.
[03:06:04.307 --> 03:06:12.756]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:16.227 --> 03:06:22.253]  I was watching the end of the Edward Dow interview about 25 minutes ago, and he made a really good point.
[03:06:22.253 --> 03:06:24.595]  I've never talked to him privately, never told him this.
[03:06:24.595 --> 03:06:29.640]  Haven't really talked about it a lot on air, but I've thought about talking about it, but I always get distracted by the news.
[03:06:29.640 --> 03:06:32.102]  But it really is an important point on so many fronts.
[03:06:32.102 --> 03:06:34.084]  He said, Alex Jones has had his wealth destroyed.
[03:06:34.084 --> 03:06:37.708]  And my wealth was never as great as they said it was, not by 2%.
[03:06:39.729 --> 03:06:43.091]  I never had $400 million, never had $10 million.
[03:06:43.091 --> 03:06:44.931]  But I mean, I did have more wealth.
[03:06:44.931 --> 03:06:47.532]  Now I basically have nothing other than my house.
[03:06:47.532 --> 03:06:51.054]  And the globalists thought when they persecuted me and lied about me that would make me go away.
[03:06:51.054 --> 03:06:52.074]  No, I already knew they were evil.
[03:06:52.074 --> 03:06:54.055]  I already knew they were going to come after me.
[03:06:54.055 --> 03:06:56.456]  I'm surprised they haven't killed me or put me in prison yet.
[03:06:56.456 --> 03:06:58.757]  They've certainly been trying to put me in prison.
[03:06:58.757 --> 03:06:59.497]  But he's right.
[03:06:59.497 --> 03:07:07.881]  Being involved in service against evil, being involved in standing up against evil, I joined my ancestors that were amazing people.
[03:07:08.991 --> 03:07:09.512]  We're good to go.
[03:07:25.029 --> 03:07:27.873]  And really on the other side of it has been nothing but victory and success.
[03:07:27.873 --> 03:07:33.902]  I get to see all the major prominent voices echoing my analysis and my research.
[03:07:33.902 --> 03:07:35.985]  And then on their own discovering how the globalists operate.
[03:07:35.985 --> 03:07:37.448]  Because once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[03:07:37.448 --> 03:07:38.870]  It's like taking the red pill.
[03:07:38.870 --> 03:07:39.771]  Morpheus tells Neo.
[03:07:41.089 --> 03:07:44.573]  Neo, you can't be told about the Matrix, you've got to see it for yourself.
[03:07:44.573 --> 03:07:53.283]  And so it's not that they're following what I say, it's that they're waking up because of our research and our guest research and this show and our listener support, and they're seeing what we see.
[03:07:53.283 --> 03:07:55.326]  They've taken the blinders off.
[03:07:55.326 --> 03:07:59.471]  Or to use the opposite analogy, like they live, they put the sunglasses on.
[03:07:59.471 --> 03:07:59.811]  And so...
[03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:11.216]  It enrages my enemies when I talk about the fact that I would do it the same way again, basically, and the Lord works in mysterious ways, but I've not made the point that, yes, I am happier than I've ever been.
[03:08:11.216 --> 03:08:23.726]  I'm also very nostalgic for some of the freedoms we've lost, and I'm sad and I grieve, but at the end of the day, I'm so fulfilled and so much closer to God that I'm a completely different person.
[03:08:24.366 --> 03:08:30.811]  I mean, I look back on the mistakes I made, and I was never perfect, but I always loved God and loved justice, but I am so much more of a person now.
[03:08:30.811 --> 03:08:34.374]  My intellectual capacity is so much greater.
[03:08:34.374 --> 03:08:40.799]  In the past, I would dream, like most people do, in their sixth or seventh hour of sleep, REM sleep, and now I go to bed at night.
[03:08:40.799 --> 03:08:42.540]  I used to only sleep like five, six hours.
[03:08:42.540 --> 03:08:43.841]  I love to sleep ten hours now.
[03:08:44.722 --> 03:08:48.906]  I don't usually get to, but I just have dreams from the time I go to sleep, the time I wake up.
[03:08:48.906 --> 03:08:51.508]  This shows amazing brain activity.
[03:08:51.508 --> 03:08:52.388]  And something's happened.
[03:08:52.388 --> 03:08:57.092]  I've just dialed in closer to God, the Holy Spirit, and it's just fabulous.
[03:08:57.092 --> 03:08:59.994]  I mean, the dreams are just spectacular.
[03:08:59.994 --> 03:09:03.117]  And they're so incredible, I can't even describe them.
[03:09:03.117 --> 03:09:06.280]  And that just shows that we're designed to fight evil.
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:07.400]  We're designed to stand up for good.
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:13.225]  And so I really love Owen, and I love the rest of the crew, and I love the listeners, and I love all our sponsors and affiliates and just everybody.
[03:09:14.366 --> 03:09:21.308]  I love this journey, getting to see who's real and who's not, and all the great people I've gotten to meet and gotten to know in this fight, and how I've seen people grow.
[03:09:21.308 --> 03:09:24.149]  Not just myself, but how I've seen us all grow.
[03:09:24.149 --> 03:09:29.631]  So, really, this is the Animating Contest of Liberty, and we've got a big fourth-hour guest coming up.
[03:09:29.631 --> 03:09:31.331]  We'll be hosting the War Room today, 3 p.m.
[03:09:31.331 --> 03:09:31.711]  Central.
[03:09:31.711 --> 03:09:36.693]  We're working really hard, and I'm on my way back to Austin right now, so I'll see you guys soon.
[03:09:36.693 --> 03:09:39.534]  But again, I just wanted to point out that Edward Dowd is totally right.
[03:09:39.534 --> 03:09:40.914]  I am way happier than I've ever been.
[03:09:40.914 --> 03:09:42.915]  I was never trying to amass wealth.
[03:09:44.255 --> 03:09:52.662]  I had some backup money and some backup things because I knew attacks were coming and I tended to always expend those investments to stay on air.
[03:09:52.662 --> 03:10:00.949]  I'm going to say I'm the best steward, but I took the $3 million backup money we had five years ago and bought a property that I sold last year for $7 million.
[03:10:00.949 --> 03:10:04.773]  And I put the proceeds completely into the fight.
[03:10:05.513 --> 03:10:08.614]  And we got a seven, eight million dollar bitcoin donation.
[03:10:08.614 --> 03:10:12.215]  Seven or eight, because we got it at about eight million, but by the time I sold it, seven million.
[03:10:12.215 --> 03:10:16.897]  And I put it all into the operation, and it was the exact amount we needed to stay on air.
[03:10:16.897 --> 03:10:18.717]  So that's how God works in mysterious ways.
[03:10:18.717 --> 03:10:20.638]  And my enemies, when they had me on the stand in Connecticut,
[03:10:21.238 --> 03:10:21.398]  Yes.
[03:10:36.235 --> 03:10:37.296]  Infowars anyways.
[03:10:37.296 --> 03:10:40.299]  Yeah, it all went there.
[03:10:40.299 --> 03:10:43.001]  I think like $50,000 or something got spent on some of my bills.
[03:10:43.001 --> 03:10:48.306]  But the point is that they just couldn't believe it because they'd never do that.
[03:10:48.306 --> 03:10:51.748]  They'd never have a $3 million house.
[03:10:51.748 --> 03:10:52.889]  I bought it as an investment.
[03:10:53.991 --> 03:10:55.952]  I was told about it by a great realtor.
[03:10:55.952 --> 03:10:57.134]  He's actually Elon Musk's realtor.
[03:10:57.134 --> 03:10:57.734]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:10:57.734 --> 03:11:00.137]  But here in Austin, a great patriot named Gary.
[03:11:00.137 --> 03:11:01.398]  He said, listen, this guy's a banker.
[03:11:01.398 --> 03:11:02.920]  He can't finish his house.
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:03.860]  He'll sell it to you for $3 million.
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:04.962]  It's worth $5 million right now.
[03:11:04.962 --> 03:11:06.203]  In a couple of years, it'll be worth $7 million.
[03:11:06.203 --> 03:11:07.164]  I suggest you buy it.
[03:11:07.164 --> 03:11:10.627]  And just all it needs is a few of the fixtures and doors and air conditioning put in.
[03:11:11.448 --> 03:11:19.973]  I took all the money I had, bought it with the full intention of knowing the storm was coming, and then sold it two and a half, three years later for seven million plus dollars.
[03:11:19.973 --> 03:11:26.276]  And I dumped it all into free speech right when we were being censored and shut down and had no funds.
[03:11:26.276 --> 03:11:27.837]  And it just came through and got us on air.
[03:11:27.837 --> 03:11:29.658]  And it was such a blessing.
[03:11:29.658 --> 03:11:31.018]  But I'll tell you this now.
[03:11:31.018 --> 03:11:35.401]  I don't care about losing the quote wealth I had, except the fact I don't have anything in my batteries.
[03:11:36.121 --> 03:11:37.322]  I don't have anything else.
[03:11:37.322 --> 03:11:39.503]  I am actually upside down.
[03:11:39.503 --> 03:11:44.406]  That's why I need your support at DefendJones.com for my own personal expenses.
[03:11:44.406 --> 03:11:48.889]  That's why I need you to go to JonesCrowder.com where I do a once a week show with Crowder.
[03:11:48.889 --> 03:11:52.791]  You get all the other shows he's got, all the special behind the paywall stuff at JonesCrowder.com.
[03:11:52.791 --> 03:11:58.194]  You get one month free with a promo code Alex at JonesCrowder.com.
[03:11:58.194 --> 03:12:00.175]  That's how you fund Alex Jones.
[03:12:00.175 --> 03:12:04.038]  I mean, most of the money actually goes to Fund Free Speech, but some of it goes to me because
[03:12:04.858 --> 03:12:05.798]  I'm out of money.
[03:12:05.798 --> 03:12:07.519]  And so, it's very, very simple.
[03:12:07.519 --> 03:12:08.459]  So I don't worship the money.
[03:12:08.459 --> 03:12:09.259]  I don't care about the money.
[03:12:09.259 --> 03:12:10.319]  But it's like fuel.
[03:12:10.319 --> 03:12:14.140]  When I gas my car up, I don't worship the 10 gallons or 20 gallons I put in.
[03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:16.000]  But I need it to get where I'm going.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.081]  I don't worship the car either, though.
[03:12:17.081 --> 03:12:17.921]  I do like it.
[03:12:17.921 --> 03:12:20.081]  But I love the car way more than the gas.
[03:12:20.081 --> 03:12:20.981]  You get what I'm saying.
[03:12:20.981 --> 03:12:22.342]  Money is only freedom.
[03:12:22.342 --> 03:12:25.182]  That's why we're trying to take all our money away, take our prosperity away.
[03:12:25.182 --> 03:12:26.503]  I'm trying to bring our prosperity back.
[03:12:26.503 --> 03:12:29.303]  And it's very easy to do with the great system God's given us.
[03:12:29.303 --> 03:12:31.124]  I want to thank God for the great job He's done today.
[03:12:31.124 --> 03:12:32.544]  He's got a few minutes left in this segment.
[03:12:33.144 --> 03:12:34.745]  And then we've got a great guest host coming up.
[03:12:34.745 --> 03:12:36.285]  And like I said, I want to be back at 3 p.m.
[03:12:36.285 --> 03:12:37.426]  Central with the War Room.
[03:12:37.426 --> 03:12:38.806]  But thank you all for your support.
[03:12:38.806 --> 03:12:42.667]  JonesCrowder.com, JonesCrowder.com and DefendJones.com.
[03:12:42.667 --> 03:12:48.830]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:52.491]  Great being on InfoWars.
[03:12:52.491 --> 03:13:01.194]  And as Alex just said, we are standing up against evil.
[03:13:03.752 --> 03:13:06.114]  It's as simple as that.
[03:13:06.114 --> 03:13:09.296]  We're standing up against evil.
[03:13:09.296 --> 03:13:14.059]  And Infowars and the crew, these people work very, very hard.
[03:13:14.059 --> 03:13:18.321]  As do we with the Trends Journal, to give you the best that we can.
[03:13:18.321 --> 03:13:21.183]  And we're standing up against evil.
[03:13:21.183 --> 03:13:24.465]  And evil's right in front of our eyes.
[03:13:24.465 --> 03:13:26.747]  Need any more proof?
[03:13:26.747 --> 03:13:27.587]  You know what last Thursday was?
[03:13:30.146 --> 03:13:32.207]  No, no, it wasn't Transgender Day.
[03:13:32.207 --> 03:13:34.908]  I think it's Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:34.908 --> 03:13:39.711]  We're going to have that every Thursday.
[03:13:39.711 --> 03:13:42.132]  If I'm elected, we'll have a Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:42.132 --> 03:13:42.992]  No, no.
[03:13:42.992 --> 03:13:46.934]  Last Thursday wasn't Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:46.934 --> 03:13:52.317]  Last Thursday was International Peace Day.
[03:13:52.317 --> 03:13:57.920]  And these little pieces of crap, these little prostitute whores,
[03:13:58.570 --> 03:14:06.275]  These little arrogant J-Cappers, these little boys, Anderson Cooper.
[03:14:06.275 --> 03:14:09.838]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt.
[03:14:09.838 --> 03:14:12.720]  How do you think I got this job?
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:17.923]  I'm just a jerky slob, but I'm a member of the club.
[03:14:17.923 --> 03:14:25.889]  We won't talk one bit about International Peace Day because we're pieces of crap.
[03:14:27.119 --> 03:14:29.741]  We're little prostitutes.
[03:14:29.741 --> 03:14:42.591]  We're media whores that get paid to put out by our corporate pimps and our government whoremasters.
[03:14:42.591 --> 03:14:55.041]  All we do, Solenti, all we do, Alex Jones, and all the rest of the crew,
[03:14:56.196 --> 03:14:59.037]  All we do is sell war.
[03:14:59.037 --> 03:15:01.257]  We're war whores.
[03:15:01.257 --> 03:15:02.237]  That's all we are.
[03:15:02.237 --> 03:15:07.118]  That's what Alex Jones said.
[03:15:07.118 --> 03:15:09.619]  Standing up against evil.
[03:15:09.619 --> 03:15:12.919]  Not a peep about International Peace Day.
[03:15:12.919 --> 03:15:13.799]  Bip!
[03:15:13.799 --> 03:15:14.960]  Nowhere.
[03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:17.160]  Not in the toilet paper record.
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:19.260]  The New York Slime.
[03:15:19.260 --> 03:15:20.781]  Not on CNN.
[03:15:20.781 --> 03:15:22.141]  The Cartoon News Network.
[03:15:23.467 --> 03:15:29.630]  Hey, USA Today, you forgot about yesterday?
[03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:33.552]  Not a word about peace.
[03:15:33.552 --> 03:15:39.194]  And as you all know, I launched Occupy Peace back in 2015.
[03:15:39.194 --> 03:15:41.596]  Occupypeace.com.
[03:15:41.596 --> 03:15:43.376]  And I have peace rallies.
[03:15:43.376 --> 03:15:46.298]  And oh, am I hated here.
[03:15:46.298 --> 03:15:49.659]  One of my tenants in the 1774 Academy
[03:15:53.717 --> 03:15:59.159]  Closed down when I had a Peace and Freedom Rally, because they called it a political rally.
[03:15:59.159 --> 03:16:04.001]  And all we are, low-life scum, we support the Ukraine War!
[03:16:04.001 --> 03:16:04.841]  Oh yeah?
[03:16:04.841 --> 03:16:06.062]  Hey, Junior!
[03:16:06.062 --> 03:16:09.363]  Put on your military drag and go fight over there!
[03:16:09.363 --> 03:16:11.884]  Well, shut your mouth!
[03:16:11.884 --> 03:16:22.488]  Anybody that supports the Ukraine War, send your money, send yourself, send your wife, send your kids, your transgenders, and go fight!
[03:16:23.643 --> 03:16:27.464]  Well, shut up!
[03:16:27.464 --> 03:16:30.884]  Not a peep about International Peace Day.
[03:16:30.884 --> 03:16:36.985]  Instead, these are the kind of headlines.
[03:16:36.985 --> 03:16:41.666]  Biden-Zelensky call for stand against Russia.
[03:16:41.666 --> 03:16:51.888]  Yeah, this is, uh, last week, Biden said, quote,
[03:16:52.526 --> 03:16:59.110]  If you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?
[03:16:59.110 --> 03:17:04.333]  Hmm.
[03:17:04.333 --> 03:17:08.696]  You mean like the United States' invasion of Iraq?
[03:17:08.696 --> 03:17:12.118]  United States' invasion of Afghanistan?
[03:17:12.118 --> 03:17:16.261]  Hey, isn't Libya beautiful now?
[03:17:16.261 --> 03:17:17.261]  Eh, about 11,000 to 15,000 people died in a flood.
[03:17:20.382 --> 03:17:22.683]  Because of the rotted dam breaking?
[03:17:22.683 --> 03:17:29.606]  But when Gaddafi was running the country, it was the richest country in Africa.
[03:17:29.606 --> 03:17:36.970]  People had more rights and benefits than all of Africa and a lot of places around the world.
[03:17:36.970 --> 03:17:47.735]  But hey, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Obama, and Hillary Clinton, and Samantha Power, POWER!
[03:17:51.227 --> 03:17:52.888]  Oh, and Susan Rice.
[03:17:52.888 --> 03:17:55.208]  Oh, not white rice.
[03:17:55.208 --> 03:17:57.048]  Different color rice.
[03:17:57.048 --> 03:18:06.710]  Again, I'm sick and tired of hearing this crap that if only women were in charge, oh, it would be so nice.
[03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:11.511]  Good and bad comes in every race, creed, and color, and gender.
[03:18:11.511 --> 03:18:12.632]  Got it?
[03:18:12.632 --> 03:18:14.012]  So save your crap.
[03:18:18.357 --> 03:18:20.377]  No word about peace.
[03:18:20.377 --> 03:18:26.519]  Oh, but Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:18:26.519 --> 03:18:28.979]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[03:18:28.979 --> 03:18:30.700]  No, Salenti.
[03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:31.940]  You have to say it properly.
[03:18:31.940 --> 03:18:34.681]  Qaddafi has to go, folks.
[03:18:34.681 --> 03:18:37.721]  He was always folking us, folks, folks, folks.
[03:18:37.721 --> 03:18:40.162]  Yep, he was the folk.
[03:18:40.162 --> 03:18:46.223]  I want that guy Assad out of there so we could steal the oil out of eastern Syria.
[03:18:49.088 --> 03:19:01.738]  Anyway, you read the headlines, you read the words that they say, and Biden says, if you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?
[03:19:01.738 --> 03:19:04.340]  Huh.
[03:19:04.340 --> 03:19:15.289]  Lavrov, the top Russian diplomat, said, wait a minute.
[03:19:15.289 --> 03:19:18.472]  If you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is any nation secure?
[03:19:19.175 --> 03:19:24.418]  How about Palestine being all carved up?
[03:19:24.418 --> 03:19:27.699]  Oh, you're doing that so Israel could be secure?
[03:19:27.699 --> 03:19:31.641]  But that's okay.
[03:19:31.641 --> 03:19:37.604]  And then Biden says, I respectfully suggest the answer is no.
[03:19:37.604 --> 03:19:46.088]  We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow.
[03:19:46.088 --> 03:19:47.809]  This is not America!
[03:19:48.593 --> 03:19:57.279]  All you little slimeballs that want to go fight aggressors overseas, pack up your crap and go there!
[03:19:57.279 --> 03:20:01.401]  I, Gerald Salenki, am an American patriot.
[03:20:01.401 --> 03:20:02.982]  You got it?
[03:20:02.982 --> 03:20:05.904]  You got it, you little slimeballs?
[03:20:05.904 --> 03:20:08.766]  I believe in people like George Washington.
[03:20:08.766 --> 03:20:10.007]  That's right.
[03:20:10.007 --> 03:20:13.569]  A real man that fought.
[03:20:13.569 --> 03:20:16.091]  Oh yeah, remember Washington crossing the Delaware?
[03:20:17.057 --> 03:20:17.718]  No, Biden.
[03:20:17.718 --> 03:20:20.479]  He didn't take a, you know, a ferry.
[03:20:20.479 --> 03:20:22.561]  He went there to fight.
[03:20:22.561 --> 03:20:24.722]  Doubt George Washington.
[03:20:24.722 --> 03:20:26.623]  Not like you, Biden.
[03:20:26.623 --> 03:20:28.805]  Five draft affirmants, Biden.
[03:20:29.662 --> 03:20:38.446]  And your fifth one you got when you said you had asthma when you were a kid, and you couldn't go to Vietnam, but you love every war.
[03:20:38.446 --> 03:20:43.708]  Oh, you said you had asthma, but you also brag what a great athlete you were.
[03:20:43.708 --> 03:20:46.729]  Oh, you were a great athlete in college, but you couldn't go fight.
[03:20:46.729 --> 03:20:55.032]  No, because you are exactly what Alex Jones said.
[03:20:55.032 --> 03:20:56.513]  We're standing up against evil.
[03:21:00.509 --> 03:21:20.828]  So going back, covering up and cutting up every place that you want, George Washington said, do not become involved in any foreign entanglements.
[03:21:20.828 --> 03:21:23.230]  This is none of our business.
[03:21:23.230 --> 03:21:25.492]  It's only our business when we are threatened.
[03:21:29.853 --> 03:21:32.415]  Well, we are going to be attacked.
[03:21:32.415 --> 03:21:35.576]  That is our only, only interest.
[03:21:35.576 --> 03:21:46.442]  Save your BS crap that you're bringing freedom and democracy to other countries, you little pieces of scum, when you're robbing from us.
[03:21:46.442 --> 03:21:48.003]  What freedom do you have?
[03:21:48.003 --> 03:21:50.125]  Get in your house!
[03:21:50.125 --> 03:21:51.385]  COVID's coming.
[03:21:51.385 --> 03:21:52.746]  COVID's coming.
[03:21:52.746 --> 03:21:55.488]  Get in your house and close your business.
[03:21:55.488 --> 03:21:56.068]  Oh, freedom?
[03:21:58.587 --> 03:22:01.988]  You spelled democracy wrong.
[03:22:01.988 --> 03:22:05.169]  D-U-H, duh.
[03:22:05.169 --> 03:22:09.870]  Mock, M-O-C-K, mock.
[03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:12.270]  R-A-C-Y, duh.
[03:22:12.270 --> 03:22:14.411]  Democracy.
[03:22:14.411 --> 03:22:24.793]  You gotta be duh stupid to think that you live in a free country when we're in control of you.
[03:22:24.793 --> 03:22:26.754]  So this is the crap that they're spreading.
[03:22:28.613 --> 03:22:31.635]  One article after another.
[03:22:31.635 --> 03:22:36.438]  Oh, Ukraine's face.
[03:22:36.438 --> 03:22:39.560]  Black Sea Fleet in Crimea.
[03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:40.781]  Great.
[03:22:40.781 --> 03:22:42.562]  Great.
[03:22:42.562 --> 03:22:45.264]  Ukraine has lost this war.
[03:22:45.264 --> 03:22:48.326]  You go back to your trends journal.
[03:22:48.326 --> 03:22:57.272]  When the war began on 24 February 2022, we said ain't no way no how that
[03:22:59.156 --> 03:23:02.938]  Ukraine's going to defeat Russia.
[03:23:02.938 --> 03:23:23.831]  This is the Russia that the Germans killed 25 million plus during World War II in Operation Barbarossa.
[03:23:23.831 --> 03:23:24.612]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:23:25.518 --> 03:23:28.879]  How about a guy they assassinated because he wanted peace?
[03:23:28.879 --> 03:23:31.660]  John F. Kennedy.
[03:23:31.660 --> 03:23:40.903]  Listen to his speech at Washington University in June of 1963.
[03:23:40.903 --> 03:23:44.284]  Five months before they jacked you dead when they killed him.
[03:23:44.284 --> 03:23:47.025]  All about peace.
[03:23:47.025 --> 03:23:50.266]  And he goes on to say that we should not hate the people in the Soviet Union.
[03:23:53.194 --> 03:24:00.455]  You see, these people are very advanced scientifically, culturally, philosophically.
[03:24:00.455 --> 03:24:10.377]  And over 20 million of them were killed by the Russians, by the Germans.
[03:24:10.377 --> 03:24:14.178]  They suffered more than any other nation.
[03:24:14.178 --> 03:24:20.439]  Their land, their farms, their homes, their factories were destroyed.
[03:24:20.439 --> 03:24:20.779]  Kennedy.
[03:24:22.435 --> 03:24:26.556]  From Chicago East.
[03:24:26.556 --> 03:24:30.077]  You think Ukraine's gonna beat him?
[03:24:30.077 --> 03:24:32.197]  What are you, kidding me?
[03:24:32.197 --> 03:24:48.380]  Kennedy also warns that if we go to war with the Soviet Union, which is now Russia, in a nuclear exchange, life on Earth will be eliminated in 24 hours.
[03:24:48.380 --> 03:24:52.321]  And the destruction will last for many generations.
[03:25:03.086 --> 03:25:09.811]  Biden urges global unity and sticking up for Ukraine.
[03:25:09.811 --> 03:25:31.225]  And then the guy that's the president of Ukraine, the prime minister's president, Zelensky, whose former role was a comedian in a sitcom that played the piano with his penis, said, war crimes must be punished.
[03:25:33.151 --> 03:25:45.815]  Deported people must come home and the occupier must return to their own land.
[03:25:45.815 --> 03:25:47.955]  Huh.
[03:25:47.955 --> 03:25:50.156]  War crimes must be punished.
[03:25:50.156 --> 03:25:59.779]  So when am I going to see little Georgie Bush punished for taking us into the, lying us into the Iraq War?
[03:25:59.779 --> 03:26:02.900]  Why am I going to, when am I going to see little Georgie Bush punished?
[03:26:06.531 --> 03:26:09.752]  Or bring us into the Afghan war?
[03:26:09.752 --> 03:26:13.293]  How about those war crimes, Zelensky?
[03:26:13.293 --> 03:26:15.414]  How about those war crimes?
[03:26:15.414 --> 03:26:20.256]  Oh, and by the way, how about the Ukrainian war crimes?
[03:26:20.256 --> 03:26:21.876]  That's right.
[03:26:21.876 --> 03:26:26.317]  The Ukrainian war crimes, when you kill some 15,000 people,
[03:26:28.544 --> 03:26:37.331]  In the Donbass region, they're all Russian-speaking people, and Ukraine was part of Russia in and out for 300 years.
[03:26:37.331 --> 03:26:54.523]  But when the United States launched the coup in 2014, and the people didn't buy it in the Donbass region, the Ukraine government said, let's kill them.
[03:26:54.523 --> 03:26:57.886]  Oh, and look at that little clip on InfoWars.
[03:26:59.141 --> 03:27:00.662]  Yeah.
[03:27:00.662 --> 03:27:07.207]  About how up in Canada they're praising the Nazi Ukrainians, huh?
[03:27:07.207 --> 03:27:08.448]  Yeah.
[03:27:08.448 --> 03:27:11.130]  Praising the Nazis up in Canada.
[03:27:11.130 --> 03:27:11.630]  That's right.
[03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:13.852]  It's there for everybody to watch, listen to.
[03:27:13.852 --> 03:27:18.655]  It's not misinformation, not a conspiracy theory.
[03:27:18.655 --> 03:27:26.561]  Oh, and by the way, read about how we've been writing in the Trends Journal about how Putin is saying
[03:27:27.267 --> 03:27:31.469]  We're fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
[03:27:31.469 --> 03:27:33.351]  The facts are right there.
[03:27:33.351 --> 03:27:36.072]  Oh, and did you hear little Trudeau?
[03:27:36.072 --> 03:27:41.155]  A little arrogant boy that talks so tough, but can.
[03:27:41.155 --> 03:27:44.777]  Wants to do everything to support Ukraine, but go over there and fight little Trudeau.
[03:27:44.777 --> 03:27:47.038]  Can't understand why your wife left you.
[03:27:47.038 --> 03:27:49.720]  I watched her talk and I figured it out.
[03:27:49.720 --> 03:27:53.182]  Because anybody with a brain couldn't stand a little slimer like you.
[03:27:54.133 --> 03:27:56.174]  And I'll call you that to your face.
[03:27:56.174 --> 03:27:58.436]  You little warmongering nothing of a boy.
[03:27:58.436 --> 03:28:00.077]  Oh, what do you mean, nothing of a boy?
[03:28:00.077 --> 03:28:01.798]  Don't you know who my daddy was?
[03:28:01.798 --> 03:28:04.600]  My daddy was Piazzadope.
[03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:07.482]  Just like little Georgie Bush, a little nothing of a clown.
[03:28:07.482 --> 03:28:08.963]  Don't you know who my daddy was?
[03:28:08.963 --> 03:28:13.546]  Don't you know my granddaddy, Prescott Bush?
[03:28:13.546 --> 03:28:18.329]  George Collins said it, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:28:18.329 --> 03:28:23.713]  And we on the Infowars team are the one big club that ain't in it.
[03:28:25.382 --> 03:28:29.966]  And it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority.
[03:28:29.966 --> 03:28:36.291]  Keen on setting breastfires of freedom in the minds of men, said Samuel Adams, and we are them.

[03:30:05.553 --> 03:30:15.980]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[03:30:17.341 --> 03:30:22.186]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[03:33:22.102 --> 03:33:34.668]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:34.668 --> 03:33:43.392]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show, and again, do everything you can to support InfoWars, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.

[03:33:49.676 --> 03:33:52.817]  You help yourself and you're helping InfoWars.
[03:33:52.817 --> 03:34:01.778]  You know, when the COVID war broke out, you know, we were the first magazine, by the way, to say, you know.
[03:34:01.778 --> 03:34:10.460]  It began on January 2020, the celebration of Chinese Lunar New Year, the Year of the Rat.
[03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:13.460]  That's when the Chinese launched it.
[03:34:13.460 --> 03:34:17.221]  Two weeks later, the cover of our magazine was Coronavirus, 106 dead in China.
[03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:23.552]  The next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:34:23.552 --> 03:34:27.174]  What do you tell me this one?
[03:34:27.174 --> 03:34:34.398]  So what I'm saying is that we're bringing you what nobody else is bringing you.
[03:34:34.398 --> 03:34:38.680]  All they're bringing you is lie, hate, fear and hysteria.
[03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:42.703]  That's the way that they make money in the mainstream media.
[03:34:42.703 --> 03:34:44.704]  We're bringing you facts and information.
[03:34:46.448 --> 03:34:57.214]  And by the way, if you want to subscribe to the Trends Journal, you go to jonestrends.com and you get a great deal.
[03:34:57.214 --> 03:35:03.877]  And by the way, it's only $2.86 a week, but you go to jonestrends.com and it's even a lot less.
[03:35:03.877 --> 03:35:13.142]  So again, we had forecast back in June.
[03:35:14.653 --> 03:35:20.416]  That the markets would go down in April and October.
[03:35:20.416 --> 03:35:23.637]  Excuse me, in September and October.
[03:35:23.637 --> 03:35:25.078]  So here we are.
[03:35:25.078 --> 03:35:28.960]  The markets are down again today.
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:30.241]  And they're down all across.
[03:35:30.241 --> 03:35:36.484]  They're down in, you know, and they're really getting hit in, you know, in Hang Seng.
[03:35:36.484 --> 03:35:38.204]  China's finished.
[03:35:38.204 --> 03:35:39.405]  They launched the COVID war.
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:45.784]  The 21st century was going to be the Chinese century before they launched this thing.
[03:35:45.784 --> 03:35:49.848]  And then three years of zero COVID policy, they destroyed their economy.
[03:35:49.848 --> 03:35:53.151]  And the economy's been destroyed around the world.
[03:35:53.151 --> 03:35:54.832]  No one talks about it.
[03:35:54.832 --> 03:35:58.095]  We do, and we give you the facts.
[03:35:58.095 --> 03:36:02.499]  So going back to the economy, let's go back to the COVID war.
[03:36:06.056 --> 03:36:06.756]  Stay home.
[03:36:06.756 --> 03:36:07.977]  Close down your business.
[03:36:07.977 --> 03:36:08.637]  Here's money.
[03:36:08.637 --> 03:36:09.398]  Don't worry about it.
[03:36:09.398 --> 03:36:10.698]  It's going to your bank account.
[03:36:10.698 --> 03:36:12.319]  Here you go.
[03:36:12.319 --> 03:36:13.440]  Trillions of dollars.
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:15.281]  Trillions of dollars dumped in.
[03:36:15.281 --> 03:36:18.502]  Zero interest rate policy.
[03:36:18.502 --> 03:36:19.483]  Yeah, I don't want to go to work.
[03:36:19.483 --> 03:36:20.443]  I got all this free money.
[03:36:20.443 --> 03:36:21.544]  Yeah.
[03:36:21.544 --> 03:36:23.285]  So what happened?
[03:36:23.285 --> 03:36:25.566]  Money's flowing into the banks.
[03:36:25.566 --> 03:36:28.147]  So now the bank's got all this dough, right?
[03:36:28.147 --> 03:36:30.148]  What do they do with the dough?
[03:36:30.148 --> 03:36:32.569]  They bought treasuries.
[03:36:32.569 --> 03:36:35.431]  They bought treasuries when interest rates were at zero.
[03:36:36.724 --> 03:36:41.387]  So the treasuries were worth like zero.
[03:36:41.387 --> 03:36:46.551]  Fast forward.
[03:36:46.551 --> 03:36:47.551]  Treasury yields?
[03:36:47.551 --> 03:36:51.254]  Why should I invest in the stock market?
[03:36:51.254 --> 03:36:57.378]  I go to money market funds, I go to treasuries, I almost get 5% on my money.
[03:36:57.378 --> 03:36:59.119]  But wait a minute.
[03:36:59.119 --> 03:37:01.321]  The banks had all that money
[03:37:02.130 --> 03:37:10.274]  And now they're in a losing game because they bought all this stuff when interest rates were near zero.
[03:37:10.274 --> 03:37:14.175]  Now let's put it together.
[03:37:14.175 --> 03:37:30.382]  Before I put it together, we're telling you the greatest economic calamity in modern history is about to occur.
[03:37:30.382 --> 03:37:31.363]  The debt levels
[03:37:32.475 --> 03:37:39.056]  That have been built up as a result of the COVID war.
[03:37:39.056 --> 03:37:44.597]  It's like in the $305 trillion mark.
[03:37:44.597 --> 03:37:47.898]  Globally.
[03:37:47.898 --> 03:37:57.100]  And by the way, we have a great article coming out in the Trends Journal this week that comes out tomorrow by Gregory Manorino talking about this as well.
[03:37:57.100 --> 03:37:58.560]  Now let's put it all back together.
[03:38:01.314 --> 03:38:03.576]  The office building bust.
[03:38:03.576 --> 03:38:08.119]  We're the only ones that forecast this over three years ago.
[03:38:08.119 --> 03:38:10.041]  People are working from home.
[03:38:10.041 --> 03:38:13.464]  They don't want to commute.
[03:38:13.464 --> 03:38:17.187]  People that are renting all this office space, I don't need all this office space.
[03:38:17.187 --> 03:38:18.188]  Stay home.
[03:38:18.188 --> 03:38:20.710]  Come back three days a week.
[03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:26.094]  Your office occupancy rate, according to Castle Systems with a K, is around 47%.
[03:38:26.094 --> 03:38:26.514]  That's right.
[03:38:31.661 --> 03:38:35.603]  53% of the people aren't going back into the offices.
[03:38:35.603 --> 03:38:39.706]  Now, the people that are renting the office are saying, I don't need this place.
[03:38:39.706 --> 03:38:40.927]  My lease is up.
[03:38:40.927 --> 03:38:46.591]  Give me two floors instead of 12.
[03:38:46.591 --> 03:38:51.874]  Now, the people that own the office buildings, how are they going to pay their loans?
[03:38:51.874 --> 03:38:55.097]  Oh, those loans that are floating loans?
[03:38:55.097 --> 03:38:59.880]  That are going to cost them a lot more now to renew their loans because interest rates are so high?
[03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:14.945]  You and now the banks don't have the money to cover this because as I put this whole thing together, tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here and where we're going.
[03:39:14.945 --> 03:39:19.587]  And our system is global nomic, making connections between different fields.
[03:39:19.587 --> 03:39:23.589]  Opportunity misses those who view the world through the eyes of their profession.
[03:39:23.589 --> 03:39:26.830]  We look at everything.
[03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:31.552]  So now they got all these worthless bonds that they bought, these treasuries.
[03:39:33.049 --> 03:39:35.051]  That they're losing money on.
[03:39:35.051 --> 03:39:42.356]  Now they're not getting money coming in, the banks.
[03:39:42.356 --> 03:39:53.185]  When these loans are due on these commercial offices, and other commercial real estate, what's going to happen?
[03:39:53.185 --> 03:39:56.848]  Again, you are going to see a banking bust the likes of which we've never seen.
[03:40:02.691 --> 03:40:09.854]  But don't worry, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:40:09.854 --> 03:40:11.354]  What is Biden talking about?
[03:40:11.354 --> 03:40:16.536]  Sending another $24 billion of our money to Ukraine?
[03:40:16.536 --> 03:40:19.657]  Yesterday, I went filling up my car with gas.
[03:40:19.657 --> 03:40:22.819]  You know, I remember back when I was a kid, they used to have people pumping gas.
[03:40:22.819 --> 03:40:26.280]  It was great.
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:31.182]  Anyway, and I see this couple, the woman was nicely dressed, the guy so-so.
[03:40:32.773 --> 03:40:33.694]  A little younger than me.
[03:40:33.694 --> 03:40:37.195]  Maybe about 10 years younger, I guess.
[03:40:37.195 --> 03:40:38.196]  You know what they were doing?
[03:40:38.196 --> 03:40:40.777]  It was at the QuickCheck, the big place.
[03:40:40.777 --> 03:40:46.921]  They were going through all the garbage cans looking for bottles so they could get deposit money.
[03:40:46.921 --> 03:40:50.523]  Yeah.
[03:40:50.523 --> 03:40:56.906]  That's the America we live in today.
[03:40:56.906 --> 03:41:01.749]  One of the reasons why Trump won, there were three things he promised.
[03:41:02.298 --> 03:41:07.022]  Build a wall, tax cuts, and rebuild the infrastructure.
[03:41:07.022 --> 03:41:08.403]  He only did the tax cuts.
[03:41:08.403 --> 03:41:10.565]  And I know, I didn't build the wall, blah, blah, blah.
[03:41:10.565 --> 03:41:12.327]  It didn't happen.
[03:41:12.327 --> 03:41:20.293]  Anybody running today, in any country, this immigration crisis is big time.
[03:41:20.293 --> 03:41:22.976]  That should be the number one stand.
[03:41:22.976 --> 03:41:26.679]  How about America for the Americans?
[03:41:26.679 --> 03:41:28.981]  But, put the whole picture together.
[03:41:29.677 --> 03:41:34.359]  Why are the people leaving their countries in droves like this?
[03:41:34.359 --> 03:41:38.680]  One reason, because of all the wars America and its allies started.
[03:41:38.680 --> 03:41:41.461]  Number two, the corruption.
[03:41:41.461 --> 03:41:44.382]  Government corruption around the world.
[03:41:44.382 --> 03:41:49.524]  Poverty, violence, and crime.
[03:41:49.524 --> 03:41:52.665]  This is the new world order.
[03:41:52.665 --> 03:41:55.366]  We are living in evil times.
[03:41:55.366 --> 03:41:56.406]  We have to reverse this.
[03:41:57.623 --> 03:42:02.807]  And to me, the only way that we'll reverse it is the Renaissance.
[03:42:02.807 --> 03:42:11.974]  And you can see how low we've gone when you see a slob like Fetterman showing up and looking like a jerk.
[03:42:11.974 --> 03:42:13.775]  But you know what?
[03:42:13.775 --> 03:42:18.338]  He represents the slobbing down of America.
[03:42:18.338 --> 03:42:21.420]  I say bring back dignity and grace.
[03:42:21.420 --> 03:42:24.843]  No, no, Fetterman says bring back slob and disgusting.
[03:42:26.206 --> 03:42:28.508]  Vote the way you want, folks.
[03:42:28.508 --> 03:42:30.549]  Yep.
[03:42:30.549 --> 03:42:32.870]  Vote the way you want.
[03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:34.912]  We need a higher level.
[03:42:34.912 --> 03:42:37.213]  And the higher levels are the level above.
[03:42:37.213 --> 03:42:45.339]  Because I, Gerald Solenti, am a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:42:45.339 --> 03:42:46.720]  Occupypeace.com.
[03:42:46.720 --> 03:42:48.621]  Donate what you can.

[03:43:01.377 --> 03:43:08.019]  I tell you, as I travel back to Austin, Texas right now to be back in the studio, I'm listening to Gerald Cemente and he's, he on fire.
[03:43:08.019 --> 03:43:11.239]  So I wanted to just send this little message to say, Gerald, we love you.
[03:43:11.239 --> 03:43:12.900]  You're a real American.
[03:43:12.900 --> 03:43:21.862]  And the way you point out that, you know, George Washington led from the front and he fought a war that the biggest empire in the world had started.
[03:43:21.862 --> 03:43:26.843]  And he was the underdog for six years and lost almost every battle, but he persevered.
[03:43:28.161 --> 03:43:34.523]  And he got that one victory at Trenton after going across the Delaware and a bunch of his troops froze to death.
[03:43:34.523 --> 03:43:43.425]  And then the British and German soldiers were shooting at him, the Hessian soldiers, the Prussian soldiers, literally at 50 yards away, thousands of them.
[03:43:43.425 --> 03:43:48.247]  And they said it was like he was magically divinely protected, call it what you want, luck, whatever.
[03:43:48.247 --> 03:43:52.588]  They were all shooting at him and they couldn't hit him as he led the troops in for the main assault.
[03:43:53.348 --> 03:43:57.462]  But you know what, whether you believe in God or not, the point is, fortune favors the bold.
[03:43:57.462 --> 03:43:59.208]  That's the British Special Forces motto.
[03:44:00.578 --> 03:44:02.839]  And I just want to point out what Gerald says is so central.
[03:44:02.839 --> 03:44:09.201]  The chicken hawks that all got draft deferments in Vietnam and you name it are the ones that tell us how great war is all day.
[03:44:09.201 --> 03:44:12.022]  And Sean Penn saying nuclear war is a good thing.
[03:44:12.022 --> 03:44:13.322]  Why are we scared of it?
[03:44:13.322 --> 03:44:15.123]  These are psychotic nuts.
[03:44:15.123 --> 03:44:20.905]  And what the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says on Saturday at the U.N.
[03:44:20.905 --> 03:44:21.565]  is so central.
[03:44:21.565 --> 03:44:24.166]  I covered this big this week.
[03:44:24.166 --> 03:44:25.207]  The clips are on Bandai Video.
[03:44:25.207 --> 03:44:26.607]  You've got to go watch it.
[03:44:26.607 --> 03:44:27.668]  It's just true.
[03:44:27.668 --> 03:44:28.128]  It's just true.
[03:44:29.088 --> 03:44:34.373]  He said the West has lost its survival instinct.
[03:44:34.373 --> 03:44:37.896]  It's lost its feeling that it can be destroyed.
[03:44:37.896 --> 03:44:42.640]  It's lost any capacity to realize that self-preservation is important.
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:44.702]  Because that's what this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:44.702 --> 03:44:46.643]  The Russian submarines are off the east and west coast.
[03:44:46.643 --> 03:44:48.004]  They're in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:44:48.004 --> 03:44:49.406]  One submarine.
[03:44:49.406 --> 03:44:51.507]  It's got 24 cruise missiles and a bunch of other
[03:44:52.328 --> 03:44:52.668]  I think?
[03:45:11.343 --> 03:45:13.103]  Or even the psychotic Clinton.
[03:45:13.103 --> 03:45:14.264]  Or even Obama.
[03:45:14.264 --> 03:45:16.864]  But now they have no sense of danger.
[03:45:16.864 --> 03:45:18.885]  No sense of what they're playing with.
[03:45:18.885 --> 03:45:20.825]  Because they have this normalcy bias.
[03:45:20.825 --> 03:45:23.926]  Because none of them were ever generals or military leaders.
[03:45:23.926 --> 03:45:25.246]  And I'm not lionizing them.
[03:45:25.246 --> 03:45:27.206]  But at least they know how dangerous war is.
[03:45:27.206 --> 03:45:29.207]  All the real military analysts say back off.
[03:45:29.207 --> 03:45:29.707]  It's dangerous.
[03:45:29.707 --> 03:45:31.247]  Like Colonel McGregor.
[03:45:31.247 --> 03:45:32.027]  And countless others.
[03:45:32.027 --> 03:45:34.088]  But all the little chicken hawks.
[03:45:34.088 --> 03:45:35.568]  All the little cowards.
[03:45:35.568 --> 03:45:36.948]  They've never even been in a fight.
[03:45:36.948 --> 03:45:38.489]  Never even beat somebody's brains out.
[03:45:39.449 --> 03:45:56.724]  They think that because I mean let me tell you I don't claim to be the toughest guy around but I grew up in Dallas got a lot of fights very rough situation and I learned no matter how tough I was man there's always gonna run to somebody that if they start a fight with you you might as well back down because this may even be a little guy he is about to beat the living hell out of you
[03:45:57.745 --> 03:46:01.747]  I'll tell a quick story and hand it back to Gerald and we'll skip the next break so I don't steal his time.
[03:46:01.747 --> 03:46:08.671]  But I had a guy when I was 15 start a fight with me at the movies.
[03:46:11.048 --> 03:46:20.133]  I, he punched me, I punched him, broke his nose, he had to have nose surgery, rammed his head in the wall, because he started kicking my ass, so I got mad.
[03:46:20.133 --> 03:46:33.279]  And about a year later, I'm walking down the street, and a pickup truck pulls over, and just another small black guy, smaller than I was, you know, he wasn't little, but he wasn't a huge guy, gets out, he says, you Alex Jones?
[03:46:33.279 --> 03:46:34.900]  And I said, yeah.
[03:46:34.900 --> 03:46:35.821]  And he came up and
[03:46:36.701 --> 03:46:36.881]  Yeah.
[03:46:51.857 --> 03:46:53.277]  There's a lot of badasses out there.
[03:46:53.277 --> 03:46:57.918]  No matter how tough you are, no matter how many punches you can take, because that's my gift, is I can take a lot of punches, a lot of damage.
[03:46:57.918 --> 03:46:58.919]  It doesn't matter.
[03:46:58.919 --> 03:47:01.499]  There's people so fast and so mean, you don't even have an idea.
[03:47:01.499 --> 03:47:04.040]  There's always somebody tougher on any given day.
[03:47:04.040 --> 03:47:06.120]  And we're dealing with nuclear weapons and the Russians here.
[03:47:06.120 --> 03:47:07.660]  So I didn't tell a fighting story to act tough.
[03:47:07.660 --> 03:47:14.362]  I told a story about being humble and realizing that the smartest thing to do is not get in a fight.
[03:47:15.765 --> 03:47:20.991]  And instead, these globalists, with their little, little dick syndrome, are starting World War III, and it's so dangerous.
[03:47:20.991 --> 03:47:21.952]  We love Gerald Celente.
[03:47:21.952 --> 03:47:23.253]  We love the audience.
[03:47:23.253 --> 03:47:25.536]  He's making incredibly powerful points.
[03:47:25.536 --> 03:47:32.144]  And the good news is, it's now admitted by Sy Hirst and others, not that we even need him to tell us, that the Ukrainian Nazis have lost the war.
[03:47:32.144 --> 03:47:33.085]  They are Nazis.
[03:47:33.085 --> 03:47:34.746]  They tried to mainline this with Nazis.
[03:47:35.367 --> 03:47:36.127]  Hello there, you Awakening Wonders!
[03:47:36.127 --> 03:47:38.148]  Thanks for joining me on Stay Free with Russell Brand on Rumble.
[03:47:38.148 --> 03:47:43.191]  If you're watching this on YouTube or anywhere else, eventually you're going to have to click the link in the description and join us over in Rumble.
[03:47:43.191 --> 03:47:45.872]  And if you can become a supporter, it's the only way that you can back
[03:48:04.640 --> 03:48:09.605]  Our independent voice at a time where it's obviously being challenged.
[03:48:09.605 --> 03:48:11.247]  We've got a great show for you today.
[03:48:11.247 --> 03:48:12.288]  In our item, here's the news.
[03:48:12.288 --> 03:48:14.050]  No, here's the effing news.
[03:48:14.050 --> 03:48:21.337]  We are going to be talking about the state and the legacy media's war on free speech and in particular how that has affected me this week.
[03:48:21.337 --> 03:48:26.082]  We've also got Jimmy Dore coming up on the show and you know what Jimmy Dore will be advocating for.
[03:48:26.682 --> 03:48:39.687]  Revolution, mass disobedience, new alliances between ordinary people, putting aside the barriers and boundaries of left and right, that we can come together to oppose increasingly authoritarian centralised power.
[03:48:39.687 --> 03:48:42.728]  We're going to continue to do on this channel what we've always done.
[03:48:42.728 --> 03:48:45.589]  Tell you the truth as best we can.
[03:48:45.589 --> 03:48:48.050]  Listen to you as best we can.
[03:48:48.050 --> 03:48:51.231]  So the first story we're going to talk about is Stoltenberg acknowledging that
[03:48:51.431 --> 03:48:55.995]  Putin invaded Ukraine due to NATO infringement.
[03:48:55.995 --> 03:49:07.584]  A significant story because of course what we've mostly been schooled in is that Russia are a criminal nation led by a lunatic in Putin that unprovoked attacked Ukraine.
[03:49:07.584 --> 03:49:16.611]  As we always say, the Ukrainian people should be utmost in our thoughts and the humanitarian imperatives that the world claims are what's driving this war
[03:49:17.211 --> 03:49:20.454]  Ought be what's driving a move towards peace.
[03:49:20.454 --> 03:49:30.264]  But as you know, the military-industrial complex are significantly invested in what some people, Jimmy Dore notably, regard as a money laundering operation.
[03:49:30.264 --> 03:49:35.689]  Let's have a look at Stoltenberg acknowledging the simple truth that Putin was provoked.
[03:49:36.687 --> 03:49:48.630]  President Putin declared in the autumn of 2021, and he actually sent a draft treaty that he wanted NATO to sign, to promise no more NATO enlargement.
[03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:50.990]  That was what he sent us.
[03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:56.872]  And that was a precondition for not invade Ukraine.
[03:49:56.872 --> 03:49:57.912]  Of course we didn't sign that.
[03:49:58.852 --> 03:50:00.613]  The opposite happened.
[03:50:00.613 --> 03:50:04.414]  He wanted us to sign a promise never to enlarge NATO.
[03:50:04.414 --> 03:50:15.077]  He wanted us to remove our military infrastructure in all Allies that have joined NATO since 1997, meaning half of NATO, all the Central and Eastern Europe.
[03:50:15.077 --> 03:50:19.658]  We should remove NATO from that part of our alliance.
[03:50:19.658 --> 03:50:24.360]  Introducing some kind of E and B, a second class membership.
[03:50:24.360 --> 03:50:25.140]  We rejected that.
[03:50:26.027 --> 03:50:31.531]  So he went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, across his borders.
[03:50:31.531 --> 03:50:33.793]  He has got the exact opposite.
[03:50:33.793 --> 03:50:40.017]  In a sense, what's being described there is the recipe for a peaceful resolution to this conflict, which many believe.
[03:50:40.017 --> 03:50:41.938]  And let me know what you think in the chat.
[03:50:41.938 --> 03:50:46.722]  And remember, if you press the red Awaken button, you can join our community, and it's more important that you do that.
[03:50:47.142 --> 03:50:52.344]  Jesse Stoltenberg asserted today that weakening Russia in Ukraine could allow the United States to intensify its efforts in countering China.
[03:51:13.852 --> 03:51:22.956]  Stoltenberg and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley believe the war in Ukraine will continue for years if Kiev is to achieve its military goals.
[03:51:22.956 --> 03:51:27.298]  Stoltenberg said we must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine.
[03:51:27.298 --> 03:51:29.439]  Who would benefit from a long war in Ukraine?
[03:51:29.439 --> 03:51:31.360]  Would it be the Ukrainian people or would it be
[03:51:32.020 --> 03:51:33.281]  The Military-Industrial Complex.
[03:51:33.281 --> 03:51:35.262]  Why don't you let us know in the chat what you think.
[03:51:35.262 --> 03:51:48.530]  President Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday and announced the new tranche of US military aid for Ukraine that includes more cluster bombs which are notorious for killing and maiming civilians.
[03:51:48.530 --> 03:51:57.635]  It seems that there's an absolute amorality when it comes to the approach of this war, when it comes to telling stories about this war, when it comes to dissenting against this war,
[03:51:57.915 --> 03:52:00.195]  When it comes to advocating for peace.
[03:52:00.195 --> 03:52:04.276]  When it comes to looking at what conditions may have led to this war.
[03:52:04.276 --> 03:52:06.497]  In a minute, we're going to have our presentation, Here's the News.
[03:52:06.497 --> 03:52:18.899]  No, Here's the Effing News, where I'm going to be talking about how the state, legacy media, and big tech cooperate with one another in order to control narratives that are plainly against the interests of ordinary people.
[03:52:18.899 --> 03:52:25.360]  How they prevent us from becoming united around topics as diverse as the pandemic, and indeed, this ongoing conflict.
[03:52:25.820 --> 03:52:35.926]  And also how the same PSYOPS units that used to be engaged in opposition against ISIS are now being deployed against domestic populations.
[03:52:35.926 --> 03:52:38.128]  We'll be talking about that in a matter of moments.
[03:52:38.128 --> 03:52:40.309]  Also we'll be talking to Jimmy Dore.
[03:52:40.309 --> 03:52:49.355]  But I think it's important that we cover these vital issues that appear to have considerable opposition from the mainstream legacy media.
[03:52:49.355 --> 03:52:50.996]  We're talking about what we've always talked about.
[03:52:51.556 --> 03:52:56.480]  Big Pharma and their ability to assert and exert power over political process.
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:53:07.889]  The military-industrial complex that seem to be able to control foreign policy, to generate, create war, and then find convenient excuses for why that war might be taking place.
[03:53:07.889 --> 03:53:15.095]  Most of all what we're advocating for is our shared collective voices and our ability to independently communicate with one another.
[03:53:15.475 --> 03:53:19.156]  For the possibility that we might create new systems together.
[03:53:19.156 --> 03:53:32.081]  If we don't have the ability to control currency, if we don't have the ability to create independent media, then we are slowly being corralled into a totalitarian space, where nobody has any individual power.
[03:53:32.081 --> 03:53:43.725]  We already live in a globalist, corporatist condition, where unelected bodies, whether that's NATO, no one voted for them, the WHO, no one voted for them, or the UN, are in a position
[03:53:44.025 --> 03:53:48.126]  Where they are able to impose policy on sovereign nations.
[03:53:48.126 --> 03:53:50.167]  Democracy is becoming meaningless.
[03:53:50.167 --> 03:54:02.411]  And the only reason those stories are not being told is because legacy media are in lockstep with one another in order to prevent truthful, open and honest conversations happening that would allow us to form new alliances.
[03:54:02.411 --> 03:54:04.432]  We'll be looking at that in Here's the News.
[03:54:04.432 --> 03:54:11.614]  But now, without going too much more deeply into this obvious crisis and counter-narrative to how the war between Ukraine and Russia began,
[03:54:11.934 --> 03:54:17.437]  Let's have a look at the Empire State Building being lit up as a giant Pfizer needle.
[03:54:17.437 --> 03:54:19.719]  For what reason, exactly?
[03:54:19.719 --> 03:54:21.440]  This is a press release about that story.
[03:54:21.440 --> 03:54:30.745]  Today, the Empire State Building turned its iconic building blue to announce that the CDC recommends everyone six months of age and older gets this season's updated COVID-19 shot.
[03:54:30.745 --> 03:54:38.510]  The blue light symbolizes our gratitude and appreciation for the updated vaccines and all those who made it possible.
[03:54:39.190 --> 03:54:46.976]  A literal monolith and icon of American culture is being turned into an advertisement for a private company.
[03:54:46.976 --> 03:54:51.539]  When did the symbols of a great nation become co-opted by a corporation?
[03:54:51.539 --> 03:54:56.022]  How has this been allowed to happen and how is it still allowed to be referred to as a democracy?
[03:54:56.022 --> 03:54:56.763]  Let me know in the chat.
[03:54:57.023 --> 03:55:06.170]  Marty Makary, Professor Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Post that Pfizer's version of the new vaccine has not been tested on humans at all.
[03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:10.213]  We only have data about antibody production from 10 mice.
[03:55:10.213 --> 03:55:13.255]  If I wasn't reading that from a reliable scientist myself...
[03:55:13.675 --> 03:55:15.616]  I would assume that it was untrue.
[03:55:15.616 --> 03:55:26.643]  How is that plausible and feasible that a national cause, an international notion, can be presented to a global population on the basis of ten mice?
[03:55:26.643 --> 03:55:31.886]  The experience of ten mice is being used to undergird an ongoing global program.
[03:55:31.886 --> 03:55:33.748]  For me, that's a cause for some concern.
[03:55:34.628 --> 03:55:40.790]  In summer 2020, as Covid vaccines moved ahead at warp speed, the companies behind them promised they wouldn't make too much money.
[03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:42.730]  Let's see how that went.
[03:55:42.730 --> 03:55:45.371]  Pfizer chairman Albert Baller was emphatic.
[03:55:45.371 --> 03:55:51.752]  His company was developing a Covid vaccine for the good of humanity, not for money, he told Time Magazine in 2020.
[03:55:51.752 --> 03:55:53.493]  This is not business as usually said.
[03:55:54.133 --> 03:55:57.576]  If you were calculating return on investment, we would never do these things.
[03:55:57.576 --> 03:56:04.961]  We were discussing that back in March, what that means to human lives, to the economy of the world, so it must be that we take those measures.
[03:56:04.961 --> 03:56:11.105]  Thus, Pfizer would not overcharge for the mRNA vaccine it was developing with the German company BioNTech, Baller said.
[03:56:11.105 --> 03:56:14.828]  We're going to charge governments a very, very nominal value, he said.
[03:56:14.828 --> 03:56:20.172]  Asked directly if Pfizer intended to profit, Baller said, we will make a very, very marginal profit at this stage.
[03:56:20.172 --> 03:56:21.613]  So, were Pfizer telling the truth?
[03:56:22.273 --> 03:56:28.455]  Pfizer made more than a hundred billion dollars in profits from the Covid vaccine in 2022 alone.
[03:56:28.455 --> 03:56:31.336]  Those facts seem to me to be significant.
[03:56:31.336 --> 03:56:37.459]  Those facts seem to me worthy of discussion and I don't think we're going to see that discussed on the mainstream media.
[03:56:37.459 --> 03:56:48.563]  Let me know in the chat if you've noticed how the mainstream media reports on certain stories investigating them extremely thoroughly and elsewhere there is little or no debate or dissent.
[03:56:48.563 --> 03:56:49.523]  What do you think about that?
[03:56:49.523 --> 03:56:50.864]  What do you think is actually happening?
[03:56:51.664 --> 03:57:13.017]  Whether it's the war in Ukraine and NATO's involvement in provoking it, or Pfizer's relationship with the United States of America and their ability to co-opt national symbols of pride and turn them into corporate emblems that have only been, let's face it, tested on 10 mice, it seems that the state and the media have a pretty close relationship.
[03:57:13.017 --> 03:57:19.962]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[03:57:19.962 --> 03:57:20.382]  Do that,
[03:57:22.216 --> 03:57:25.050]  And you'll earn your way to the next level.
