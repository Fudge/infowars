[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.680]  It's Monday, September 25th, 2023, I'm your host Alex Jones, and this is going to be the
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.160]  most jam-packed broadcast ever.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.400]  The quickening is here, the political planets have aligned for the good, the bad, and the
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.400]  ugly.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.880]  We're in a time of increased insanity, a singularity of corruption, so let me boil down what's coming
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.960]  up in this first hour, in this short first segment, and then we'll break down each one
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.640]  of these subjects that all tie together coming up after this first break.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.740]  Obviously, the big story, because it's so illustrative of the truth and how the public
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.260]  has been put into a trance, and that real Nazis are hiding in plain view, while the same
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.180]  globalist establishment labels anybody that doesn't accept the WEF and the New World Order's
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.920]  real fascist policies as Nazis.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.300]  You have an SS soldier of the Waffen SS, the armed Nazi special forces of special
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:22.500]  forces, whose jobs in occupied countries was to carry out torture, execution, extermination,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.560]  creating a standing ovation with Trudeau and Zelensky, who brought him there to the event,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.000]  and you've got the parliament members that are so historically ignorant, they don't
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.520]  know when they say, and this hero, who fought against the Russians in World War
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.220]  II in Ukraine, well, the people that fought against the Russians in Ukraine in World
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.800]  War II were the Nazis, Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis, and it's their great-grandsons
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.440]  and grandsons that are the main fighting force today, and who have an actual Nazi symbol
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.140]  on their official uniforms, and most of them have Waffen SS twin lightning bolt tattoos
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.000]  and swastikas, and they do the Hitler blood and soil rituals.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.160]  If you know World War II history, like I do, I'm quite the buff on it, it's just
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.680]  blaringly obvious, but it's like if you know a language and somebody else doesn't,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840]  like if you know what Crip and Blood or MS-13 gang signs are, and you see it tattooed on
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.680]  somebody, you know they're a former prisoner, an ex-con, but for somebody that doesn't
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.920]  know what those tattoos mean, they have no idea what they're dealing with.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.960]  And so, ignorance is bliss, but really what it is is incredibly destructive, so that's
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.900]  the first massive, massive story that we're going to be covering, because here's
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.140]  Zelensky, who's Jewish, with an actual SS member, who they now admit that battalion
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.380]  he was in helped run the extermination at the famous execution points where they've
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.380]  now built World War II holocaust memorials.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.580]  You cannot make that up, so here's Zelensky setting up World War II memorials for dead
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.080]  Jews killed and shoveled into ravines by the tens of thousands, with Marina Abramovich
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.760]  setting up a big occultic memorial there.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]  Can't make that up.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.760]  By the way, he's hiring her as the ambassador, quote, to the children, the world's greatest,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.540]  most famous witch, and Aleister Crowley, high priestess, and then over here he's
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.360]  doing that, and then over on the other side he brings a 98-year-old Nazi to praise
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.480]  him at the parliament.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.480]  Okay, so I'm going to get more into that coming up.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.060]  This is just so insane, and meanwhile I'm called a Nazi by the ADL, I mean you can't make
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.860]  this up, and meanwhile Trump's called a Nazi when his grandkids are Jewish, so it just
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.380]  goes on and on and on, he moves the US embassy back to Jerusalem, it's just unbelievable,
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.380]  so he's a Nazi, and then you've got the ADL worshipping, as usual, George Soros,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.140]  who was an actual Nazi collaborator as well, and said he wasn't sorry for the best
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.140]  time of his life.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.140]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.900]  I'm already covering the story, but I'm going to cover it next segment.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.000]  Then we're going to get into the War Patrol saying the border's totally broken, we already
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.220]  know that, but that they can't protect America because they've been ordered to process illegals
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.580]  and bring them in, and they basically are human smugglers now, and they're trying
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.500]  to follow their oath and even having internal protests, that's coming up.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.500]  Also Zelensky's demanded a total blank check, Senator Josh Hawley has been given classified
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.540]  briefings, has gone public, said they want unlimited funds even though they admit
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.420]  the Ukrainians are losing internally, they've been briefed on that, losing bad, but then
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.300]  they lie to the American people.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.380]  That's all coming up, it's just a massive, massive broadcast today, tell everybody you
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.460]  know, tune in now, we'll play all the video clips and more at the start of the

[00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:03.043]  on air.
[00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:07.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now an absolute fact.
[00:06:07.363 --> 00:06:14.283]  It cannot be doubted that there is a massive exploding, accelerating global awakening to
[00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:20.743]  the entire globalist new world order agenda and everything they touch is turning to
[00:06:20.743 --> 00:06:22.323]  pure crap.
[00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:28.883]  All over the Western world, nationalist and populist and anti globalist who are both right
[00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:36.363]  wing and even left wing are surging in the polls and winning elections everywhere.
[00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:40.783]  The few places they're not winning, there's clear election fraud like here in the United
[00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:46.703]  States and in Brazil where they stole it from Bolsonaro and in both countries they're
[00:06:46.703 --> 00:06:52.842]  trying to bar both men, Trump and Bolsonaro, from being able to run for office again.
[00:06:52.842 --> 00:06:57.683]  But hey, the globalists can try to hold the damn back, but they're never going to be
[00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:04.402]  successful unless they're able to manipulate the Russians into starting a nuclear war and
[00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:08.683]  the ruling class believes that that might be better for them because their real enemy
[00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:13.203]  is the people and progress taking control of the planet.
[00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:15.143]  They want control of human development.
[00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.462]  They want control of human destiny.
[00:07:17.462 --> 00:07:20.443]  They want control of the live extension technology.
[00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:25.163]  So again, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:29.203]  Let me break down what we're about to cover.
[00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:33.803]  Trump is 10 to 15 points ahead in hundreds of polls.
[00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:37.923]  You notice I've been saying this for about a year because I look at the real scientific
[00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:42.842]  polls that are done by major institutions, organizations and groups that never get any
[00:07:42.842 --> 00:07:44.482]  media attention.
[00:07:44.482 --> 00:07:50.783]  But now the Washington Post, ABC News and others with their skewed polls show Trump
[00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:54.423]  at least 10 points ahead of Biden.
[00:07:54.423 --> 00:08:01.663]  When you look at sub-sex of the polls, he's more than 15 to 20 points ahead of Biden
[00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:05.303]  in key demographics like under 35.
[00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:11.342]  Ladies and gentlemen, that has got them in total panic mode because even their skewed
[00:08:11.342 --> 00:08:17.222]  polls that over sample Democrats and have a bunch of other manipulated data points that
[00:08:17.222 --> 00:08:20.602]  are put into the equation show him 10 points ahead.
[00:08:20.602 --> 00:08:27.043]  That means 20 points ahead in the general public, 30 points ahead and under 35.
[00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:33.762]  This is just an unprecedented, gigantour lead that we've not seen since polling began
[00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:37.043]  in this country over a hundred years ago.
[00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:39.843]  That's one of the giant stories we're going to be covering.
[00:08:39.843 --> 00:08:44.903]  We've got huge Ukraine news from Senator Josh Hawley, who has come out and said that
[00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:50.023]  obviously he's been given classified briefings and we don't need classified briefings to
[00:08:50.023 --> 00:08:55.723]  know this because the evidence is there, but it just further confirms that Russia
[00:08:55.723 --> 00:09:00.423]  has completely dominated and won, the Ukrainian military's broken, all the NATO funds and
[00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:04.862]  weapons have done nothing, Russia's getting stronger by the day, but that Zelensky and
[00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:12.483]  NATO won a quote blank check of quote hundreds of billions more a year for at least a decade.
[00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:13.483]  I know Hawley's telling the truth.
[00:09:13.483 --> 00:09:14.483]  He's a credible guy.
[00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:18.423]  Plus they've already said, NATO's already said, Oh, we're building permanent factories
[00:09:18.423 --> 00:09:22.703]  in Poland and places for weapons because this is going to go on perhaps for more than
[00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:23.703]  a decade.
[00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:26.043]  So we've got that huge news.
[00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:30.203]  We've got the border patrol videos of their internal meetings where they're saying we've
[00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:31.903]  fallen out of office.
[00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:34.963]  We're not going to keep smelling illegal aliens in.
[00:09:34.963 --> 00:09:36.683]  Joe Biden's a criminal.
[00:09:36.683 --> 00:09:37.683]  We're not going to be part of this.
[00:09:37.683 --> 00:09:41.262]  And now the head of the border patrol has gone public saying that.
[00:09:41.262 --> 00:09:44.762]  So they're putting their jobs and their futures on the line.
[00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:46.843]  Finally the American people are doing the right thing.
[00:09:46.843 --> 00:09:49.363]  Finally the bureaucrats are doing the right thing.
[00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:54.063]  Finally the men and women in law enforcement at many levels are doing the right thing.
[00:09:54.063 --> 00:10:00.502]  It's very small, high powered at the top cadres of the justice department and FBI that
[00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:03.303]  are actually running all the persecution.
[00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:07.303]  I'm not saying the people low level are perfect, but we're definitely seeing massive
[00:10:07.303 --> 00:10:10.203]  whistleblowers and massive resistance.
[00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:12.262]  So let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[00:10:12.262 --> 00:10:15.883]  Yes, I believe these agencies need to be reorganized or abolished, but at the same
[00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:20.543]  time they're not all our enemies and we've got to be ready for more of them to come
[00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:25.782]  over to our side, just like we've seen with so many other prominent organizations and
[00:10:25.782 --> 00:10:30.223]  groups because as it dawns in the world how evil the new world order is and how destructive
[00:10:30.223 --> 00:10:34.423]  it is and that your own future rests with resisting them.
[00:10:34.423 --> 00:10:36.703]  We got to be ready to have defectors over our side.
[00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:39.022]  Freedom is popular folks.
[00:10:39.022 --> 00:10:41.383]  Charity doesn't ever go on forever.
[00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:47.063]  So when we see all these people talking like Alex Jones, when we see the understanding
[00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:51.183]  of the new world order becoming mainstream, we have to be ready to accept these people.
[00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:53.782]  We have to be ready to win.
[00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:55.223]  That is so important.
[00:10:55.223 --> 00:11:02.143]  Speaking of ready to win, the biggest public humiliation for the globalists that
[00:11:02.143 --> 00:11:04.343]  I've seen in a long time just happened.
[00:11:04.343 --> 00:11:06.282]  This has really struck a chord.
[00:11:06.282 --> 00:11:10.183]  It's really gotten people's attention and that's the first big story I'm going to
[00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:12.742]  cover right now.
[00:11:12.742 --> 00:11:18.863]  We have here in the chamber today Ukrainian Canadians, Ukrainian-Canadian world veteran
[00:11:18.863 --> 00:11:25.623]  from the Second World War who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians
[00:11:25.623 --> 00:11:45.063]  and continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98.
[00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:54.343]  Jaroslav Janka, 98, fought in one of the most prestigious SS groups of World War II
[00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:59.623]  where much of the war took place and where some of the biggest massacres and Holocaust
[00:11:59.623 --> 00:12:02.262]  events were also carried out.
[00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:09.223]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he was a member of the armed SS.
[00:12:09.223 --> 00:12:15.983]  He was a member of the most elite Nazi organization on the planet.
[00:12:15.983 --> 00:12:25.262]  An actual Nazi of the 14th division of the Waffen-SS in the field.
[00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:28.782]  Now for anybody that studied World War II, and I certainly have, I've probably read
[00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:34.103]  200 books on the subject, found it fascinating when I was very young and then over the years
[00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:36.423]  have read over 200 books.
[00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:41.262]  But you would think that when they gave him a standing ovation a few days ago with
[00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:48.903]  Zelensky in the Canadian parliament for, quote, fighting the Russians in World War II,
[00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:54.303]  that the members of parliament would have known that we were on the side of the Russians
[00:12:54.303 --> 00:13:00.863]  in World War II and that the Ukrainians were on the side of the Nazis.
[00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:05.423]  But oh, they didn't know that because all they do, like trained seals who are given
[00:13:05.423 --> 00:13:12.463]  the fish, is salute and praise whatever they're told to promote.
[00:13:12.463 --> 00:13:19.343]  And this is really blown up in their face because Putin has not been lying about the
[00:13:19.343 --> 00:13:27.703]  fact that the largest contingent of the Ukrainian military and of the ruling class in the current
[00:13:27.703 --> 00:13:31.223]  group that's in control there is Nazis.
[00:13:31.263 --> 00:13:39.343]  That is the historic factual demographic of Ukraine since World War II.
[00:13:39.343 --> 00:13:48.063]  The Nazis occupied the country for several years and the majority of the Ukrainians,
[00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:54.103]  around 60 percent, historians estimate, sided with the Nazis.
[00:13:54.103 --> 00:14:00.463]  So in the East they were mainly Russians, in the West they saw themselves as more Germanic
[00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:05.583]  than Aryan and that's why the government of Ukraine officially calls the Russians
[00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:13.862]  subhuman and calls them orcs from Lord of the Rings because they say Slavs are basically
[00:14:13.862 --> 00:14:19.742]  subhuman even though almost everyone in that country is at least part Slavic with
[00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:23.823]  a Slavic background, even the ones that are blonde haired, blue eyed.
[00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:30.463]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality, but the New York Times, CNN have covered it
[00:14:30.463 --> 00:14:35.463]  up and said that it's a Russian lie that there are any Nazis over there, despite
[00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:40.263]  the fact that their official uniforms have the Nazi symbol used by Ukrainians in
[00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:45.463]  World War II and that many of the soldiers have swastikas on their arms.
[00:14:45.463 --> 00:14:52.143]  They do the Hitlerian blood and soil rituals with tens of thousands of troops and initiations
[00:14:52.223 --> 00:14:56.742]  where they cut themselves and climb them in these graves and rub dirt all over themselves
[00:14:56.742 --> 00:15:05.263]  in just weird, bizarre, Germanic rituals that basically Hitler developed.
[00:15:05.263 --> 00:15:06.543]  You cannot make this up.
[00:15:06.543 --> 00:15:09.903]  This is a real live Nazi cult.
[00:15:09.903 --> 00:15:16.023]  But see, when I say the globalists are like Nazis, I would say ZG Ping is like a Nazi
[00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:19.223]  or ZG Ping is like Attila the Hun.
[00:15:19.223 --> 00:15:25.383]  Just because somebody's a different color doesn't mean they can't be a supremacist organization.
[00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:29.783]  Hitler was based on race, ZG Ping in China is based on race, and if you look at Klaus
[00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:34.622]  Schwab, whose father and grandfather were Nazis, his grandfather helped head up
[00:15:34.622 --> 00:15:39.023]  the biggest weapons munition facility and was the head executive of the third largest
[00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:42.783]  weapons maker, and it just goes on and on.
[00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:47.263]  It's just like the ADL giving awards to George Soros.
[00:15:47.303 --> 00:15:51.383]  George Soros told 60 Minutes the best time of his life was working for Hitler.
[00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:54.703]  They didn't feel bad about it, and then it was, quote, exhilarating.
[00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:59.463]  Arnold Schwarzenegger told Rolling Stone he loved Hitler, but that's okay because they support
[00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:00.463]  the leftist agenda.
[00:16:00.463 --> 00:16:04.862]  So, I'm not saying that Soros is a Nazi.
[00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:10.263]  What I'm saying is that they're in a cult of evil and they'll work with anybody who
[00:16:10.263 --> 00:16:13.663]  is evil, but anybody who's good, they will oppose.
[00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:19.783]  This is the sickening left actually giving a standing ovation to a real live 98-year-old
[00:16:19.783 --> 00:16:24.543]  Nazi, and now the ADL and Simon Wiesenthal Center and all of them have an egg on their
[00:16:24.543 --> 00:16:29.742]  face because they're busy calling the average American Nazis and demonizing us with
[00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:33.343]  no proof or no evidence, and the left's getting caught all the time creating fake
[00:16:33.343 --> 00:16:40.383]  Nazi groups that they control, and then meanwhile, they're so ignorant or just such
[00:16:40.383 --> 00:16:45.502]  a cult or think we're so stupid that they bring a super rare, that's like finding
[00:16:45.502 --> 00:16:52.502]  a leprechaun or something, but a demonic version of it, a 98-year-old actual Waffen-SS
[00:16:52.502 --> 00:16:57.703]  guy who took part in massacres of Jews and shoveled 30-something thousand of them
[00:16:57.703 --> 00:17:04.143]  into a ravine, the same place that Zelensky builds memorials to Jews, and then he's
[00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:09.103]  right there with a guy that helped kill them and shovel them into a ravine?
[00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:13.862]  I mean, maybe this guy will go on 60 Minutes and say he doesn't feel bad he did it, and
[00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:17.342]  he'd do it again and it was the best part of his life and it was exhilarating and
[00:17:17.342 --> 00:17:21.503]  happy making and maybe the ADL Goodman Award.
[00:17:21.503 --> 00:17:26.023]  That's how sick these people are, and it's emblematic of everything they do is turning
[00:17:26.023 --> 00:17:27.743]  to crap.
[00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:31.223]  Every lie they've put out is blowing up in their face, and the people are seeing
[00:17:31.223 --> 00:17:37.342]  through Jack Smith and the UN prosecutors, that's who they've got, his team is made
[00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:42.263]  up of a bunch of UN prosecutors, not just him, from The Hague, and it's the
[00:17:42.263 --> 00:17:47.623]  same globalist story every day, the UN taking over our health care and our
[00:17:47.623 --> 00:17:51.822]  bodies, the UN taking over regulation and censorship of the internet, it's all
[00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:55.143]  being announced, the UN taking over control of global energy, well who runs
[00:17:55.143 --> 00:18:00.302]  the UN? The big global corporations. Who created the EU? The EU was an idea of
[00:18:00.302 --> 00:18:04.943]  Adolf Alois Hitler. Edward VIII, the King of England, had to advocate
[00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:08.543]  because he was a Nazi, he stayed in Europe during World War II for much of
[00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:13.783]  the war in Spain. He was going to be the king of the new European Union, the
[00:18:13.783 --> 00:18:16.943]  idea that Hitler came up with, and then of course the British had told
[00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:19.822]  Hitler they were going to side with him, they had a treaty with him, but then
[00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:25.423]  they double-crossed him, and I'm not saying that the Brits are the Nazis,
[00:18:25.423 --> 00:18:30.862]  it's just a historical fact that they manipulated Hitler into thinking that
[00:18:30.862 --> 00:18:33.743]  England was going to side with him and they didn't, that's just a fact, and they
[00:18:33.743 --> 00:18:38.223]  removed Neville Chamberlain and brought in Winston Churchill, so World
[00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:43.143]  War II set the global order and set up the Bretton Woods system and the
[00:18:43.143 --> 00:18:47.423]  whole society we're in today, and now they're setting up a new order based
[00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:51.063]  around the European Union allied with the Communist Chinese that is basically
[00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:54.862]  based on many of the ideas that Adolf Hitler came up with. Hitler relaunched
[00:18:54.862 --> 00:18:59.342]  the Olympics, Hitler created the design of the Volkswagen, Hitler created the
[00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:05.783]  symbol of the Olympics and the symbol of of Audi, all of it folks, it's all from
[00:19:05.783 --> 00:19:10.943]  Hitler, and so real things from Hitler we're not supposed to talk about, but
[00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:15.623]  then we project onto America that had nothing to do with Hitler and onto
[00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:19.463]  Alex Jones when both my grandfathers fought in World War II that I'm a
[00:19:19.463 --> 00:19:24.383]  Nazi, I'm not associated with George Soros, I'm not associated with Zelensky, I
[00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:31.423]  don't have SS death squad operators in standing ovations with me, I have
[00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:35.822]  nothing to do with that, but see it doesn't matter because the evil
[00:19:35.822 --> 00:19:38.903]  globalist corporate media with all the blood on their hands from all these
[00:19:38.903 --> 00:19:44.543]  wars can sit there and sell this lie as long as the public stays asleep, and
[00:19:44.543 --> 00:19:48.423]  it goes further, Madeleine Albright was on 60 minutes one time and of course
[00:19:48.423 --> 00:19:54.983]  she said 500,000 children dying in Iraq when she tripled the sanctions on
[00:19:54.983 --> 00:19:58.383]  them is a good price to pay, she'd do it again, remember that? Remember that?
[00:19:58.383 --> 00:20:01.903]  Well she also in the same 60 minutes got in trouble and got sued
[00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:06.263]  because on the wall behind her was a famous painting that had been missing
[00:20:06.263 --> 00:20:11.903]  since World War II that her father stole from fellow Jews claiming he'd
[00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:15.263]  helped him get out of the country and he stole their wealth, the equivalent
[00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:19.903]  of billions, and then handed Jews over to the Nazis, so he was a big version
[00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:26.263]  of George Soros, so see the relationship now? I'm not saying the ADL are Nazis,
[00:20:26.263 --> 00:20:30.903]  I'm saying they use Nazis to scare Jews into serving them and giving them
[00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:34.783]  money and giving them power, then they can demonize all their opposition as
[00:20:34.783 --> 00:20:40.302]  Nazis while being knee-deep or really neck-deep with actual Nazis, these are
[00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:44.903]  super predators ladies and gentlemen, and I can go on for hours with all these big
[00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:49.023]  powerful prominent Jews working with the Nazis to round up Jews, that's a big
[00:20:49.023 --> 00:20:53.423]  scandal from World War II folks, a lot of Jews were able to get out and go to
[00:20:53.423 --> 00:20:57.663]  Israel and go to the US and go other places but they had to pay money
[00:20:57.663 --> 00:21:03.302]  ladies and gentlemen, Palestine at the time, they had to pay money to the
[00:21:03.302 --> 00:21:08.263]  brokers who were Jewish in many cases to do it and that's the dirty secret of
[00:21:08.263 --> 00:21:13.183]  Madeline Albright and George Soros and the ADL and now there's their god
[00:21:13.183 --> 00:21:18.463]  Zelensky saying, oh I'm a Jewish president so it's okay we've got an army
[00:21:18.463 --> 00:21:21.703]  made up of Nazis, Zelensky last year told the New York Times, yeah a lot of
[00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:25.143]  our people are Nazis, they're good people, there's nothing wrong with that,
[00:21:25.143 --> 00:21:29.943]  so that's why they arrogantly brought this guy up there was to celebrate it
[00:21:29.943 --> 00:21:38.023]  and to rub it in our faces over and over and over and over and over again, so
[00:21:38.023 --> 00:21:43.543]  what is Madeline Albright, is she a Nazi? No, she's a monstrous, cutthroat, ruthless
[00:21:43.543 --> 00:21:48.183]  killer because that stuff existed before the Nazis, it exists now today
[00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:52.883]  it's just called evil people, Madeline Albright's evil, Xi Jinping's evil, the ADL's
[00:21:52.883 --> 00:21:57.342]  evil, Zelensky's evil, the Azov Battalion's evil and they're starting
[00:21:57.342 --> 00:22:02.743]  World War III, so that's our first big report, look at the photos, see the
[00:22:02.743 --> 00:22:07.503]  videos, see all for yourself on Infowars.com but the world is awakening
[00:22:07.503 --> 00:22:12.343]  the globalist tyrants know that their time is short, now let's move on to our
[00:22:12.343 --> 00:22:17.583]  next big story, oh wait before I move on to the next story I forgot this one
[00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:20.983]  last little tidbit, I mean there's so many we'll talk about it more later
[00:22:20.983 --> 00:22:25.383]  here is one member of the Canadian Parliament a few years ago during the
[00:22:25.383 --> 00:22:29.503]  Canadian trucker protest against the endless lockdowns and forced injections
[00:22:29.503 --> 00:22:34.783]  saying that honk honk honking your horn is code for Heil Hitler and it
[00:22:34.783 --> 00:22:39.703]  wasn't just this kook it was a bunch of others saying it as well so the okay
[00:22:39.703 --> 00:22:45.183]  hand symbol all of that's bad all of that's Nazi being whites inherently
[00:22:45.183 --> 00:22:49.263]  evil says the ADL just white people are inherently bad except for ADL
[00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:54.903]  members but if you honk your horn that's also Hall Hitler here it is
[00:22:54.903 --> 00:23:00.663]  how much vitriol do we have to see of honk honk which is an acronym for
[00:23:00.823 --> 00:23:09.062]  Heil Hitler do we need to see by these protesters on social media now you heard
[00:23:09.062 --> 00:23:13.183]  her she's a member of the Canadian Parliament and if you honk your horn in
[00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:18.543]  protest you are hailing Hitler now if you give a standing ovation to an
[00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:23.903]  actual SS commander who helped round up Jews and shoot them in the back of
[00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:28.223]  the head and throw into pits no problem no problem but if you don't be
[00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:31.703]  locked down your house don't want kids have to wear masks forever don't want to
[00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:35.463]  be locked down don't want to you know starve everybody to death you are a
[00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:39.263]  Nazi but if you want to lock people up in their houses and tell them
[00:23:39.263 --> 00:23:43.663]  they're not essential and basically watch and commit suicide like a Nazi then
[00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:47.543]  you are a Nazi you understand okay good let's move on to the next
[00:23:47.543 --> 00:23:52.783]  subject and remember all of this is interconnected once you understand
[00:23:52.783 --> 00:23:55.223]  history once you understand the globalist roots once you understand
[00:23:55.223 --> 00:23:59.103]  their aims their goals then you can study each section under attacks each
[00:23:59.103 --> 00:24:03.743]  head of the Hydra and understand how to defeat them so segueing out of the
[00:24:03.743 --> 00:24:10.903]  actual SS soldier of death the actual individual now they're reporting
[00:24:10.903 --> 00:24:17.983]  that was conducting the lining up Jews in mass and shooting them and putting
[00:24:17.983 --> 00:24:21.983]  them in barns and burning them up some of the biggest massacres did happen in
[00:24:21.983 --> 00:24:27.423]  Ukraine and this is one of the main unit let's segue to what's happening
[00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:32.223]  currently sigh Hersh is reported from his sources you can see it for yourself
[00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:35.783]  they lied to us about Ukraine they lied to us about the history of the
[00:24:35.783 --> 00:24:40.103]  war and they lied to us about the offensive and that the Ukrainians were
[00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:45.223]  winning and some numbers are at 113 million the real numbers are closer to
[00:24:45.223 --> 00:24:50.343]  200 billion but regardless senator Josh Hawley has been given a quote
[00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:56.023]  classified briefing where the Pentagon confirmed yes the Ukrainians have lost
[00:24:56.023 --> 00:25:00.783]  the war their military is basically destroyed and unless we send in NATO
[00:25:00.783 --> 00:25:04.302]  troops the Russians are going to win and then now it's being reported by
[00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:07.983]  major German news what I already told you before the war even officially
[00:25:07.983 --> 00:25:12.823]  started a year and a half ago US troops are being treated at German
[00:25:12.823 --> 00:25:18.183]  military bases for wounds sustained in Ukraine they simply put on Ukrainian
[00:25:18.343 --> 00:25:25.823]  uniform so we're officially at war with Russia it's escalating every day and now
[00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:30.623]  you can go to info Wars calm and read the very important article senator
[00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:35.423]  shocked by classified briefing on Ukraine Warhawks one blank check with
[00:25:35.423 --> 00:25:40.103]  no victory in sight senator Josh Hawley Republican Missouri known for his
[00:25:40.103 --> 00:25:42.983]  efforts to force the by administration declassified information related to
[00:25:42.983 --> 00:25:47.663]  covens possible lab origins at Wuhan exited a classified briefing this week
[00:25:47.663 --> 00:25:53.263]  on the situation Ukraine and expressed a feeling of shock was listen to my
[00:25:53.263 --> 00:25:57.383]  show he wouldn't be shocked if there is some path to victory in Ukraine I
[00:25:57.383 --> 00:26:01.963]  didn't hear it today also heard that there's going to be no end to the
[00:26:01.963 --> 00:26:05.783]  funding request he went on to say they want hundreds of billions of
[00:26:05.783 --> 00:26:10.903]  dollars a year and that it could last for a decade well again classified
[00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:15.223]  briefing these are just synopsis the head of NATO said it could last 10 years
[00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:20.703]  just a few months ago publicly so all this quote Intel stuff oh you need the
[00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:24.943]  intelligence agency to tell you the the senators are just now learning that
[00:26:24.943 --> 00:26:30.062]  the Russians are winning they've been winning the entire time ladies and
[00:26:30.062 --> 00:26:35.463]  gentlemen so remember the corporate media lied to you they brainwashed you
[00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:42.263]  senator Josh Hawley also has exposed that the CIA was involved brainwashing
[00:26:42.263 --> 00:26:47.023]  the public concerning COVID and elections and everything else it's
[00:26:47.023 --> 00:26:51.703]  illegal the agencies have taken over they've been put in place by the big
[00:26:51.703 --> 00:26:56.423]  banks by BlackRock we're occupied we're conquered and now they're
[00:26:56.423 --> 00:27:00.503]  starting fights with Russia now they're starting nuclear wars they're insane
[00:27:00.703 --> 00:27:08.103]  they're dangerous let's go ahead and play a clip of the senator from
[00:27:08.103 --> 00:27:12.423]  congressional hearings just last week talking about something we told you
[00:27:12.423 --> 00:27:16.583]  about a decade ago and then I've experienced the CIA coming after me and
[00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:20.503]  I've watched Senate and House Armed Services Committee hearings where they
[00:27:20.503 --> 00:27:24.663]  admit they're using the CIA against me so the senators can act like they
[00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:27.583]  don't know what's going on they do know what's going on and it needs to
[00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:31.663]  stop we have a bunch of psychotic disconnected lunatics running this
[00:27:31.663 --> 00:27:36.543]  country in much of the world and it's gotta stop because senator Hawley said
[00:27:36.543 --> 00:27:40.343]  well you know the CIA said we've got to keep the war going or it'll
[00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:44.943]  embarrass America standing in the world embarrass our standing the whole
[00:27:44.943 --> 00:27:49.343]  world sees through this and who we're backing in these crazy Nazis and how's
[00:27:49.343 --> 00:27:52.723]  it gonna help America standing there's a huge nuclear war and most of us are
[00:27:52.723 --> 00:27:57.763]  dead how about that standing so no America's standing was strong and
[00:27:57.763 --> 00:28:01.163]  weren't the bad guy and we're becoming the bad guy we certainly are
[00:28:01.163 --> 00:28:04.523]  run by the bad guys it needs to stop so here's the senator talking
[00:28:04.523 --> 00:28:08.643]  about the CIA brainwashing the American people by the way that's
[00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:10.963]  illegal
[00:28:11.323 --> 00:28:15.963]  intelligence dangerously compromised warrant CIA and FBI whistleblowers you're

[00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:38.649]  coming up in the second and third hours we've got ezra levant the head of rebel
[00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:43.689]  media that does an incredible job as you know based out of canada but they're also international
[00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:52.250]  joining us to respond to the incredible standing ovation endorsement of an actual s s operative
[00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:58.949]  from world war ii who helped reportedly carry out the mass exterminations of jews and others
[00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:03.409]  the standing ovation that he and zelinski gave him to rub it in our faces and just
[00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:07.330]  how insane this is and how it's blown up their face and why would they do such a thing
[00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:13.009]  that is coming up ladies and gentlemen bottom of the next hour then edward dowd has got a
[00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:18.130]  lot of new intel on just how bad the vaccine deaths are and what he believes the globalist
[00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.370]  next move is going to be i agree with him tucker carlson agrees we're all on the same
[00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:28.890]  page this is critical information the third hour so tell everyone you know tune in for
[00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:35.890]  that information now let me get into a couple of stories that just illustrate the mindset
[00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:41.410]  of the left and remember it's the same programs the same organizations from australia to the
[00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:48.330]  u.s from canada to germany from wales in england to burgundy france it's the same
[00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:55.690]  projects the same ngo's the same organizations the same programs of absolute tyranny so here's
[00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:02.009]  what they're up to let's go to this one first missouri ag sues health provider for
[00:35:02.009 --> 00:35:08.810]  allegedly not giving mental evaluations before sex reassignments including in children now
[00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.049]  normally somebody shows up and wants something cut off you know like well are you mentally
[00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:18.850]  ill or something wrong but instead they're exacerbating the mental illness and then
[00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:23.850]  the government and media are going along with it for giant profits at the same time it
[00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:29.009]  sterilizes the person so that's good for the population so that's loving and liberal
[00:35:29.009 --> 00:35:34.049]  and now there's news articles coming out everywhere again from europe to the u.s where
[00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:40.009]  the school's as young as five tell the kids are transgender get them to agree they are then
[00:35:40.009 --> 00:35:45.370]  put them in a database and then keep that information from the parents so that's directly
[00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:51.850]  taking control of the children's sexual development of their biology and their bodies
[00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:57.170]  from the parents in a state-run cult with guidelines and manuals of how to keep it secret
[00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:03.650]  and how to keep files on the parents to build a case against them to take the child when they
[00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:11.090]  hit seven and the chemical sterilization begins or the physical mutilation castration removal
[00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:18.690]  the breast testicles ovaries uteruses you name it so this is a nightmare situation but that's
[00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:23.370]  who they are but more and more pushback is happening and more and more victims are filing
[00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:28.130]  lawsuits and so the worm is starting to turn and we're protecting our children and that's what
[00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:34.569]  this is all about but boy they have really taken us down a dark dark road it shows where
[00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:39.210]  they're gonna take us if we don't start standing up now that's wonderful and good
[00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:43.250]  to mutilate children and chemically sterilize them and keep it secret from the parents and
[00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.170]  take the kids away when they're 10 and take them off to be sterilized washington
[00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.770]  states pass a law to do that they're trying to pass laws in illinois to do it i mean i mean
[00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:57.850]  this is a cult now hbo's got shows that simulate little girls being raped by men
[00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:03.410]  when they're eight years old i mean they're just selling this garbage everywhere because
[00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:15.090]  they want our souls but that is all bad you see it's it's it's bad to not want to chop
[00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:22.930]  a child's genitals off it's it's virtuous to want to do it but what else is happening well
[00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:30.450]  what else is the left up to anti-religious group threatens to warn auburn university after
[00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:39.130]  200 kids baptized on campus absolute joke so because the football coach and some of the
[00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:44.650]  professors who are christians have their own personal relationships with adult students they're
[00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:48.810]  not trying to cut their penises off they're not trying to put them on chemicals they're
[00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.529]  not trying to get them to go to orgies but they are christians they're allowed to have
[00:37:53.529 --> 00:37:58.810]  christian private associations at state-funded colleges separation of church and state means
[00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:03.650]  you don't have a state-run religion but it doesn't mean that a valedictorian can't say
[00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:08.529]  i gave my heart to christ and i think jesus christ or it can't say that a football player
[00:38:08.609 --> 00:38:16.210]  can't say a prayer before or after a football game or in the field house but but the left has
[00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:21.490]  gone so far as telling kids they can't hand out christmas cards before the christmas break
[00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:27.210]  and you can't call it christmas so again what a cult and these organizations and groups
[00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:37.170]  are now openly threatening to sue the school saying it's inappropriate for hundreds of students
[00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:43.090]  to go and get baptized in the river there by the school with some of the christian members
[00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:49.930]  of the school no that's their free association the freedom from religion foundation says it was
[00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:57.009]  inappropriate and unconstitutional for auburn employees like head coach hugh frieze to have
[00:38:57.009 --> 00:39:03.330]  participated an anti-religious group attempting to throw cold water on an alabama university
[00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:10.370]  after the school's football coach was filmed assisting with the baptism of students has
[00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:15.730]  a twisted interpretation of the first amendment a legal expert says on friday the freedom from
[00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:20.529]  religion foundation sent a letter to the university president christopher roberts warning
[00:39:20.529 --> 00:39:26.609]  that more than 200 student baptisms one of which was assisted by auburn tigers head coach
[00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.970]  hugh frieze somehow violated the constitution's establishment clause so it just goes on from
[00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:38.850]  there they're putting up satanic altars at courthouses they are literally setting up satan
[00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:43.250]  clubs in in elementary schools they are telling our children they want to cut their balls off
[00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:50.130]  and then promoting it but then if in free association people want to go together and and
[00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:55.810]  and and be baptized and be brought deeper into the christian faith and you know you know have
[00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:01.090]  god touch their heart and make them be born again that is the worst thing ever because these
[00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.370]  aren't anti-religion groups folks these are occultic groups you scratch one of these atheists
[00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:11.250]  you scratch one of these people they're communists they're globalists they're you name it and and
[00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:16.210]  they are marching forward in fact i just saw another clip i'm going to get to in a few minutes
[00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:22.609]  of a prominent leader speaking to a parliament a communist saying you're not going to stop the
[00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:28.609]  new world order of the esgs uh the carbon taxes it's our time because it is a communist
[00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:33.890]  movement ladies and gentlemen run by ultra rich who are exempt from their own policies so they
[00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.810]  are so scared of christians getting together they are so scared of people coming together
[00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:44.290]  they are so scared of of a chain reaction of coming back to god to counteract this poison
[00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:49.250]  but there is a new revival happening and it's not happening in these controlled corporate 501c3
[00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:56.210]  churches it is happening in real churches and in businesses and in in colleges and just as people
[00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:02.130]  realize there is good and evil and we need god so i salute uh that university and i tell them stand
[00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.290]  up to these tyrants and don't let these monsters tell you that you can't freely associate
[00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:10.690]  remember how during the covid lockdowns black lives matter could march but nobody else could
[00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.850]  they beat you up for not wearing a mask or being out in public but but black lives matter
[00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:19.730]  could then they had a fake study saying when black lives matter marches it cuts covid
[00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.890]  but when you go out it increases covid and by the way don't look at the sun don't talk to
[00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:29.730]  your neighbors don't watch the sunset these are cults trying to see how much ridiculous
[00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:35.090]  crap they can get you to follow and go along with migrant encounters at the southern border
[00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:41.090]  are surging once again after a lull this summer with cities straining to host more asylum
[00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:47.170]  seekers to alleviate the pressure president biden granted temporary legal status to nearly half a
[00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:53.250]  million venezuelans already in the country allowing them to legally work but thousands
[00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:59.090]  more migrants are arriving daily testing the biden administration's migration strategy
[00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:05.330]  abc's matt rivers is in el paso with the new border chief in charge there good morning matt
[00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:11.569]  good morning martha we had an exclusive conversation with the new border patrol chief
[00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:17.649]  jason owens who laid out the myriad challenges facing his organization amidst unrelenting
[00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:24.529]  historic migration the crisis continues at the u.s mexico border the highest total of migrant
[00:42:24.529 --> 00:42:29.569]  encounters since december and this month reportedly on pace to surpass that figure and
[00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:35.330]  this morning exclusive access to the top u.s official on the front line border patrol chief
[00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:41.009]  jason owens giving abc news his first interview since taking over the top job nearly three months
[00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:45.970]  ago in terms of flow and and the threats that we're seeing with fentanyl and with the criminal
[00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:50.370]  organizations that that are our adversary it's about as bad as i've ever seen it the last
[00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:55.410]  week has been intense to say the least thousands crossing per day in the latest spike in
[00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:01.330]  migration we haven't seen these numbers since the end of title 42 the pandemic era policy that
[00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:06.609]  allowed officials to quickly expel most migrants at the border without allowing asylum claims
[00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:12.930]  how sustainable is this your ability to respond to this amount of people at the border
[00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:18.450]  this isn't sustainable this is uh up and down the system uh everybody is overwhelmed
[00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.930]  even the government of mexico which have been great partners for us the u.s border patrol
[00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.250]  a lot of times our facilities are already over capacity nowhere more overwhelmed than the
[00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:32.609]  small town of eagle pass texas where thousands of migrants converged and crossed over the last
[00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:39.170]  week behind that in part organized crime officials say human smugglers surged migrants to that area
[00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:44.770]  for a reason so you believe what's happening in eagle pass is directly a distraction to occupy
[00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:48.529]  your time instead of looking at something else i believe it's a money-making opportunity for
[00:43:48.529 --> 00:43:52.130]  those smugglers and i believe it's a distraction for them to cross other things into the country
[00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:58.770]  other things like narcotics fentanyl uh bulk cash weapons people of interest whether it be hardened
[00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:03.970]  criminals and gang members convictions convicted sexual predators owen says his agents should be
[00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:09.250]  focused on stopping those kind of things but instead must deal with unrelenting flows of
[00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:13.970]  migrants it's quickly overwhelmed federal facilities with officials forced to release
[00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:19.569]  thousands of migrants into the u.s to await immigration proceedings human smugglers promising
[00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:24.450]  migrants they'll simply just be let in which owen says is not true they're still facing
[00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:29.009]  removal and deportation so it is not this this open gate that the uh that the smugglers are
[00:44:29.009 --> 00:44:32.770]  promising but that's what they're saying that's what they're saying immigration law aside
[00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:39.410]  migrants are going to keep coming a record 81 000 plus migrants crossed the notorious dadian
[00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:44.930]  gap from colombia to panama last month eventually joined on the route to the u.s by those from
[00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:51.250]  central america and mexico owens is keenly aware of the political debate but says his agency
[00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:57.009]  just follows the law we see a lot of a lot of folks say just push people back just uh don't
[00:44:57.009 --> 00:45:01.170]  let them cross or send them back immediately the u.s board patrol is a law enforcement agency
[00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:07.090]  we enforce the laws that are on the books we don't have the right nor should we of denying
[00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:12.370]  somebody due process once they are on american soil and martha the thing that owens kept coming
[00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:17.410]  back to is that it is not the job of border patrol agents to process migrants or at least it
[00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:21.890]  shouldn't be it's their job to stop deadly harmful things from coming into the country but they can't
[00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:26.850]  do that as long as this kind of migration keeps happening and as long as congress doesn't
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:32.529]  pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix what is unquestionably a broken system martha
[00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:39.009]  matt rivers thank you we stay focused we continue to do the job and the mission
[00:45:39.569 --> 00:45:43.890]  that we signed up for all right we all signed up for we all raised our hand
[00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:52.210]  it's not hard to say it may be hard for you to say it but i've been doing it for 31 years
[00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:57.810]  it's not hard for me to say it every day i wake up and i'm committed to this organization
[00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.410]  and i'm committed to each one of you
[00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.690]  i understand the same thing but it seems like a policy
[00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:07.649]  but then you keep releasing you're getting locked down in the policies of
[00:46:07.649 --> 00:46:14.930]  politics you can't even say that that's why she's not left you just said it you can't
[00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:19.730]  see anything that happened to you you just said it the whole generation the whole generation
[00:46:20.609 --> 00:46:26.210]  why are you guys getting caught up you come into mantas right there's a mission out there
[00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:30.130]  to me there's a mission
[00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:37.810]  so we're doing the face right i've been doing this job as long as y'all that's a problem what's
[00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.970]  that that's a problem chief for people to triumph is for good men to do nothing
[00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.970]  i can't hear you for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing that's exactly what's
[00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:51.250]  happening here good men are doing nothing you're allowing the big ladies you are doing
[00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:55.410]  something no sir we're not you are you're rescuing people every day you're taking
[00:46:56.050 --> 00:47:05.090]  streets every day you're taking them in the history of our country in one year in this
[00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:10.370]  country you know we've made or written all seizures already this year than we made last
[00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:28.770]  year you just saw or listen to clips of the border patrol head saying the agency cannot
[00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:35.250]  protect the u.s because they are forced to process so many illegals and we also have
[00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:44.370]  internal of senior board patrol having meetings with uh the other uh officers the other agents
[00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:48.930]  and saying we have an oath we've got to stop this we're literally completing the smuggling
[00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:53.810]  process well what's really happening here is the process of awakening and realizing that
[00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:57.649]  the bottom's fallen out of this country we literally have globalists running the nation
[00:47:57.649 --> 00:48:04.690]  that are working against it and dissolving it again the earlier story leftist groups
[00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:12.850]  threatening to sue if the football coach who's a christian goes in his off spare time and goes
[00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.970]  to a river by the college and hundreds of young people come together in christ that's our
[00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:24.370]  free association you monsters you cult members i mean again only in places like communist china
[00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.690]  where they restrict christians from doing that or say you can't do that at university what's
[00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:33.330]  next send us to re-education and yes that's what the whole covet lockdowns are about
[00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:37.970]  the smokescreen to start disappearing their political enemies and now all over the globalist
[00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:42.930]  world they are saying the next time there's a virus we're going to lock up people that don't
[00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:49.009]  go along with it in the covet camps they're going for broke they're trying to put everybody
[00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:53.490]  in prison they're criminals and i know as a general audience you get that but we
[00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:58.770]  cannot get punch drunk here in this fight and just become complacent just accept we live in
[00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:04.529]  tyranny we have to understand it's only going to get worse until we wake up and say no and
[00:49:04.529 --> 00:49:12.850]  break free of the system of lies the empire of lies that is hollywood that is the left that is
[00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:18.130]  the cia that is the globalist they have to be stopped they're not americans they're anti-americans
[00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:22.290]  everything they do is destroy this country they're not our leaders they are a fraud working
[00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:31.250]  against us speaking of fraud the big national polls that you see pushed in the last couple
[00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:38.130]  years showing biden ahead of trump or trump and biden in a dead heat or fraudulent you can go
[00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:42.770]  read the methodology of these big national polls it's the groups they sample that they've
[00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.250]  sampled before they know how they're going to vote it's also the fact that they'll sample 10
[00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:52.609]  to 15 percent more democrats saying that they believe there's quote more democrats in america
[00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:57.649]  than republicans there's a lot of other ways they manipulated but even in those manipulated
[00:49:57.649 --> 00:50:04.210]  polls by the washington post and others trump is now 10 to 20 points depending on the demographic
[00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:12.290]  ahead of joe biden so imagine even though there's all that fraudulent methodology
[00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:18.370]  being put in garbage data trump is still way ahead they are in complete panic mode i could
[00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:23.569]  have told them that i did on air that indicting trump would supercharge him because america is
[00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:29.569]  in a awakening america is in a realignment america is breaking with the system it's beyond
[00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:34.850]  political people know we've got a hijacked government and they're upset about it and so
[00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:40.529]  now the articles on info wars.com the washington post has come out and said oh our poll wasn't
[00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:47.250]  correct our poll's not accurate really joe biden is in a dead heat with trump so even their skewed
[00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:52.930]  polls show that biden's losing it is super unpopular and he was unpopular two and a half
[00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:56.770]  years ago when he stole the election and we all know that that's why they're trying to
[00:50:56.770 --> 00:51:02.210]  outlaw questioning it because it's so popular 80 plus percent of americans who are republicans
[00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:07.170]  believe it was stolen upwards of 50 of democrats believe it was stolen are you going to arrest us
[00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:13.649]  all no we know the truth and we're not backing down and so when you try to steal it again next
[00:51:13.649 --> 00:51:19.170]  year it's going to be even more obvious the only way the globalists win is if we back down
[00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:23.250]  because it's just like polls are just like voting they've only got so many dead people
[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:28.290]  so many people that have moved out of district with their uh mail-in ballots and and other
[00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:33.410]  things to steal an election they run out of bullets they were starting to win in florida and
[00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:37.890]  texas in the last election until they ran out of dead people and then suddenly the republicans surged
[00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:44.529]  by 10 o'clock at night because the real votes were coming in and again you can see
[00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:49.250]  the democrats stacking the ballots they where where the where the graph goes straight up instead
[00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:54.450]  of at a curve the republicans are at a curve democrats when they need it boom bump up but then
[00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:59.970]  they run out of ammo so just like with these polls even though they're skewed when trump gets
[00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:05.250]  such a giant lead it still overtakes even the fraud they've got baked into the cake
[00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:10.370]  so they're gonna have to up the fraud even more and now discredit their own poll telling you that
[00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:16.609]  trump is way ahead they're losing the hearts and minds they're losing the people the people
[00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:19.970]  know we're being deindustrialized the people know that the globalists are at war with us
[00:52:20.609 --> 00:52:26.370]  and as long as we hang on and continue to speak out at city councils and school boards
[00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:29.810]  and everywhere else we're going to win we're going to come together now they're going to
[00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:34.930]  launch some false flags you can bet your bottom dollar on that race-based false flags cyber
[00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:41.569]  attacks power outages expanded wars stock market crashes it's all in the cards that's why we've
[00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:46.450]  got to understand they're the ones behind it they're the ones exacerbating it they're the
[00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:52.130]  enemy our government has been hijacked the government's not the enemy we've got to take control
[00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:58.290]  of our government and remove the criminals and have real reform that is the secret that is the key
[00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.569]  that is the answer and that's why this broadcast is so critical and that's why you're so critical

[00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:51.090]  what the left has done is they've weaponized accusations and this is really you you could
[00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:56.689]  take a look at history and the french revolution and and jacques jacques and then they would just
[00:55:56.689 --> 00:56:01.010]  behead you in the street and that's where the left is going they just want to be able to accuse
[00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:05.170]  you and then behead you in the street now they haven't gone to beheading us in the street yet but
[00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:10.370]  they do the digital decapitation they do the digital defamation they do the digital assault
[00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:15.810]  but so they've weaponized rape accusations that are illegitimate to hurt their political opposition
[00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:21.649]  and so now who suffers real victims of rape because now whether russell brand is guilty or
[00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:28.689]  not or tim ballard is guilty or not i don't believe them and i never will because they're
[00:56:28.689 --> 00:56:35.090]  the jesse smalllets of political operations and we've got another example and this one might be
[00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:43.010]  the most hurtful because it's now the youth it's now the democrat youth that are that are
[00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:47.890]  looking at the jesse smalllets and that are looking at the fake rape accusations to hurt
[00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.210]  their political opposition and now they're faking things because they think oh this is how you get

[00:57:00.689 --> 00:57:05.730]  now the left so they weaponize rape accusations they they false flag events to try to hurt

[00:59:48.710 --> 01:00:02.710]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:11.710]  So after the FBI plot, the fake plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer was an entrapment where all the defendants were acquitted by a jury.
[01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:15.710]  How does this play into the January 6th narrative?
[01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:22.710]  Where now a Capitol police chief is testifying, he's confused why the Democrats stood down security that day.
[01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:26.710]  Here is his testimony in front of Congress.
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:35.710]  A second set here. In a press conference on January 7th, Speaker Pelosi called for your resignation on national television.
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.710]  Speaker Pelosi also stated that she had not talked to you since the initial breach of the Capitol.
[01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:47.710]  But according to your transcribed interview, you were on the phone with Speaker Pelosi a few times. Can you explain that discrepancy?
[01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:54.710]  Yeah, that is correct. I spoke to Speaker Pelosi three times that evening.
[01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:59.710]  And she went on national TV and said I had never spoken to her, but I spoke to her three times.
[01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:07.710]  The three times were the first time when I went over to brief Vice President Pence at the secure location.
[01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:13.710]  I had called House Sergeant-at-Arms Irving, told him I was going over to brief the Vice President.
[01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:18.710]  I was also going over to do a personal assessment of the Capitol. At that point, things were getting under control.
[01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:24.710]  I went over there, briefed him on when we can get them back into chambers with Mr. Irving being fully aware.
[01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.710]  He said he wanted to get Speaker Pelosi on the phone.
[01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:33.710]  He made a phone call from his cell phone at approximately 534, where I first briefed Speaker Pelosi.
[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:38.710]  The second call was when I left that location. As I was walking away, I met up with Mr. Stenger,
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:43.710]  and we started walking over to the Senate to go brief the Senate, when Jennifer Hemingway,
[01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:48.710]  I believe it was Jennifer Hemingway, handed me his cell phone, and it was Emily Barrett's cell phone calling her,
[01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:53.710]  and it was Speaker Pelosi on the other line. This is my second call with Speaker Pelosi,
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.710]  questioning the information I had given to Vice President Pence about when we can get back into chambers.
[01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:03.710]  The information was correct. I could get them back into chambers by 7 p.m., and the call ended.
[01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:08.710]  That was call number two. Call number three was 625 p.m.
[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:13.710]  I was over at the Senate, from where the Senate had been sequestered,
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:18.710]  and on a cell phone using Robert Karam's cell phone, they dialed leadership,
[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:23.710]  who was over offsite at a secure location, and I briefed all the leadership of the plans to get them back into chambers.
[01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:25.710]  That would have been call number three with Speaker Pelosi.
[01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:30.710]  You didn't have two calls. You had three calls, so Speaker Pelosi's comments that she didn't speak to you are inaccurate.
[01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.710]  That is correct, sir.
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:37.710]  This is on January the 3rd. I believe this was in your book that you met with both Stenger and Ervin
[01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:42.710]  and requested National Guard assistance to be ready on the 6th.
[01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:47.710]  Can you explain what happened in those two meetings with Ervin and Stenger?
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:52.710]  Absolutely. So on the morning of the 3rd at 924 a.m.,
[01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:57.710]  I typically went to see him because I know what a big deal it is to have National Guard come and assist us on the Hill.
[01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:02.710]  I went into his office again, 924 in the morning, went up,
[01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:07.710]  and immediately went up and said, hey, I'd like to bring in the National Guard to support me on, to assist me on the perimeter,
[01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:12.710]  because when we have a joint session of Congress, it takes a lot of our personnel inside.
[01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:17.710]  But immediately, as soon as I asked him, his first response was, I don't know, I don't like the optics of that.
[01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:23.710]  And his second response was, besides the intelligence doesn't support it.
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:28.710]  He immediately, then we began talking, said, have you reached out to Mike Stenger on this?
[01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:33.710]  I said, no, I have not talked to him about it yet.
[01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:38.710]  He said, why don't you talk to Stenger and see what he has to say?
[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:43.710]  So then I left, went over to Mike Stenger's office at 935 in the morning, walked into his office.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:48.710]  To immediately ask him, I'd like to request the National Guard.
[01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.710]  He said, you know, let's come up with another idea.
[01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:58.710]  Why don't you call, do you know somebody at the National Guard?
[01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:03.710]  I said, yes, sir, I know General William Walker.
[01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:08.710]  He said, why don't you call Walker and see if we need them, how quickly could they get here, and how many people could they send us?
[01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:13.710]  So I asked him really quickly once he got Secretary of Defense approval and sent him over.
[01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:18.710]  When you met with Stenger, had Ervin given him heads up that you were coming to ask for National Guard?
[01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:24.710]  Yeah, later on, after January 6th, specifically on April 8th, I went and had lunch with Mike Stenger.
[01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:33.710]  And I asked him, because it was kind of unusual, he came up with that idea so quickly when I went walking in.
[01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:38.710]  Mr. Stenger, you came up with that response fairly quickly for me to call General Walker.
[01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:43.710]  And he had told me Paul Erving had called him ahead of time and said, son came here looking for the National, asking for the National Guard.
[01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:49.710]  We've got to come up with another plan, Pelosi will never go for it.
[01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:54.710]  So why did Nancy Pelosi lie about those communications, and why won't the mainstream media play that police officer's January 6th testimony?
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:05:03.710]  My fellow patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.

[01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:37.710]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We're now into hour number two. Alex Jones here with a breaking news update.
[01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:46.710]  I first saw the report last night, and before I even read the full details, I knew what I was about to read because I've had similar things happen to me.
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:52.710]  I've had the feds try to set me up as a Russian agent. I mean, there's so much stuff that's not known to the public yet,
[01:06:52.710 --> 01:07:01.710]  but basically, they just list anybody that is anti-war or anti-open borders or anti-Biden or anti-globalist as a Russian agent.
[01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:06.710]  You already know that, and the Steele dossier was fake and Russiagate was fake and both impeachments were fake,
[01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:11.710]  and so now they've got more fake indictments run by two former head UN war crimes prosecutors,
[01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.710]  Jack Smith and this other guy they just brought in last week.
[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:20.710]  This is global government taking over our bodies. This is global government taking over our sovereignty.
[01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.710]  The White House, quote, approves. They're now our doctor.
[01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:31.710]  The latest Pfizer Moderna experimental shot that was tested on no humans, but only 10 mice.
[01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:36.710]  This is a total criminal takeover. They're just exercising their power.
[01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:44.710]  So I saw the headline, US government threatened Tucker Carlson and told him not to go to Russia and not enter.
[01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:49.710]  And he didn't give the details when he spoke to a European newspaper of why it happened.
[01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:54.710]  I'm going to give him a call later today and try to find out some more details later today.
[01:07:54.710 --> 01:08:01.710]  But he said that they basically said, you're not a loyal American if you go there and you better not go,
[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:07.710]  which is a threat, a threat by the State Department, a threat by the CIA, because I know what could threaten you.
[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:13.710]  I got a Russian visa about four years ago and I was going to go over there
[01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:17.710]  and basically cover what was going on during Russiagate because I knew it was so ridiculous.
[01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:24.710]  Plus, I've never been to Russia and I got some similar threats and some people reached out to me and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:30.710]  And just from me getting that visa as a journalist, as a media person,
[01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:38.710]  I mean, why is that not a big story? I had the feds try to set me up as a Russian agent and, of course, I blew their cover,
[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:47.710]  went to the FBI and reported the whole thing and filed a report with them to another federal agency or another branch of the FBI.
[01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.710]  You would say, why would you do something like that?
[01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:54.710]  To get it on record, ladies and gentlemen, that I knew they'd done it and I knew what their operation was
[01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:58.710]  and I knew who was behind it so that they were on record that I wasn't going to be set up by them.
[01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:02.710]  So that's how serious this situation is.
[01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:08.710]  That if you go back to the Gulf War or Gulf War II or any of these wars we've had,
[01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:14.710]  during the wars, 60 Minutes and other people go interview Saddam Hussein
[01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:18.710]  or they interview the Iranian mullahs or the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:23.710]  So since when are people not allowed to go interview people?
[01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:30.710]  Since when do they tell the number one talk show host in the English-speaking world, Tucker Carlson, you can't go?
[01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:33.710]  And by the way, Tucker's the most truthful person I've ever known.
[01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:35.710]  I've gotten to know him the last 12 years very well.
[01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:40.710]  Remember he came out a few years ago and said, the NSA is spying on me, a whistleblower told me high level,
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:47.710]  came out in Congress, a month later that indeed they were spying on the emails and phone calls of Tucker Carlson.
[01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:50.710]  Well, what is the NSA doing spying on the American people?
[01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:54.710]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is outrageous.
[01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:58.710]  And NATO and the CIA and all of them are spying on the American people.
[01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.710]  They're censoring the American people.
[01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:03.710]  That came out in Senate hearings just a few weeks ago.
[01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:06.710]  We played clips of it last hour.
[01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:09.710]  If the Russians were trying to invade the U.S., I'd be angry at the Russians.
[01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.710]  If the Russians were spying on me, I'd be angry.
[01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.710]  If the Russians were trying to put me in jail, I'd be mad at them.
[01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.710]  They're not, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.710]  It's the globalists that are running our country into the ground.
[01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:25.710]  So now in the year 2023, Tucker Carlson is being threatened not to go to Russia
[01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:28.710]  and not get his interview with Vladimir Putin.
[01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:31.710]  Obviously he's interviewed all these other world leaders.
[01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.710]  That's what you're supposed to do as a top news anchor.
[01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:37.710]  But because he's more of a populist, because he's anti-war,
[01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.710]  he's basically been given an offer he couldn't refuse.
[01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:46.710]  And Tucker's a tough guy, so I can imagine what they said or what they did.
[01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.710]  Probably something along these lines.
[01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:51.710]  Well, you know, you need to be a loyal American.
[01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:53.710]  Some really bad things can happen if you go talk to him.
[01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:55.710]  You need to think about your family.
[01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.710]  That's how these threats go.
[01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.710]  And he basically said they threatened him
[01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:01.710]  and said that he wouldn't be a loyal American.
[01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:02.710]  Loyal American?
[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:04.710]  People running our country have dissolved our border,
[01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.710]  are massively human trafficking,
[01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.710]  have depleted their strategic oil reserve,
[01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:12.710]  have done all these other countless horrible things to us,
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.710]  and then they sit there while they're globalists
[01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:18.710]  and wage war against America and our families with the Hollywood machine
[01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:20.710]  and try to castrate our children with the whole transgender cult
[01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.710]  and all the rest of the crimes.
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:25.710]  Defunding the police, putting in the Soros DAs,
[01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.710]  releasing violent offenders, putting political dissidents in jail,
[01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:31.710]  set to put our own reporter, Owens Freuer,
[01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:35.710]  in federal prison for his free speech.
[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.710]  And then they point their finger at us and say,
[01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.710]  we're traitors and we work for Russia.
[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.710]  This is asinine.
[01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:45.710]  Hillary Clinton took millions of dollars from the Russians,
[01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.710]  millions from the communist Chinese.
[01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:50.710]  They're the people that have sold us out to foreign interests.
[01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:51.710]  They're the people that have done this,
[01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:55.710]  and everybody is waking up to this.
[01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.710]  So Tucker's tough.
[01:11:56.710 --> 01:12:00.710]  But I wonder who else they'll tell him he can't interview next.
[01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:01.710]  That's what the FBI did
[01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.710]  whenever they called Twitter and others and said,
[01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:04.710]  don't run the Hunter Biden story.
[01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:05.710]  It's fake.
[01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:06.710]  They knew it was real.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.710]  It's called election meddling.
[01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:10.710]  It's called legacy dinosaur media
[01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.710]  that teamed up with the agencies, teamed up with the courts,
[01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.710]  teamed up with the system and law fair
[01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:19.710]  to shut down loyal Americans that are fighting the new world order.
[01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.710]  We are the loyal Americans.
[01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:25.710]  The leftists in this country are useless, idiot, quisling suckers
[01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:29.710]  that serve a multinational black rock corporate takeover of the planet
[01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:30.710]  and our own physical bodies.
[01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:33.710]  A literal depopulation is death call.
[01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:35.710]  So I stand with Tucker Carlson.
[01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:37.710]  I stand with Russell Brand.
[01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.710]  I stand with everyone being persecuted by this deep state.
[01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:43.710]  And don't ever forget Infowars has been persecuted unlike any other organization.
[01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.710]  We're not backing down, but we are targets of this evil group.
[01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.710]  We're loyal Americans, and we need your financial support.
[01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:50.710]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:56.710]  Infowarsstore.com, the trifecta sale, no excuse, DNA force plus, real red pill plus.
[01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.710]  All of these great products, body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.710]  back in stock, 40% off for a limited time,
[01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.710]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.710]  Get a book.
[01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:06.710]  Get a film.
[01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:07.710]  Get a water filtration system.
[01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:08.710]  Get some high-quality herbal food.
[01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:09.710]  Get ready.
[01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:10.710]  Get prepared.
[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:14.710]  Fund the Infowar while taking care of yourself, your health, your family, and more.
[01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:15.710]  A 360 win.
[01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.710]  All the way we lose if you don't take action.
[01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:23.710]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.710]  We're not the communist agents.
[01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.710]  We're not the Russian agents.
[01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:27.710]  We're not the Chinese agents.
[01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.710]  We're not the Nazi agents.
[01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.710]  The globalists are like Specter from James Bond,
[01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.710]  a multinational corporate criminal syndicate
[01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.710]  that works with every evil group they can
[01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:38.710]  to consolidate power and control for themselves.
[01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:41.710]  Ian Fleming was number two in MI6 OSS.
[01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.710]  He wrote the James Bond books, and before he died,
[01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:48.710]  he said Specter is basically a real organization.
[01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:50.710]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:52.710]  That's why Klaus Schwab looks like Dr. Evil
[01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.710]  or looks like Blofeld,
[01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.710]  because it's based on real characters like Klaus Schwab's father,
[01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.710]  who literally was the head of Specter.
[01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:02.710]  You hear me?
[01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:04.710]  This is not fiction.
[01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.710]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:07.710]  This is going down.
[01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:09.710]  MI6 is Specter.
[01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:12.710]  The CIA is Specter.
[01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:13.710]  You understand?
[01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:14.710]  Our government is run by Cobra.
[01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.710]  Call it Specter.
[01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:16.710]  Call it Cobra.
[01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:17.710]  Call it chaos.
[01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:18.710]  Call it Hydra.
[01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:19.710]  Call it wherever you want.
[01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:20.710]  Call it Red Skull.
[01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.710]  It runs things.
[01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:22.710]  It's in control.
[01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:23.710]  It wants to get in your body.
[01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.710]  It wants to hurt you.
[01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:25.710]  It wants to rob you.
[01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:26.710]  It wants to kill you.
[01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.710]  It wants to guinea pig you.
[01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:28.710]  It wants to silence you.
[01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:29.710]  It wants to censor you.
[01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.710]  It wants to destroy you.
[01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:32.710]  Wake up or be destroyed.
[01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:33.710]  Be loyal to humanity.
[01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:34.710]  Be loyal to America.
[01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:35.710]  Be loyal to your children.
[01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:36.710]  Be loyal to the truth.
[01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:37.710]  God bless you all.
[01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:38.710]  Back to Owen Schroyer.
[01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:39.710]  Coming up next segment,
[01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:40.710]  we'll interview Ezra LeVant
[01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:43.710]  on the actual 98-year-old SS Nazi,
[01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:45.710]  part of the same battle group
[01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:48.710]  that actually carried out Holocaust operations in Ukraine.
[01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:51.710]  So this is critical, historic information.
[01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:52.710]  Please stay with us.
[01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:54.710]  Ezra LeVant was known as from Canada.
[01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:55.710]  Let me just add something here.
[01:14:55.710 --> 01:14:56.710]  Some people are going to say,
[01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:57.710]  well, why did you back down
[01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:58.710]  when you got threatened by the feds
[01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.710]  not to go to Russia as a journalist?
[01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:01.710]  Or why did Tucker do it?
[01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:03.710]  Because they turned loose
[01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:05.710]  the whole national security apparatus on you.
[01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.710]  If you haven't been in that position,
[01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:07.710]  you don't know what it's like.
[01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.710]  So I respect Tucker's decision.
[01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:10.710]  That was mine, too,
[01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:13.710]  because it was so weird to be
[01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:14.710]  accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.710]  I knew it was a fraud.
[01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:19.710]  But then as they were arresting all these people
[01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.710]  and, like, doing all this stuff,
[01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:25.710]  I realized they were going to come after me as well.
[01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:26.710]  And so why would I give them that?
[01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.710]  Even though it wasn't true,
[01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:30.710]  it'd be a tool they'd beat me over the head with.
[01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:32.710]  And that's why they called us all Russian agents,
[01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.710]  knowing that they could silence their political opposition.
[01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:36.710]  Now that the public's seen through it,
[01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.710]  I do intend after this war is hopefully over
[01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.710]  before we're all destroyed and killed
[01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.710]  to go to Russia
[01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.710]  and actually enter these people and talk to them.
[01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:45.710]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.710]  It doesn't mean I'm a Russian agent.
[01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.710]  I've never been to Israel.
[01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.710]  I want to go to Israel.
[01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:50.710]  It doesn't mean I'm an Israeli agent.
[01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:52.710]  I've never been to Egypt.
[01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:53.710]  I want to go to Egypt.
[01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:54.710]  I want to see the pyramids.
[01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:56.710]  It doesn't mean I'm an Egyptian agent.
[01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:58.710]  And the idea that Americans can't do this
[01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:01.710]  by the CIA-run government is just preposterous.
[01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:03.710]  But Tucker's been honest about it.
[01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:04.710]  I've been honest about it.
[01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.710]  This is a big deal.
[01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:08.710]  Back to the O.N.T.R.E. and the live broadcast.
[01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:12.710]  All right, so we are now back live
[01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:15.710]  inside the InfoWars world headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:17.710]  O.N.T.R.E. are taking over.
[01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:20.710]  We are going to be joined by Ezra Levant
[01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.710]  out of Canada,
[01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:26.710]  responding to this Canadian parliament phenomenon
[01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:30.710]  of celebrating an actual Nazi.
[01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:36.710]  Now, I do want to preface that
[01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:40.710]  with some of the other developing news
[01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:44.710]  dealing with Russia, dealing with the war in Ukraine,
[01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:49.710]  and now how there's news reports hitting the mainstream media
[01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:51.710]  that we've been reporting for months or years
[01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.710]  that, yes, there are Americans fighting Russians in Ukraine,
[01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:57.710]  but there's a silver lining to that.
[01:16:57.710 --> 01:17:01.710]  And there's a danger to it as well.
[01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:03.710]  And I'll explain that.
[01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:05.710]  But also it comes out this weekend
[01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:08.710]  in a 60 Minutes report
[01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:15.710]  that we're not just funding Ukraine's war.
[01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:18.710]  We're not just sending them money for war.
[01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:20.710]  Wherever the money goes, we don't know.
[01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:21.710]  There's no oversight.
[01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:22.710]  It could go right into Zelensky's pockets.
[01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:26.710]  It could go right into his family's pockets,
[01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:27.710]  his oligarch's pockets.
[01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.710]  That's what people think is really going on.
[01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.710]  Maybe it comes right back to the U.S.
[01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:35.710]  Maybe it goes right in congressmen and women's pockets.
[01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.710]  And maybe that's why they voted against the oversight.
[01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:39.710]  But we don't know.
[01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:40.710]  But no, it's not just that.
[01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:45.710]  We now find out that we are funding
[01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.710]  Ukrainian infrastructure and agriculture.
[01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:53.710]  So while the Biden administration targets our farmers,
[01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.710]  while the Biden administration targets our infrastructure
[01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:58.710]  and our agriculture,
[01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:02.710]  it's now building and funding Ukraine's.
[01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:06.710]  This is just beyond ludicrous stuff.
[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:12.710]  And every American should be outraged at this betrayal.
[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:14.710]  But we'll get to that
[01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:17.710]  and we'll build that up
[01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.710]  before we get to Ezra Levant.
[01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:25.710]  But we had it on the Drudge Report top story.
[01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:31.710]  It was syndicated over all the mainstream news websites last night.
[01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:33.710]  Donald Trump beating Joe Biden by 10 points.
[01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:39.710]  Now, we have to remember political polls are propaganda.
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.710]  Political polls are propaganda.
[01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:48.710]  Donald Trump has always been ahead of Joe Biden.
[01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:54.710]  They use political polls as deception and disinformation and propaganda.
[01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:56.710]  So considering that,
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:19:00.710]  why are they now telling you Trump is polling 10 points ahead of Biden?
[01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:03.710]  Well, because they're getting ready to remove Biden.
[01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.710]  But the Democrats don't want to do it themselves.
[01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:07.710]  So they're going to use the media
[01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:08.710]  and they're going to use Kevin McCarthy,
[01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.710]  who I believe is now doing the bidding of the Democrats.
[01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:15.710]  And that's why he's now decided to roll out the impeachment inquiry.
[01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:18.710]  Because now the Democrats are ready to get Biden out of the way
[01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:22.710]  and bring in Gavin Newsom, Michelle Obama, who knows.
[01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:26.710]  Won't be RFK Jr., the real candidate, the good candidate,
[01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:27.710]  who they should be getting behind.
[01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:30.710]  But because he's against the military industrial complex
[01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:33.710]  and because he's against the pharmaceutical industrial complex
[01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.710]  and because he's his own man,
[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:36.710]  the Democrats aren't interested in him.
[01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.710]  So they're going to make sure that he gets stabbed in the back
[01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:42.710]  and cannot get the nomination.
[01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:44.710]  But if it were a legitimate party,
[01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:46.710]  it would be RFK Jr.
[01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:48.710]  If we still had a United States of America,
[01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:52.710]  it would be RFK Jr. versus Donald J. Trump.
[01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:53.710]  But we don't.
[01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:54.710]  We live in a corrupt country,
[01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:57.710]  and so they're trying to keep Trump and RFK Jr. off the ballot
[01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.710]  because that's what the people want,
[01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.710]  not the deep state.
[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:04.710]  So Trump has always been ahead of Biden.
[01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:07.710]  And we can make all the jokes like,
[01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:09.710]  well, show me a Biden rally,
[01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:10.710]  show me a Biden hat.
[01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.710]  Of course they don't exist.
[01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:14.710]  And they just want this.
[01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:18.710]  They don't even want the real world to reflect
[01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:20.710]  the political world,
[01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:22.710]  even though that would be common sense.
[01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:24.710]  Yeah, hey, I don't know a single Biden supporter.
[01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:26.710]  Hey, I don't know a single Biden voter.
[01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:28.710]  He doesn't have any rallies.
[01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:30.710]  He doesn't have any merchandise.
[01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:32.710]  I know a lot of Trump voters and supporters.
[01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:34.710]  I see Trump hats and shirts and rallies all the time,
[01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:35.710]  but nothing for Biden.
[01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.710]  Oh, but he got 81 million votes.
[01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.710]  He's the most popular president of all time.
[01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:40.710]  And then overnight they just say,
[01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:43.710]  oh, Trump's leading Biden by 10 points.
[01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.710]  It's all political propaganda.
[01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:48.710]  But here's more proof.
[01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:51.710]  About half an hour ago,
[01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:57.710]  Donald Trump boarded Trump Force One
[01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:00.710]  in route to South Carolina.
[01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.710]  President Trump is going to be having a rally
[01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:06.710]  in Somerville, South Carolina.
[01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:10.710]  And of course, the tickets sold out in seconds.
[01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:13.710]  And before the sun even rose,
[01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:18.710]  people were lined up around the arena.
[01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.710]  Show me B-roll of clip one, please.
[01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.710]  Now, again, this isn't to say,
[01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:29.710]  well, let's put all of our eggs in this basket.
[01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:32.710]  This totally proves that Trump is more popular than Biden.
[01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.710]  But let's be just honest here.
[01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:37.710]  Biden couldn't do this if he paid people to show up.
[01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:39.710]  And they've tried that, by the way,
[01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:41.710]  and people still don't show up.
[01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.710]  They try to get concerts.
[01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.710]  They try to do some of the most popular bands,
[01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:48.710]  like Foo Fighters,
[01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:51.710]  or they get Taylor Swift to do Democrat rally concerts
[01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:54.710]  so that they can actually load an arena
[01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:56.710]  or a venue with people and then say,
[01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:58.710]  see, this is a Democrat rally.
[01:21:58.710 --> 01:21:59.710]  No, it's a Taylor Swift concert.
[01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:01.710]  It's a rock concert.
[01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.710]  It's not actually a political rally
[01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:06.710]  if the musicians weren't there performing,
[01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:07.710]  nobody would show up.
[01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.710]  They do the same thing here in Texas.
[01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:10.710]  They get Willie Nelson to perform,
[01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.710]  and then they say, look, it's a Beto rally.
[01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.710]  No, it's a Willie Nelson show.
[01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:20.710]  And it appears now Trump has landed in South Carolina.
[01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:24.710]  But so you can see that video.
[01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:26.710]  You can see in that video
[01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:30.710]  that is basically dawn this morning,
[01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:35.710]  and there's already hundreds, if not thousands of people lined up.
[01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.710]  And I am curious here, guys, can we get audio of that?
[01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:41.710]  This is all new breaking news right now.
[01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:44.710]  Donald Trump getting off Trump Force One.
[01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.710]  Do we have that audio, guys?
[01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:48.710]  Let me hear what Trump had to say
[01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:50.710]  as he got off of Trump Force One
[01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:52.710]  headed to a rally in South Carolina.
[01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:55.710]  How you doing, Mr. President?
[01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:56.710]  Nice to see you.
[01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:57.710]  Nice to see you.
[01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:58.710]  What's going on?
[01:22:58.710 --> 01:22:59.710]  Well, we're glad you're here in South Carolina.
[01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:01.710]  I am indeed.
[01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.710]  We're leading by, I guess, 42 points.
[01:23:03.710 --> 01:23:04.710]  That's a lot.
[01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:07.710]  And we're leading by a lot,
[01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:09.710]  according to the Washington Post, ABC,
[01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:12.710]  against probably the worst president,
[01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:14.710]  definitely the worst president, I'd say,
[01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:16.710]  in the history of our country.
[01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:17.710]  He's destroying our country.
[01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:18.710]  So we have to change it.
[01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:19.710]  See you later.
[01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:20.710]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:22.710]  OK, so again, you have the audience there
[01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.710]  already surrounding around the venue
[01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.710]  before the sun rises.
[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.710]  But where's the Joe Biden rally?
[01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:28.710]  Where's the Joe Biden hat?
[01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:29.710]  Where's the Joe Biden T-shirt?
[01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:30.710]  Where's the Joe Biden support?
[01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:31.710]  A voter?
[01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:32.710]  Anywhere?
[01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:33.710]  Nowhere.
[01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:34.710]  Just the paid ones.
[01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:35.710]  Literally just the paid ones.
[01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.710]  And we got a story about one of his
[01:23:36.710 --> 01:23:38.710]  paid supporters, by the way,
[01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:39.710]  coming up later today.
[01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:41.710]  I've got a ton of news we're going
[01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.710]  to be covering on The War Room today.
[01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:45.710]  They're going full Jussie Smollett.
[01:23:45.710 --> 01:23:47.710]  It's really a disgusting, despicable thing.
[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:49.710]  But so there you go.
[01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:52.710]  Now, let me circle back to the issue
[01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:54.710]  that we're going to be discussing
[01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:57.710]  with Ezra Levant coming up here
[01:23:57.710 --> 01:24:00.710]  in just about 10 minutes.
[01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:04.710]  And we're kind of juggling here
[01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:06.710]  and taking cues in live time.
[01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:07.710]  This is all live broadcast.
[01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:08.710]  We don't have teleprompters,
[01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.710]  nothing scripted.
[01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:10.710]  So sometimes I just got to kind of
[01:24:10.710 --> 01:24:13.710]  do an air check with my crew here.
[01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.710]  Are we going straight through
[01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:15.710]  to this interview or is there
[01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:16.710]  a break before that?
[01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.710]  OK, so I guess.
[01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:29.710]  OK, so let me let me do this then.
[01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:32.710]  Before Ezra Levant joins.
[01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:36.710]  Because you really have gone
[01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:38.710]  into full Twilight Zone,
[01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:40.710]  we've gone even beyond
[01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:41.710]  the Twilight Zone,
[01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:42.710]  if that's even possible,
[01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.710]  where you have Canadian Parliament
[01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:48.710]  with Zelensky giving standing ovations
[01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:50.710]  to literal Nazis.
[01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:52.710]  And see, I don't even like
[01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:53.710]  it's so strange because.
[01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:55.710]  Oh, Trump's a Nazi.
[01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:57.710]  Trump supporters are Nazis.
[01:24:57.710 --> 01:24:58.710]  They do honk your horn,
[01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:00.710]  which means hail Hitler.
[01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.710]  I mean, these leftists
[01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:03.710]  have completely lost their mind.
[01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:05.710]  And what they do is they lie
[01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.710]  to hurt their political opposition.
[01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:09.710]  They lie and they do
[01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:10.710]  rape accusations.
[01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:11.710]  They lie and they do
[01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:12.710]  Nazi accusations.
[01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:13.710]  So it's like I don't want
[01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:14.710]  to be a part of the boy
[01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.710]  that cried wolf phenomenon,
[01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:18.710]  even though it's the wolf.
[01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:20.710]  But OK, the left has been
[01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:22.710]  screaming Nazi Nazi Nazi
[01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:25.710]  Hitler Nazi.
[01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:29.710]  But but OK, that's
[01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:31.710]  that's not a real Nazi.
[01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:32.710]  Trump is not a Nazi.
[01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:34.710]  Trump supporters are not Nazi.
[01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:35.710]  Everybody knows that.
[01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.710]  But it's like, oh, OK,
[01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:39.710]  here's the actual Nazi.
[01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:41.710]  But it's like, OK,
[01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:42.710]  it's the boy that cried wolf.
[01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:44.710]  Oh, there's the actual wolf.
[01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:46.710]  But nobody believes me.
[01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:47.710]  So I don't want to be
[01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.710]  made a fool of up here
[01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:50.710]  screaming wolf, wolf, wolf.
[01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:51.710]  And then everybody laughs at me
[01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:52.710]  and doesn't believe me
[01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:53.710]  because they've been lying about
[01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:55.710]  a wolf for this entire time.
[01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:56.710]  But it's like, no,
[01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:58.710]  that's the actual wolf.
[01:25:58.710 --> 01:25:59.710]  Yeah, the wolf is coming
[01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:00.710]  to eat your kids.
[01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:01.710]  The wolf is coming to eat
[01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:03.710]  your eat your sheep.
[01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:05.710]  The wolf is coming
[01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:06.710]  to tear apart your livestock.
[01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:07.710]  I mean, it's just like
[01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:08.710]  this is the wolf.
[01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:10.710]  This is the Nazi.
[01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.710]  You can't even make it up.
[01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.710]  But but here's some of the
[01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:16.710]  here's here's some of the preface.
[01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:17.710]  Russia issues new
[01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:18.710]  World War three alert.
[01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:19.710]  Reckless Western
[01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:20.710]  politicians have forgotten
[01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:21.710]  about self-preservation.
[01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.710]  See, I don't know if that's
[01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.710]  an accurate analysis, though.
[01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:25.710]  I think they're
[01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:27.710]  in a self-preservation mode.
[01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:29.710]  They're blackmailed
[01:26:29.710 --> 01:26:31.710]  and they're already corrupted.
[01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:32.710]  And they think the only way
[01:26:32.710 --> 01:26:34.710]  to engage in self-preservation
[01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.710]  is to just blow the planet up.
[01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:37.710]  And they think the only way
[01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:39.710]  to engage in self-preservation
[01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:40.710]  from all the crimes and
[01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:41.710]  corruption that they've engaged
[01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:42.710]  in is to just blow the
[01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.710]  planet up and destroy the
[01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:44.710]  country so that there is
[01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:46.710]  no justice system and nobody
[01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:47.710]  can come after them
[01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:48.710]  for what they've done
[01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:49.710]  for crimes against
[01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:51.710]  humanity and war crimes.
[01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:53.710]  No, it's not about
[01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:54.710]  self-preservation.
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:55.710]  It's that they've
[01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:56.710]  gone psychotic mad
[01:26:56.710 --> 01:26:58.710]  in their corruption
[01:26:58.710 --> 01:26:59.710]  and they don't give
[01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:01.710]  a damn about the country.
[01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:03.710]  So sure, blow it up
[01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:04.710]  in a war.
[01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:05.710]  Sure, start a war with Russia.
[01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:06.710]  They don't care.
[01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.710]  They hate the country.
[01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:08.710]  They take statues of
[01:27:08.710 --> 01:27:09.710]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington,
[01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:10.710]  Theodore Roosevelt
[01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:11.710]  and get rid of them.
[01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:12.710]  They wipe their ass
[01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:13.710]  with the Bill of Rights
[01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:15.710]  and the Constitution.
[01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:17.710]  Senators shocked by
[01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:18.710]  classified briefing on Ukraine,
[01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:19.710]  Warhawks went blank check
[01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:20.710]  with no victory in sight.
[01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:21.710]  There is no victory in sight.
[01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:22.710]  All there is is World War III
[01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:24.710]  nuclear holocaust.
[01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.710]  And they know that.
[01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:26.710]  That's been the case
[01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:27.710]  since day one.
[01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.710]  They're stealing the money.
[01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:33.710]  They're selling out the country.
[01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:35.710]  US Army Hospital in Germany
[01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:36.710]  is treating Americans hurt
[01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:37.710]  fighting in Ukraine.
[01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:38.710]  Now folks, let me tell you
[01:27:38.710 --> 01:27:40.710]  why this is dangerous.
[01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:42.710]  These are not
[01:27:44.710 --> 01:27:45.710]  these are not official
[01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:46.710]  armed forces.
[01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:47.710]  They are not in uniform
[01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:49.710]  and so the Geneva Convention
[01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.710]  codes do not apply.
[01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:52.710]  These are contractors.
[01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:55.710]  And regardless
[01:27:57.710 --> 01:27:59.710]  the world and Russians
[01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:00.710]  see this as a direct
[01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:01.710]  act of war.
[01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:03.710]  Even though they're
[01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:04.710]  not in uniform
[01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:05.710]  they understand what's
[01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:06.710]  really going on.
[01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:07.710]  That's just an end around.
[01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.710]  But you do understand
[01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.710]  how dangerous that is
[01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:10.710]  to send contractors
[01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:12.710]  over there out of uniform
[01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:13.710]  to fight Russians.
[01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:15.710]  And then we get
[01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:16.710]  another slap in the face.
[01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:18.710]  60 Minutes report
[01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:19.710]  on US funding of Ukraine.
[01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:21.710]  US paying salaries
[01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:23.710]  of 57,000 first responders
[01:28:23.710 --> 01:28:25.710]  subsidizing small businesses
[01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:26.710]  in war-torn country
[01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:27.710]  funding agriculture
[01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:29.710]  and infrastructure.
[01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:31.710]  Meanwhile
[01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:32.710]  our infrastructure
[01:28:32.710 --> 01:28:33.710]  is falling apart
[01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:34.710]  and the Democrats
[01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:35.710]  are attacking farmers
[01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:36.710]  attacking agriculture
[01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:37.710]  and attacking our
[01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:38.710]  energy grid.
[01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:40.710]  And making sure
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.710]  but see
[01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:42.710]  they really think
[01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:43.710]  that they can just
[01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:44.710]  blow everything up
[01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:45.710]  and then they're
[01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:46.710]  going to have
[01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:47.710]  and Marina Abramovich
[01:28:47.710 --> 01:28:48.710]  going to Ukraine
[01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:49.710]  and they'll rebuild that
[01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:50.710]  and they'll take
[01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:51.710]  all the money
[01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:52.710]  from those deals.
[01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:53.710]  And I don't think
[01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:54.710]  the world is
[01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:55.710]  going to accept that
[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:56.710]  and I don't think
[01:28:56.710 --> 01:28:57.710]  Russia is going
[01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:58.710]  to take that either.
[01:28:58.710 --> 01:28:59.710]  Don't lie down
[01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:00.710]  and take it.

[01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:01.710]  Yeah, so my name
[01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:02.710]  is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:03.710]  How do I write
[01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:04.710]  all the books that I do?
[01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:05.710]  Four books with
[01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:06.710]  Dr. Judy Mikovits,
[01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:07.710]  four books with
[01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:08.710]  Project Veritas
[01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:09.710]  whistleblowers,
[01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:11.710]  two books with Alex Jones.
[01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:12.710]  That's because I use
[01:32:12.710 --> 01:32:14.710]  Brain Force every day.
[01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:15.710]  What I always need
[01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:16.710]  is I always need
[01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:17.710]  some sort of boost
[01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:18.710]  in the morning.
[01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:19.710]  And so, you know,
[01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:20.710]  I try to exercise,
[01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:21.710]  eat well,
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:22.710]  take good vitamins.
[01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:23.710]  But the one thing
[01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.710]  that I have really found
[01:32:25.710 --> 01:32:26.710]  that makes a difference
[01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:27.710]  is Brain Force.
[01:32:27.710 --> 01:32:29.710]  I'll take Brain Force
[01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.710]  in the morning
[01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:31.710]  right before I go
[01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:32.710]  to my computer
[01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:33.710]  and I'm good for
[01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:34.710]  the next four or five hours
[01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:35.710]  writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:37.710]  So it really is true
[01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:38.710]  that Brain Force
[01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:40.710]  is something I use every day
[01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:41.710]  and it helps me
[01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:42.710]  with my writing.
[01:32:42.710 --> 01:32:43.710]  All right, we love you.
[01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:44.710]  We'll be right back.

[01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:48.710]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:49.710]  We'll be right back
[01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:50.710]  with our number two.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:07.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:18.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:28.280]  So the situation in Ukraine has people fuming, the threat of World War III, nuclear holocaust,
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:33.880]  the theft of our money, the depletion of our weapons, and just the outright lies.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.960]  And then adding to it, saluting Nazi soldiers.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:52.160]  And then this report from 60 Minutes over the weekend.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.680]  American taxpayers are financing more than just weapons.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:02.220]  We discovered the US government's buying seeds and fertilizer for Ukrainian farmers.
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:09.460]  And covering the salaries of Ukraine's first responders, all 57,000 of them.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:15.020]  That includes the team that trains this rescue dog named Joy to comb through the wreckage
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:20.300]  of Russian strikes looking for survivors.
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:25.980]  And the US also funds the divers, who we saw clearing unexploded ammunition from
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.660]  the country's rivers to make them safe again for swimming and fishing.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.900]  Russia's invasion shrank Ukraine's economy by about a third.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.740]  We were surprised to find that to keep it afloat, the US government is subsidizing
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:44.380]  small businesses.
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:56.660]  So you're paying Ukrainian law enforcement, firefighters, farmers, agriculture, infrastructure.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.280]  Meanwhile, our police are getting defunded.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.120]  Our infrastructure is falling apart.
[01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:08.590]  In fact, they're shutting down, in many ways, our infrastructure.
[01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:12.070]  They're shutting down our agriculture in the name of climate change.
[01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:18.530]  And then Zelensky, who might be the focal point that kicks off World War III, is lecturing
[01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:24.630]  you about how you're not doing enough for climate change.
[01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:27.250]  Can it get more offensive?
[01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:35.370]  Can it get more offensive as Bidenomics crushes your economy, but we send $200 billion to Ukraine?
[01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:39.370]  U.S. soldiers treated worse than garbage while White House keeps throwing money at
[01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:40.370]  Ukraine.
[01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:45.010]  Yeah, the only time that this current military leadership cares about a U.S. soldier is
[01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:51.270]  if he has a gay flag, if he wears a puppy sex kink leather daddy outfit, or if he's
[01:35:51.270 --> 01:36:00.030]  a hardcore leftist liberal, or if he's a trans woman that gets a job as the paid-for propagandist
[01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.790]  in Ukraine.
[01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:06.750]  Can it get any more offensive?
[01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:11.710]  I'm sad to say that it can.
[01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:17.590]  I'm sad to say that it can.
[01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:26.950]  Here's a video of not one standing ovation for a literal Nazi, but two, two.
[01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:33.670]  And again, I have to report this news with like, I don't even know how to explain it
[01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:39.150]  because we're now part of the boy that cried wolf phenomenon, except we haven't been
[01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:40.750]  crying wolf.
[01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.670]  We're actually now seeing the wolf.
[01:36:42.670 --> 01:36:50.110]  But nobody, it's like, you can't even believe it because psychotic leftists and liberals
[01:36:50.110 --> 01:36:54.550]  have been calling everybody they don't like a Nazi for the last five, six, seven years.
[01:36:54.550 --> 01:37:06.310]  I mean, we're talking lowest IQ level of political discourse, lowest IQ level of insults.
[01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:13.950]  And yet now here we are funding actual Nazis in Ukraine, the Azov battalion, they run around
[01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:21.750]  waving Nazi flags, they tattoo swastikas on their arm.
[01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:26.790]  And now you have Canadian parliament with Zelensky honoring an actual Ukraine, not one
[01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:32.350]  standing ovation, but two here in clip number seven.
[01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:38.470]  We have here in the chamber today, Ukrainian Canadians, Ukrainian Canadian world veteran
[01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:45.270]  from the second world war who fought the Ukrainian independence against the Russians
[01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:49.870]  and continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98.
[01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:54.270]  See, pause it real quick, pause it real quick.
[01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:59.990]  I look, the speaker at parliament there, I'm not going to pretend like I'm the expert
[01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:02.590]  and Ezra Levant is, is supposed to be joining us here.
[01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:03.470]  There's, there's a delay.
[01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:05.590]  I think he's got something going on in an emergency.
[01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:07.470]  I hope he can still join us.
[01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:13.470]  But the speaker of the parliament, they're just, they, they don't really, they, they
[01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:16.630]  play it down the middle and they basically just read what's in front of them.
[01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:20.030]  So I don't know if the speaker there has any clue about what he's doing or what
[01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:22.830]  he's reading or even history in general.
[01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.390]  But here's the problem.
[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:27.190]  Most Americans don't even understand history.
[01:38:27.190 --> 01:38:28.830]  And there's multiple reasons for this.
[01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:32.590]  A, the education system is failing us.
[01:38:32.590 --> 01:38:35.190]  B, they just don't care about it.
[01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:40.790]  In fact, the education system might be misrepresenting even the history as well.
[01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:42.350]  But so listen to what he says.
[01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:48.510]  Let me play this again because it's incredible that he's so ignorant and that
[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:52.230]  the people are so ignorant that they don't even understand what he just said.
[01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:55.030]  Play this introduction again, and I want you to listen carefully.
[01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:59.070]  Again, if you know history, you know what he just said.
[01:38:59.070 --> 01:39:01.590]  If you're ignorant of history, it just flew right over your head,
[01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:04.510]  apparently like it did he and the rest of this Canadian parliament.
[01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:05.990]  Play this introduction again.
[01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:07.790]  And I want you to see if you catch on here.
[01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:09.390]  Go ahead and play it again.
[01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:12.830]  We have here in the chamber today, Ukrainian Canadians,
[01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:17.910]  Ukrainian Canadian world veteran from the second world war who fought
[01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:22.070]  the Ukrainian independence against the Russians.
[01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:23.350]  Okay, pause it.
[01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:26.390]  So it actually, now that I'm watching it, it looks like he might've realized what
[01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:30.470]  he just said there because he kind of pauses and goes, whoa, oops.
[01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:36.110]  What, what folks that, that is the Azov battalion.
[01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:39.670]  That was the Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:44.190]  So, so it's almost like he just realized what he said, reading that speech.
[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.790]  It's almost like after he read it, he realized what he actually just said.
[01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:50.670]  He says that the Ukrainians fighting the Russians.
[01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:54.550]  Folks, that was the Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:58.630]  So for those that don't understand history, let's, let's even
[01:39:58.630 --> 01:40:00.910]  paint it with a broader brush.
[01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:03.030]  Guys, go ahead and look it up right now.
[01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:06.070]  How many Russians died in world war II?
[01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:07.630]  Let's just do this in real time.
[01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:08.870]  We'll just do a history lesson here.
[01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:12.870]  I'm not a history buff, but I mean, I, I passed history class.
[01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:16.590]  I guess I'm, I consider myself lucky and blessed enough that I actually
[01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:19.630]  had good history professors that actually knew history and they
[01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:21.190]  didn't even go off the textbook.
[01:40:21.190 --> 01:40:22.670]  I mean, I had history professors in college.
[01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:25.790]  I remember they were like, yeah, the textbooks basically lie to you about
[01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:26.510]  history.
[01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:28.990]  And so they would just teach history.
[01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:30.670]  They wouldn't even go into the textbook because they were like, yeah,
[01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:32.310]  the textbook isn't even accurate.
[01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:38.270]  But so, so the Soviet union, Russia lost 27 million people during world
[01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:43.710]  war II, including 8.7 military and 19 million civilians.
[01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:48.310]  So rush, there were more Russians that died in world war II than any other
[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.750]  country.
[01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:53.230]  And I believe, and guys look this one up too.
[01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:55.190]  I believe it was more than a million,
[01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:58.230]  not even 2 million.
[01:40:58.670 --> 01:41:01.070]  How many Russians died when they took Berlin?
[01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:05.470]  So let's go and plug that one in now major pivot point,
[01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:08.270]  major victory point for world war II, defeating the Nazis.
[01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:09.950]  It was the Russians.
[01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:13.550]  And I believe it was more than a million Russians died when, when
[01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:17.090]  basically they concluded the war in Berlin and put an end to the
[01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.530]  Nazis.
[01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:19.290]  That was the Russians.
[01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:22.330]  That was the Russians.
[01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:32.290]  So let's see there, but I believe it was over a million and they took
[01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:39.570]  Berlin and it was one of the final blows to Hitler's regime and the
[01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:41.690]  national socialist workers party.
[01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:42.770]  Okay.
[01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:45.690]  So maybe I'm thinking of a different battle then they're saying it was
[01:41:45.690 --> 01:41:46.730]  80,000 here.
[01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:52.850]  The point is maybe it was Stalingrad.
[01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:55.650]  Maybe it was some other German battle.
[01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:59.850]  The point is millions of Russians died defeating the Nazis.
[01:42:01.450 --> 01:42:05.890]  And that was just on one day, 80,000 died on, on May 2nd, 1945, one
[01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:08.250]  day, 80,000 Russians died.
[01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:12.290]  So I might be thinking about the longer, the largest number in Germany.
[01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:19.770]  The point is more Russians died, defeating the Nazis than any other country.
[01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:25.410]  And it was a group of Ukrainian Nazis that were still fighting the
[01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:28.490]  Russians, that there were still that blood between them and the
[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:29.810]  Russians to this day.
[01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:34.050]  Yes, Stalingrad 750,000.
[01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:35.970]  So, so, but the point is clear.
[01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:41.450]  So he goes up there and he says, he helped fight the Russians.
[01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:44.050]  The Russians defeated the Nazis.
[01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:47.050]  Like you are out there promoting Nazism.
[01:42:47.050 --> 01:42:49.530]  I think he, after he read it, you kind of tell, he was like, whoa,
[01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:50.650]  oops, what did I just read?
[01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:53.450]  And so now they're cheering literal Nazis.
[01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:54.770]  And I have to give this history lesson.
[01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:57.210]  I didn't even get to them standing ovation for this clown.
[01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:59.810]  Bodies is back.

[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:07.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:38.540]  So working on getting Israel Avant, he's had an emergency come up, we're not sure
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:41.900]  if he'll be able to join us, but we will hopefully be hearing from him soon.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:52.740]  We also have Edward Dowd coming up in the third hour, but again, it's just like you hear the
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:56.980]  Twilight Zone music in the background or you hear the record skip and you can see it.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:01.300]  I think you could see it in the parliament speaker's face once he read that.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:05.120]  He goes, and he helped fight the Russians and he kind of paused and like took back
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.560]  a little bit like, wait, the Russians were our allies.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:21.480]  The Russians defeated the Nazis, what, wait, there are serious historical debates that go
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.200]  on who was more imperative in defeating the Nazis.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:30.020]  Was it the USA or was it the Russians?
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:33.260]  And you could argue it was the Russians and they suffered more loss of life and it's
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.260]  really not even close.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:40.200]  I mean, that's the look of a man who just realized he read a script supporting a Nazi.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.520]  I mean, that's the look on his face right there.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.160]  Now, again, you have to understand the way the speaker in parliament works is they're
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.440]  just basically like a robot.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.320]  They just read it and call it right down the middle.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.720]  They don't get political at all.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.880]  They don't show any sides or any favoritism at all.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.720]  They just go up there and read what they're supposed to read and try to maintain decorum.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:05.380]  But yeah, buddy, you just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:11.220]  You just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:15.140]  So let's play it one more time and I'll shut up and you can listen to Canadian
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:20.420]  parliament with Vladimir Zelensky giving two standing ovations to a literal Nazi,
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.340]  not a leftist.
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.660]  I accused everybody I disagree with them being a Nazi.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:25.820]  Everybody wearing a red hat is a Nazi.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.880]  Everybody that wears an American flag is a Nazi, even though it was the Americans
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.640]  and our great-grandfathers that defeated the Nazis and many of them died
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.640]  and D-Day and everything.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.840]  No, no, no, not like that, like a literal Nazi.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.640]  So here you go.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  Let's play the whole thing.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.480]  The speaker of parliament realizing that he just read a highlight reel of a Nazi
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.400]  and then these people give him two standing ovations.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.400]  Go ahead.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.000]  We have here in the chamber today, Ukrainian-Canadians,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.080]  Ukrainian-Canadian world veteran from the second world war who fought
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:56.860]  the Ukrainian independence against the Russians.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.860]  Nope.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.860]  Nope.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:01.420]  He just realized what he read.
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.420]  Even at his age of 98.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.420]  Pause it again.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.420]  This is too rich.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.420]  This is actually hilarious.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:09.420]  He realizes what he read.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.460]  Did you see the reaction there?
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:14.620]  He realizes what he just read.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.400]  The Russians were our allies.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.420]  The Russians defeated the Nazis.
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.280]  I just read a highlight reel supporting a Nazi.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.040]  You watch his face.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:27.860]  First he gets confused and then he realizes he's like, he fought the Russians and then
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:32.100]  his eyebrows perk up and his head rears back and he's like, holy smokes.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.980]  I just read a highlight reel for a Nazi.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:34.980]  All right.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.340]  I promise this isn't the last time I'm going to play it.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:37.740]  This is just too rich to me.
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:39.060]  This is just too rich to me.
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:46.380]  He realizes that he just read a script promoting and hyping up a literal Nazi.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.300]  I mean, folks, we are just in complete clown world.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:51.860]  Just, okay, I'm going to shut my mic off.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:52.860]  Here you go.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.120]  Nazi, Canadian parliament, two rounds of applause.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.960]  We have here in the chamber today, Ukraine, just watch the face.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:50:59.960]  Just please watch the face.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:00.960]  It's priceless.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.320]  World veteran from the second world war who fought the Ukrainian independence against
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:13.700]  the Russians and continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98.
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:30.900]  Yeah, so it goes on forever and then it's like, you know, this is what they do at
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:34.380]  like ball games, like a baseball game, a guy hits a third home run or has a big home
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:38.520]  run and do a standing ovation and then he walks on the dugout and then they do another
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.520]  standing ovation.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.220]  It's like, yeah, he's a hero.
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.280]  We want a curtain call.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  And now they do it for Nazis.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.880]  Uh, Ezra LaVant, I thank you for joining us.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.560]  I know, uh, you've got some other stuff going on.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.520]  I want to give you the floor here because here's some of the headlines in response.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.880]  Apology demanded after MPs honor man who fought four Nazis.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.680]  Who is Yaroslav Hunk ex Waffen SS member gets applauded in Canadian parliament.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.900]  Trudeau and Zelensky honor 98 year old veteran who fought alongside Nazis and SS division.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:08.220]  All right, we're beyond the pale total Twilight zone.
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:11.260]  Ezra LaVant, your response.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:16.100]  You know, Trudeau calls everyone he doesn't like a Nazi and yet he is the first Canadian
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:20.860]  prime minister in history or first democratic leader in the world that I know of that
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:26.300]  literally invited a Nazi to, to attend parliament and he got a standing ovation and I'm
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:32.520]  not talking about a conscripted guy or an enlisted man, you know, low down in the pyramid
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:34.120]  of the Nazi Wehrmacht.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:38.840]  I'm talking about someone who volunteered to be part of the SS.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:43.440]  That's the nastiest, most brutal fighting force in the Nazi regime.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.400]  Those are the folks who would hunt for Jews in the attics.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.480]  Those are the folks who would shoot people and dump them in a mass grave.
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:51.520]  That's the Nazi Waffen SS.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.400]  They actually trained at Dachau.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:53:00.360]  They took orders directly from Germany and this guy sneaked into Canada about 70 years
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.620]  ago by lying about his past.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:07.660]  He said he wasn't with the 14th Waffen, the battalion, he was with the first Ukrainian
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.660]  battalion.
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:13.580]  He lied, he faked the name of his group so he could come to Canada.
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:18.700]  Now Owen, he lived a quiet life for 70 years, keeping a low profile.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:23.660]  Maybe he was worried that some Mossad Nazi hunters would find them, kidnap them and
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:27.300]  bring them to Israel for a trial like they did for Adolf Eichmann.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:32.320]  So he lives his whole life in Canada, he's 98, there aren't many of these guys left.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.920]  Then suddenly he gets a phone call from Trudeau's office saying, come on down to parliament,
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.320]  you're actually a hero.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.280]  I mean, he's got to be thinking Adolf Hitler would be so proud of me now.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.840]  And not a single journalist and not a single politician, not a single person in the establishment
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:49.140]  said, what?
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:55.960]  If this guy was fighting against the Russians in 43, 44, 45, what side was he on?
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.100]  Because the only people fighting against the Soviet Union then were the Nazis.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:05.580]  Imagine the word trickery necessary to get this guy in and don't tell me that Trudeau
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.580]  didn't know.
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:11.140]  I heard your analogy with baseball Owen, but this is more like a State of the Union address.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.840]  When the president calls out this guy in the crowd, an army veteran calls out that
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.560]  guy in the crowd, you know, a small businessman, they know exactly who he was.
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:25.920]  He was vetted, he was their hero and he thought, and they just thought they could get away
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.920]  with it.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.960]  But independent journalists blew the whistle, not the regime media Owen, independent journalists.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.380]  You know why?
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.740]  Because the rest of the regime media is in on it.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:41.340]  Yeah, the people that cry Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, when someone disagrees with them are now
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:42.780]  celebrating a literal Nazi.
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:47.320]  I just, I can't even believe now it's the, it's the total boy that cried wolf phenomenon.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.880]  But you know, if I'm a body language reader, there's two, there's two moments that have
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:52.600]  me extremely intrigued.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.380]  First of all, you have the speaker there who I think he kind of realizes it.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:58.920]  If you watch his face, his, his eyes perk up and his head goes back.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.360]  He's like, wait, he fought the Russians.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.080]  He's like, wait, he fought the Russians?
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.960]  Like what am I, wait, is this guy the Nazi?
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.400]  And then the, and then the video where he's like wiping his brow with the sweat.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:13.340]  It's like, it's like all the stress that he's, he's lived under being a Nazi for 70
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.340]  years.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.380]  It's like all the stress is now wiped away.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:20.300]  He's like, oh, I've lived, I'm a Nazi all these years and now it's all relieved.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.200]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:26.500]  And you know, the fact that the speaker of the house was reading and looked surprised
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.380]  to read goes to the fact that someone wrote that script for him.
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:33.280]  The reason I mentioned that is because this speaker of the house put out a press release
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:37.660]  today and made a little statement saying, I'm the only one who knew about this.
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:38.880]  Didn't ask any more questions.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.960]  It definitely wasn't Justin Trudeau.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.080]  It definitely wasn't Chrystia Freeland, our deputy prime minister whose own grandfather
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.280]  was a Ukrainian Nazi.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.720]  I mean, there are some weird Nazi ties in Canada.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:58.200]  Justin Trudeau went to Kiev about three months ago and he met with a Nazi apologist
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.600]  that Zelensky himself fired.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.320]  There was this Ukrainian ambassador who denied the Holocaust and it was so crazy that Zelensky
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.500]  himself fired this guy, his name is Andre Melnick.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:13.800]  Trudeau met with him after he was fired, what are you doing?
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:20.480]  And so there's this weird thing where Trudeau calls every conservative he hates a Nazi,
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.540]  but Trudeau can't get enough of these Nazis.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.020]  And today when the speaker of the house fell on his sword and said, hey everybody,
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:30.700]  I was the only one who knew, stop asking questions.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:34.300]  I was the guy responsible for this, don't pick on Trudeau.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.300]  Really?
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.840]  It's obvious he was reading a speech written for him by someone else.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.520]  This goes straight to Trudeau and it's another humiliation for Canada at the hands of Trudeau.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.200]  I think Canadians are starting to get a little bit tired of this guy.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.400]  Well, and I kind of want to hone in on this as well, Ezra Levant with us from
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:56.760]  Rebel News, rebelnews.com at Ezra Levant on Twitter.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:01.400]  Do you think that Trudeau and his cabinet are just so ignorant that they didn't even
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.480]  realize what they were doing and they thought this would just be like a good promotional
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:07.960]  stunt for the war in Ukraine?
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.820]  I do because remember he's been going to Ukraine and meeting, for example, with this
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.480]  Andrei Melnyk and he's had no blow back.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:17.180]  So I think, I think he thought this will work.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:18.900]  It's worked so far.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:22.820]  I mentioned the deputy prime minister, her name is Kristia Freeland.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:24.980]  Her grandfather was actually a Nazi.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:30.340]  He expropriated a Jewish newspaper in Ukraine and turned it into a Nazi propaganda bag.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:34.200]  Now I'm not blaming a granddaughter for what her grandfather did.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.600]  All right, folks, you can't make this up.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.000]  I'm sorry, we're up against a short break.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  This is a short break.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.560]  We got five minutes on the other side.

[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:07.759]  Yeah, we should be playing this music when we play that clip from Canadian Parliament
[02:00:07.759 --> 02:00:12.759]  where they're celebrating a Nazi, a literal Nazi. It's the boy that cried wolf. I mean,
[02:00:12.759 --> 02:00:19.480]  it's also strange. Ezra, Ezra Levant with us here, rebel news.com. But, but talk to me
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:24.000]  about the backlash here. Obviously the mainstream media that accuses everybody being a Nazi
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.639]  is not going to be covering this, but the backlash must've been real because the speaker
[02:00:28.639 --> 02:00:33.139]  had to issue a statement in a, in a, in a coverage of Justin Trudeau. Are they really
[02:00:33.139 --> 02:00:37.320]  this ignorant? Is it all a publicity stunt? I mean, what, what the hell goes on that
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:42.280]  leads to this moment? Well, I mentioned to you a few months ago, Justin Trudeau went to
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:48.080]  Ukraine and met with a Holocaust denier named Martin, I'm sorry, Andre Melnick. And it's
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.920]  not just my accusation that he's a Holocaust denier. He went on TV denying it. It was
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.120]  so awful Zelensky had to fire him. So imagine meeting with that guy. So Trudeau's
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:03.219]  meeting with these Holocaust deniers, he's hanging out with these extremist people and
[02:01:03.219 --> 02:01:07.620]  nothing happens. There's no reverberations back home in Canada. So he's thinking, oh,
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:12.019]  okay, so that's how it is now. I can go further. I can go further. And so on Friday
[02:01:12.019 --> 02:01:16.620]  when Zelensky's in Ottawa, this is Trudeau's big moment. He says, I'm going to show what
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:22.660]  a guy I am. I'm going to find this one Ukrainian freedom fighter who's actually a
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:28.019]  Nazi and I'm going to show what a, you know, he, it was a show off moment for Trudeau
[02:01:28.019 --> 02:01:36.000]  and he almost got away with it, Owen, because at Friday, no one said anything. Saturday,
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.380]  no one said anything. And by no one, I mean there were 338 members of parliament in the
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:43.860]  room. No one said anything. There were a lot of other guests. In fact, if you, in
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:50.519]  the video clip you can see right near this Nazi were Canadian military brass. They surely
[02:01:50.519 --> 02:01:55.059]  knew what was going on. They said nothing. Countless journalists were covering this.
[02:01:55.059 --> 02:02:00.259]  They said nothing. Trudeau almost got away with it. But then independent journalists,
[02:02:00.259 --> 02:02:04.500]  including myself, started putting two and two together. I did a little bit of a tweet
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:11.099]  storm late Saturday night. I got 3 million impressions on my tweets. There was a professor
[02:02:11.099 --> 02:02:15.820]  who got millions and all these sort of independent people on Twitter. And I started
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:23.540]  tagging the official anti Semitic fighters, the anti anti Semitic fighters in Canada.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:28.820]  Where are you with this? How are you okay with this? And, and I guess so many people
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:36.500]  online started making this a thing that the dam broke. And, and a Holocaust Memorial
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:41.300]  group put out a statement and then another did. And then it just finally the dam broke,
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.900]  but not because of any mainstream media journalists. And that goes to show you that whenever they
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:53.139]  condemn someone as bigoted or racist or Nazi, they don't actually mean it.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:59.059]  Because they don't actually care. Because a real life Nazi whose hands are probably covered in
[02:02:59.059 --> 02:03:05.139]  blood, when he was there, they didn't say a word because they wanted to protect the precious
[02:03:05.139 --> 02:03:09.540]  Justin Trudeau. And it took grassroots independent Twitter journalists to make a
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:16.019]  difference. So Owen, never, never, never allow the establishment to get away with
[02:03:16.019 --> 02:03:22.019]  calling you names because odds are it's projection. They accuse you of what they
[02:03:22.019 --> 02:03:26.340]  are doing themselves. And thank God for rebel news and Ezra LaVant to be there to push this,
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:34.019]  to push this over the dam. And so, I mean, again, like this is beyond the pale.
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:40.500]  What is the breaking point though, for the Canadian people? I mean, Trudeau is not popular.
[02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:44.580]  He was nowhere near winning the popular vote, but I mean, what is the breaking point? The
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.900]  arresting of journalists, the arresting of pastors, the crushing of dissidents?
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:55.860]  Well, I think a couple of things are turning. First of all, the economy. Inflation is out of
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:00.980]  control. Housing prices are skyrocketing. Housing prices are twice as expensive
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:05.540]  proportionately here as they are in America. Young people just can't buy homes. And Trudeau
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:10.740]  has doubled immigration in the last year. It's the equivalent of 10 million people a year in
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:14.740]  America. It's 1 million a year in Canada. We're one tenth your size. So you've got out of
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:20.340]  control inflation, unaffordable homes, doubling immigration, and then you've just got scandal
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:25.380]  after scandal. I think people are getting sick of Mr. Woke. He's like Gavin Newsom.
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:29.620]  He runs a failed state. Imagine if Gavin Newsom were your president. That's what Trudeau is.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:35.219]  Oh my gosh. Well, we might not have to imagine. Ezra LaVant at Ezra LaVant on Twitter,
[02:04:35.219 --> 02:04:38.820]  rebelnews.com. Folks, I'm really appreciative of him joining us. This is how it is in media.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.900]  He's literally eating his lunch in the break, but he just had to come on with us. It's okay.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:47.139]  We respect that, Ezra. We love you. Thank you for joining us on short notice.
[02:04:47.139 --> 02:04:50.260]  We're going to be right back with Edward Dowd. I mean, folks, we are just...
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:55.540]  Trump said it right. Everything Woke turns to shit. That's all I can say. That's it.
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:04.179]  My fellow Patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.

[02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:27.700]  You know, I'm thinking about just letting this siren play
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:32.500]  for a minute here. Edward Dowd is about to join us because, you know, here's the thing, folks.
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:40.900]  Donald Trump gets 50,000 people at a rally. Joe Biden gets 50, somehow wins the election.
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:46.820]  I got speeches from Joe Biden. He can't even talk, okay? There's clips from Biden speaking
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:53.059]  yesterday. The guy can't even talk. If I put 10 scoops of mashed potatoes in my mouth,
[02:06:53.059 --> 02:06:59.219]  I'd sound like Joe Biden. This is breaking news. In Oklahoma, somebody just smashed into
[02:06:59.219 --> 02:07:03.940]  an oil line. It's literally spewing and squirting and spouting oil, and it's just
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.179]  a lake of oil right now in Oklahoma. I mean, our infrastructure is falling apart. It's under
[02:07:08.179 --> 02:07:14.900]  attack. I've got Canadians saluting literal Nazis. Okay, well, now we're going to be joined by
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:20.340]  Edward Dowd. And let me just, let me just give a little preface here.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:32.099]  Embalmer reveals 50% of bodies containing white fibers, blood clots since April, May, 2021. Now,
[02:07:32.099 --> 02:07:37.940]  obviously the timing here is clear. That's post COVID vaccine. I mean, holy smokes. Now,
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:46.580]  Edward Dowd is an expert when it comes to analytics and data. And so all he's doing
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:51.940]  is studying the data. And he's here to reveal big news on what he's seeing as far as
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:59.700]  what can only be described as vaccine side effects. And so Edward, you have obviously
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:06.660]  broken a lot of various news stories dealing with the data post vaccine. You've got more
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:13.700]  troubling data you want to reveal now. Yeah, at this point, it's a joke in my humble opinion.
[02:08:14.179 --> 02:08:18.019]  The regulatory authorities see what we see. There are signals everywhere,
[02:08:18.019 --> 02:08:22.340]  and yet they continue to march on as if nothing's going on. This is the biggest
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:28.099]  fraud I've ever seen in my life. Unfortunately, it's tragic. We just dropped a study last week,
[02:08:28.099 --> 02:08:33.460]  my partners who are PhD physicists, and we have some data scientists working with us.
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:37.139]  Now our team has grown. We're still doing this work pro bono. But this is what we put out
[02:08:38.019 --> 02:08:45.219]  from a UK study on cardiovascular events, excess cardiovascular deaths.
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:54.740]  So we did a statistical analysis. In 2020, there were 13% increase in cardiovascular deaths. Okay,
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:09:01.219]  fair enough. But then it shot up to 30 in 2021. It's 44% in 2022. We suspect it will
[02:09:01.219 --> 02:09:07.059]  be higher in 2023. When we looked at the long-term trend of this,
[02:09:09.219 --> 02:09:14.580]  we could see that it was well off trend. Cardiovascular deaths are actually trending
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:20.580]  down in the UK. There was about 8 per 100,000. We're now back up to 11 in 2022,
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:25.940]  probably go higher in 2023. And statistically speaking, the standard deviation
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:32.500]  that we see in 2022 is about 10 and a half standard deviations above the historical
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:39.059]  trend line. And what does that mean to your audience? What are standard deviations, real quick?
[02:09:40.019 --> 02:09:44.179]  A lot of people don't understand what it means. In my world, a three standard deviation event
[02:09:44.179 --> 02:09:50.740]  is rare. It happens 0.3% of the time. A 3.8% standard deviation event is the same as
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:54.980]  you getting struck by lightning at least once in your lifetime. So it's rare, okay?
[02:09:55.219 --> 02:10:00.019]  So we have 10 and a half standard deviation events of cardiovascular deaths.
[02:10:00.019 --> 02:10:04.980]  They seem to be accelerating. A lot of the data that I'm tracking seems to be accelerating.
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:12.099]  In June, disabilities in the US, as measured by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, shot up
[02:10:12.099 --> 02:10:18.820]  a million. So we've added about 4.2 million disabled Americans since the rollout of the
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:24.580]  vaccines. It was running around 29 to 30 million for the prior five years.
[02:10:25.219 --> 02:10:30.660]  More than half of those are employed. Our excess mortality seems to be focused in the young,
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:34.019]  especially those who are employed, who are subjected to vaccines.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.340]  So the evidence just keeps rolling out and it keeps getting worse and worse.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.940]  Well, let me just dumb this down. Let me just dumb this down for the audience,
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:45.540]  because I like to make the sports analogy because I think it applies in more ways than
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:50.340]  one. Ironically, this is like in Major League Baseball guys, the best home run hitters
[02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:54.099]  were hitting 40 home runs a year. And then the best home run hitters out of nowhere
[02:10:54.099 --> 02:10:58.260]  were hitting 70 home runs a year. Okay, well, that's a deviation. What did we find out? It's
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:03.139]  from an injection, steroids. So that's a mundane dumbing it down. But folks,
[02:11:03.139 --> 02:11:05.460]  that's what this is like. This is like, oh, we're hitting 40 home runs a year. Oh,
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:08.900]  now we're hitting 70 home runs a year. What's causing this? It was steroids.
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:12.980]  But this, what you're talking about is death rates, myocarditis,
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:18.980]  cardiovascular issues, post-vaccine. Correct. And there's a signal.
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:25.620]  And we pay billions of dollars to these supposed watchdogs, the CDC, the FDA,
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:31.860]  the equivalents in the UK, Australia, Europe, billions of dollars. And they have statisticians
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:38.099]  on staff. And we're seeing a bunch of guys downloading publicly available data or seeing 10
[02:11:38.099 --> 02:11:44.099]  and a half standard deviation events consistently across all sorts of different things. And yet
[02:11:44.179 --> 02:11:51.780]  there's no, there's nary a peep from anybody in these billion-dollar budget institutions.
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:56.900]  And the question we need to ask is why. They see the same data we see. And I'll tell you why.
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:12:01.540]  Regulatory capture and the system has been corrupt for years. We just didn't know it
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:06.820]  because there was nothing to see in terms of the numbers. But this vaccination program
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:10.980]  was so widespread, the death and destruction has probably been going on with other
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:15.620]  pharmaceutical products is now there for everybody to see. And it's a disaster.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:21.700]  Now, as far as let's say healthcare providers and doctors are concerned, we have had some groups
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:25.540]  step forward, the frontline doctors. We've had some other groups or individuals rather
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:31.620]  step forward to call this out. Is there a panic amongst the medical establishment, amongst
[02:12:32.179 --> 02:12:37.460]  doctors, hospital boards, or are they going to be involved in trying to cover this up too,
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:43.219]  because maybe fear of punishment, retribution, or just their involvement with getting these
[02:12:43.219 --> 02:12:48.660]  vaccines in people's arms? Well, there's a couple of things going on. There's word of mouth.
[02:12:49.299 --> 02:12:54.820]  So some doctors are quietly whispering to some of their patients, don't take any more boosters.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:59.299]  I'm hearing that those types of stories, but people in positions of authority are going to
[02:12:59.299 --> 02:13:05.059]  keep their mouth shut as long as possible. And then if there is ever a eureka moment,
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:10.740]  they're going to pull a 180 and say they were deceived as well. But there was so much money
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:16.820]  involved in this COVID rollout, so many windfalls for so many individuals, especially hospitals
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:22.340]  that received COVID goodies from the government, that they're being paid to keep their mouth
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:29.860]  shut at the moment. Now, this is a phenomenon that goes with a lot of different products. I
[02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:34.099]  mean, I think another issue we have, not to get off course, because I think it all ties in,
[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:39.540]  we saw this push from doctors. We got to get all the kids on Ritalin. We got to get all the
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:43.860]  kids on ADHD medicine. Oh, we've got to get all these painkillers and all these other pharmaceutical
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:49.700]  products into people's cabinets as well. Talk about the phenomenon of, hey, they get the
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:54.980]  kickbacks from these pharmaceutical companies. So they have a incentive, they have a motive
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:14:00.660]  to prescribe ADHD medicines. They have a motive to describe these painkillers, which we know have
[02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:05.059]  caused tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of deaths in this country.
[02:14:05.059 --> 02:14:07.620]  Is that the phenomenon you're talking about with these vaccines?
[02:14:09.299 --> 02:14:14.900]  The vaccines, it's been documented that certain insurance companies that run hospitals and have
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:20.740]  doctors working for them were incentivizing these doctors to push the COVID vaccine.
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:27.059]  And if there were accelerators on their bonuses, if they were able to get 95% of their practice,
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:35.540]  the COVID-19 shot, they received $50 to $100 per patient injected, and that could amount to $25,
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:42.099]  $50,000 bonus. So there are definitely hidden monetary incentives throughout the whole
[02:14:42.099 --> 02:14:50.260]  healthcare system. They're starting to come to light. This started years ago with the diagnostic
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:59.380]  journals where they indicate psychological disorders. Prior to Prozac, it was X amount
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:05.219]  of inches thick. Since Prozac, they've discovered new disorders and what they create disorders
[02:15:05.219 --> 02:15:10.019]  to them in Medicaid. So this has been going on forever. It's a, let's create a disorder,
[02:15:10.019 --> 02:15:15.299]  let's find a drug and let's sell it. Now, I guess you could say that same thing
[02:15:15.299 --> 02:15:18.740]  goes on with COVID. They inflate the numbers and now they're trying to do that again, by the
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:23.219]  way. Oh, we got to get tests in people's houses. Well, okay. Why do they want tests in your house?
[02:15:23.219 --> 02:15:27.700]  So that you test positive and then they get another positive case. And then they drive up
[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:30.980]  the fear-mongering, they drive up the numbers, and then they drive up the vaccine cells,
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:36.660]  and then they drive up their profits. So, I mean, even COVID-19 in a way is that same
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:41.460]  phenomenon. Hey, let's take the normal flu or whatever it is, and let's call it COVID-19.
[02:15:43.219 --> 02:15:46.900]  There was definitely a rebranding. Well, I view this as a rebranding of the flu.
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:53.460]  You know, there were 500,000 excess deaths in 2020, mostly old people. You could make the case
[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:59.620]  that most of those 500,000 excess deaths were due to improper hospitalization protocols,
[02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:05.780]  ventilation, which turned out to kill people, and remdesivir, which we know causes kidney and
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:11.380]  liver failure. So a lot of these numbers were inflated. Let's also talk about the scandals
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:17.059]  that were swept under the rug where Governor Cuomo and other governors sent COVID patients
[02:16:17.059 --> 02:16:22.660]  into nursing homes because, quote-unquote, the hospitals were overflowing, which we all know
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:26.820]  was a joke because they were doing TikTok videos dancing around in empty hospitals,
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:32.340]  you know, during COVID. This whole thing smelled of fraud from the get-go.
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:44.980]  Edward, I really appreciate you coming on today. And I'm tuned into you right now as I'm coming
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:50.260]  back to Austin, Texas. And I'm really blessed to have you here to talk about the incredible
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:55.140]  excess mortality and all the news that's coming out. But the main reason I wanted to get you on
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:58.980]  was a breakdown you did a few days ago. We had an article on Infowars.com
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.380]  that I covered yesterday where you concur with myself and Tucker Carlson and others and said,
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:10.020]  the globalists have got to plan something big, something big to cover up all the COVID death,
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:14.580]  a new bigger crisis, a permanent emergency. And Jack Posobick is saying the same thing.
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:19.860]  I'm saying the same thing, an expanded war with Russia, a cyber attack. The whole world's
[02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:24.660]  waking up, like you said. And so they've got to cover up a big story with another story.
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:28.180]  And they say in the SPARS document and other documents, that's exactly what they would do.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:32.820]  They even forecasted a big awakening once they launched the sterilization depopulation
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.460]  plan. So that's why I wanted to get you on. I know you have limited time.
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:38.020]  Can you please speak to that? Thank you.
[02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:44.660]  Yeah, absolutely. I was asked on a podcast with Dr. Naomi Wolf. We were talking about our
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:50.740]  new, my team's new cardiovascular data. She asked me what's going to happen politically. And
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:57.700]  for me, this is just, it's not a question in my head. Under normal times,
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.940]  we vote all these people out, but these aren't normal times.
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:07.060]  The crimes have been so horrendous, the cover-ups so ridiculous and the deaths continue. And the
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:11.380]  gaslighting is so horrendous that once this comes to light, and it will, I mean, this is
[02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:16.020]  spreading word of mouth. There'll be an event horizon. I call it the vaccine event horizon,
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:21.060]  where somebody somewhere, some government, some media person, some media company breaks away
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:26.740]  and starts reporting on this. And there's a kind of an aha moment. These folks cannot relinquish
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:34.580]  power because if they do, they'll be put in jail or prosecuted. So they have to create a distraction.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:39.619]  In my humble opinion, it's either going to be like you said, a war, escalated war with the
[02:18:39.619 --> 02:18:46.660]  Ukraine. Don't forget about what's going on in Taiwan. China wants to do something. Cyber
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:53.940]  shutdown, financial crisis. They even may even bring out the aliens. I'm looking for something
[02:18:53.940 --> 02:19:00.340]  so big that it's going to kind of change the world in that there's going to be a moment
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:05.700]  for humanity. Either people are going to buy this event and start another new round of fear,
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:12.340]  or we're going to all call BS on it and their plans go awry and they're all brought
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:18.980]  to justice eventually. That's kind of my 30,000-foot analytical picture of what's going on.
[02:19:18.980 --> 02:19:22.900]  They cannot lose the elections in 2024. They cannot, and they know that.
[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:28.820]  Yeah, I completely agree. And I would say, you know, if you let's say you've been laundering
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:32.820]  money or cooking your books forever and an auditor's about to come in and catch you.
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:36.660]  Oh, well, now all of a sudden, look, a fire broke out and now all of our books burned up
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:40.980]  and now there's nothing for them to audit. And what do you know? How convenient. I mean,
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:44.900]  I feel like that's going to be have to be their phenomenon here for the cover up.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.940]  But OK, so but I also agree it's going to be something so big it's going to be changing
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:56.660]  the entire path of humanity on this planet. But so, I mean, what aliens like, how do they
[02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:00.420]  basically burn the house down to cover up the money laundering or how do they burn the file
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:05.860]  cabinet so nobody can see their cookbooks? Well, you know, let's use the words they've
[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:12.100]  been using. George Soros and Klaus Schwab and others have been talking and flooding the term
[02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:18.100]  poly crisis, poly meaning many. So I think they're going to flood the zone. I don't think
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:23.619]  it'll be any one thing. It'll be a bunch of things all at once to create maximum fear.
[02:20:23.619 --> 02:20:28.420]  And that's how they, you know, if they're able to do that, you know, we'll be back where we
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:33.380]  were in 2021 with people wanting to lock the, you know, the unvaccinated in quarantine camps.
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:40.500]  So we have to spread the word that what's coming is probably not real or exaggerated
[02:20:41.539 --> 02:20:47.060]  or an event to distract us from the crimes that have already been committed. So I expect
[02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:50.660]  multiple events all at the same time to flood the zone.
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:58.420]  My fear is, you know, I think we both would understand that we're probably dealing with
[02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:02.820]  complete psychotics at a leadership level, at many different leadership levels. I mean,
[02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:07.380]  these are complete psychotics. And so my fear is, and this is to not, believe me, this is to
[02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:12.260]  not promote going along with the fraud or the fake alien invasion or whatever they do. It's not
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:17.060]  promoting to go along with it. Definitely not. But I'm just saying my fear is that
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:22.420]  whatever next big fraud they try to run on us, if it does get rejected and completely rebuked
[02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:26.420]  by the people that they just might hit the nuclear Holocaust button. I mean, that's,
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:34.340]  that's my big fear. That is a fear that is real. If you really want to drive fear into
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:40.340]  the hearts of the globe, start detonating nukes. And of course blame the Russians,
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.380]  you know, Oh, it's the Russians this, or like you said, I mean, who knows? They're,
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:47.380]  they're kind of building up this whole alien thing right now. And so maybe they say it's
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:50.980]  alien technology and they just reveal technology that we've never seen before.
[02:21:51.619 --> 02:21:57.700]  Space weapons, you know, hydrogen bombs, whatever. And so that, that's my big fear, but
[02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:03.700]  I'm not a hopeless person. I believe there's more good people than bad people. And I
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:09.380]  think that ultimately the truth is going to win out. Is there an escape route for us? I mean,
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:12.980]  is there enough good people in the medical industry? I mean, I don't know if there's any
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:16.900]  enough good people with the, with the balls to do anything in our government, but I mean, just,
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:20.820]  let's just talk about the medical industry. I mean, could we get out ahead of this and
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:24.180]  actually say, well, wait a second, we need to be investigating the companies that,
[02:22:24.180 --> 02:22:28.020]  that promoted this vaccine that they knew is faulty and going to have all these deaths.
[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.260]  I mean, is there any way, do you think we can curtail this?
[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:35.380]  I think we are, we're curtailing it right now. I mean,
[02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:42.740]  the difference in those who are awake prior to 2020 and today is phenomenal. I mean, in my own,
[02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:47.700]  you know, friend group, I was called crazy, crazy conspiracy theorists. Now people seek
[02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:53.060]  my opinion. So word of mouth is spreading. Your shows like yours, Tucker Carlson breaking
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:59.140]  away from Fox, Joe Rogan, Russell Brand, any voice of reason, despite whatever people's
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:06.100]  password, you're speaking truth now, and you're talking about things that are real reality based
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:11.619]  things. You know, you're in the fight and the word of mouth is spreading. So I have a lot
[02:23:11.619 --> 02:23:18.340]  of hope. I'd say there is, you know, if five to 10% were awake prior to COVID, we're at 25%.
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:23.220]  Now, a lot of those 25% aren't brave and they're not saying what they believe, but
[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:28.740]  they'll be there when the SHIT hits the fan, hopefully when, when things go south.
[02:23:29.779 --> 02:23:33.779]  Well, you know, you're, you're kind of like, you're kind of like Edward, the gray now you've
[02:23:33.779 --> 02:23:38.740]  got the beard coming in. In past interviews, you had the clean face or you're kind of like
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:45.140]  Edward the gray. Let me just ask you this. Doing this research and having the realization
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:50.660]  and the reality sit in from what you've seen, how has that changed your worldview? How has
[02:23:50.660 --> 02:23:56.500]  that changed your spirituality and just how you operate day to day and the things you think about?
[02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:03.460]  Oh, you know, look, I was raised a Catholic. I believed in God, but I'll tell you now,
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:09.380]  by tuning into the spiritual world is a lot greater than it was. And this is the evil
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:15.779]  that's on display is something that really makes you think about what's, you know, what's
[02:24:15.779 --> 02:24:21.860]  my life? What's my purpose? My purpose now is to help as many people not take the Vax,
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:27.380]  wake up as many people as to the evil nature of the system that's been in place for hundreds
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:33.619]  of years. And I have a bigger purpose now. And, you know, ironically, I, when I get into the
[02:24:33.619 --> 02:24:38.980]  data, I get depressed, but then I get hopeful. And, and I try to, I try to be very circumspect
[02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:44.900]  about this and understand that, you know, I can only do what I can do. You know, the results
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:50.100]  are up to God, but, and so I don't, I don't get too hung up on, on accomplishments.
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:54.580]  I just do what I do and keep doing it. And hopefully I save a marginal life here and there.
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:59.619]  And that's kind of, that kind of keeps me going. And yes, I did grow a beard recently. It's my
[02:24:59.619 --> 02:25:05.619]  first beard in my life. And I'm just kind of experimenting with different things in my life,
[02:25:05.619 --> 02:25:10.100]  doing a lot of different things and trying to have joy. It's important to have joy in this,
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:14.660]  in this crazy world of ours. You know, the world's not going to end. It's just going
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:18.820]  to change dramatically. And you still have to do, you know, joyful things, you know,
[02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:25.779]  date people if you're single, get married, have children. Life goes on and, and surround
[02:25:25.779 --> 02:25:30.900]  yourself with like-minded individuals who have integrity, who care about others,
[02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:35.860]  and your life will just open up. You know, when I was, before this journey began,
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:42.340]  I felt isolated and alone, but now that there was this definitive marker put in the sand with
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:47.860]  the vaccine, I've made tons and tons of friends. And even some of those are vaccinated
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:50.580]  who would now regret their choice and now are in the fight. So
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:55.140]  humanity's waking up and it's kind of a wonderful thing. And there's a different viewpoint on the
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:26:01.460]  world. Like material wealth is kind of, you know, it never brought me any joy. This is
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:07.860]  bringing me joy helping others. And when you get into service, that keeps you sane and
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:14.100]  brings real happiness. The nonsense of accumulating stuff doesn't bring you anything. You know,
[02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:18.180]  I look at Alex, I look at you, you guys have been under attack. A lot of Alex's wealth has
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:22.820]  been destroyed, but he continues to fight. And I think he's happier now than he was when he had
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:28.660]  stuff. See folks, only the observations and the questions that you can get right here at
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:33.300]  Info Wars. This is why we got to keep the show on the air. Now, I want to get serious
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:38.420]  again for a second, because the embalmer talking about how everybody's coming in with these
[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:43.460]  fiber clots. It's not blood clots. It's a fiber clot. We've also heard, you know,
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:47.140]  morticians and other reports, doctors and everything else. I mean,
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:54.500]  this is an undeniable phenomenon. It's something that didn't even exist that now exists.
[02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:58.740]  Do you think that the mainstream media will be able to keep this thing under wraps,
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:02.340]  obviously paid for by big pharmaceutical companies? Or do you think the alternative
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:07.140]  media can maybe have their big breaking moment now where we overwhelm the mainstream,
[02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:13.140]  pushing the vaccines and people see through it? Well, the mainstream media is dead, in my humble
[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:18.980]  opinion. And independent alternative media is here to stay. And the numbers suggest you
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:24.500]  guys are killing it. The only reason you're not making the revenue streams that media is,
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.860]  is because the corporations that are still in the matrix are supporting this nonsense.
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:35.539]  Eventually, I think there's going to come a day where a corporation is going to run as far away
[02:27:35.539 --> 02:27:40.980]  from COVID and the establishment as possible, as quickly as possible, because the revenues will
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:46.340]  come under assault. More and more of these boycotts are occurring. Go woke, go broke is a
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:52.340]  real thing now. Budweiser has been devastated. Disney's stock is in the tank. So at the end of
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:59.300]  the day, I think we've won. And the, you know, the revenues that we don't get and you don't
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:04.740]  get are coming our way eventually because we have integrity and we tell the truth. So
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:11.539]  I think we've won. It's just the problem is we're about to see a horrendous poly crisis and a flood
[02:28:11.539 --> 02:28:15.380]  of the zone that's going to create chaos for years to come. But on the other side of that,
[02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:20.740]  I do truly believe there's a renaissance. I have to agree with everything Edward Dowd just
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:24.980]  said. And so, folks, this is why we're bringing this information so that you can
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:29.940]  prepare yourself and get yourself and just be ready for this and not panic and not
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:34.100]  uh, have the worst happen to yourself and your family. Edward Dowd, our guest,
[02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:40.180]  at Dowd Edward on Twitter or his website, finance technologies.com. That's with a PH,

[02:32:12.430 --> 02:32:13.430]  What's better?
[02:32:13.430 --> 02:32:15.150]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:32:15.150 --> 02:32:19.630]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:20.750]  people.

[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:16.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:20.599]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this extremely vital Monday transmission.
[02:33:20.599 --> 02:33:25.400]  You just heard Ellen Schroyer interview top analyst and a man that's been very accurate,
[02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:26.400]  Edward Dowd.
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:30.599]  He concurs with Jack Vosovic, myself, Tucker Carlson and the other analysts.
[02:33:30.599 --> 02:33:33.480]  The globalists have rolled out their poison shots.
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:35.759]  They released their new chimeric virus.
[02:33:35.759 --> 02:33:36.880]  The whole world's waking up.
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:40.519]  The numbers show that the deaths are mounting, the sterilization is mounting, the stillbirths
[02:33:40.519 --> 02:33:42.519]  are exploding.
[02:33:42.519 --> 02:33:43.599]  They have failed.
[02:33:43.599 --> 02:33:44.939]  Bill Gates admits they failed.
[02:33:44.939 --> 02:33:46.119]  They admit it's backfired.
[02:33:46.119 --> 02:33:48.080]  The Clinton Foundation admits it's backfired.
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.359]  The WF admits it's backfired.
[02:33:49.359 --> 02:33:51.080]  They all admit it, blip in their face.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:52.859]  So what are they going to do?
[02:33:52.859 --> 02:33:58.119]  War in China, Taiwan, expanded war in Ukraine, cyber attacks, power outages.
[02:33:58.119 --> 02:34:02.640]  They're pre-programming it all, weather weapons, fake alien invasion.
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:06.000]  But just like we got ahead of their new rollout for new COVID restrictions, they blew up in
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  their face.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:08.640]  We can get ahead of this now.
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.080]  That's why when we archive this live show today at band.video, everybody needs to get
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.679]  this Edward Dowd interview, get it out to everyone you know.
[02:34:17.679 --> 02:34:19.720]  These globalists are crazy.
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:21.039]  They love throwing it in our face.
[02:34:21.039 --> 02:34:26.080]  That's why they brought a real Nazi that actually helped run mass exterminations to
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:29.939]  be saluted at the Canadian parliament with Zelensky and Trudeau.
[02:34:29.939 --> 02:34:31.320]  They're rubbing it in our faces.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:34.880]  I agree with Ezra Levent last hour as an expert on this from Canada.
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:36.560]  This is part of a larger plan.
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:37.679]  They've got to gaslight us.
[02:34:37.679 --> 02:34:38.679]  They've got to overwhelm us.
[02:34:38.679 --> 02:34:41.839]  Two men can have a baby, cut your son's penis off.
[02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:44.119]  All of this is just to make things so weird.
[02:34:44.119 --> 02:34:45.119]  We just give up.
[02:34:45.119 --> 02:34:46.400]  But we're not giving up.
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.400]  We're waking up.
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:48.400]  We're taking action.
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.400]  We're speaking out.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:51.679]  But now we're at the most critical moment.
[02:34:51.679 --> 02:34:53.560]  They are planning something huge.
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:55.580]  They are planning something big.
[02:34:55.580 --> 02:34:57.679]  They've pre-programmed what those cards are.
[02:34:57.679 --> 02:34:58.679]  They're going to play.
[02:34:58.679 --> 02:35:00.000]  We don't know exactly what.
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.060]  Massive false flag race attacks, mass shootings.
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:06.080]  It's all going to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:07.679]  They've planned to roll it out.
[02:35:07.679 --> 02:35:11.060]  But if we get ahead of it and expose them enough, they may back down.
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:13.000]  But so far, they keep doubling down.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.960]  But at least we're not flat-footed taking it.
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:17.039]  We're standing up and resisting it.
[02:35:17.039 --> 02:35:21.800]  And so I appreciate you all, old, young, male, female, black, Hispanic, white, Asian.
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.800]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800]  Christian, Muslim.
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.679]  We are all under attack by the Satanic New World Order.
[02:35:27.679 --> 02:35:31.359]  And I want to just salute Owen and the rest of the crew for doing a fabulous job.
[02:35:31.359 --> 02:35:34.439]  Now it's up to you, the listeners and viewers, who are the real heart of the operation.
[02:35:34.439 --> 02:35:40.039]  You are the resistance to take this interview and share it with everyone you know.
[02:35:40.039 --> 02:35:44.039]  All right, spread those links.
[02:35:44.039 --> 02:35:53.519]  We're back here in the InfoWars world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:35:53.519 --> 02:35:55.759]  And it has been a wild day here.
[02:35:55.759 --> 02:35:56.759]  You know what?
[02:35:56.759 --> 02:36:01.039]  We've got some breaking Trump news.
[02:36:01.039 --> 02:36:05.960]  He's set to be speaking sometime this afternoon.
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:09.800]  But let's go to Biden.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:17.580]  Now, if I wanted to sound like Joe Biden, I'd have to stuff 10 scoops of mashed potatoes
[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:26.320]  in my mouth and maybe a couple of fingerling potatoes as well, because this guy is just
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:28.519]  pathetic.
[02:36:28.519 --> 02:36:34.240]  So here's the latest Mushmouth Joe moment from yesterday in clip number four.
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:39.039]  And two of the great artists of our time representing the groundbreaking legacy of
[02:36:39.039 --> 02:36:50.199]  hip hop in America, LLJ Cool J. By the way, that boy's got man's got biceps bigger
[02:36:50.199 --> 02:36:51.199]  than my thighs.
[02:36:51.199 --> 02:36:55.560]  I think he's an emcee like both of you.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:56.560]  Thank you.
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:02.160]  Because they're both have the light off on the mic, you know, you're you're all
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.439]  here to listen to the new edition.
[02:37:04.439 --> 02:37:10.199]  Mike Bivens, 40 years producing music that lifts our souls.
[02:37:10.199 --> 02:37:16.439]  LLJ Cool J. That boy still, you know, that's what he calls black people.
[02:37:16.439 --> 02:37:20.839]  He's called he calls black people boy because, you know, he's one of them.
[02:37:21.839 --> 02:37:23.960]  It's just this guy is an international embarrassment.
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.679]  But but but how embarrassing is it?
[02:37:25.679 --> 02:37:32.039]  And then all the yuppies in the crowd, they laugh because this guy can't even talk.
[02:37:32.039 --> 02:37:33.039]  And that's funny.
[02:37:33.039 --> 02:37:36.240]  And then here he is lying again.
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:37.240]  It's just unreal.
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:39.839]  He's told this lie 20, 30, 40, 50 times.
[02:37:39.839 --> 02:37:43.000]  I've lost count.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.960]  But he's so confused.
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:48.519]  He was so confused in the speech.
[02:37:48.519 --> 02:37:50.279]  First of all, he's speaking to the Black Caucus.
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.720]  He called them the Hispanic Caucus.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:53.160]  So we got that wrong.
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:54.800]  He can't even pronounce LL Cool J.
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.519]  He can't even read a teleprompter.
[02:37:56.519 --> 02:37:58.519]  He's mush mouthing the whole way through.
[02:37:58.519 --> 02:37:59.519]  And then he just lies.
[02:37:59.519 --> 02:38:02.199]  And he talks about how he was part of the civil rights movement again, just an
[02:38:02.199 --> 02:38:03.199]  outright lie.
[02:38:03.199 --> 02:38:05.080]  Actually, he might be telling the truth.
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:06.359]  He was part of the civil rights movement.
[02:38:06.359 --> 02:38:08.060]  He was on the KKK side.
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:11.720]  But no, here's Biden pretending otherwise in clip number three.
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.080]  I started off in a kid.
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:15.080]  In a kid?
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:16.080]  In the civil rights movement.
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.080]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:24.279]  Play that back for me.
[02:38:24.279 --> 02:38:25.839]  I started off in a kid.
[02:38:25.839 --> 02:38:29.400]  He started off in a kid in the civil rights movement in Wilmington, Delaware, and I was
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.160]  in high school and the community.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:34.160]  We won.
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.519]  We won by a staggering thirty one or thirty two hundred votes when I ran the first time
[02:38:39.519 --> 02:38:42.359]  for the Senate at twenty nine years old.
[02:38:42.359 --> 02:38:46.960]  And Nixon won by sixty four percent of my state.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.279]  I won because virtually 90 percent of the African-American community, we have a large
[02:38:51.279 --> 02:38:52.599]  community voted for me.
[02:38:52.599 --> 02:38:53.599]  I owe you.
[02:38:53.599 --> 02:38:54.599]  I owe you.
[02:38:54.599 --> 02:38:56.599]  I owe you.
[02:38:56.599 --> 02:38:58.320]  He owes you.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.640]  By the way, actually, this was in the news today, guys.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.640]  Pull it up.
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:02.640]  I don't have it on my desk.
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.980]  I don't think I have it on my desk.
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:05.980]  But I know it was in the news.
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:06.980]  Guys, go ahead and Google.
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:11.519]  Joe Biden loses, I think it was 17 percent of the black vote in latest polls, I think
[02:39:11.519 --> 02:39:14.619]  is what it was.
[02:39:14.619 --> 02:39:20.279]  I imagine that speech isn't helping, but it's more about the economy getting crushed, gas
[02:39:20.279 --> 02:39:22.599]  prices going up.
[02:39:22.599 --> 02:39:27.599]  The education system collapsing, the infrastructure collapsing, the energy bill is going up, the
[02:39:27.599 --> 02:39:28.599]  grocery bill is going up.
[02:39:28.599 --> 02:39:30.279]  I mean, that's really why he's losing the vote.
[02:39:30.279 --> 02:39:37.320]  And he's just a stone cold, lying fraud phony supporting illegal immigrants ahead
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:38.839]  of American citizens.
[02:39:38.839 --> 02:39:42.500]  Because he says he owes you everything, but then he gives everything to illegal immigrants.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:46.259]  But no, there were stories today in the news how Joe Biden lost like another 17 percent
[02:39:46.259 --> 02:39:48.679]  of the black vote in polls.
[02:39:48.679 --> 02:39:52.199]  So I guess it's not working, Joe.
[02:39:52.199 --> 02:39:56.080]  And I guess you're referring to black men as boy, because that's how you were brought
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:00.199]  up to talk to them, to talk down to them like that, Joe, and say, if you don't vote
[02:40:00.199 --> 02:40:01.519]  for me, you ain't black.
[02:40:01.519 --> 02:40:05.279]  So I guess that's not really working for that demographic.
[02:40:05.279 --> 02:40:09.640]  I guess that's not really working for the black vote as he continues to lose more of
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.880]  those votes.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:21.119]  Yeah, Biden grapples with concerns over young black voter support.
[02:40:21.119 --> 02:40:23.279]  So yeah, these stories were all over the news today.
[02:40:23.279 --> 02:40:25.599]  He's hemorrhaging votes.
[02:40:25.599 --> 02:40:29.080]  And so.
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.560]  There's a couple of other things that are going to be hurting him, like this video
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.039]  that surfacing in clip five and just the B-roll is fine here.
[02:40:36.039 --> 02:40:41.199]  And understand that we here at InfoWars have already documented this and we've been documenting
[02:40:41.199 --> 02:40:44.160]  this since 2021 when Joe Biden took over.
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.720]  Here is a member of the Border Patrol at the southern border where there's a line of
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:56.000]  illegal immigrants and he's dropping a ladder so that they can climb the wall and get
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.279]  over the barbed wire.
[02:40:58.279 --> 02:41:00.519]  I mean, what?
[02:41:00.519 --> 02:41:04.920]  Oh, you're trying to cross the border illegally, but you're at the wall and the barbed wire
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:05.920]  here.
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:07.960]  Here's a ladder.
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:08.960]  Come on in.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:12.839]  OK.
[02:41:12.839 --> 02:41:17.640]  But then there's the popularity of Donald Trump that is skyrocketing.
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:24.560]  The mugshot has certainly added to the cultural benefit of Trump's politics.
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:30.039]  And now today, Donald Trump set to speak in South Carolina sometime this afternoon.
[02:41:30.039 --> 02:41:33.759]  Donald Trump buys a Glock.
[02:41:33.759 --> 02:41:48.960]  Can I get one more picture with the president?
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.960]  I just want.
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:55.720]  That's a nice looking Glock.
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:57.119]  He wants to buy one badly.
[02:41:57.119 --> 02:41:58.119]  You look so good.
[02:41:58.199 --> 02:42:00.880]  He made that clear.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:01.880]  I think he said it three times.
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:04.880]  He wants to buy one.
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:05.880]  And one more time.
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:06.880]  One more time.
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:07.880]  Hey, hey, hey.
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:08.880]  The Attorney General.
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:09.880]  The Attorney General.
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:10.880]  Jump in.
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  You look good.
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:17.039]  It's a beautiful Glock.
[02:42:17.039 --> 02:42:18.720]  It's perfectly made for Trump.
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.640]  We might just put Trump on the side of the Glock.
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:28.080]  And I'm thinking about holsters now and what kind of holster do I want?
[02:42:29.039 --> 02:42:30.039]  Fantastic.
[02:42:30.039 --> 02:42:31.039]  One, two, three.
[02:42:31.039 --> 02:42:33.919]  Do I want the holster on the belt?
[02:42:33.919 --> 02:42:39.619]  Or some people thinking, you know, maybe for Trump, maybe you get the shoulder holster
[02:42:39.619 --> 02:42:46.439]  or maybe you put it in the leg or in the sock with the leg holster.
[02:42:46.439 --> 02:42:49.679]  We've got a lot of things to consider, but look at that beautiful Glock.
[02:42:49.679 --> 02:42:51.679]  It's my Glock now.
[02:42:51.679 --> 02:42:55.359]  And so it's my Glock and it's the most beautiful Glock.
[02:42:58.359 --> 02:42:59.359]  Don't lie down and take it.

[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.359]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[02:44:04.359 --> 02:44:05.519]  supply.
[02:44:05.519 --> 02:44:10.359]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[02:44:10.359 --> 02:44:14.560]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:17.359]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:44:17.359 --> 02:44:20.720]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:25.919]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[02:44:25.919 --> 02:44:29.199]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:44:29.199 --> 02:44:35.320]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:39.640]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:47.400]  Our info wars life survival shield X3 is hands down the best pure nascent iodine
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:54.800]  stabilized in an activated tri iodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:59.119]  Get yours now at info war store dot com.
[02:44:59.119 --> 02:45:05.880]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.000]  diet.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.039]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[02:45:12.039 --> 02:45:13.039]  it.
[02:45:13.039 --> 02:45:18.199]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[02:45:18.199 --> 02:45:23.679]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:45:23.679 --> 02:45:29.320]  The best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at info war store
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:31.439]  dot com.
[02:45:31.439 --> 02:45:37.880]  Omega three fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:40.060]  our brain and our heart.
[02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:44.919]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[02:45:44.919 --> 02:45:50.199]  Get your essential omega three fatty acids from the best sources available.
[02:45:50.199 --> 02:45:53.099]  Ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[02:45:57.699 --> 02:45:59.179]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:45:59.179 --> 02:46:00.179]  Thought it was next week.
[02:46:00.179 --> 02:46:01.179]  I come in this morning.
[02:46:01.179 --> 02:46:04.539]  It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:46:04.539 --> 02:46:06.800]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:12.560]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot, please look
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:21.060]  how full this bottle is right to the top folks right to the top.
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:28.380]  These 95% to humanoid again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:29.619]  Some are maybe 10.
[02:46:29.619 --> 02:46:32.380]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:36.460]  This is 95%.
[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:37.460]  Super constant.
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:41.099]  So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average bill.
[02:46:41.099 --> 02:46:43.740]  It's that powerful or more.
[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:47.460]  So they're available at info war store dot com.
[02:46:47.460 --> 02:46:52.259]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula filled out for almost eight months back in stock
[02:46:52.259 --> 02:46:59.580]  that info war store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:46:59.580 --> 02:47:04.199]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[02:47:04.199 --> 02:47:05.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:41.660]  I want to explain what info wars is really all about, what the core of this crew and
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:51.220]  this audience and all the work that's been put in here for decades.
[02:47:51.220 --> 02:47:57.500]  And I want to start this off with a meme that was going viral during the Hawaiian
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:00.619]  wildfires.
[02:48:00.619 --> 02:48:02.619]  And it's a picture of Hawaii burning.
[02:48:02.619 --> 02:48:07.160]  And it says only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.060]  Now if you remember, it was law enforcement telling people they couldn't leave and they
[02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:14.199]  were blocking the roads and they shut off the water and they kept the power lines charged
[02:48:14.199 --> 02:48:15.199]  up.
[02:48:15.199 --> 02:48:19.939]  So only those that disobeyed survived.
[02:48:19.939 --> 02:48:24.340]  If you, if you rejected the blockade and said, no, I'm going to get out of this burning
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:27.340]  hell hole, then you survived.
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:33.640]  If you obeyed law enforcement and stayed in the burning inferno, you burned to death.
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:36.000]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:41.380]  And you see, that's everything.
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:44.099]  That's the core of what drives info wars.
[02:48:44.099 --> 02:48:50.740]  That's the nucleus that is the makeup of our hosts, our crew, our guests and our
[02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:56.419]  audience because we understand that the new world order is death.
[02:48:56.419 --> 02:48:59.580]  And only those who disobey will survive.
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:00.740]  Look at the vaccine.
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:03.539]  Another perfect example.
[02:49:03.539 --> 02:49:07.800]  Unfortunately, many didn't get the message and they obeyed.
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:10.919]  And now tens of thousands have died from the vaccine.
[02:49:10.919 --> 02:49:14.240]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:17.019]  But look at the larger issue.
[02:49:17.019 --> 02:49:19.779]  What are we facing next?
[02:49:19.779 --> 02:49:24.560]  It begins, Australia's fifth largest bank announces digital only transactions will phase
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:28.919]  out cash.
[02:49:28.919 --> 02:49:32.919]  And then we have a report coming up shortly from Paul Joseph Watson talking about how
[02:49:32.919 --> 02:49:37.740]  the UK governments and these other governments around the world want to force you into the
[02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:43.119]  climate change, zero carbon emissions world.
[02:49:43.119 --> 02:49:45.000]  Now what does that actually look like?
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.779]  You're not going to have access to energy.
[02:49:47.779 --> 02:49:50.880]  You're not going to have access to food.
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.179]  And the only access that you will get is if you are a good slave and obedient to
[02:49:56.179 --> 02:49:59.099]  your masters.
[02:49:59.099 --> 02:50:03.840]  And of course, that is death.
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:06.419]  So it's a powerful meme.
[02:50:06.419 --> 02:50:14.439]  And it's the deeper understanding that drives everything we do here.
[02:50:14.439 --> 02:50:16.119]  Take your vaccine.
[02:50:16.119 --> 02:50:19.000]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.919]  Stay at home during the wildfire.
[02:50:20.919 --> 02:50:22.320]  Don't leave.
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:25.919]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:25.919 --> 02:50:27.439]  Go into the digital currency.
[02:50:27.439 --> 02:50:29.840]  Go into the central bank digital currency.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.140]  Stop eating meat.
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:32.980]  Stop consuming energy.
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:35.340]  Stop living.
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:42.980]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:42.980 --> 02:50:51.720]  The mad dash to net zero continues to cause chaos across Europe.
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:59.220]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:03.220]  So they want you to think that obeying is surviving.
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:08.099]  They want you to think that obeying is getting through it and getting along and getting
[02:51:08.099 --> 02:51:10.699]  to the other side.
[02:51:10.699 --> 02:51:14.660]  But the other side is death.
[02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:19.980]  The other side is slavery.
[02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:23.599]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:51:23.599 --> 02:51:28.400]  And you see, this is why the voices like Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer and Russell
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:33.640]  Brand and so many others have to be shut down.
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:39.560]  We also have an update coming up from Alex on the Russell Brand situation where they're
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:43.880]  trying to do to Russell Brand what they did to Alex Jones.
[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:48.840]  Firm pulls ads from Rumble platform over Russell Brand videos, so they're trying to hurt
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:50.340]  Rumble's bottom line.
[02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:56.179]  Rumble won't budge, at least I don't think they'll budge.
[02:51:56.179 --> 02:51:57.419]  I'm an online expert.
[02:51:57.419 --> 02:52:02.900]  Russell Brand's refuge platform Rumble may be forced offline under new Internet safety
[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:03.900]  laws.
[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:04.900]  Oh, Internet safety.
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:05.900]  See, just obey.
[02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:08.140]  It's for your safety.
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:13.259]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:52:13.259 --> 02:52:22.880]  Now Rumble has built in many ways an infrastructure around the parallel economy.
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:26.240]  So I don't think they can take them completely off the Internet.
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:29.599]  So you'll still have Rumble like you'll have banned.video.
[02:52:29.599 --> 02:52:30.919]  They'll be completely censored.
[02:52:30.919 --> 02:52:32.080]  Their links will be banned.
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:35.240]  They'll make it impossible to find, but they'll still be able to operate.
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:39.720]  Much like InfoWars and banned.video, everyone will get that treatment.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.800]  But you know, Rumble has an app.
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:44.119]  And Rumble has been developing this app.
[02:52:44.119 --> 02:52:45.519]  They're trying to improve this app.
[02:52:45.519 --> 02:52:47.460]  They're trying to make it so you can go live from the app.
[02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:50.099]  You can upload HD from the app.
[02:52:50.099 --> 02:52:55.300]  And they're trying to build it to be a legitimate competitor of YouTube.
[02:52:55.300 --> 02:53:02.859]  But now they're going to say, you better take Russell Brand off of Rumble or we're
[02:53:02.859 --> 02:53:06.480]  removing your app.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:09.900]  Just like they did to InfoWars.
[02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:12.880]  So does Rumble understand?
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:17.240]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:18.759]  I think Rumble gets it.
[02:53:18.759 --> 02:53:24.539]  I think Rumble will stand strong.
[02:53:24.539 --> 02:53:26.800]  But what is the real message here?
[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:29.599]  Is it that if you're a rapist, you don't get free speech?
[02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.119]  Of course not.
[02:53:31.119 --> 02:53:34.000]  That has nothing to do with it.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.039]  The real argument here is that if you call out the corrupt establishment, if you call
[02:53:39.039 --> 02:53:43.460]  out corrupt governments, if you call out the military industrial complex, if you call
[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:48.320]  out the pharmaceutical industrial complex, if you dare question elections, you must
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:49.660]  be silenced.
[02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:51.259]  You must be shut down.
[02:53:51.259 --> 02:53:54.220]  A rape accusation or even if it is a rape.
[02:53:54.220 --> 02:53:55.640]  That's not what this is really about.
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:53:57.380]  These people love Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:53:57.380 --> 02:53:59.500]  These people fly to Jeffrey Epstein's island.
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:01.779]  They're there with the minors.
[02:54:01.779 --> 02:54:03.980]  This isn't about rape.
[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:08.619]  And by the way, they hate victims of rape because they use rape accusations to destroy
[02:54:08.619 --> 02:54:12.439]  their opposition, which only hurts victims of rape.
[02:54:12.439 --> 02:54:16.640]  Only those who disobeyed survived.
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:21.840]  So the next big thing is the zero carbon emissions society.
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:25.679]  And if you obey, you will not survive.
[02:54:25.679 --> 02:54:27.439]  Do you understand it?
[02:54:27.439 --> 02:54:28.960]  Do you get the message loud and clear?
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:31.740]  Was it not obvious with vaccines?
[02:54:31.740 --> 02:54:34.880]  Was it not obvious with the Hawaiian wildfires?
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:39.740]  Is it not obvious when they want to cut out your energy and food consumption and treat
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.660]  you like a slave?
[02:54:41.660 --> 02:54:47.019]  Here is the latest video report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:47.019 --> 02:54:51.960]  Billionaire John Cordwell is furious, mad at Rishi Sunak for indicating there might
[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:54.340]  be a slight delay in implementing net zero.
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:58.019]  He's threatening to pull all his financial support from the conservatives and give it
[02:54:58.019 --> 02:54:59.019]  to labor.
[02:54:59.019 --> 02:55:03.500]  Cordwell said the environmental apocalypse is coming and it's coming very, very rapidly.
[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:05.080]  I'm very worried about the future.
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:10.519]  In fact, the mobile phone magnate is so worried about the environmental apocalypse that just
[02:55:10.519 --> 02:55:14.779]  last month he bragged about how useful his private helicopter was whizzing quickly
[02:55:14.779 --> 02:55:19.240]  between his business in London and his 90 million pound Staffordshire mansion.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:22.279]  I can do what otherwise would be a four hour journey in an hour.
[02:55:22.279 --> 02:55:24.439]  John, what about the environmental apocalypse?
[02:55:24.439 --> 02:55:29.400]  The average chopper expels around 340 kilograms of CO2 per hour.
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:32.960]  In comparison, an average car expels 8.5 kilograms of CO2.
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:38.580]  So every time John wants to shoot back to his country pile, he's belching out 331 kilograms
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:41.259]  more carbon dioxide than is necessary.
[02:55:41.259 --> 02:55:45.300]  This is the guy sounding the alarm about an environmental apocalypse.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:47.660]  All those little people with their nasty emissions.
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:52.419]  The dude who doesn't even need to travel back from London, because he owns a 45,000
[02:55:52.419 --> 02:55:56.900]  square foot, 250 million pound property in Mayfair too.
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:00.859]  Dude's got monthly heating bills greater than your entire net worth, but he's gonna start
[02:56:00.859 --> 02:56:02.900]  lecturing you on your carbon footprint.
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:09.599]  We might already be past the tipping point and who says net zero by 2050 is soon enough.
[02:56:09.599 --> 02:56:11.480]  We need to do everything in our power.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:16.359]  Yeah, I'm sure John's deep concern about you driving a petrol car beyond 2030
[02:56:16.359 --> 02:56:21.439]  is somewhat assuaged by the kind of fun he has on his 73 foot mega super yacht.
[02:56:21.439 --> 02:56:26.400]  Super yacht with permanent crew helicopter pads, submarines and pools emits about 7,020 tons
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:31.320]  of carbon dioxide a year, more than 1,500 times higher than a typical family car.
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:36.820]  I guess John's exempted himself from contributing to the environmental apocalypse.
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:40.419]  And to be clear, the Tories aren't doing a U-turn on net zero at all.
[02:56:40.419 --> 02:56:45.500]  They're still barreling full tilt towards an agenda based on hysterical eco alarmism.
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:49.419]  That'll make everyone poorer, more miserable than living under the despotic thumb of a
[02:56:49.419 --> 02:56:53.460]  technocratic control grid, just at a marginally slower pace.
[02:56:53.460 --> 02:56:57.220]  Rishi Sunak's announcement was that he would still be banning the sales of all new
[02:56:57.220 --> 02:57:01.140]  petrol and diesel cars just by 2035, not 2030.
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:02.919]  That's what Caldwell's mad about.
[02:57:02.919 --> 02:57:06.919]  The media presents all this like there's anything more than a cigarette paper's width
[02:57:06.919 --> 02:57:10.119]  distance between the Tory policy and the Labour policy.
[02:57:10.119 --> 02:57:14.279]  They're both fully committed to sacrificing Britain's prosperity and freedom at the
[02:57:14.279 --> 02:57:18.840]  altar of green madness, refusing to even build new nuclear power plants that would
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:21.320]  more than meet our energy needs for eternity.
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:25.080]  While countries like China and India will continue to blanket their countries with
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:29.800]  coal fired power plants, laughing at the rest of the world as they belch CO2 to
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:33.419]  their hearts content like John Cordwell on his super yacht.
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:52.900]  My fellow patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:58.099]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three

[03:00:03.539 --> 03:00:09.019]  wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas, the heart of the resistance to tier.
[03:00:11.419 --> 03:00:15.800]  Now, let me tell you what we have coming up the rest of the day.
[03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:19.419]  The final hour of the Alex Jones show will consist of a special
[03:00:19.419 --> 03:00:23.800]  report from Alex, a new breaking report from Alex coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:29.119]  We will also then have a another breaking report from Alex at the end
[03:00:29.119 --> 03:00:32.080]  of this hour, dealing with some breaking news, with some inside
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:36.240]  information that he has on the Russell brand situation, and those
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:40.599]  will be bookends to the great Gerald Salente doing great work as
[03:00:40.599 --> 03:00:45.599]  usual with the trends journal hosting here in the fourth hour as well.
[03:00:46.300 --> 03:00:51.419]  We will be monitoring Donald Trump set to speak in South Carolina any moment now.
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:54.820]  He's bought himself a nice gold Trump 45.
[03:00:55.019 --> 03:00:56.220]  We showed you that video.
[03:00:56.460 --> 03:01:00.179]  He has spoken to the media and he has also done a meet and greet with
[03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.900]  South Carolina Trump campaign volunteers.
[03:01:03.179 --> 03:01:04.740]  What has Joe Biden been doing today?
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:08.099]  Well, I know he hasn't spoke with the media.
[03:01:08.380 --> 03:01:13.340]  I know he has not purchased a Glock and I know he's not having a campaign event.
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:17.119]  And so what is the supposed president doing today?
[03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:21.439]  Nothing napping, eating tapioca pudding in a cryogenic chamber.
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:22.820]  Who knows?
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:23.779]  It's Joe Biden.
[03:01:23.900 --> 03:01:25.560]  He doesn't even know actually.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.400]  He's not even aware that Biden makes border history.
[03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:34.359]  He's making history with the most illegal immigrant encounters in August
[03:01:34.359 --> 03:01:38.880]  ever recorded and the most illegal immigrants crossing the border ever
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:43.000]  encountered in one month, Biden border crisis, El Paso, Texas
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.900]  shelters are so overwhelmed that hundreds of Venezuelans, including
[03:01:45.900 --> 03:01:47.419]  children are sleeping on the streets.
[03:01:47.419 --> 03:01:51.980]  And we've documented this for you as well with our news
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:56.259]  team at infowars.com and band.video.
[03:01:56.259 --> 03:01:59.140]  So on the war room, we'll be monitoring Trump's speech.
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:04.900]  And then, uh, I'll be back hosting as well at the three o'clock hour.
[03:02:05.619 --> 03:02:08.500]  And it looks like, uh, is this Trump live right now even?
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:13.679]  So, um, pop me in for a second here, guys, pop me in.
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:16.480]  I think she celebrated that night.
[03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:18.460]  Now we call her beautiful Hillary.
[03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:19.580]  She's a beautiful woman.
[03:02:20.439 --> 03:02:25.960]  Crooked Joe's inflation crisis has raised costs to small businesses like this one
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:29.199]  by more than 20% already, and it's going much higher.
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:34.320]  Biden's energy crisis has hurt sales by nearly tripling the cost to fill up a
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:37.599]  sportsman's 355 gallon gas tank.
[03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:42.759]  Think of that three times higher soaring interest rates, which is even a worse
[03:02:42.759 --> 03:02:47.199]  problem, make boat loans much more expensive, makes it very hard for people
[03:02:47.199 --> 03:02:53.039]  to buy boats and all of this horrible stuff is happening against
[03:02:53.039 --> 03:02:55.660]  your incredible American worker.
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:03.880]  Under Biden, household incomes have been crushed by nearly $7,400 a year.
[03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:04.840]  Does anyone know that?
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:05.960]  Marjorie, did you know that?
[03:03:06.939 --> 03:03:12.539]  Under Trump, incomes increased by more than $8,000 a year with no inflation.
[03:03:12.539 --> 03:03:13.699]  We didn't have inflation.
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:18.179]  A vote for Crooked Joe Biden is a vote for inflation,
[03:03:18.179 --> 03:03:20.699]  taxation, submission, and failure.
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:21.580]  That's what it is.
[03:03:22.539 --> 03:03:26.300]  A vote for Trump is a vote for more jobs, higher wages, and more boats,
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.340]  cars, trucks, and airplanes stamped.
[03:03:28.779 --> 03:03:31.779]  Made in America and made in South Carolina.
[03:03:31.779 --> 03:03:39.119]  I think you should just take his new Trump 45 block and just start busting
[03:03:39.119 --> 03:03:41.519]  into the air, you know, just start firing them off.
[03:03:41.519 --> 03:03:43.720]  The burning wreckage of Bidenomics.
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:47.279]  As soon as we get back into the, wear it on the hip, he should just
[03:03:47.279 --> 03:03:49.160]  travel with that Trump 45 on his hip.
[03:03:49.359 --> 03:03:51.880]  Although who knows, maybe a Jack Smith has banned him
[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:53.000]  from having a second amendment.
[03:03:53.199 --> 03:03:54.599]  We know he's trying to ban his first amendment.
[03:03:54.599 --> 03:03:56.859]  And Marjorie is nodding her head and Henry's nodding his head.
[03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:59.140]  So I can't be the only one that thinks that, but I think this
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:03.800]  another loaded Trump event, another absolutely loaded and packed house
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:05.099]  for a Trump campaign rally.
[03:04:05.099 --> 03:04:08.400]  Joe Biden doesn't even have campaign rallies, let alone
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:09.359]  anybody that would go to them.
[03:04:09.619 --> 03:04:12.039]  So, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen, and who knows, maybe Trump
[03:04:12.039 --> 03:04:14.640]  will still be speaking in an hour when I go live on the war room, but
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:17.519]  we got a special report from Alex Jones coming up at the top of the hour.
[03:04:17.599 --> 03:04:20.240]  We got a special report coming up from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[03:04:20.359 --> 03:04:22.880]  We got the great Gerald Cilente loaded for bear as well.
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:25.000]  Folks, infowarsstore.com.

[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:50.720]  fighting back against the mental, spiritual and physical poisoning
[03:05:51.359 --> 03:05:52.900]  that we contend with on a daily basis.
[03:05:55.539 --> 03:06:07.199]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:06:07.599 --> 03:06:12.960]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:06:16.119 --> 03:06:20.240]  I was watching the end of the Edward Dow interview about 25 minutes
[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:21.840]  ago, and he made a really good point.
[03:06:22.160 --> 03:06:24.720]  I've never talked to him privately, never told him this, haven't
[03:06:24.720 --> 03:06:26.859]  really talked about it a lot on air, but I've thought about talking about
[03:06:26.859 --> 03:06:30.119]  it, but always get distracted by the news, but it really is an
[03:06:30.119 --> 03:06:31.439]  important point on so many fronts.
[03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:35.160]  He said, Alex Jones has had his wealth destroyed and my wealth was
[03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:40.560]  never as great as they said it was not by 2%, it was never had
[03:06:40.560 --> 03:06:44.519]  $400 million, never had $10 million, but I mean, I did have more wealth.
[03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:48.199]  Now I basically have nothing other than my house and the globalist
[03:06:48.199 --> 03:06:50.939]  thought when they persecuted me and lied about me, that would make me go away.
[03:06:50.939 --> 03:06:52.039]  No, I already knew they were evil.
[03:06:52.039 --> 03:06:53.840]  I already knew they were going to come after me.
[03:06:53.880 --> 03:06:55.960]  I'm surprised they haven't killed me or put me in prison yet.
[03:06:56.400 --> 03:06:59.359]  They've certainly been trying to put me in prison, but he's right.
[03:06:59.400 --> 03:07:03.480]  Being involved in service against evil, being involved in standing up
[03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:09.400]  against evil, I joined my ancestors that were amazing people who fought
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:11.240]  corruption and tyrants as well.
[03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:16.800]  And so it fundamentally at a cellular level has satisfied me and made me
[03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:23.160]  so empowered and in such discernment and such a better man that all this
[03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:24.279]  pain has been worth it.
[03:07:24.919 --> 03:07:27.779]  And really on the other side of it has been nothing but victory and success.
[03:07:27.779 --> 03:07:32.759]  I get to see all the major prominent voices echoing my analysis and my
[03:07:32.759 --> 03:07:36.079]  research and then on their own, discovering how the globalist operates.
[03:07:36.079 --> 03:07:37.400]  Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:38.400]  It's like taking the red bill.
[03:07:38.759 --> 03:07:43.220]  Morpheus tells Neo, Neo, you can't be told about the matrix.
[03:07:43.220 --> 03:07:44.400]  You've got to see it for yourself.
[03:07:44.439 --> 03:07:46.960]  And so it's not that they're following what I say, it's that they're
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:50.079]  waking up because of our research and our guest research and this show
[03:07:50.079 --> 03:07:53.160]  and our listeners support, and then they're seeing what we see.
[03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:55.960]  They've, they've taken the blinders off where to use the opposite
[03:07:55.960 --> 03:08:01.800]  analogy, like they live, they put the sunglasses on and so it enrages
[03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:04.960]  my enemies when I talk about the fact that I would do it the same way
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:08.640]  again, basically, and the Lord works in mysterious ways, but I've not
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:11.199]  made the point that yes, I am happier than I've ever been.
[03:08:11.800 --> 03:08:14.439]  I'm also very nostalgic for some of the freedoms we've lost.
[03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:19.079]  I'm, I'm, I'm sad and I grieve, but at the end of the day, I'm so
[03:08:19.079 --> 03:08:23.680]  fulfilled and so much closer to God that I'm a completely different person.
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:26.840]  I mean, I look back on the mistakes I made and I was never perfect, but
[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:30.680]  I always loved God and love justice, but I am so much more of a person now.
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:33.320]  My intellectual capacity is so much greater.
[03:08:34.279 --> 03:08:37.400]  In the past, I would dream like most people do in their sixth or seventh
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:40.640]  hour of sleep, room sleep, and now I go to bed at night.
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:42.079]  I used to only sleep like five, six hours.
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:43.880]  I love to sleep 10 hours now.
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:47.079]  I don't usually get to, but I just have dreams from the time I go to
[03:08:47.079 --> 03:08:50.320]  sleep, the time I wake up, that's, that's, that, this shows amazing
[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:52.359]  brain activity and something's happened.
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:54.800]  I've just dialed in closer to God and the Holy spirit.
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:56.960]  And it's just, it's just fabulous.
[03:08:57.279 --> 03:09:01.720]  I mean, the dreams are just spectacular and they're so incredible.
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:02.800]  I can't even describe them.
[03:09:02.800 --> 03:09:06.199]  And that just shows that we're designed to fight evil.
[03:09:06.199 --> 03:09:07.320]  We're designed to stand up for good.
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:10.199]  And so I really love Owen and I love the rest of the crew and I love
[03:09:10.199 --> 03:09:13.199]  the listeners and I love all our sponsors and affiliates and just everybody.
[03:09:14.199 --> 03:09:17.079]  I love this journey, getting to see who's real and who's not, and all the
[03:09:17.079 --> 03:09:20.160]  great people I've gotten to meet and gotten to know in this fight.
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:23.359]  And how I've seen people grow, not just myself, but I've seen us all grow.
[03:09:23.960 --> 03:09:26.079]  So really this is the animating contest of Liberty.
[03:09:26.599 --> 03:09:28.960]  And we've got a big fourth hour guest coming up.
[03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:31.599]  I will be hosting the war room today, 3 PM central.
[03:09:31.599 --> 03:09:34.560]  We're working really hard and I'm on my way back to Austin right now.
[03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:35.919]  So I'll see you guys soon.
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:38.840]  But again, I just wanted to point out that Edward Doubt is totally right.
[03:09:39.359 --> 03:09:40.919]  I am way happier than I've ever been.
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:42.919]  I was never trying to amass wealth.
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:47.560]  I had some backup money and some backup things since I knew attacks were coming.
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:51.560]  And I tend to always expend those investments to stay on here.
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:55.359]  And I'm going to say I'm the best Stuart, but, uh, you know, I, I took
[03:09:55.359 --> 03:09:58.199]  the 3 million backup money we had five years ago and bought a property
[03:09:58.199 --> 03:10:02.199]  that, uh, I sold last year for 7 million and I put the proceeds
[03:10:02.279 --> 03:10:04.720]  completely, uh, into the fight.
[03:10:05.359 --> 03:10:09.079]  And we got a seven, $8 million Bitcoin donation, seven or eight.
[03:10:09.079 --> 03:10:10.680]  Cause you know, we got it at about 8 million, but by the
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:13.759]  time I sold it at 7 million and I put it all into the operation.
[03:10:13.759 --> 03:10:16.320]  And then it was the exact amount we needed to stay on air.
[03:10:16.759 --> 03:10:18.480]  So that's how God works in mysterious ways.
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:21.240]  And my enemies, when they had me on the stand in Connecticut, they
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:24.160]  said, Oh, under oath, you claim you gave all the Bitcoin money,
[03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.480]  which I had a right to keep it.
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:27.840]  It was given to me personally, you claim you gave that to
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:30.759]  free speech systems, info wars, under penalty of perjury.
[03:10:30.759 --> 03:10:32.039]  You'll go to prison in your line.
[03:10:32.599 --> 03:10:35.279]  And I went, Oh yeah, there's some bonuses to the employees, which
[03:10:35.279 --> 03:10:37.039]  is the info wars anyways.
[03:10:37.199 --> 03:10:39.720]  Yeah, it, it, it all went there.
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:44.039]  I think like $50,000 or something got spent on some of my bills, but the point
[03:10:44.039 --> 03:10:47.599]  is they just couldn't believe it because they'd never do that.
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.680]  They never have a $3 million house.
[03:10:51.320 --> 03:10:52.800]  Uh, and I bought it as an investment.
[03:10:53.519 --> 03:10:55.519]  Uh, I was told about it by a great realtor.
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:10:57.039]  He's actually Elon Musk realtor.
[03:10:57.039 --> 03:10:57.599]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:10:57.599 --> 03:10:59.519]  But you're an awesome, great Patriot named Gary.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.279]  He said, listen, this guy's a banker.
[03:11:01.279 --> 03:11:02.240]  He can't finish his house.
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:03.720]  He'll sell it to you for three.
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:04.840]  It's worth 5 million right now.
[03:11:04.840 --> 03:11:06.000]  In a couple of years, we were worth seven.
[03:11:06.039 --> 03:11:07.000]  I suggest you buy it.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.880]  And just all it needs is a few of the fixtures and doors and
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:10.640]  air conditioning put in.
[03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:15.039]  I took all the money I had bought it with a full intention.
[03:11:15.039 --> 03:11:17.519]  And on the storm was coming and then sold it two and a half, three
[03:11:17.519 --> 03:11:19.800]  years later for 7 million plus dollars.
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:23.359]  And I dumped it all into free speech right when we were being censored
[03:11:23.359 --> 03:11:25.599]  and shut down and had no funds.
[03:11:26.119 --> 03:11:27.720]  And it just came through and kept us on air.
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:30.439]  And it was such a blessing, but I'll tell you this now.
[03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:34.000]  I don't care about losing the quote wealth I have, except the fact
[03:11:34.039 --> 03:11:35.480]  I don't have anything in my batteries.
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:37.079]  I don't have anything else.
[03:11:37.119 --> 03:11:38.800]  I am actually upside down.
[03:11:39.359 --> 03:11:42.199]  That's why I need your support at defendjones.com for
[03:11:42.199 --> 03:11:43.880]  my own personal expenses.
[03:11:44.279 --> 03:11:47.800]  That's why I need you to go to jonescrouter.com or do a once a week
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:51.119]  show with Crowder to get all the other shows he's got all the special
[03:11:51.119 --> 03:11:52.919]  behind the paywall stuff at jonescrouter.com.
[03:11:52.919 --> 03:11:57.720]  You get one month free with a promo code Alex at jonescrouter.com.
[03:11:58.039 --> 03:12:00.039]  That's how you fund Alex Jones.
[03:12:00.039 --> 03:12:02.079]  I mean, most of the money actually goes to fund free speech.
[03:12:02.079 --> 03:12:05.279]  And, but some of it goes to me because I'm out of money.
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:07.439]  And so it's very, very simple.
[03:12:07.439 --> 03:12:08.439]  So I don't worship the money.
[03:12:08.439 --> 03:12:10.279]  I don't care about the money, but it's like fuel.
[03:12:10.279 --> 03:12:13.199]  When I gas my car up, I don't worship the 10 gallons
[03:12:13.199 --> 03:12:15.480]  of 20 gallons I put in, but I need it to get where I'm going.
[03:12:15.919 --> 03:12:17.000]  I don't worship the car either though.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.680]  I do like it, but I love the car way more than the gas.
[03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:20.840]  You get what I'm saying?
[03:12:20.840 --> 03:12:21.919]  Money is only freedom.
[03:12:22.279 --> 03:12:23.880]  That's why we're trying to take all our money away.
[03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:24.880]  Take our prosperity away.
[03:12:25.079 --> 03:12:26.480]  I'm trying to bring our prosperity back.
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:29.240]  And it's very easy to do with the great system God's given us.
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:30.840]  I want to thank God for the great job he's done today.
[03:12:31.079 --> 03:12:32.519]  He's got a few minutes left in this segment.
[03:12:33.039 --> 03:12:34.680]  And then we've got a great guest host coming up.
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:36.160]  Now, like I said, I want to be back at 3 p.m.
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:38.480]  Central with the Warren, but thank you all for your support.
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:42.599]  Jones Crowder dot com, Jones Crowder dot com and defend Jones dot com.
[03:12:42.599 --> 03:12:43.519]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:12:48.759 --> 03:12:51.160]  Great being on Info Wars.
[03:12:52.119 --> 03:12:57.039]  And as Alex just said.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.240]  We are standing up against evil.
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:05.800]  It's as simple as that.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:07.680]  We're standing up against evil.
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:12.960]  And Info Wars and the crew, these people work very, very hard,
[03:13:13.759 --> 03:13:17.199]  as do we with the Trends Journal to give you the best that we can.
[03:13:18.119 --> 03:13:19.880]  And we're standing up against evil.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.439]  And evil is right in front of our eyes.
[03:13:24.279 --> 03:13:25.519]  Need any more proof?
[03:13:26.599 --> 03:13:28.720]  You know what last Thursday was?
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:34.599]  No, no, it wasn't Transgender Day, I think, I think it's Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:34.599 --> 03:13:39.240]  We're going to have that every, every, every, every Thursday.
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:41.759]  If I'm elected, we'll have a Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:41.759 --> 03:13:44.919]  No, no, last Thursday wasn't Transgender Thursday.
[03:13:46.519 --> 03:13:47.759]  Last Thursday.
[03:13:49.039 --> 03:13:54.320]  Was International Peace Day and these little pieces of crap,
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:01.199]  these little prestidude whores, these little arrogant Jake Tappas,
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:05.599]  these little boys, Anderson Cooper.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:09.359]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt.
[03:14:09.599 --> 03:14:12.039]  How do you think I got this job?
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:16.840]  I'm just a jerky slob, but I'm a member of the club.
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:23.320]  We won't talk one bit about International Peace Day
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:25.919]  because we're pieces of crap.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:28.800]  We're little prestidudes.
[03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:34.359]  We're media whores that get paid to put out
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:41.240]  by our corporate pimps and our government whore masters.
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:49.400]  All we do, Cilenti, all we do, Alex Jones,
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:15:01.840]  and all the rest of the crew, all we do is sell war. We're war whores. That's all we
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:11.720]  are. That's what Alex Jones said, standing up against evil. Not a peep about International
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:20.760]  Peace Day, but nowhere. Not in the toilet paper record, the New York slime, not on CNN, the
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:26.120]  Cartoon News Network. Hey, USA Today, you forgot about yesterday?
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:51.170]  No. Not a word about peace. And as you all know, I launched Occupy Peace back in 2015. OccupyPeace.com. And I have peace rallies. And oh, am I hated here. One of my tenants in the 1774 academy
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:59.200]  closed down when I had a peace and freedom rally because they called it a political rally.
[03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:06.240]  And all we are lowlife scum, we support the Ukraine war. Oh yeah? Hey, Junior, put on
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:13.000]  your military drag and go fight over there. Or shut your mouth. Anybody that supports
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:21.120]  the Ukraine war, send your money, send yourself, send your wife, send your kids, your transgender
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:24.360]  sisters, and go fight. Or shut up.
[03:16:24.500 --> 03:16:45.260]  Not a peep about International Peace Day. Instead, these are the kind of headlines,
[03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:48.480]  last week.
[03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:57.980]  Biden said, quote, if you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any
[03:16:57.980 --> 03:17:01.140]  nation secure?
[03:17:01.200 --> 03:17:08.640]  You mean like the United States invasion of Iraq?
[03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:11.600]  United States invasion of Afghanistan?
[03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:16.560]  Hey, isn't Libya beautiful now?
[03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:22.700]  About 11 to 15,000 people died in a flood because of the rotted dam breaking.
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:29.780]  But when Gaddafi was running the country, it was the richest country in Africa.
[03:17:29.780 --> 03:17:37.020]  People had more rights and benefits than all of Africa and a lot of places around the world.
[03:17:37.020 --> 03:17:46.740]  But hey, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Obama, and Hillary Clinton, and Samantha Power,
[03:17:46.740 --> 03:17:50.100]  Power, Power hungry.
[03:17:50.100 --> 03:17:56.980]  Oh, and Susan Rice, oh, not white rice, no, different color rice.
[03:17:56.980 --> 03:18:04.420]  Again, I'm sick and tired of hearing this crap that if only women were in charge, oh,
[03:18:04.420 --> 03:18:06.540]  it would be so nice.
[03:18:06.540 --> 03:18:12.620]  Good and bad comes in every race, creed, and color, and gender, got it?
[03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:14.140]  So save your crap.
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:27.800]  No word about peace. Oh, but Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. I want that guy Qaddafi
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:34.840]  out of there. No, Cilenti. You have to say it properly. Qaddafi has to go folks. He was
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:41.040]  always foking us. Folks, folks, folks. Yep, he was the folk. I want that guy who's sought
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:46.280]  out of there so we could steal their oil out of eastern Syria.
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:19:07.369]  Anyway, you read the headlines, you read the words that they say, and Biden says, if you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:18.560]  Diplomat said, wait a minute, if you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is any nation secure?
[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:21.279]  How about Palestine being all carved up?
[03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:28.540]  Oh, you're doing that so Israel could be secure, but that's okay.
[03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:39.520]  And then Biden says, I respectfully suggest the answer is no. We have to stand up to this
[03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:48.600]  naked aggression today and deter other would be aggressors tomorrow. This is not America.
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:55.780]  All you little slime balls that want to go fight aggressors overseas, pack up your crap
[03:19:55.820 --> 03:20:04.080]  and go there. I, Gerald Cilenti, am an American patriot. You got it? You got it, you little slime
[03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:13.780]  balls. I believe in people like George Washington. That's right. A real man that fought. Oh yeah,
[03:20:13.780 --> 03:20:20.900]  remember Washington crossing the Delaware? No Biden, he didn't take a ferry. He went there
[03:20:20.900 --> 03:20:30.220]  to fight. That George Washington, not like you Biden, five draft affirmants Biden and your fifth
[03:20:30.220 --> 03:20:35.860]  one you got when you said you had asthma when you were a kid and you couldn't go to Vietnam,
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:42.780]  but you love every war. Oh, you said you had asthma, but you also brag what a great athlete
[03:20:42.780 --> 03:20:46.780]  you were. Oh, you were a great athlete in college, but you couldn't go fight. No,
[03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:56.500]  because you are exactly what Alex Jones said. We're standing up against evil.
[03:20:56.700 --> 03:21:01.660]  So, going back.
[03:21:01.700 --> 03:21:08.700]  Covering up and cutting up every place that you want.
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:18.360]  George Washington said, do not become involved in any foreign entanglements.
[03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:25.400]  This is none of our business. It's only our business when we are threatened.
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:38.020]  When we are going to be attacked, that is our only, only interest. Save your BS crap that
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:43.500]  you're bringing freedom and democracy to other countries, you little pieces of scum, when
[03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:52.100]  you're robbing from us. What freedom do you have? Get in your house. COVID's coming. COVID's
[03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:56.140]  coming. Get in your house and close your business. Oh, freedom?
[03:21:56.300 --> 03:22:14.420]  You spelled democracy wrong. D-U-H, duh, mock, M-O-C-K, mock, R-A-C-Y, duh, mock-racy.
[03:22:14.420 --> 03:22:22.539]  You got to be duh, stupid to think that you live in a free country when we're in control
[03:22:22.539 --> 03:22:36.580]  of you. So this is the crap that they're spreading. One article after another. Oh, Ukraine's space
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:47.259]  Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. Great. Great. Ukraine has lost this war. You go back to your Trans
[03:22:47.259 --> 03:23:00.500]  When the war began on 24 February 2022, we said, ain't no way, no how that Ukraine's going to defeat Russia.
[03:23:00.600 --> 03:23:04.100]  This is the Russia.
[03:23:04.200 --> 03:23:22.800]  That the Germans killed 25 million plus during World War II in Operation Barbarossa.
[03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:25.520]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:30.360]  How about a guy they assassinated because he wanted peace, John F. Kennedy?
[03:23:30.360 --> 03:23:42.520]  Listen to his speech at Washington University in June of 1963, five months before they jack
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:44.280]  you dead when they killed him.
[03:23:44.280 --> 03:23:45.280]  All about peace.
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:50.440]  And he goes on to say that we should not hate the people of the Soviet Union.
[03:23:50.500 --> 03:23:57.940]  You see, these people are very advanced scientifically, culturally, philosophically.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:07.760]  And over 20 million of them were killed by the Russians, by the Germans.
[03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:11.800]  They suffered more than any other nation.
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:18.800]  Their land, their farms, their homes, their factories were destroyed.
[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:22.800]  Kennedy, from Chicago East.
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:41.990]  Kennedy also warns that if we go to war with the Soviet Union, which is now Russia, in
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  will be eliminated in 24 hours, and the destruction will last for many generations.
[03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:56.039]  Yeah.
[03:24:56.100 --> 03:25:00.100]  Thank you.
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:06.400]  Biden urges global unity and sticking up for Ukraine.
[03:25:06.500 --> 03:25:17.760]  And then the guy that's the president of Ukraine, the prime minister's president, Zelensky,
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:42.090]  whose former role was a comedian in a sitcom that played the piano with his penis, said war crimes must be punished, deported people must come home, and the occupier must return to their own land.
[03:25:42.100 --> 03:26:03.050]  Huh. War crimes must be punished. So when am I gonna see little Georgie Bush punished for taking us into the, lying us into the Iraq war? Why am I gonna, when am I gonna see little Georgie Bush punished?
[03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:13.820]  Who'll bring us into the Afghan war? How about those war crimes, Zelensky? How about those
[03:26:13.820 --> 03:26:22.700]  war crimes? Oh, and by the way, how about the Ukrainian war crimes? That's right. The Ukrainian
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:32.580]  war crimes, when you kill some 15,000 people in the Donbass region, they're all Russian-speaking
[03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:38.300]  people, and Ukraine was part of Russia in and out for 300 years. But when the United
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:46.820]  States launched the coup in 2014, and the people didn't buy it in the Donbass region,
[03:26:46.900 --> 03:26:58.539]  the Ukrainian government said, let's kill him. Oh, and look at that little clip on InfoWars.
[03:26:58.539 --> 03:27:09.660]  Yeah. About how up in Canada, they're praising the Nazi Ukrainians. Yeah. Praising the Nazis
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:16.340]  up in Canada. That's right. It's there for everybody to watch, listen to. It's not misinformation,
[03:27:16.340 --> 03:27:23.900]  not a conspiracy theory. Oh, and by the way, read about how we've been writing in the Trends
[03:27:23.900 --> 03:27:32.180]  Journal about how Putin is saying we're fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine. The facts are right
[03:27:32.180 --> 03:27:38.820]  there. Oh, and did you hear little true dope? A little arrogant boy that talks so tough,
[03:27:38.820 --> 03:27:43.820]  but again, wants to do everything to support Ukraine, but go over there and fight little
[03:27:43.820 --> 03:27:49.580]  true dope. Can't understand why your wife left you. I watched her talk and I figured it out
[03:27:49.580 --> 03:27:54.619]  because anybody with a brain couldn't stand a little slimer like you. And I'll call you
[03:27:54.619 --> 03:27:59.539]  that to your face. You little warm-mongering nothing of a boy. Oh, what do you mean nothing
[03:27:59.539 --> 03:28:05.060]  of a boy? Don't you know my daddy was? My daddy was pure dope. Just like little
[03:28:05.060 --> 03:28:09.180]  Georgie Bush, a little nothing of a clown. Oh, you know my daddy was? Do you know
[03:28:09.180 --> 03:28:16.100]  my granddaddy? Oh, don't press Scott Bush. George Collins said it is one big club and you
[03:28:16.100 --> 03:28:25.500]  ain't in it. And we on the Info Wars team are the one big club that ain't in it. And it
[03:28:25.500 --> 03:28:30.619]  does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting
[03:28:30.619 --> 03:28:36.500]  breastfires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams, and we are them. And you

[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:58.320]  You know, when the COVID war broke out, we were the first magazine, by the way, to say,
[03:34:01.519 --> 03:34:10.160]  it began on January 2020, the celebration of Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat.
[03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:16.720]  That's when the Chinese launched it. Two weeks later, the cover of our magazine was coronavirus,
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:18.320]  106 dead in China.
[03:34:18.600 --> 03:34:24.360]  And the next line was 1.4 billion still alive, what do you tell me this one?
[03:34:24.600 --> 03:34:34.380]  So, what I'm saying is that we're bringing you what nobody else is bringing you.
[03:34:34.380 --> 03:34:38.820]  All they're bringing you is lie, hate, fear and hysteria.
[03:34:38.820 --> 03:34:42.780]  That's the way that they make money in the mainstream media.
[03:34:42.780 --> 03:34:46.480]  We're bringing you facts and information.
[03:34:46.480 --> 03:34:54.240]  And by the way, if you want to subscribe to the Trends Journal, you go to JonesTrends.com
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:57.240]  and you get a great deal.
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:02.120]  And by the way, it's only $2.86 a week, but you go to JonesTrends.com and it's even a
[03:35:02.120 --> 03:35:04.120]  lot less.
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:09.160]  So, again, we had forecast.
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:21.720]  Back in June, that the markets would go down in April and October, excuse me, in September
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:22.720]  and October.
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:25.040]  So, here we are.
[03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:26.560]  The markets are down again today.
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:36.720]  They're down all across. They're down and they're really getting hit in Hang Seng. China's
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:43.680]  finished. They launched the COVID war. The 21st century was going to be the Chinese century
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:48.400]  before they launched this thing. And then three years of zero COVID policy, they destroyed
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:54.820]  their economy. And the economy has been destroyed around the world. No one talks about it.
[03:35:54.820 --> 03:36:01.780]  We do when we give you the facts. So going back to the economy, let's go back to the
[03:36:01.780 --> 03:36:02.580]  COVID war.
[03:36:02.700 --> 03:36:09.660]  Stay home, close down your business, here's money, don't worry about it, it's going to
[03:36:09.660 --> 03:36:12.600]  your bank account, here you go.
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:16.780]  Trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars dumped in, zero interest rate policy.
[03:36:16.780 --> 03:36:21.540]  Yeah, I don't want to go to work, I got all this free money, yeah.
[03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:23.340]  So what happened?
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:27.620]  Money is flowing into the banks, so none of the banks got all this dough, right?
[03:36:27.620 --> 03:36:30.140]  What do they do with the dough?
[03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:32.540]  They bought treasuries.
[03:36:32.540 --> 03:36:38.780]  They bought treasuries when interest rates were at zero, so the treasuries were worth
[03:36:38.780 --> 03:36:41.300]  like zero.
[03:36:41.300 --> 03:36:43.420]  Fast forward.
[03:36:43.500 --> 03:36:51.180]  Treasury yields, why should I invest in the stock market?
[03:36:51.180 --> 03:36:54.940]  I go to money market funds, I go to treasuries, I almost get 5% of my money.
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:37:04.140]  But wait a minute, the banks had all that money and now they're in a losing game because they
[03:37:04.140 --> 03:37:07.540]  bought all this stuff when interest rates were near zero.
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:11.600]  Now let's put it together.
[03:37:11.500 --> 03:37:15.570]  Before I put it together,
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:27.600]  we're telling you the greatest economic calamity in modern history is about to occur.
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:36.600]  The debt levels that have been built up as a result of the COVID war.
[03:37:36.700 --> 03:37:45.180]  It's like in the $305 trillion mark, globally.
[03:37:45.200 --> 03:37:56.200]  And by the way, we have a great article coming out in the Trends Journal this week that comes out tomorrow by Gregory Manarino talking about this as well.
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:37:59.200]  So now let's put it all back together.
[03:37:59.200 --> 03:38:07.200]  The office building bust. We're the only ones that forecast this over three years ago.
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:12.200]  People are working from home. They don't want to commute.
[03:38:11.300 --> 03:38:18.220]  People that are renting all this office space, I don't need all this office space, stay home,
[03:38:18.220 --> 03:38:26.099]  come back three days a week. Your office occupancy rate, according to Castle Systems with a K,
[03:38:26.099 --> 03:38:35.880]  is around 47%. That's right. 53% of the people aren't going back into the offices. Now the
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:40.800]  people that are renting the office are saying, I don't need this place. My lease is up there.
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:42.759]  Give me two floors instead of 12.
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:51.060]  Now, the people that own the office buildings, how are they going to pay their loans?
[03:38:51.060 --> 03:38:57.580]  Oh, those loans that are floating loans that are going to cost them a lot more now to renew
[03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:00.060]  their loans because interest rates are so high?
[03:39:00.100 --> 03:39:08.460]  You, and now the banks, don't have the money to cover this because, as I put this whole
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:13.980]  thing together, tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where
[03:39:13.980 --> 03:39:14.980]  we're going.
[03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:20.120]  And our system is global nomic, making connections between different fields.
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:23.600]  Opportunity misses those who view the world through the eyes of their profession.
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:26.820]  We look at everything.
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:33.240]  So now, they got all these worthless bonds that they bought, these treasuries, that they're
[03:39:33.240 --> 03:39:35.020]  losing money on.
[03:39:35.020 --> 03:39:38.220]  Now they're not getting money coming in the banks.
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:46.820]  When these loans are due on these commercial offices and other commercial real estate,
[03:39:46.900 --> 03:39:50.400]  what's going to happen?
[03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:56.960]  Again, you are going to see a banking bust the likes of which we've never seen.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:07.640]  But don't worry, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:40:07.700 --> 03:40:17.060]  What is Biden talking about? Setting another $24 billion of our money to Ukraine? Yesterday,
[03:40:17.060 --> 03:40:22.040]  I went filling up my car with gas. I remember back when I was a kid, they used to have people
[03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:30.240]  pumping gas. It was great. Anyway, and I see this couple, the woman was nicely dressed,
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:37.240]  the guy so-so. A little younger than me, maybe about 10 years younger, I guess. You
[03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:41.140]  know what they were doing? I was at the quick check. They had a big place. They were going
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:47.040]  through all the garbage cans looking for bottles so they could get deposit money. Yeah.
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:52.100]  That's the America we live in today.
[03:40:52.300 --> 03:41:05.420]  One of the reasons why Trump won, the three things he promised, build a wall, tax cuts,
[03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:06.420]  and rebuild the infrastructure.
[03:41:06.420 --> 03:41:11.779]  He only did the tax cuts, and I know I didn't build a wall, blah, blah, blah, but it didn't
[03:41:11.779 --> 03:41:12.779]  happen.
[03:41:12.779 --> 03:41:20.380]  Anybody running today in any country, this immigration crisis is big time.
[03:41:20.380 --> 03:41:22.960]  That should be the number one stand.
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:26.740]  How about America for the Americans?
[03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:29.699]  But put the whole picture together.
[03:41:29.699 --> 03:41:34.359]  Why are the people leaving their countries in droves like this?
[03:41:34.359 --> 03:41:38.859]  One reason, because all the wars America and its allies started.
[03:41:38.859 --> 03:41:46.900]  Number two, the corruption, government corruption around the world, poverty, violence, and
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:47.340]  crime.
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:52.640]  This is the new world order.
[03:41:52.640 --> 03:41:55.320]  We are living in evil times.
[03:41:55.320 --> 03:41:57.640]  We have to reverse this.
[03:41:57.640 --> 03:42:00.640]  And to me the only way that we'll reverse it is the Renaissance.
[03:42:00.700 --> 03:42:09.680]  And you can see how low we've gone when you see a slob like Fetterman showing up and looking
[03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:18.920]  like a jerk, but you know what? He represents the slobbing down of America. I say bring
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:26.440]  back dignity and grace. No, no, Fetterman says bring back slob and disgusting. Vote
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:35.300]  the way you want, folks. Yep. Vote the way you want. We need a higher level and the higher
[03:42:35.300 --> 03:42:45.180]  levels from the level above because I, Gerald Cilente, am a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:42:45.180 --> 03:42:51.920]  OccupyPeace.com, donate what you can. You go to Jonestrends.com for the Trends Journal
[03:42:51.920 --> 03:43:03.640]  and support everything you can for info boards. I tell you, as I travel back to Austin, Texas
[03:43:03.640 --> 03:43:08.040]  right now to be back in the studio, I'm listening to Gerald Cilente and he's on fire. So I
[03:43:08.040 --> 03:43:12.920]  want to just send us a little message and say, Gerald, we love you. You're a real American.
[03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:16.800]  And the way you point out that, you know, George Washington led from the front and
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:22.600]  he fought a war that the biggest empire in the world had started. And he was the underdog
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:29.960]  for six years and lost almost every battle. But he persevered and he got that one victory
[03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:33.760]  at Trenton after going across the Delaware and a bunch of his troops froze to death.
[03:43:33.760 --> 03:43:37.640]  And then the British and German soldiers were shooting at him. The Hessian soldiers,
[03:43:37.640 --> 03:43:43.920]  the Prussian soldiers literally at 50 yards away, thousands of them. And they said it was
[03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:48.280]  like he was magically, divinely protected. Call it what you want, luck, whatever. They
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:52.040]  were shawl shooting at him and they couldn't hit him as he led the troops in for the
[03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:55.480]  main assault. But you know what, whether you believe in God or not, the point is
[03:43:55.480 --> 03:44:01.040]  fortune favors the bold. That's the British special forces motto. And I just want to
[03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:05.800]  point out what Gerald says is so central. The chicken Hawks that all got draft deferments
[03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:09.040]  in Vietnam and you name it, are the ones that tell us how great war is all day.
[03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:13.400]  And Sean Penn saying nuclear war is a good thing. Why are we scared of it? These
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:20.360]  are psychotic nuts. And what the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov says on Saturday
[03:44:20.360 --> 03:44:25.280]  to UN is so central. I covered this big this week. The clips are on Bandai video.
[03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:30.180]  You got to go watch it. And it's just true. It's just true. He said the West has
[03:44:30.180 --> 03:44:38.240]  lost its survival instinct. It's lost its feeling that it can be destroyed. It's lost
[03:44:38.240 --> 03:44:43.680]  any capacity to realize that self-preservation is important because that's what this is. Ladies
[03:44:43.680 --> 03:44:47.480]  and gentlemen, the Russian submarines are off the East and West coast or in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:53.440]  One submarine, it's got 24 cruise missiles and a bunch of other nukes on it could take
[03:44:53.440 --> 03:44:58.280]  out the entire East coast. One of those missiles, Manhattan's gone. It's going to fire
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:03.520]  10 in Manhattan alone. It's going to fire 20. There's multiple subs just to hit DC.
[03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:09.040]  Pentagon's gone. And our past leaders weren't perfect, whether they were Kennedy or Eisenhower
[03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:16.160]  or Reagan or Nixon or even the psychotic Clinton or even Obama. But now they have no sense of
[03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:21.240]  danger, no sense of what they're playing with because they have this normalcy bias because none
[03:45:21.240 --> 03:45:25.720]  of them, wherever generals are military leaders and I'm not lionizing them, but at least they
[03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:30.120]  know how dangerous war is. All the real military analysts say back off. It's dangerous like Colonel
[03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:34.960]  McGregor and countless others, but all the little chicken Hawks, all the little cowards,
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:40.200]  they've never even been in a fight, never even beat somebody's brains out. They think
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:42.480]  that, cause I mean, let me tell you, I don't claim to be the toughest guy around,
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:47.120]  but I grew up in Dallas, got a lot of fights, very rough situation. And I learned
[03:45:47.120 --> 03:45:51.120]  no matter how tough I was, man, there's always going to run to somebody that if they
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:53.920]  start a fight with you, you might as well back down because this may even be a little
[03:45:53.920 --> 03:45:58.520]  guy. He is about to beat the living hell out of you. I'll tell a quick story and
[03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:02.360]  it back to Gerald, we'll skip the next break so I don't steal his time. But, uh, I had
[03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:11.760]  a guy when I was 15 start a fight with me and, uh, at the movies. And, uh, I, he
[03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:16.240]  punched me. I punched him, broke his nose. He had to have nose surgery, rammed his
[03:46:16.240 --> 03:46:20.960]  head in the wall cause he started kicking my ass. So I got mad. And, uh, about a
[03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:26.560]  year later I'm walking down the street and a pickup truck pulls over and just another
[03:46:26.600 --> 03:46:30.760]  small black guy, smaller than I was, you know, he wasn't little, but he wasn't a
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:35.560]  huge guy gets out. He says, you Alex Jones? And I said, yeah. And he came up
[03:46:35.560 --> 03:46:41.140]  and did a, not a body slam, but a pile driver, my head in the ground and
[03:46:41.140 --> 03:46:44.720]  split my head wide open. Now I did jump back up and punch him in the
[03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:46.880]  throat. He had to get tricky out of me to put them in animals to put me in
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:50.560]  jail about it. But the point is, is that you learn when you've been in
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:54.160]  fights that there's a lot of badasses out there, no matter how tough you are,
[03:46:54.160 --> 03:46:56.760]  no matter how punches you can take. Cause that's my gift is I can take a
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:46:59.800]  lot of punches, a lot of damage. It doesn't matter. There's people so fast
[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:02.120]  and so mean, you don't even have an idea. There's always somebody
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:05.400]  tougher on any given day. And we're dealing with nuclear weapons in the
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:07.840]  Russians here. So I didn't tell a fighting story to act tough. I told a
[03:47:07.840 --> 03:47:12.080]  story about being humble and realizing that, that, that, that the
[03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:16.360]  smartest thing to do is not getting a fight. And instead these
[03:47:16.360 --> 03:47:19.800]  globalists with their little, little Dick syndrome are starting world
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:22.160]  war three and it's so dangerous. So we love Gerald Salente. We love
[03:47:22.160 --> 03:47:25.640]  the audience. He's making incredibly powerful points. And the
[03:47:25.640 --> 03:47:28.000]  good news is it's not admitted by Syhurst and others. It's not
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:31.240]  that we would need him to tell us that the Ukrainian Nazis have
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:34.280]  lost the war. They are Nazis. They tried to mainline this with
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:36.720]  Nazis. Now they thought they were getting away with Nazis in
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:39.520]  Ukraine, the grandsons. So why not bring an SS officer that
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:42.920]  actually ran Holocaust operations into be praised. This is all
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:45.760]  planned. They love to rub our noses in it, but it's blown up
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:47.520]  with their face like everything else they're doing. So the
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:48.680]  worm is turning against them.
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:51.680]  Hello there, you awakening wonders. Thanks for joining me on Stay

[03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:12.360]  show for you today in our item. Here's the news. No,
[03:48:12.360 --> 03:48:15.200]  here's the effing news. We are going to be talking about
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:18.640]  the state and the legacy media's war on free speech and
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:21.400]  in particular, how that has affected me this week. We've
[03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:24.400]  also got Jimmy Dore coming up on the show and you know what
[03:48:24.400 --> 03:48:27.960]  Jimmy Dore will be advocating for revolution, mass
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:31.520]  disobedience, new alliances between ordinary people, putting
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:34.440]  aside the barriers and boundaries of left and right that
[03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:37.760]  we can come together to oppose increasingly authoritarian
[03:48:37.840 --> 03:48:40.880]  centralized power. We're going to continue to do on this
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:44.360]  channel, what we've always done, tell you the truth as
[03:48:44.360 --> 03:48:48.400]  best we can listen to you as best we can. So the first
[03:48:48.400 --> 03:48:50.360]  story we're going to talk about is Stoltenberg
[03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:54.600]  acknowledging that Putin invaded Ukraine due to NATO
[03:48:54.760 --> 03:48:57.960]  infringement. A significant story because of course, what
[03:48:57.960 --> 03:49:01.600]  we've mostly been schooled in is that Russia are a criminal
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:05.920]  nation, led by a lunatic in Putin, that unprovoked
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:09.680]  attacked Ukraine. As we always say, the Ukrainian people
[03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:12.720]  should be utmost in our thoughts and the humanitarian
[03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:16.320]  imperatives that the world claims are what's driving this
[03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:20.720]  war ought be, what's driving a move towards peace. But as
[03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:23.480]  you know, the military industrial complex are
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:26.400]  significantly invested in what some people, Jimmy Dore
[03:49:26.400 --> 03:49:30.440]  notably, regard as a money laundering operation. Let's
[03:49:30.440 --> 03:49:33.640]  have a look at Stoltenberg acknowledging the simple
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:35.760]  truth that Putin was provoked.
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:40.560]  President Putin declared in the autumn of 2021 and
[03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:44.280]  actually sent a draft treaty that they wanted NATO to
[03:49:44.280 --> 03:49:49.320]  sign to promise no more NATO enlargement. That was what what
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:53.720]  he sent us. And that was that that was a pre condition for not
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:59.440]  invade Ukraine. Of course, we didn't sign that. The opposite
[03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:03.320]  happened. He wanted us to sign the promise never to enlarge
[03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:08.960]  NATO. He wanted us to remove our military infrastructure in in
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:12.480]  all allies that have joined NATO since 1997, meaning half
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:15.640]  of NATO, all the central Eastern Europe, we should remove
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:20.400]  NATO from from that over of our lines, introducing some kind
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:26.120]  of E and B or second class membership. We rejected that. So
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:30.400]  he went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO close to his
[03:50:30.400 --> 03:50:33.640]  borders. He has he has got the exact opposite.
[03:50:33.680 --> 03:50:36.640]  In a sense, what's being described there is the recipe
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:39.640]  for a peaceful resolution to this conflict, which many
[03:50:39.640 --> 03:50:41.960]  believe and let me know what you think in the chat. And
[03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:44.920]  remember, if you press the red Awaken button, you can join our
[03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:47.360]  community and it's more important that you do that now
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:50.560]  than it ever has been before. Join our locals community, we
[03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:53.440]  need your support. We are plainly in a position where
[03:50:53.440 --> 03:50:57.440]  your direct support is going to be incredibly valuable to us.
[03:50:57.440 --> 03:51:01.040]  Now, we've just heard there described is the reasons that
[03:51:01.040 --> 03:51:04.600]  Putin went to war with Ukraine. Let's get into this
[03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:08.000]  story a little more deeply. Jesse Stoltenberg asserted today
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:10.520]  that weakening Russia and Ukraine could allow the United
[03:51:10.520 --> 03:51:13.560]  States to intensify its efforts in countering China.
[03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:17.000]  Stoltenberg and chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:19.960]  Milley believe the war in Ukraine will continue for years
[03:51:19.960 --> 03:51:23.360]  if Kiev is to achieve its military goals. Stoltenberg
[03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:27.360]  said, we must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine. Who
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:29.840]  would benefit from a long war in Ukraine? Would it be the
[03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:32.880]  Ukrainian people? Or would it be the military industrial
[03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:34.560]  complex? Why don't you let us know in the chat what you
[03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:37.120]  think? President Biden met with Ukrainian President
[03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:41.640]  Vladimir Zelensky on Thursday and announced the new
[03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:44.400]  tranche of US military aid for Ukraine that includes more
[03:51:44.400 --> 03:51:47.120]  cluster bombs, which are notorious for killing and
[03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:50.000]  maiming civilians. It seems that there's an absolute
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:52.960]  amorality when it comes to the approach of this war, when
[03:51:52.960 --> 03:51:55.960]  it comes to telling stories about this war, when it comes
[03:51:55.960 --> 03:51:59.240]  to dissenting against this war, when it comes to advocating
[03:51:59.240 --> 03:52:02.480]  for peace, when it comes to looking at what conditions may
[03:52:02.480 --> 03:52:05.000]  have led to this war. In a minute, we're going to have
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:07.360]  our presentation, here's the news, no, here's the effing
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:10.520]  news, where I'm going to be talking about how the state,
[03:52:10.520 --> 03:52:14.200]  legacy media and big tech cooperate with one another in
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:17.120]  order to control narratives that are plainly against the
[03:52:17.120 --> 03:52:19.960]  interests of ordinary people, how they prevent us from
[03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:23.360]  becoming united around topics as diverse as the pandemic,
[03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:27.440]  and indeed this ongoing conflict, and also how the same
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:31.560]  psyops units that used to be engaged in opposition
[03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:35.160]  against ISIS are now being deployed against domestic
[03:52:35.160 --> 03:52:37.560]  populations. We're talking about that in a matter of
[03:52:37.560 --> 03:52:40.400]  moments, also we'll be talking to Jimmy Dore, but I
[03:52:40.400 --> 03:52:43.600]  think it's important that we cover these vital issues
[03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:47.280]  that appear to have considerable opposition from the
[03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:50.200]  mainstream legacy media. We're talking about what we've
[03:52:50.200 --> 03:52:53.240]  always talked about, big pharma and their ability to
[03:52:53.240 --> 03:52:56.560]  assert and exert power over political process, the
[03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:59.760]  military industrial complex that seem to be able to
[03:52:59.760 --> 03:53:03.800]  control foreign policy to generate, create war, and then
[03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:07.080]  find convenient excuses for why that war might be taking
[03:53:07.080 --> 03:53:10.320]  place. Most of all, what we're advocating for is our
[03:53:10.320 --> 03:53:13.800]  shared collective voices and our ability to independently
[03:53:13.800 --> 03:53:16.800]  communicate with one another, for the possibility that
[03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:19.800]  we might create new systems together. If we don't have
[03:53:19.800 --> 03:53:22.320]  the ability to control currency, if we don't have the
[03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:25.400]  ability to create independent media, then we are slowly
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:30.040]  being corralled into a totalitarian space where nobody
[03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:34.600]  has any individual power. We already live in a globalist
[03:53:34.600 --> 03:53:37.760]  corporatist condition where unelected bodies, whether
[03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:41.040]  that's NATO, no one voted for them, the WHO, no one
[03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:44.200]  voted for them, or the UN, are in a position where
[03:53:44.200 --> 03:53:48.120]  they are able to impose policy on sovereign nations.
[03:53:48.120 --> 03:53:50.640]  Democracy is becoming meaningless, and the only
[03:53:50.640 --> 03:53:52.880]  reason those stories are not being told is because
[03:53:52.880 --> 03:53:56.400]  legacy media are in lockstep with one another in order
[03:53:56.400 --> 03:53:59.600]  to prevent truthful, open, and honest conversations
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:02.440]  happening that would allow us to form new alliances.
[03:54:02.440 --> 03:54:04.640]  We'll be looking at that in Here's The News, but
[03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:07.520]  now, without going too much more deeply into this
[03:54:07.520 --> 03:54:10.520]  obvious crisis and counter narrative to how the war
[03:54:10.520 --> 03:54:12.680]  between Ukraine and Russia began, let's have a look
[03:54:12.680 --> 03:54:16.160]  at the Empire State Building being lit up as a giant
[03:54:16.160 --> 03:54:20.080]  Pfizer needle. For what reason exactly? This is a
[03:54:20.080 --> 03:54:22.240]  press release about that story. Today, the Empire
[03:54:22.240 --> 03:54:24.800]  State Building turned its iconic building blue to
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:27.160]  announce that the CDC recommends everyone six
[03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:29.480]  months of age and older gets this season's updated
[03:54:29.480 --> 03:54:31.920]  COVID-19 shot. The blue light symbolizes our
[03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:35.440]  gratitude and appreciation for the updated
[03:54:35.440 --> 03:54:39.080]  vaccines and all those who made it possible.
[03:54:39.080 --> 03:54:42.840]  A literal monolith and icon of American culture is
[03:54:42.840 --> 03:54:45.880]  being turned into an advertisement for a private
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:49.240]  company. When did the symbols of a great nation
[03:54:49.240 --> 03:54:51.960]  become co-opted by a corporation? How has this
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:54.360]  been allowed to happen? And how is it still allowed
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:56.360]  to be referred to as a democracy? Let me know in
[03:54:56.360 --> 03:54:59.040]  the chat. Marty Makary, Professor Johns Hopkins
[03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:00.920]  School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Post
[03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:03.760]  that Pfizer's version of the new vaccine has not
[03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:07.280]  been tested on humans at all. We only have data
[03:55:07.280 --> 03:55:10.680]  about antibody production from 10 mice. If I wasn't
[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:13.720]  reading that from a reliable scientist myself, I
[03:55:13.720 --> 03:55:16.040]  would assume that it was untrue. How is that
[03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:19.440]  plausible and feasible that a national cause, an
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:22.720]  international notion, can be presented to a global
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:27.360]  population on the basis of 10 mice? The experience
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:30.640]  of 10 mice is being used to undergird an ongoing
[03:55:30.640 --> 03:55:33.280]  global program. For me, that's a cause for some
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:37.000]  concern. In summer 2020, as COVID vaccines moved
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:39.200]  ahead at warp speed, the companies behind them
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:41.400]  promised they wouldn't make too much money. Let's
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:43.680]  see how that went. Pfizer chairman, Albert
[03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:46.360]  Baller, was emphatic. His company was developing
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:48.640]  a COVID vaccine for the good of humanity, not
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:51.960]  for money, he told Time magazine in 2020. This is
[03:55:51.960 --> 03:55:54.360]  not business as usually said. If you were
[03:55:54.360 --> 03:55:56.360]  calculating return on investment, we would never
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:55:58.680]  do these things. We were discussing that back in
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:56:00.960]  March, what that means to human lives, to the
[03:56:00.960 --> 03:56:03.360]  economy of the world. So it must be that we
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:05.880]  take those measures. Thus, Pfizer would not
[03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:07.720]  overcharge for the mRNA vaccine it was
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:09.880]  developing with the German company BioNTech,
[03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:11.760]  Baller said. We're going to charge
[03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:13.960]  governments a very, very nominal value, he
[03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:16.080]  said. Asked directly if Pfizer intended to
[03:56:16.080 --> 03:56:18.480]  profit, Baller said we will make a very, very
[03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:20.920]  marginal profit at this stage. So were Pfizer
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:23.520]  telling the truth? Pfizer made more than $100
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:25.840]  billion in profits from the COVID vaccine in
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:30.200]  2022 alone. Those facts seem to me to be
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:33.320]  significant. Those facts seem to me worthy of
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:35.160]  discussion. And I don't think we're going to
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:37.560]  see that discussed on the mainstream media. Let
[03:56:37.560 --> 03:56:39.920]  me know in the chat if you've noticed how the
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:42.160]  mainstream media reports on certain stories,
[03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:44.800]  investigating them extremely thoroughly. And
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:47.880]  elsewhere, there is little or no debate or
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:49.600]  dissent. What do you think about that? What do
[03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:51.800]  you think is actually happening? So whether
[03:56:51.800 --> 03:56:54.040]  it's the war in Ukraine and NATO's
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:56.240]  involvement in provoking it, or Pfizer's
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:56:58.360]  relationship with the United States of
[03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:00.680]  America and their ability to co-opt
[03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:03.680]  national symbols of pride and turn them into
[03:57:03.680 --> 03:57:05.880]  corporate emblems that have only been, let's
[03:57:05.880 --> 03:57:08.520]  face it, tested on 10 mice. It seems that the
[03:57:08.520 --> 03:57:11.440]  state and the media have a pretty close
[03:57:11.480 --> 03:57:12.480]  relationship.
[03:57:12.800 --> 03:57:16.360]  You've got to have the will to accept the
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:18.360]  truth and buck the system and the group
[03:57:18.360 --> 03:57:22.960]  collective. Do that, and you'll earn your way
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:26.240]  to the next level. This is the info war.
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:50.160]  Bodies is back. The ultimate tumeric product on
[03:57:50.160 --> 03:57:52.840]  the market has returned to info war store.com
[03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:56.440]  and is now 25% off for a limited time. Utilized
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:57:58.840]  for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:01.760]  most studied medicinal herbs today. Hundreds of
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:04.200]  peer reviewed scientific articles are published
[03:58:04.240 --> 03:58:06.440]  every year on the chemistry and therapeutic
[03:58:06.440 --> 03:58:09.120]  potential of tumeric and its active components.
[03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:11.400]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the
[03:58:11.400 --> 03:58:14.880]  body, help boost and support flexibility, increase
[03:58:14.880 --> 03:58:17.920]  mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your
[03:58:17.920 --> 03:58:21.120]  immune system, and so much more. Regular tumeric
[03:58:21.120 --> 03:58:23.720]  from the store contains about one to 5% of the
[03:58:23.720 --> 03:58:26.360]  active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super
[03:58:26.360 --> 03:58:30.280]  powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of
[03:58:30.280 --> 03:58:32.520]  the active ingredients in tumeric. No other
[03:58:32.520 --> 03:58:34.960]  product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery
