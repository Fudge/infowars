[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[00:18.520 --> 00:22.920]  transmission you are the resistance.
[00:22.920 --> 00:25.800]  It's Thursday September 10th.
[00:25.800 --> 00:32.560]  The year is 2020 53 days old and look at these mainstream headlines.
[00:32.560 --> 00:37.600]  Mad Dog Madness discussed secret military coup against President Trump while serving
[00:37.600 --> 00:39.720]  in his White House.
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.800]  Plot to overthrow US government.
[00:43.800 --> 00:51.080]  Who told you about that back at the time and who fingered Madness specifically and
[00:51.080 --> 00:54.920]  McMaster and Fiona Hill?
[00:54.920 --> 00:59.760]  She was before Congress last year and she went on 60 minutes and said I don't even know
[00:59.760 --> 01:02.880]  what a globalist is.
[01:02.880 --> 01:10.960]  She headed the most powerful Soros Foundation and she was on the board of some of his other
[01:10.960 --> 01:18.040]  foundations and she's the main writer at theglobalist.com.
[01:18.040 --> 01:24.320]  That's like Batman saying his uniform isn't black.
[01:24.320 --> 01:28.280]  That's like Superman saying he doesn't have an ass on his chest but this is their level
[01:28.280 --> 01:34.280]  of gaslight like Nadler saying there's no such thing as Antifa.
[01:34.280 --> 01:40.360]  My wife was even talking to some of her family that are liberals and she's like what do you
[01:40.360 --> 01:49.680]  think of Antifa attacking and they go that doesn't exist because the news said so.
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.680]  They're saying the American flag was designed by Betsy Ross in 1776 and it's red, white,
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.680]  and blue.
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.560]  Betsy Ross was Washington and people go no it's not it's green, yellow, and black.
[02:02.560 --> 02:03.560]  You go no it's not.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.560]  They go yes it is.
[02:04.560 --> 02:06.560]  CNN says so.
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.240]  Cue the Twilight Zone music.
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.800]  So we've been aware of this coup.
[02:09.800 --> 02:12.200]  Oh let me tell you I've been aware of it.
[02:12.200 --> 02:18.840]  I have really gotten to enjoy the FBI and the CIA and all of these different state agencies
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.440]  harassing me and trying to destroy us and trying to destroy my family but you know I've
[02:23.440 --> 02:28.160]  signed on for this so I understand that these are illegitimate rogue groups and that I believe
[02:28.160 --> 02:33.360]  America will wake up and get rid of them but Woodward's book is a lot of lies and a lot
[02:33.360 --> 02:34.360]  of stuff.
[02:34.360 --> 02:35.360]  It's true.
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.360]  I know it's true.
[02:36.360 --> 02:38.360]  I know it isn't because I've studied the whole thing.
[02:38.360 --> 02:41.640]  And he's saying Mattis wanted to coup because Mattis is a good guy.
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.360]  This is selling the idea of a coup 53 days down that we told you they're going to try.
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.160]  We told you they're canvassing behind the scenes.
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.960]  So this is coming out in the open to make it look legitimate.
[02:51.960 --> 03:00.800]  So he mixes a bunch of lies in with the fact that Mattis met with Republicans and Democrats
[03:00.800 --> 03:09.680]  overseas and conspired to have a 25th Amendment coup d'etat against El Presidente.
[03:09.680 --> 03:12.840]  Well that didn't happen but they're trying again now.
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.360]  We now know and it's in his book.
[03:14.360 --> 03:21.160]  At least I know it's accurate in 2017 and then again in 2018 right before he left.
[03:21.160 --> 03:27.360]  They would go on CNN all these different CIA, FBI, globalists, Phil Mudd, Clapper, Brennan
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.440]  and they'd say oh he'll be gone by December and Blitzer, well Blitzer would say you mean
[03:34.440 --> 03:41.120]  a impeachment 25th Amendment they go no something else and Blitzer like why are you saying that
[03:41.120 --> 03:42.120]  on TV?
[03:42.120 --> 03:45.800]  They were saying it so they're stay behind networks and the government would believe
[03:45.800 --> 03:53.880]  it was legitimate and would believe they were about to take out a Russian agent.
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.040]  So the first thing I did reading where Woodward said this happened was go back and look at
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.680]  the dates and it's indeed when they were, it was about a month before the two times
[04:02.680 --> 04:07.840]  they came out and put it out in the news as a trial balloon, hey the government's going
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.080]  to kill the president, hey we're going to remove him, hey we're going to drug him and
[04:11.080 --> 04:14.320]  arrest him.
[04:14.320 --> 04:21.080]  And we knew at the time that they were trying to spike his food with some type of chemical
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.240]  that would make him have a hallucination or pass out and then by the time they got into
[04:25.240 --> 04:32.760]  the hospital Trump would never make it out of their life or in a coma.
[04:32.760 --> 04:36.400]  So that's the type of people we're dealing with.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.680]  Mattis is a wimp, Mattis can't tie his shoelaces, he couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.680]  bag, he's built up as this tough guy because he's an empty, no one piece of un-American
[04:45.680 --> 04:51.280]  garbage in a coup plot against the president with John, McCain, Obama and Hillary and all
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.960]  of them will pay.
[04:53.960 --> 05:01.360]  Mad dog, he's a little shrunken rat, he's a disgrace to America and the Marine Corps.
[05:01.360 --> 05:04.400]  You've always had a pledge for me and it's that I'll come to you with the truth at least
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.520]  as good as my human temporal truth can get because as the Bible says we all see through
[05:09.520 --> 05:15.240]  a rose-colored darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.640]  so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin, everything we do is actually a twisted
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.440]  distortion of God's will.
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.520]  So when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's
[05:25.520 --> 05:31.680]  got but I'll tell you it's all I got and when I tell you, in this country and the world
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.000]  is under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that, you can look out the
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.200]  window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news, you can see it.
[05:40.200 --> 05:44.640]  But you've got this commitment, I do recognize the truth of God and so do you, we're going
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.760]  to win this fight but it's going to be hard and I want to keep M. Full Wars in the main
[05:48.760 --> 05:52.760]  position to fight and it only happens when you support what you've been doing so again
[05:52.760 --> 05:58.000]  I thank you but go to M. FullWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word because
[05:58.000 --> 06:11.200]  that's how we're going to win and I thank you all.
[06:11.200 --> 06:22.560]  Total absolute complete vindication yet again, it is Thursday, September 10th of year 2020.
[06:22.560 --> 06:29.760]  We are 53 days out from the Deep State, Blubberlist, Chicom, Hollywood, Petafile, Devil, Warchipper,
[06:29.760 --> 06:35.280]  Bact, Axis of Evil attempting to throw the election into question when it's going to
[06:35.280 --> 06:38.680]  be a landslide, all the internal numbers, external numbers show for President Trump,
[06:38.680 --> 06:43.400]  they will then use that crisis with big tech ganged up on America with our enemies, try
[06:43.400 --> 06:50.120]  to plunge us into a hot civil war but they have failed and they have failed again and
[06:50.120 --> 06:54.960]  they will fail again if we take action and if we speak up.
[06:54.960 --> 07:00.000]  So don't panic but get very, very active and very, very aggressive like your life depends
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.480]  on it because it does and that's why you've seen all the Democrats come out and say this
[07:08.480 --> 07:12.240]  is like your life depends on it, you got to get rid of Trump because they're painted into
[07:12.240 --> 07:19.240]  a corner, they're rats that don't have a sinking ship to even escape from, they don't
[07:19.240 --> 07:25.000]  know what to do, they're going down so they want to take America down with them.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.120]  Here are the headlines at infowars.com, newswars.com but you can also just find this in the Associated
[07:30.120 --> 07:37.720]  Press or Reuters, just type in at the search engine, General Mattis plot to overthrow
[07:37.720 --> 07:44.360]  the U.S. government or General Mattis coup plot against President Trump.
[07:44.360 --> 07:50.560]  Isn't that just absolutely special?
[07:50.560 --> 07:53.280]  Let's go over this right now.
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.800]  New book reveals General Mattis discussed secret military coup against President Trump
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.480]  while serving in his winehouse and so did the members of the Justice Department with them
[08:04.480 --> 08:11.400]  as well and then they would all rule over America and put someone in weak like Joe Biden
[08:11.400 --> 08:19.320]  Kamala Harris that their plutocracy of plutocrats would control.
[08:19.320 --> 08:25.240]  It was reported that General Mattis last night discussed a likely coup with fellow government
[08:25.240 --> 08:33.520]  officials back when he was working for President Trump in the book released by Watergate related
[08:33.520 --> 08:42.200]  Bob Woodward, Mattis reportedly did the following, trending, exclusive video, another article,
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.040]  15 armed agents raid another one of the folks trying to build the wall, that's where we're
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.040]  going to get to.
[08:47.040 --> 08:51.960]  Mattis quietly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern for the
[08:51.960 --> 08:52.960]  nation.
[08:52.960 --> 09:02.920]  So this is all pitched by Bob Woodward of Oats needed, these were heroes that just had
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.560]  this on their conscience and just knew what they had to do.
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.240]  So all of Woodward's book is a lie and we'll go over that except for the fact that they
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.760]  were plotting a coup which is totally illegal and criminal but now they're lionizing it
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.480]  because they're preparing another one when Trump doesn't accept the fraudulent results
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.200]  when they try to steal the election.
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.400]  Mattis quietly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern for the
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.680]  nation's fate under Trump's command and according to Woodward told Coates, the head of National
[09:32.680 --> 09:38.440]  Intelligence that there may come a time when we have to take collective action since Trump's
[09:38.440 --> 09:47.080]  dangerous, he's unfit and more and it goes on from there.
[09:47.080 --> 09:54.960]  Think about that, we'll get more into all of this here today but it was a consortium
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.440]  of Republican and Democrat leaders, they also met secretly in Europe.
[10:00.440 --> 10:06.400]  Mattis plotted a Democratic Party to overthrow US government and it's called Deep State Dictatorship.
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.800]  That's the big article in live feed on infowars.com, there's one on the zero hedge, Woodward book
[10:10.800 --> 10:17.240]  exposes general James Mattis plot to overthrow the US government but again it's something
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.880]  that the Lord told him to do even though he doesn't even really believe in God as a Christian
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.720]  if you read his deeper writings, he's an occultist, anti-American piece of garbage.
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.320]  According to pre-released excerpt from the Washington Post, Bob Woodward writes about
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.440]  a discussion between General James Mattis known as the ultimate wimp and director of
[10:36.440 --> 10:40.720]  National Intelligence Dan Coates about a plot to overthrow the elected government of the
[10:40.720 --> 10:43.000]  United States.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.080]  Mattis quietly went to Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern, the nation's
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.200]  fate under Trump command and according to Woodward told Coates, there may come a time
[10:52.200 --> 10:56.720]  when we have to take collective action since Trump is dangerous and he's unfit.
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.320]  What do you call a conversation between the defense secretary and the head of the US intelligence
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.680]  apparatus where they are talking about collective action to remove an elected president?
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.920]  That's called sedition, a seditious conspiracy punishable by execution I should add under
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.680]  the Constitution.
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.760]  As alarming as it sounds on the face, this actually aligns with our own previous research
[11:16.760 --> 11:21.160]  into key military leadership and joint chiefs of staff and the corrupt intent to overthrow
[11:21.160 --> 11:26.040]  an elected government using COG that Nancy Pelosi is talking about on TV saying she will
[11:26.040 --> 11:27.540]  be in command now.
[11:27.540 --> 11:31.440]  She said I met with the military last week, this is five weeks ago, that queued that up
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.440]  guys.
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.760]  She said I met with the military last week and I'm going to take over, I'm second in
[11:38.760 --> 11:42.920]  command meaning get rid of the vice president and everything and we will fumigate him out
[11:42.920 --> 11:46.480]  of the White House one way or another no matter if he leaves we'll have another inauguration
[11:46.480 --> 11:47.480]  another location.
[11:47.480 --> 11:53.280]  They've got it all set up now where they won't just kill him or drug him, they'll just say
[11:53.280 --> 12:00.000]  he didn't win and then they go to Colorado or whatever and have their coronation or LA.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.640]  Not their inauguration.
[12:02.640 --> 12:06.560]  As alarming as it sounds on its face, this actually aligns with our previous research
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.200]  and ours too into key military leadership, the joint chiefs and their corrupt intent
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.760]  to overthrow the elected government.
[12:12.760 --> 12:19.200]  Please remember when we noted this very issue as Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vidman compromised
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.120]  his position yet not removed by his command structure within the Pentagon.
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.080]  That's why Trump came out last week and he said and this week he said the troops love
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.760]  me, the soldiers love me, but a lot of the brass don't because they're part of this
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.040]  military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us of that's such an American tradition.
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.640]  George Washington warned of a military getting too much power, but that's just George Washington
[12:42.640 --> 12:49.840]  and General Eisenhower, you know, they were good guys but when Trump says that he's bad
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.600]  and now we know I Trump said hey you may not see me for a while because the deep state's
[12:54.600 --> 13:00.000]  angry at me not letting us have one side of deals with China and they're trying to overthrow
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  the government right now.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  I need your help.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  We're in trouble.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's Trump firing the bat signal.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.600]  That's not oh everything's fine.
[13:08.600 --> 13:09.920]  We're totally winning.
[13:09.920 --> 13:10.920]  Don't get involved.
[13:10.920 --> 13:11.920]  Don't get informed.
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  We're not going to handle it all.
[13:12.920 --> 13:16.840]  Hillary secretly arrested 2017 none of that happened.
[13:16.840 --> 13:18.520]  This is neck and neck.
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.880]  We've got more on Durham today.
[13:21.880 --> 13:27.920]  We'll be getting into some of that.
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.040]  The Attorney General says there might be more indictments.
[13:31.040 --> 13:33.000]  I wouldn't hold your breath.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.520]  This is very serious and we'll discuss what this means because we already all knew this
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.360]  but now we know more details but it was all transparent because they were getting everybody
[13:41.360 --> 13:43.560]  ready and preparing the public.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.040]  They were PR'ing it.
[13:45.040 --> 13:46.920]  We're going to go to break.
[13:46.920 --> 13:50.520]  I'm going to come back and get into all of this, the latest COVID news, the latest lockdown
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.680]  news and how we fight back against it.
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.640]  Tomorrow's news today, if you tell other folks to tune in and tell them to tell others to
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.480]  tune in like hey be part of the Second American Revolution the truth is at infowars.com.
[14:02.480 --> 14:12.440]  That URL is at newswars.com and if you tell people about the live feeds by the local radio
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.520]  stations you're listening to that station has a stream share that link and tell others
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.960]  hey here's the forbidden link share this we're going to save the republic but you've got
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.280]  to recruit them into it then it causes the chain reaction.
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.200]  Our regular show has up to 3 million real people a day that come and listen to it.
[14:30.200 --> 14:32.760]  Those shows exaggerate their numbers, ours is about 3 million.
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.800]  When we do special shows sometimes a million tune in usually about 300,000 that evening.
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.920]  When you get excited it's millions so tonight there's going to be the special show that
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.480]  we've been doing for the election.
[14:45.480 --> 14:52.280]  Election countdown five nights a week seven tonight only six minutes of breaks every hour
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.720]  and it is great for your stations to pick it up and great for you to share with everybody
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.240]  saying hey here's real election coverage that the system doesn't want you to get.
[15:01.240 --> 15:04.600]  There is so much more we're going to be covering as well.
[15:04.600 --> 15:07.840]  Another issue I'm going to cover in the last segment of this hour.
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.200]  Another excellent zero hedge.com article what possible disruption is coming that requires
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.560]  China to start mass stockpiling of all possible commodities.
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.360]  They've already broken the worldwide supply chain to a great extent and it's already causing
[15:24.360 --> 15:27.920]  mass starvation in the third world it's already causing food prices to go up here and they

[17:15.240 --> 17:24.560]  movie and it's designed to free civilization and have a post renaissance stagnation or
[17:24.560 --> 17:30.440]  new dark age and a total consolidation of all wealth of power in the hands of the kleptocratic
[17:30.440 --> 17:36.680]  post humanist the magnitude of this is unfathomable as you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny
[17:36.680 --> 17:42.560]  are being marked carefully every i dotted every t crossed a total societal vertical integration
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.000]  takeover medical tyranny total surveillance the big tech heads on average have had their
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.400]  wealth cope up 35% in the last eight months of course jeff bezos has basically doubled
[17:51.400 --> 17:56.040]  his everyone is being forced out of their system the post human robot takeover you're
[17:56.040 --> 18:24.520]  being made obsolete you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:24.520 --> 18:34.120]  well the former head of the national security agency joined the board of amazon dot com alex
[18:34.120 --> 18:44.600]  what is the world saying of course amazon is a technological takeover of everything
[18:44.600 --> 18:48.520]  robots replacing humans driverless cars drones delivering food shutting down all of their
[18:48.520 --> 18:54.360]  businesses consolidating the economy as everybody else goes bankrupt and poor with alexa pods
[18:54.360 --> 18:59.000]  monitoring you inside your house and tracking everything you do for social credit score
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.120]  control it's all the big five tech companies competing with each other for global domination
[19:06.120 --> 19:15.120]  in the post human world and then meanwhile you've got all these snakes like mattis and
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.560]  mcmasker and the rest of them who were chosen from the military because and chosen from
[19:20.560 --> 19:28.160]  college because they were sent to globalist courses to believe that they were going to
[19:28.160 --> 19:33.360]  graduate out of the american system into the global government system that the clintons
[19:33.360 --> 19:40.120]  and others control through their foundations whether it's tony blair or bill clinton or
[19:40.120 --> 19:47.040]  hillary clinton or baracka mama they simply graduate on the multinational systems and
[19:47.040 --> 19:51.120]  the corporate governing systems that they've set up above the nation state and they are
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.200]  authoritarian they are autocratic they are dictatorial they are centralized they are
[19:56.200 --> 20:01.480]  vertically integrated they are anti-human they are disconnected they are bloodthirsty
[20:01.480 --> 20:08.360]  from their very core position and proud of it and they give you this neoliberal love
[20:08.360 --> 20:13.120]  the black people love the brown people while they run slave camps all over the world while
[20:13.120 --> 20:18.240]  the un goes in and just will murder whole giant villages of thousands in africa and
[20:18.240 --> 20:23.000]  in asia and berma and admit they did it and say well they wouldn't leave the land we're
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.160]  setting it aside for a carbon sink it's just a footnote yeah they they mowed them down
[20:30.160 --> 20:36.440]  with helicopters and tanks big deal okay the clintons oversaw the un killing 900,000 rwandans
[20:36.440 --> 20:43.320]  big deal we need the land but then oh george flooring oh the local police are bad let's
[20:43.320 --> 20:48.520]  get rid of them with a un initiative called strong cities that takes over and if you
[20:48.520 --> 20:52.680]  don't address this as a world government takeover you can't beat it but that's what it is and
[20:52.680 --> 20:58.360]  now the un dictates what medical treatments medical doctors can have and even if state
[20:58.360 --> 21:04.200]  law says a doctor can give you a hydroxychloroquine the un says no you can't and those doctors
[21:04.200 --> 21:09.720]  get in trouble but it's had people really wake up every doctor i run into every doctor
[21:09.720 --> 21:12.880]  i hear about that friends and family talk to you see doctors everywhere coming public
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.360]  and saying this is all a fraud first they said it was 25 times stronger than it was
[21:17.360 --> 21:22.000]  that then they downgraded it 10 times and then 10 times until now it's hundreds of times
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.400]  weaker than the flu unless you have a total vitamin and mineral deficiency and then any
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.880]  virus can kill you but it is manmade so bill gates can own it and control it and then what
[21:34.880 --> 21:44.760]  is it like now to sit here and watch big tech heads in congress a month ago say we don't
[21:44.760 --> 21:51.480]  allow speech if the un doesn't authorize it and under article 30 and article 31 of the
[21:51.480 --> 21:57.080]  un universal declaration of human rights they say you have the right for us to keep you
[21:57.080 --> 22:03.240]  safe by taking your rights away and the other 29 rights they say don't exist when the united
[22:03.240 --> 22:10.360]  nations decides they don't it's not fine print it's how the un universal declaration of human
[22:10.360 --> 22:18.640]  rights ends that you have no right you have no speech no right to defend yourself children
[22:18.640 --> 22:24.720]  have a right to be taken out of their homes to be protected and now in the us in every
[22:24.720 --> 22:29.000]  major blue area in canada in the leftist areas in australia and europe they're coming and
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.240]  taking the children because they wouldn't be brought in for testing they're not even
[22:33.240 --> 22:41.960]  sick but you gotta now you gotta come in for the testing and the contact tracing now there's
[22:41.960 --> 22:47.240]  article 30 nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying that any state
[22:47.240 --> 22:55.960]  group or person or any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at
[22:55.960 --> 23:01.120]  the destruction of any of the rights and freedom set forth here in and then they can argue
[23:01.120 --> 23:07.200]  that they can take your rights away you see in the name of guarding the rights and everyone
[23:07.200 --> 23:15.240]  has duties they say that's printed for me in article 30 you have duties to the un your
[23:15.240 --> 23:22.840]  slave folks might want to go read that but see boom you wake up ai surveilling you ai
[23:22.840 --> 23:26.640]  is controlling you medical doctors can't talk about what the facts are everyone's controlled
[23:26.640 --> 23:33.680]  and now they're coming to take you to a secret facility like they just announced in canada
[23:33.680 --> 23:46.400]  for taking you to a secret facility because you didn't do what they told you meanwhile
[23:46.400 --> 23:55.040]  everybody's focused in on the show cuties which I bit my lip and watch some of the boil downs
[23:55.040 --> 24:00.560]  it's absolutely sexualization of little girdles and pedophilic behavior and teaching little
[24:00.560 --> 24:07.000]  girdles to be aggressive crazy you know the equivalent of like 35 year old veteran hookers
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.040]  very dangerous behavior training them to go into dangerous places do dangerous things
[24:10.040 --> 24:13.720]  it'll get them killed and shake their ass in front of men to get off and not get in trouble
[24:13.720 --> 24:17.360]  and the guys drool looking at the 10 year old girls I mean it's really disgusting folks
[24:17.360 --> 24:21.840]  they got Netflix shows where they go I did not ever do a 10 year old boy that's a top
[24:21.840 --> 24:26.480]  I mean he's pitching and then the 10 year old boy goes in there with this man dresses
[24:26.480 --> 24:31.840]  a woman into a dungeon with a dirty mattress and they close the door I mean this is this
[24:31.840 --> 24:37.640]  it's way beyond because this is Hollywood this is Hollywood injecting its poison in
[24:37.640 --> 24:45.200]  everybody and creepy dudes I mean you know the guys they cast look like that guy that
[24:45.200 --> 24:51.160]  vice in the New York Times call the good pedophile they go oh he's a nice guy and he's got a prosthetic
[24:51.160 --> 24:59.240]  arm and you know he he's hunted and harassed I mean even the guys they got from casting
[24:59.240 --> 25:04.960]  look just like the guy that vice interviews as the as the as the good pedophile I'm not
[25:04.960 --> 25:09.680]  saying those guys are pedophiles I'm just saying if I was casting somebody is to look
[25:09.680 --> 25:14.480]  like a pedophile I would I would that that guy's central casting in fact I forget that
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.280]  guy's name just just even the New York Times had an article about it and a bunch of others
[25:19.280 --> 25:29.560]  did last week yeah that's not him there is boom bingo bingo a pedophile opens up about
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.360]  being targeted by vigilantes now that's vice HBO loves pedophilia now go back to the security
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.000]  guard in the last piece I said if I was gonna cast a pedophile that's exactly what they
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.040]  look like and they got that look in their eyes and then look at who they cast for the show
[25:43.040 --> 25:51.880]  for little girls to shake their ass look even though what they're doing wow wow man let me
[25:51.880 --> 25:55.480]  tell you what the hardcore ones that that looks like a Renfield the guy that delivers
[25:55.480 --> 26:03.520]  kids you want to see what a Dracula looks like Sasha Barak Cohen or Ryan Stelter they
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.000]  they they do the sharkfish and let me tell you that's what the kids see when they're
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.080]  not just gonna get fondled or rape no that's what that's what kids see when they're about
[26:11.080 --> 26:19.840]  to die we're talking getting chopped up and bled out good begging for mommy so anyways
[26:19.840 --> 26:25.640]  I digress sorry about that um we're gonna come back from breaking I'm gonna be a good
[26:25.640 --> 26:30.360]  boy and say the latest COVID news where they're now assaulting families where young babies
[26:30.360 --> 26:36.840]  have to be smothered by the high priest of evil it's all about jabbing needles in you
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.240]  and Bill Gates puttin something in you it's all about smothering your face and all of
[26:41.240 --> 26:46.760]  that tracking you all about creepy weirdos like general Hayden not saying he's a pedophile
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.160]  just he looks like one looks like a little Dracula a little nice for rocks it but worse
[26:52.160 --> 27:02.880]  he's the real thing you can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.200]  commands but if you were a person just 200 years ago you saw that you think it was magic
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.400]  you wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them so for that
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.920]  person it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit and it's similar to
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.960]  how ducks and butterflies of many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.400]  of miles back to the exact place where they were born they're following magnetic lines
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.400]  they have magnetic cells in their brains we now know scientific what's going on there's
[27:31.400 --> 27:36.240]  even a lot more than that so we talk about the spirit we're talking about all the dark
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.240]  matter we're talking about all the things you don't understand but we know it's there
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.480]  and just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system that's what's
[27:43.480 --> 27:49.440]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.920]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[27:53.920 --> 28:00.360]  in the space time continuum the mass is more than just a symbol of subservience being a
[28:00.360 --> 28:05.400]  blind follower not knowing facts and science it's a symbol that you have been turned into
[28:05.400 --> 28:10.280]  a subhuman and they tell you you are non-essential remember first they said no more industry
[28:10.280 --> 28:13.960]  you'll be a service economy and now they tell you service is non-essential this has been
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.480]  the post-industrial world plan the whole time and Operation Long Step and other documents
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.480]  the Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.000]  be totally poor and under their control so you can finally be starved to death of nutrients
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  and then killed with very very weak bio weapons won't affect anyone that actually gets their
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.440]  RDA of vitamins and minerals and so that's the plan for you and your family now that
[28:38.440 --> 28:42.080]  you're tuned into this broadcast you check this out for yourself you know it's true so
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.440]  let's start warning the sheep let's start educating them now I just went and swam at
[28:47.440 --> 28:51.400]  the lake and I walked around for 20 minutes educating people after I got out of the water
[28:51.400 --> 28:56.600]  it's that simple we must take action now or be slaves forever this is life and death
[28:56.600 --> 29:00.120]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening and I point out that the globalist
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.720]  are a eugenics death goal because it's true I don't say it to scare you a lot of people
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.080]  say man this show is dark well you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're
[29:09.080 --> 29:14.000]  going to defeat it and if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.800]  are saying they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public but if you just
[29:18.800 --> 29:24.960]  scratch the surface they're so arrogant they've all written to tell blueprints of this plan
[29:24.960 --> 29:30.160]  and more and more being honest about it because there comes a point where as David Ike says
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.760]  they have to stop hiding it and start selling it so we're at the point of the emergence
[29:35.760 --> 29:41.880]  now and it's coming out in the open and some people under mass Stockholm syndrome are going
[29:41.880 --> 29:47.160]  to submit to any level of tyranny but others are going to fight this isn't like some old
[29:47.160 --> 29:53.000]  dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it be okay no this thing is post human
[29:53.000 --> 30:09.480]  and extermination research what that is you're listening to the alex jones show I've got
[30:09.480 --> 30:26.240]  a tiger by the tail it's plain to see I won't be much when you get through with me we never
[30:26.240 --> 30:34.480]  give up because we don't have a choice every night you drag me with the bright lights are
[30:34.480 --> 30:45.760]  found there ain't no way of slowing it down I'm about as helpless as a leaf in the game
[30:45.760 --> 30:53.920]  and looks like I've got a tiger by the tail tiger by the tail I've got a tiger by the
[30:53.920 --> 31:03.000]  tail it's plain to see welcome back on your host Alex Jones let's get right into it everybody
[31:03.000 --> 31:10.560]  knows now that it's confirmed that Kobe is a giant fraud a giant scam a giant conjure
[31:10.560 --> 31:17.520]  to say it's a hoax is really not the proper term you can use it because they hoax the
[31:17.520 --> 31:22.520]  test 90 plus percent false positives they hoaxed most of the people that died of other
[31:22.520 --> 31:26.200]  things put them in the list they sent people that were sick in a nursing homes knowing
[31:26.200 --> 31:29.640]  that people hadn't had sunlight and that they didn't have good vitamins and minerals and
[31:29.640 --> 31:34.440]  they could actually get a kill rate so that was that was a scam that was a murder that
[31:34.440 --> 31:41.480]  was a conspiracy COVID is a organized criminal conspiracy to not let people have regular
[31:41.480 --> 31:46.280]  medical care so the insurance kept companies to keep trillions of dollars worldwide be able
[31:46.280 --> 31:50.120]  to decide who's essential and who's not have martial law and home arrest and then apps
[31:50.120 --> 31:55.680]  that track you and big tech can all on average expand their wealth over 35% in just the last
[31:55.680 --> 32:00.480]  eight months Jeff Bezos's company's doubled because you're not going to go to the store
[32:00.480 --> 32:06.640]  and put on the mask and go through all the crap and be yelled at so you call Amazon
[32:06.640 --> 32:12.560]  and it's the dying of Main Street the dying of the restaurants the dying of the shops
[32:12.560 --> 32:19.240]  you know the laundry mats and the dying of the real estate market a great reset to collapse
[32:19.240 --> 32:24.520]  markets so the globalist can buy it up a piece of the dollar and then dictate the terms of
[32:24.520 --> 32:28.600]  our surrender to the mega corporations that have all the money through fraud and through
[32:28.600 --> 32:33.800]  fractional reserve banking and at Davos they admit this and they come out and have books
[32:33.800 --> 32:39.560]  and articles this year saying this is our great reset they said it within the end of
[32:39.560 --> 32:45.320]  January when COVID wasn't even a big story here they were saying we're coming we're
[32:45.320 --> 32:48.040]  going to take over we're going to vertically integrate we're going to have the global
[32:48.040 --> 32:55.520]  reset we'll teach America to not have a big carbon footprint now there it is economic
[32:55.520 --> 33:02.760]  forum world economic forum the great reset go read for yourself and the hundreds of articles
[33:02.760 --> 33:07.080]  about oh it's good for the earth now you're poor now you know now you're made to wear
[33:07.080 --> 33:14.600]  your mask and first it's oh people under six don't have to wear a mask oh now two year
[33:14.600 --> 33:25.480]  olds need to now they're like babies need to and boy the virtue signalers love at the
[33:25.480 --> 33:30.400]  corporations to have their minions follow orders because they know rail stations and
[33:30.400 --> 33:38.520]  borders and airports are places where people tend to give up their rights where they can
[33:38.520 --> 33:42.560]  then beta test the next level of control like the border stand wide open with the TSA grow
[33:42.560 --> 33:51.480]  in your child's genitals and so now 19 month old babies which can die by the way put the
[33:51.480 --> 33:57.120]  mask on smothering them you have police officers yelling at them and when other people on the
[33:57.120 --> 34:04.720]  plane said this is wrong they just shut the whole flight down to teach you good little
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.160]  slaves meanwhile they've already laid off a lot of the pilots a lot of already retired
[34:10.160 --> 34:16.680]  this is part of their larger plan the articles on infowars.com airliner kicks off family cancels
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.800]  entire plane journey because baby 19 month old wasn't even wearing a face mask and their
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.160]  policies 24 months which is incredibly abusive video posted to Twitter shows a family being
[34:27.160 --> 34:32.840]  kicked off West jet plane because their 19 month old baby wasn't wearing a face mask and
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.720]  remember we'll play the audio in a moment how they said 10 years ago we're gonna make
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.600]  you wear bracelets that can shock you when you're on a plane Homeland Security proposed
[34:41.600 --> 34:47.280]  that under Obama people said that's crazy and then they proposed a camera in the back
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.320]  of every seat to make sure you behave well now the airlines are saying oh a lot of our
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.680]  airlines actually already had hidden cameras and we're gonna have AI watching you it's
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.480]  a program we just happen to have that if you take your mask down we'll have you banned
[35:00.480 --> 35:04.560]  from the flight and next it'll be the grocery store I mean think of the science fiction
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.160]  dystopia where now they go oh wear it when you have sex Democrat Party in Wisconsin and
[35:10.160 --> 35:17.040]  now in New York and now in California and now in Washington make you wear mask while
[35:17.040 --> 35:23.120]  you're at your home on a zoom or FaceTime because you can't ever see one not wearing
[35:23.120 --> 35:29.360]  we've got to all have the peer pressure it's called a cult and they're announcing at all
[35:29.360 --> 35:34.440]  these universities West Virginia University all of this all coming out oh it's an app
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.160]  you get to be here all the app tracks you and make sure you wear your mask and you got
[35:38.160 --> 35:41.120]  to hold the phone up every hour so you've got a mask and you got to tell them where
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.640]  you go you can't leave campus you're not allowed to and it's all a covid test they call it
[35:46.640 --> 35:49.800]  you answer some questions that tells you again by the way we'll be watching you we'll be
[35:49.800 --> 35:54.960]  listening to you we'll be tracking you it's beyond 1984 boom oh and the former head of
[35:54.960 --> 36:03.360]  the NSA now runs Amazon remember what they said that that headline six seven years ago
[36:03.360 --> 36:09.480]  your refrigerator and your toaster will be watching and listening to you remember I told
[36:09.480 --> 36:13.520]  you all this 20 something years ago oh but I'm the bad guy oh I'm the cook and now covid's
[36:13.520 --> 36:22.120]  the excuse for the whole rollout here's the report absolutely outrageous and American
[36:22.120 --> 36:29.160]  Airlines and Delta and WestJet they're all doing it let's go ahead and roll the report
[36:29.160 --> 36:40.160]  we have all seen it
[36:40.160 --> 37:06.720]  this is all about forced inoculation
[37:06.720 --> 37:26.760]  so when cops arrest people and cops shut down planes when cops beat up black people white
[37:26.760 --> 37:31.920]  people because they're not wearing a mask properly it's wonderful and good but then when a guy
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.160]  pulls a gun on cops and they shoot him the cops are bad and so the cops follow worse
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.040]  so a lot of the police will follow whatever the media says so they won't respond to a
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.080]  black thug with a gun but they'll respond to a white thug with a gun and they won't
[37:45.080 --> 37:48.800]  respond to somebody burning down a police station but they'll respond when you're not
[37:48.800 --> 37:53.400]  wearing a mask and click their heels it's all about who's in control of the police and
[37:53.400 --> 37:59.160]  this is all unconstitutional it's all very very dangerous and complying with the airlines
[37:59.160 --> 38:04.720]  doesn't get us out of this only makes it worse now I've got some really horrifying news I'm
[38:04.720 --> 38:11.760]  going to cover next segment I've been looking into what these new vaccines do that go in
[38:11.760 --> 38:19.480]  and actually reprogram the DNA the RNA vaccines that are so dangerous and I went and did over
[38:19.480 --> 38:23.920]  an hour of research this morning in medical papers on them and it does exactly what I
[38:23.920 --> 38:32.640]  thought it turns off a gene that when it turns it off it makes you sluggish low IQ and you
[38:32.640 --> 38:40.080]  don't live as long as cancer and die it's kill switch and so the Bill Gates main vaccine
[38:40.080 --> 38:47.280]  is a kill switch and I'm sitting there reading mainline literature that messing with the protein
[38:47.280 --> 38:55.720]  in a cell tends to flip its kill switch and that that's why vaccines are dangerous because
[38:55.720 --> 39:03.520]  they can mess with those proteins by having autoimmune response but these new vaccines
[39:03.520 --> 39:11.800]  go and actually turn them on and it's much worse I mean you can't make it up you can't
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.000]  make it up and people follow orders and then they'll wonder why they get fat why they're
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.880]  unhealthy why they're so stupid why a regular cold comes by and kills you and it's because
[39:21.880 --> 39:28.640]  they're going to turn your gene off and and and this is just one thing I found about it
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.960]  just doing random searches about proteins and protein tests and animals with these vaccines
[39:33.960 --> 39:38.080]  and they founded it they don't know why they just turned the gene off and then the animal
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.520]  just gets sick and dies they're going to murder all of us isn't it good we're going to take
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.640]  it too it's who we are Bill Gates is going to murder every one of us with pleasure it's
[39:47.640 --> 39:56.760]  their planet now and we rolled over and we asked for it so we're going to die it was
[39:56.760 --> 40:01.720]  a sleeper product it wasn't popular at first but as people tried it it's become one of

[41:11.240 --> 41:16.560]  tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.680]  back or those that supposedly break quarantine this of course is all based on the test that
[41:21.680 --> 41:29.600]  are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so this is a power grab the world government

[41:41.400 --> 41:47.280]  republicans is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian and they are using this
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.320]  as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them
[41:51.320 --> 42:00.440]  it's a very simple equation it's illegal we must resist it as of 54 days out the globalist
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.720]  child molesting devil worshipers know they're in trouble and they know trumps can win landslides

[44:17.200 --> 44:23.240]  live broadcasting deep in the heart of Texas with George straight bringing us in Amarillo
[44:23.240 --> 44:32.920]  by morning Amarillo by morning up from San and tone up from San and tone I think I'm
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.360]  gonna listen to a bunch of country music this weekend everything that I got all right let
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.360]  me just do this I read all this this morning I spent over an hour actually I got up at
[44:43.360 --> 44:52.920]  like 3am again okay I spent like two hours scanning over hundreds of pages and reading
[44:52.920 --> 45:00.360]  through quite a few documents and during the last four minute break I realized I hadn't
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.880]  highlighted a lot of what I wanted to hit so I've got to re scan over this during the
[45:03.880 --> 45:08.160]  next couple breaks to actually do this right but believe me you're going to want to tune
[45:08.160 --> 45:14.680]  into the start of the next hour in just a few minutes because I'm not a scientist I
[45:14.680 --> 45:22.760]  can go read what the scientists say and it's very very clear and it's very very frightening
[45:22.760 --> 45:26.920]  and I've got the big picture and you've got the big picture why in the hell would Bill
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.880]  Gates be running around saying well one of my vaccines makes 100% of people sick and some
[45:31.880 --> 45:40.360]  of them die but my weaker ones only make 80% sick and only 20% get paralyzed or have to
[45:40.360 --> 45:47.040]  go to the hospital why would they suddenly in AP go okay number one cause of polio's
[45:47.040 --> 45:52.040]  vaccines because they're getting ready to hurt people really bad and they've done the
[45:52.040 --> 46:00.040]  psychological studies at Stanford and at Yale this year that at least 35% of the public
[46:00.040 --> 46:06.600]  will take a vaccine even if it names them or kills them they're that limping hey ancient
[46:06.600 --> 46:14.720]  Germans ancient Goths ancient Brits ancient Mesoamericans every ancient culture the majority
[46:14.720 --> 46:20.360]  of people would give their children to the priest to be gutted in front of them or burned
[46:20.360 --> 46:26.720]  on an altar in what is Mexico today all the way down into central and south America by
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.560]  the collapse of the Mesoamerican society that happened right as Cortez arrived they were
[46:30.560 --> 46:36.680]  already collapsed the main source of meat was human flesh of children they had shops
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.000]  down at the bottom of the pyramids with hanging children and people came and bought the meat
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.920]  people would routinely eat their own children after they were gutted they'd go buy an arm
[46:45.920 --> 46:52.800]  or a leg that's how they can get us to not care about human life that was going on everywhere
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.480]  people were sacrificing their children you go back 6000 years ago and the Mayans would
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.520]  sacrifice a few people on a few holidays and then it got more it's always the same and
[47:04.520 --> 47:09.800]  you look at us we've killed more people than the Mesoamericans ever did with abortion this
[47:09.800 --> 47:15.800]  is the religion of the Satanist who did they worship down in South America Central America
[47:15.800 --> 47:21.080]  and Southern North America the wings serpent who did the Egyptians worship and they did
[47:21.080 --> 47:31.480]  the human sacrifice to wing serpent this is a global cult ladies and gentlemen and we
[47:31.480 --> 47:38.200]  ain't in it now I've got a special report here that we put together some levity a little
[47:38.200 --> 47:45.000]  bit of fun we'll air this and then we'll come back on the other side and we will get to
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.400]  this hardcore news of now we know at least in some of the studies I'm sure it is much
[47:49.400 --> 47:55.280]  worse stuff but of course the Bill Gates vaccines are linked to turning off a chromosome in the
[47:55.280 --> 48:03.800]  cells that is a it is a life switch it throws a kill switch just can't make this up of course
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.640]  it's a kill switch oh he wants us to die me really want you to take this he says to make
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.880]  you really sick you're gonna need a lot of these shots then they're gonna manage covering
[48:13.880 --> 48:17.960]  all that up it's all a big sick laboratory test but listen with what's happening in the
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.800]  supply chain breakdown and all the craziness and China hoarding food and Europe and governments
[48:22.800 --> 48:26.080]  and elites digging into bunkers you need to get your storeable food one to two weeks
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.080]  for delivery now before the big rush comes when they contest the election all the fireworks
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.000]  that are coming this is a check box you check off and it funds the info or a 360 when get
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.120]  your storeable foods before the next big rush comes at info or store dot com or triple
[48:40.120 --> 48:48.080]  eight two five three three one three nine and the supplements and then other big sales and
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.520]  the new Biden for a limited edition Biden for nursing home shirt but here's this satirical
[48:53.520 --> 48:59.440]  report but but this really happened but our response is satire here it is I always own
[48:59.440 --> 49:05.680]  up to stuff when we make a mistake but what we got caught doing here at info wars was
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.480]  downright criminal so I'm just gonna lay it out with the chips fall where they may we're
[49:10.480 --> 49:17.160]  gonna have to let Rob do go so it's we just got noticed from YouTube parent company Google
[49:17.160 --> 49:27.440]  parent company of course alphabet that he stole someone's identity and we're not gonna
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.960]  stand for that type of activity so it's with heavy heart that we're gonna show you what
[49:30.960 --> 49:46.240]  was done and I'm gonna summarily throw Rob do out of the building viewers and listeners
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.600]  of info wars have always got a commitment from me that when we do something wrong we'll
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.080]  own up to it and it's with heavy heart that I've got to go ahead and admit this to all
[49:56.080 --> 50:02.000]  you and I apologize for myself the whole crew but we're gonna have to let Rob do go we just
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.440]  got noticed today from YouTube parent company Google and alphabet that he stole someone's
[50:07.440 --> 50:17.680]  identity and that's really a crime now we've got the notice from them and let me just show
[50:17.680 --> 50:24.600]  it Rob do did in the interest of total transparency he admits he's wrong in fact he's right here
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.200]  with us right now I'm gonna show you what he did and the notice from YouTube here it
[50:28.200 --> 50:36.200]  is Rob come on man about this well so we put out a video about about two weeks ago called
[50:36.200 --> 50:41.200]  scooby-doo solves the mystery of the pandemic and you can even watch it here's to you kids
[50:41.200 --> 50:47.240]  we now know the video is a hoax they included flu pneumonia and other infections to boost
[50:47.240 --> 50:52.000]  the numbers let's find out who is really behind it all like President Trump is definitely behind
[50:52.000 --> 51:02.040]  one of these phantoms she's pink dr. Fauci like I thought doctors were supposed to help
[51:02.040 --> 51:09.920]  people not scare them Microsoft's Bill Gates not only a computer guy he's a notorious vaccine
[51:09.920 --> 51:15.560]  pusher who wants to reduce the world's population I get it so Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate
[51:15.560 --> 51:20.320]  everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak that's diabolical
[51:20.320 --> 51:25.200]  yeah that sounds pretty bad don't worry kids these globalists won't get away with their
[51:25.200 --> 51:30.200]  pandemic hoax this time where they're going they'll be locked up for a long good while
[51:30.200 --> 51:40.960]  in the big house yeah shut your mouth stop making excuses we're gonna read the notice
[51:40.960 --> 51:45.880]  of what you did in a moment he stole the identity of not just scooby-doo not just the scooby
[51:45.880 --> 51:53.560]  friends but also defamed Bill Gates gg ping and other great humanitarians okay so let's
[51:53.560 --> 51:58.360]  go ahead read the notice from them about how you stole the identity go ahead impersonation
[51:58.360 --> 52:03.320]  upon review we've determined your content violates our guidelines and we've removed it from YouTube

[52:24.280 --> 52:29.560]  if this video is guilty of impersonation as you claim then the entire bad lip reading
[52:29.560 --> 52:37.040]  channel which is a channel made up entirely of movie clips and NFL clips of people impersonating
[52:37.040 --> 52:41.280]  those people okay the entire channel is the White House Correspondents Center then now
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.840]  Alec Baldwin can't impersonate Trump but just finish up criminal should be removed as well
[52:46.840 --> 52:51.960]  this is a meme and satire channel and I am not guilty of anything except a quality shaggy
[52:51.960 --> 52:56.520]  voice I didn't really like my skew voice but I'll do job the shaggy voice I'll take these
[52:56.520 --> 53:02.240]  part but but we know that this is not about impersonation this video places your false
[53:02.240 --> 53:09.560]  idols Fauci and Gates in a bad light and disparages the real master of YouTube gg ping now do
[53:09.560 --> 53:18.320]  your scooby imitation for us oh that's about it like it's okay to make fun of gg ping in
[53:18.320 --> 53:24.080]  America since when did we wake up we don't have any free speech sorry hey let's stop
[53:24.080 --> 53:28.680]  right there I would say go to band on video or 20 election center dot com but we've had
[53:28.680 --> 53:34.440]  the D-DOS attacks and the hack attacks on info wars info or store dot com and and now
[53:34.440 --> 53:38.320]  they have successfully shut down band on video right now and it's all out of China it's all
[53:38.320 --> 53:41.880]  out of China they don't even hide it's right out of the government servers over in China
[53:41.880 --> 53:45.760]  and it takes huge amounts of money to you know keep these up in the face of this that's
[53:45.760 --> 53:50.400]  why it's a daily fight we're pretty cheerful about it here but we're just pro America we're
[53:50.400 --> 53:55.560]  pro freedom we're pro unborn we love God we love this country and we love you and so please
[53:55.560 --> 53:59.760]  tell folks about every AM and FM station you listen to know they're precious you know for
[53:59.760 --> 54:04.720]  us to get out their local streams are great to share and know that every day you share
[54:04.720 --> 54:10.200]  the links to band on video 22 election center dot com info wars dot com and all those that
[54:10.200 --> 54:14.160]  it really is winning the war we're gonna win this fight the chai comms the globalist almost
[54:14.160 --> 54:18.880]  defeated America but the coup d'etat plan against Trump using criminals in the military
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.600]  working with the globalist came out and every day this comes out they're in more trouble
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.640]  but they're now announcing that they do intend to have the coup they're trying to normalize
[54:26.640 --> 54:31.880]  the coup right now and they want us off air when they can text the election try to overthrow
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.920]  the president but we're fighting hard to stay on air so it takes a lot of money to do this
[54:35.920 --> 54:40.040]  so there's an info store dot com but you still can't seriously folks we need your support
[54:40.040 --> 54:50.640]  now you are the paul reverbs there is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.960]  the universe and its free will that's why the social engineers the robber barons the
[54:55.960 --> 55:03.880]  globalist the post humanist the anti humans openly tell you what they're doing and openly
[55:03.880 --> 55:07.640]  tell you that you're worthless to crap and you need to die because that will save the
[55:07.640 --> 55:12.560]  earth and they do everything they can to make the most dystopian ugly future they can in
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.320]  the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications they are making you
[55:17.320 --> 55:21.240]  hate yourself they are making you be depressed they are making you not have a connection
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.280]  to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future and
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.920]  that's what all this is about you know they say they're setting up world government to
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.880]  protect us all from our super technologies while they're the ones running around like
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.920]  mad scientist endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies the globalist
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.880]  are what is disruptive to human species they call us disruptive to their power grab it's
[55:43.880 --> 55:50.600]  time to say no it sounds over the top when I go on air and I explain that the controllers
[55:50.600 --> 55:56.040]  of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population except for a
[55:56.040 --> 56:01.320]  few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods but that's really what they're
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.600]  now externalizing they're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers thirty
[56:05.600 --> 56:11.320]  years ago and actually openly announcing it everywhere they're going from beta to operation
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.760]  and think about all these major corporations they tell you humans are horrible they tell
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.800]  you humans are a parasite they tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of and then
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.080]  they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in covid to
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.720]  kill them that's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything
[56:27.720 --> 56:33.640]  is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.200]  to roll out look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics they're
[56:38.200 --> 56:44.000]  absolutely essential to stop viral infections like covid-19 this is all absolute information
[56:44.000 --> 56:54.920]  control this is beyond my tape for you're listening to the alex jones show because i did this
[56:54.920 --> 57:02.720]  last time in 84 everybody including the nra thought background checks made sense remember
[57:02.720 --> 57:08.720]  that remember those good old days they didn't make sense keep guns out of the hands of those
[57:08.720 --> 57:14.880]  folks i am very optimistic about about iraq i think it's going to be one of the great
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.440]  achievements of this administration are you aware that you're misquoting donald trump
[57:18.440 --> 57:22.960]  in charlotte's bill he never called neo nazis very fine people he called all those folks
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.640]  who walked out of that they were neo nazis shouting hate the veins but he said specifically
[57:28.640 --> 57:34.000]  that he was condemning them he said he said he walked out and he said let's get this straight
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.200]  he said there are very fine people in both groups they're chanting anti-semitic slogans
[57:39.200 --> 57:46.360]  carrying flies i've condemned neo nazis i've condemned many different groups but not all
[57:46.360 --> 57:52.240]  of those people were neo nazis believe me not all of those people were white supremacists
[57:52.240 --> 57:59.400]  by any stretch people that were very fine people on both sides you had people in that
[57:59.400 --> 58:05.800]  group excuse me excuse me i saw the same pictures as you did you had people in that group that
[58:05.800 --> 58:11.560]  were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the
[58:11.560 --> 58:17.360]  renaming of a park from robert e lee to another name so you know what it's fine you're changing
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.440]  history you're changing culture and you had people and i'm not talking about the neo nazis
[58:22.440 --> 58:27.240]  and the white nationalist because they should be condemned totally but you had many people
[58:27.240 --> 58:33.480]  in that group other than neo nazis and white nationalists okay and the press has treated
[58:33.480 --> 58:39.720]  them absolutely unfairly this senator made a very moving and elegant speech as a son
[58:39.720 --> 58:46.960]  of the confederacy acknowledging that it was time to change and yield to a position that
[58:46.960 --> 58:56.800]  senator carol mosley brawn raised on the floor of the senate not granting a federal charter
[58:56.800 --> 59:10.280]  to a organization made up of many fine people who continue to display the confederate flag
[59:10.280 --> 59:14.840]  as a symbol look for steps to say it's true i mean if biden says it's got to be true i
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.000]  mean 2.5 million americans died of coven i mean well he said and a lot of people you
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.040]  have unnecessarily now we have over 120 million dead from coven joe biden rewrites history
[59:26.040 --> 59:31.960]  tells wisconsin audience a black guy invented the light bulb i love it we got it for example
[59:31.960 --> 59:39.920]  why in god's name don't we teach history in history classes a black man invented the light
[59:39.920 --> 59:51.680]  bulb not a white guy named edison okay lewis howard latimer born september 4th 1848 was
[59:51.680 --> 1:00:00.760]  an african-american inventor and patent draftsman for the light bulb and telephone in 1881 latimer
[1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:07.400]  along with joseph nickles invented a light bulb with a carbon filament an improvement
[1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:13.120]  on thomas edison's original paper filament which would burn out quickly and he sold the
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:23.040]  patent to the united states electric company in 1881 i mean the cultural appropriation
[1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:29.880]  that's going on in europe and in the bbc where all the shows now show ancient britains and
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:34.640]  like half of them are black there weren't any black people in britain 2000 years ago
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:41.960]  and 2000 years ago it was a roman colony and the people were slaves and they lived in stone
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:47.400]  houses and huts i mean it's just it's just like the africans were i mean it's just total
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:52.320]  absolute crap ladies and gentlemen and it's not taken something away from black people
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:59.240]  the middle illness of the left making movies where you'll see ancient roam and a third
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:03.520]  of the people are black there were some black people there maybe one out of a thousand but
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:09.840]  the romans took white slaves so they didn't have black slaves from the african slave trade
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:15.720]  the arabs liked black slaves the romans wanted white slaves whatever reason that's why they
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:20.120]  were in albion that's why they were in gall that's why they were in germania that's why
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:26.440]  they were in the kingdoms of the visigoths and the osvigoths but again that's history
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:32.160]  it's all being rewritten mindlessly because you can't have any european history you can't
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:40.160]  have any of that no no no no
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:42.920]  we're getting a lot of phone calls people are noticing that most of the video and audio
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:47.800]  streams are down we are on satellite on radio and tv stations but we're under massive sustained
[1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:51.960]  attack out of common as china i told you this is going on for weeks i told you it gets more
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:58.000]  intense each day so here we are i know i say it all the time but i mean it from the bottom
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.440]  of my heart i want to thank you the listeners viewers this broadcast and all the stations
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:07.560]  and all the affiliates and sponsors and my family and the crew and just everybody out
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:12.920]  there you know the listeners and viewers as i just said this is such an epic struggle
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:16.440]  and we've all been proven dead on we've been proven we're right because we're being led
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  by god we have a spirit and we're very humble about that this this is not us this is god
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:25.720]  working through us but man now it's so precious to stay on air i used to think you know maybe
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.680]  i'll wake a bunch of people up and i can kind of recede into the background because fighting
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:35.040]  this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but now with the evil so out in the open
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:38.480]  and everything we've said being vindicated i never questioned what i was saying because
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.800]  i knew it was true but i i did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.480]  well now we know they're going to carry it out and then some so we got a fight and i
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:50.280]  just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise god past the ammunition
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:03:14.040]  of the info war again take action folks this is it
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:20.920]  ladies and gentlemen a major coup plot hatched by republican and democrats in the deep state
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:26.600]  led by general mattis has come out in mainstream news it's in bob woodward's book but bob woodward
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:30.920]  says he's a hero and a good guy for it so it's about the only thing that's true in the
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:40.120]  book the rest of it is a bunch of garbage and i have all the evidence right here so we're
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:45.240]  going to be laying all of that out more here today now they're planning another military
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.880]  coup but they can't get the general military to be part of it but trump warned just this
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:54.560]  last weekend he said a lot of the generals don't like me because they've you know sold
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:58.920]  the country out but the troops love me the soldiers love me in fact let's get that queued
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:07.120]  up so remember trump was saying that and he said a month ago i've ended one sided trade
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:13.600]  deals with china were middlemen by 90 percent of our drugs that are overpriced and rip us
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.920]  off so this should bring down our cost upwards of half because it's all middlemen that set
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:22.720]  up the deals and who are the middlemen the globalist why don't we pay the most for drugs
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:27.920]  in the world because most of our drugs are made overseas most of those are made in china
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:31.960]  and it's a rip off and trumps like you're not ripping us off you're not ripping us off
[1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:35.280]  you're not ripping us off you're not ripping us off so he said they're going to try to
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:44.080]  take me out and i said then i said that is the bat signal now i'm just going to say this
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:49.400]  here and then i'll get into this other big news next segment the globalist have tried
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:55.120]  to go around harass all of our am and fm affiliates and tv stations and it hasn't worked in fact
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:58.160]  a lot of the stations we were on at night they said oh you're threatening us i don't have
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:03.080]  all the shrooms on we'll just put them on prime time and so that's not worked on them
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:07.160]  and so when they platformed us everywhere they thought that would shut us down it hurt
[1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:13.960]  us but we were able thanks to listen spread the word to circumvent that and so we're on
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:18.120]  over 200 radio stations and over 100 cable and tv stations around the country and i really
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:24.960]  should promote that more for the point of now we get daily hack attacks in daily d-dos
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.320]  denial service attacks and zombie attacks where they hijack people's computers and attack
[1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:32.920]  us i mean it's it's ongoing we have a couple companies that help us it costs a lot of money
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:40.280]  and some of these attacks have been as big as anybody's ever seen i mean these are big
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:45.720]  attacks but now they're like five types of attacks against info wars and three attacks
[1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:48.920]  against the store and you know two or three different types of attacks against bandah
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:54.760]  video probing so the chai comms working for the democrats and the democrats have said
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:06:00.600]  want them to win the chai comms openly are election meddling so they can shut us down
[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:06.600]  on election day when facebook and google and apple and twitter have announced they're not
[1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:10.680]  going to let the republicans or trump say that they won the election even the numbers
[1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:14.760]  show they have and they're going to contest it and plug us in a civil war so they can't
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:26.400]  have info wars on the air when this happens in 53 days and so this is a test on turning
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:32.640]  us off and brian stelter's got drones above the building on a routine basis i told you
[1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:37.760]  that a few years ago it's on hbo special stelter outside stalking us they've got pi's they've
[1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:43.800]  got stalking teams they've got payoff teams they've tried to use facebook to canvas any
[1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:48.520]  women that they think i ever knew and offer money to say i raped them these women call
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:52.280]  up and say i've never even met you but the cnn's calling saying you rape me they'll give
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:59.640]  me money i mean that's just what they're doing to me this is organized criminal operations
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:06.520]  by the new york times by cnn that are terrorist organizations that run antifa and and and
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:12.840]  they are criminally empowered they have criminal energy and the harassment of my family the
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:19.280]  stalking the the lawsuits all of it i expected but when i get up here and i tell you that
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:23.800]  the attacks ramped up 10 times whatever was and i don't know how long we can hold on that's
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:28.560]  not hyperbole that's actually what's going on but i understand it's because we're in
[1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:32.880]  a war for the very future of this country we're all trained to think of ourselves individually
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:38.240]  and i am an individualist but i'm under attack people like how do you take it being the platform
[1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:43.800]  i said you're next now you are now they censor the president and they've been incrementally
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:47.840]  turning up the heat so we should probably play this video that harissa smith put together
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:53.240]  that's titled why they've been a dollar show it's just three minutes long we'll air in
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:57.080]  the last three minutes of this segment they tell me how long it is i think it's three
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:02.600]  minutes and i said this two years ago and it's even more true today that's why just
[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:07.760]  for the radio and tv end and us to get back up for you to get it when you can we need
[1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:11.400]  capital in here because there's some of the other strategic attacks they've got going
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:15.880]  on i need to be able to plan and know how much energy and that's what money is a symbol
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:19.560]  of energy i've got in this fight so thank you all for the support since i fired the bat
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:25.320]  signal last thursday a lot of supports come in um it was even greater it'd be better but
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:30.160]  it's helped us make some decisions and we're just going to go 110 percent into this but
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:37.000]  just know the war is now this is not a game now listen to me china is hoarding food medicine

[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:00.840]  deep in the heart of texas us resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:05.120]  by communist china ally with the big mega banks that set up communist china in nineteen forty
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:10.200]  nine the communist chinese have taken control of us telecommunications infrastructure the
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:13.520]  communist chinese have taken control of hollywood the communist chinese have taken control of
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:18.200]  the main universities this is all confirmed this is not a drill big tech and silicon valley
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:21.880]  is almost completely run by the communist chinese government they've officially become
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:28.080]  state run apple 100 google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:33.320]  worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized version
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:37.680]  of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other probes before that
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.680]  were meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt to censorship by just
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:48.160]  putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:54.000]  of all previous attacks this is a tie traded dose reverse psychological warfare operation
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:00.360]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's terms they are manipulating
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:05.120]  the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with the low dosages
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:10.760]  of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:17.120]  poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.720]  internet of things integration global social score complete command and control system it
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:27.360]  is the virtual reality ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.840]  the major security agencies blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:36.720]  stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai con slash big tech making combine emergency
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.880]  situation i have been chosen for destruction because i brought you this information and
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:45.640]  have been battering ramming it out as much as i can they want to double use me as they
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:51.840]  always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.800]  turned against us so they take what i've said being sincere build me into an insincere person
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:01.200]  in the straw man i'm person that cares about life and children and is against these wars
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:05.840]  and so they make me a herder of children and they build me into this line to then set the
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:11.200]  distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about alex jones
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:16.480]  so human if i didn't sell out to them they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:22.000]  by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.120]  fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this key will break you
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.920]  free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:42.800]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:51.600]  the mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:13:00.640]  ignorance does not equal bliss ignorance equals slavery if you're ignorant walking through a
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.840]  field at night that there's a six foot hole up ahead you're gonna step in it and probably break
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:12.240]  your ankle or maybe worse well it's the same thing happening to human civilization the industrialized
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:17.280]  age really empowered humanity in many respects but also took us away from the land made us very
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:22.000]  very domesticated and very very easy to manipulate and now corruption and predatory activity
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.520]  can hide behind that complexity now i know what's going on behind the complexity because i go read
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:31.840]  what the u.n and the rockefeller foundation the davos group and the builder group and
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:39.280]  all their subsidiaries what the club of roames say so i know exactly what's going on not because
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:44.560]  i'm even that cool or special a person but i'm actually want to be empowered and informed
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:48.880]  because i'm a history buff i know that those that don't know history don't repeat it the globalists
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:53.760]  think you're stupid they laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions well mark
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with bloomberg to launch
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:05.280]  this operation red mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that trump has won
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:10.480]  on election night now he's come out the statement and told all the media in the united states that
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:15.760]  they better get behind saying that trump basically lost that they're not going to let trump declare
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:20.720]  victory even though it's overwhelming they'll have 95 percent of the vote done on election night and
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:25.120]  even if you added all the other votes in against it he'd be the winner they are going to steal this
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:30.560]  election they're preparing everyone you've seen all the scams they've already run trump is surrounded
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:37.200]  by tyrants but he has we the people and he has true media not independent media the real media
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:41.360]  so now more than ever it's critical to share the live streams the videos the articles and the
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:46.640]  information info wars.com because the globalists fear it most because we were the first to expose
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:51.680]  their plan to contest the election and drag it out to keep the american people from re-electing
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:15:18.960]  president trump. You're listening to the alex jones show all right welcome back ladies and
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:23.440]  gentlemen i'm going to hit the huge vaccine news the biggest yet next segment but we're under attack
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:29.760]  info wars is under giant attack from communist china info or store.com is under attack
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.160]  and i was talking to my it people this morning like 7am and i said i'm surprised they haven't
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:42.560]  hit band.video yet well 11am central when the show started they hit band.video because all
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.680]  these are on different hubs different servers different systems so that we have lots of lots
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:51.920]  of ships out there in the fight i've learned that a long time ago whenever all your eggs in one
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:58.800]  basket and we've got news wars.com and paul watson has summit.news that's his site and the enemy knows
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:01.840]  these are all targets and you know we're just going to launch five more sites because of this
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:09.520]  attack that's our rule cut one head off hydra hydra grows more cut the starfish up we grow more
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:14.080]  we grow and we're going to do more too don't you worry and we have a lot of stuff the enemy doesn't
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:21.760]  even know is ours and not owned by me but created by us created by the listeners and viewers and
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:29.360]  their support because i am in this fight to win not to lose and i'll just be honest i love it when
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.920]  the official communist party of china says i'm an enemy i love it when the globalist pedophile
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:39.120]  say i'm an enemy and i love it when they attack us because i don't like pain i'm not a sadomasochist
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:45.520]  but i do like being over the target and dishing out their destruction and so i'm very very excited
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:49.520]  about this so let me tell you you can't get the feeds right now at bandot video but if you go to
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:57.520]  info wars.com or you go to news wars.com with this article breaking general madis plotted with
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:02.560]  democratic party to overthrow us government installed deep state dictatorship that's even in
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:07.120]  the washington post but they're saying it's a good thing so they're now mainlining a coup
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:13.680]  off of the last plan coup they had that has our backup feeds and we've got other backup feeds
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:18.640]  where we'll sure they'll attack those we've got some other backup feeds from other servers and
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:25.280]  other systems so right now we've got a backup feed in there of audio and video so you can say hey
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:31.360]  this site is under attack info wars is under attack for what they're saying exposing the coup
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:37.600]  plan against trump this site's under hack attack for exposing the coup plot by the communist chinese
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:41.920]  against trump that's what you tell them that's where it is and my crew is great but there is
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:47.360]  a problem being in the trenches this long we've been getting massive attacks that have been
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:51.600]  escalating the last few weeks and i walked around and met with it and i said we ought to write some
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:56.720]  articles were under attack so folks know they go let's not make a big deal about it and now that
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:01.200]  most the sites are down i'm walking around and people are working they're writing articles are
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:08.720]  doing research is again because they've been around this so long that when the hubbington post
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:15.280]  and this this this group funded by soros that's going to contest the election comes out and says
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:20.160]  the main threats info wars because they'll say we're stealing the election they'll challenge us
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:25.120]  and they'll expose that a bunch of the electors for joe biden are connected to pedophilia that's
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:31.520]  what they war gamed two days ago and they said we want jones off air in official articles in buzz
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:38.640]  i mean there it is right there the daily beast the left secretly preps for make america great
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:41.920]  against violence after election day and then you read the article printed again for me
[1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:48.240]  they say the main threat is info wars what do you think they're doing i'm not up here saying
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:53.040]  that they think i'm the main threat because it's fun and i want to be the big guy and i want everybody
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:19:01.760]  to go oh you're so smart alex i am tickled pink the tucker kerlsson gets it the gateway pundit gets
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:08.640]  it that sean hannity gets it the rush limbaugh sounds just like me they don't sound just like me
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:15.600]  because i just made this up i'm dialed into what's going on and yeah it sounds radical to get up on
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:22.080]  the air and say general madis with mcmaster like let's get roger stowe on immediately we had
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:30.400]  dr c pechenek already wanted he usually can't get pechenek on whatever the stuff's going on he
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:34.320]  called us on it on it's like sooner they go oh pechenek will call today and yeah pechenek
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:38.640]  wants on today and he used to run overthrow governments i mean he's was high level one of
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:42.480]  the founders of delta force you name it i mean he's been the real deal not the fake spies and all
[1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:49.360]  that fake crap he's been the real deal but what we're getting at here is this is an existential
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:55.280]  threat to the country and everybody right now and so i just said to the producer of the show i said
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:20:01.200]  hey call pechenek and ask him on his twitter to put out that m4 is under massive hack attack
[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:05.760]  for exposing coup plots against trump and then i'm going on live right now with him you know
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:10.640]  from pechenek's voice and you know i walked around i heard that little tape earlier and i walked
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:14.880]  around i said hey you know you know we're under chinese government attack you can go talk to the
[1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:20.400]  server guys they can they've got all the logs we might want to make it a big deal that the democrats
[1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:24.560]  say we're the main threat should be taken off air because we're blocking their attempt to challenge
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:29.680]  the electors and steal the election and cause a civil war and again they're like jones knows our
[1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:34.720]  plan we've got to stop him the main enemy the main enemy cares about us the main enemy knows
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:39.120]  we're dangerous the main enemy knows we know what we do but we're so close to it everybody's like
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:45.040]  yeah there could be fire bombs there could be a thousand pound bombs dropping in this building
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:51.360]  and i i love my crew they are so used to being in the middle of this that they don't even care
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:55.920]  it's like kernel whatever his name is in the apocalypse now that's actually based on real
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:02.080]  people it's a composite what's the name of the kernel in apocalypse now and everybody's just
[1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:06.160]  shooting at him explosions are going on around him and he doesn't even care because he's done it so
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:11.920]  long kernel kill gore thinks the name of war for memory and that's based on the real head of the
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:18.640]  air cab and a famous kernel that did all that stuff but this is what we're dealing with here
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:25.040]  and our listeners have gotten used to it oh 50 dnc lawsuits oh all the attacks oh all the dirty
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:31.120]  treacherous jones he can just handle it i want you to understand that we are a canary in the coal
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:37.200]  mine that we are a bellwether that that we are a weather vane and normally you know the weather
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:41.440]  vein is up there on top the roof of the church or the building and it maybe it's a chicken or a
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:46.560]  rooster or a whale or a fish or a you know a bull but when the wind blows it lets you know which way
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:54.000]  it's blowing the weather veins bent down the wind is so strong it's never been like that so i'm just
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.960]  trying to tell everybody hey i'm sitting here at the helm of this and i can tell you we got fire
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:06.400]  coming out the sides here and i'm just trying to even get because i figured it out if i can't
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:13.680]  even get my crew excited about this then i can't get anybody excited about it but see that's a
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:20.160]  microcosm of all of us with mass stockum syndrome myself included we become accustomed to abuse
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:25.280]  accustomed to pain and instead of getting mad about it and overcoming it we just learned to deal with
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:31.280]  it i don't mind the pain well i don't mind the pain but i don't want to be under the pain if it
[1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:38.000]  means my legs are being eaten off by a bunch of demonic globalist gremlins and so they don't want
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  us on air ladies and gentlemen because we've got the enemy's number we've got the data we've got the
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:50.560]  Death Star codes we've got the blueprints we got it all and i'm happy for the crew we're great hard
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:54.160]  working folks i love them to be oblivious in the middle of this that's good they're the best crew
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:23:00.080]  we've ever had but you've also got to then not adapt to not making it a big deal when like oh
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:03.840]  jones just got his head blown off in the parking lot well that's no big deal we expected that
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:09.760]  because we're so used to all their previous attacks that when the big one hits this is a tactic
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:15.440]  we don't respond because we're so used to being punched in the nose and pedophiles on tv saying
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:20.880]  we're gonna screw your son on netflix for real we got your 10 year old we're gonna have sex with
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:27.200]  him right now we're gonna kill babies we're gonna devil worship pedophilia's good it's all
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:31.440]  throwing it in your face to make you give up don't give up and i know you're not even giving up
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:37.520]  where you you accept it but you give up where you just tune out no don't tune out grab the electrical
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:45.680]  cords and because now is the time to fully face it and get into it and not to tune out any of it
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:58.160]  you must take it all on now

[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:06.480]  rose-colored darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive so that
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:11.120]  everything we do is actually a fallen sin everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of

[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.000]  you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it and if we just listen to the surface of what
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.760]  the nwo propagandists are saying they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public but
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:19.520]  if you just scratch the surface they're so arrogant they've all written to tell blueprints of this
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:25.520]  plan and more and more being honest about it because there comes a point where as david ike says
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:31.520]  they have to stop hiding it and start selling it so we're at the point of the emergence now
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:37.760]  and it's coming out in the open and some people under mass dot com syndrome are going to submit
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:43.200]  to any level of tyranny but others are going to fight this isn't like some old dictatorship
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:49.760]  that you could submit to it and join it be okay no this thing is post human and extermination

[1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:27.040]  i am not a sadomasochist i'm not a masochist i don't like to deal with pain i like to deal
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:33.680]  with pleasure but i like to get tyrants off my back and i do think a little bit of satisfaction
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:43.520]  when they're broken but he's my feet and we've got big it companies we've got cloud flare we've
[1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:50.400]  got the biggest companies out there and we have been hit the last few weeks accelerating up by some
[1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:55.200]  of the largest private attacks ever and it's all out of communist china and i'll just tell you
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:31:05.840]  that i'm proud of that i'm proud that the daily beast and that cnn and on top of that
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:10.880]  the hovegan post came out and said that this group funded by soros that's going to coordinate all
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:18.000]  the uprisings and the quote transition to biden getting into office that that that group's main
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.240]  fear is that alex jones and m4's that means roger stone part of that is going to expose
[1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:30.160]  soros and pedophile rings and corruption like let's put those articles up if we can't we have an
[1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:35.600]  m4's article about it we also have the the daily beast and others why do they share us because
[1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:40.560]  they know we've got their number now i already wanted to get roger stone on the day about this
[1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:45.360]  when i saw it last night and he's suddenly able to come on i really appreciate him talk about a
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:54.880]  almost political prisoner but secretly you know uh investigated lied about financially bankrupted
[1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:58.640]  and i'm in the same position he knows the inside baseball we're not at liberty to get into at this
[1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:02.480]  point but there is a massive harassment campaign against everybody that they see on the inner
[1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:08.000]  orbit of trump everyone they see is loyal and here is roger stone who first exposed
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:15.280]  mcmaster and phiona hill and then general mattis saying that mattis and others may have been part of
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:20.000]  the coup plot now it's in woodward's book i know most of woodward's book is bull will walk that
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:25.360]  through and unpack that with roger stone but the way he funds over the attempted coup plan which we
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:28.800]  know was going on because right at the time this was happening they were on the news saying there
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:34.240]  may be a coup getting us ready and roger stone and i i'll just tell you we're loyal americans to
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:39.040]  ourselves to our families to the president which i don't see as a heroic effort people call roger
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:43.920]  a hero they call me a hero the reason i i'd say that is i don't want to be seen as a hero it's
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:51.040]  normal you know it turns out the fbi under the control of the deep state reached out to over
[1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:56.080]  two thousand people it's in the senate report and others and they couldn't get one america to
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:01.120]  take russian money they tried to get me to take russian money oh yeah it's been reported to the fbi
[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:06.560]  they sent fake informant informants at roger everybody he knew they couldn't get one american
[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:12.080]  to take this russian money it wasn't russian money and this is before this was even a story
[1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:16.560]  this was in the campaign they couldn't get they had to set up carter page and cia operatives
[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:20.880]  they had a job to spy on russians and say oh look he met with russians because it was his job
[1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:27.680]  and then no he was innocent no general flings of patriot and a hero and roger stone is a hero
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:32.480]  and he's gone through and the way he's been stalwart about it but it really is just our duty
[1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:37.760]  but roger i had to get you on just because 50-something days out and the attacks on us have never
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:42.640]  been anywhere near this and it's a bellwether for the contested election and the main soros group
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:47.680]  says that they see us as the main enemy roger stone what do you make of the coup plot against america
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:53.120]  i mean even zero hedge gets it right madis wanted to overthrow the u.s government i mean that's what
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:34:02.160]  this is i know we were working on roger's audio earlier roger can you hear me
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:11.360]  let's just go with fun let's go with phone like i originally wanted guys okay let's just do that
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:14.960]  okay well roger can you hear me
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:24.160]  yes he didn't hang up he's on the line guys he just doesn't have audio i i'm with you
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:28.160]  yes yes you're there thank you sir okay roger what do you make of the coup attempts everything
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:37.840]  is happening well uh alex is kind of ironic because you have you predicted this decades ago
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:45.760]  literally decades ago for almost three decades i guess you have been saying as i have that this
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:54.240]  moment would come and now it's here uh and it's multifaceted first of all they use their
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:35:01.840]  fake news media outlets to destabilize the president i'll give you an example at lantic magazine
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:10.960]  reports that there are four unidentified sources who will not come forward by name because they
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:18.080]  fear retribution uh who say that the president denigrated members of our military the guy who
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:26.560]  wrote this jeff goberg is a proven congenital liar he has a journalistic history of making things
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:34.080]  up that are not true at lantic magazine has no proof of this whatsoever but alex let me
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:40.240]  tell you what i heard i have four anonymous sources who work at atlantic magazine they're
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:45.600]  afraid to come forward of course because of retribution but they tell me this story was
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:50.400]  completely and totally fabricated i don't like that well we know it was and i'm glad we got
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:54.320]  on the line we'll come back next segment give you the floor to talk about jeffry goldberg who i
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:58.480]  know came here and visited me six years ago never wrote a story wrote a story a few months ago that
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:03.920]  almost none of it was true uh and so does he work for the israelis or who does he work for him i think
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:09.200]  he works in a larger sense for the deep state first of course of course he works for himself
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:14.800]  there's a lot of money in denigrating uh donald trump now you have this latest
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:21.600]  flap with bob woodward why would bob woodward why would anyone believe anything he says he lied
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:28.560]  about watergate he lied about the death of john belushi he lied about uh bill casey in the reagan
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:35.280]  administration and his coverage of iran contra he's been caught lying again and again and again
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:43.680]  but yet the entire fake news media like black words on the phone wire they all jump on this
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:47.680]  story all right roger back in a few minutes we'll get we'll get into it right now roger stone
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:56.640]  ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and aren't so incredibly
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:02.880]  anti-human love to censor people love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:07.600]  well it's very simple the first computers ever created were created by thomas watson the founder
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:12.640]  and owner of ibm to carry out eugenics and they helped run the death camps in nazi germany that's
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:18.000]  what the tattoos were on the slaves arms it would decide who lived and who died so from the beginning
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.920]  it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets and making humans obsolete the same people
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:28.320]  brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's brain small
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:33.040]  the same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers the lower IQs about
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:38.880]  20 points on average as well these are hardcore eugenics survival of the fittest social Darwinist
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:44.640]  grow-up world admit the truth with being soft as much and letting these globalists run your lives
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:51.840]  they are your mortal enemies they want you dead do you understand that the clock is ticking on the

[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:23.280]  com globalist combine and they are working around the clock to silence info wars just as we were
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:28.240]  the group they started with three years ago they test out everything new on us and a lot of it i
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:32.640]  can't get into on air at this point i'll be able to reveal this later but i just want to make you

[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:06.320]  non-essential remember first they said no more industry you'll be a service economy and now
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:10.720]  they tell you service is not essential this has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:17.600]  and operation long step and other documents the rocket filler foundation admits that this is how
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.320]  they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor and under their controls you can finally be
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.840]  starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very very weak bio weapons won't affect anyone

[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:59.280]  act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps location i read from the federal law
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:04.960]  and listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican now the media admits that almost

[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:17.360]  surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data with

[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:50.240]  we were headed they will pull out all stops there is no act illegal immoral or outrageous
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:55.920]  that the deep state will not utilize in an attempt to steal back the american government
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:43:04.960]  which to their shop they lost control of in 2016 the is absolutely true the generals madis uh and
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:14.560]  former general mcmaster canvassed a number of the trump cabinet members recognizing they needed
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:22.480]  a majority of the cabinet and the approval of mike hence the vice president to remove the president
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:30.160]  acting attorney general rod roses theme was actively involved in trying to line up cabinet
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:39.200]  members who would sign on the entire coup attempt collapsed when nicky hailey blew the whistle
[1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:47.360]  denied refused to join the coup and told the president not because she's a hero but because
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:53.840]  she's a neocon looking down the road and understands the popularity of trumpism within
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:57.600]  the republican party well yeah she knows what happened to the people that stabbed julia
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:04.880]  sees her to death it didn't end well exactly so uh we are now in a situation in which they're
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:11.760]  telegraphing their punches trump is going to lose the election he's going to refuse to leave the
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:19.280]  white house the military is going to replace him uh palosia said it schumer said it nadler said it
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:25.760]  shiff has said it biden has said it kamala has cherished let me let me translate it for you
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.600]  you are going to try to steal the election and if you think that trump and his supporters are
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:38.400]  going to stand down and let that happen you're dreaming dreaming what's needed now alex is not
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:42.880]  a plan for election day because there's new stories from the new york times about how the
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:49.040]  trump campaign has squandered millions and millions and millions of dollars can is going
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:57.280]  to be financially short in the closing weeks uh blow my mind just blow my mind we also know
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:05.120]  that super PACs supporting joe biden have raised over 800 million we're super PAC supporting
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:13.520]  president trump have raised only 200 million so we will be outgunned in the close but i still
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:19.200]  honestly believe in my heart that if only voters who are entitled to legally vote because they are
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:26.640]  citizens vote and they vote once donald trump will be elected president the ballots in the
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.920]  vada on election night should be seized by federal marshals and taken from the state
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:38.320]  they are completely corrupted no vote should be counted from the state of nevada if that turns
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:46.000]  out to be the provable case we can prove voter fraud in the absentee right now send federal
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:54.720]  marshals to the clark county board of elections mr president it's all there roger stone that was
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:59.760]  my next question what does trump need to do with 53 days out because it's clear they think they can
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:04.720]  steal it they've said they're going to oppose it big tech zuckerberg says they're going to launch it
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:10.880]  for weeks or months hold it up i mean that's their plan how how do we counter this the president
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:17.520]  you should call former congressman bob bar and he should ask him he should appoint him a special
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:23.520]  council he should order his appointment as a special council with a specific task of forming
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:30.640]  an election day operation using the fbi federal marshals and republican estate officials across
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:37.440]  the country to be prepared to file legal objections and if necessary to physically stand in the way
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:45.520]  of criminal activity exactly the whole democrat strategy is if federal officers are locals in
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:49.760]  force election law that's criminal and that's blocking votes when they have bombed the country
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:54.240]  with 80 million basically fake ballots to gum things up on purpose and the clintons are now
[1:46:54.240 --> 1:47:01.120]  as you said shortling admitting that they have a military plan once the election is in question
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:05.680]  to remove trump is that wishful thinking or if they have a small cadre and they're trying to
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:11.040]  act powerful what's the plan i don't want to overplay the facts here but if someone will study
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:18.480]  the president's authority in the insurrection act and in the his ability to impose the marshall law
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:24.160]  if there's widespread screening he will have the authority to arrest suckerberg to arrest
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:30.560]  tim cook to arrest the clintons to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:37.760]  activity i do not advocate a preventive detention but people who commit crimes i think they can
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:43.040]  continue to get away with it because we have two tiered justice are just wrong well let's be clear
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.080]  when we have a chai combat big tech running slave camps in china belligerently trying to steal the
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:52.640]  election and they've pressed the attack and they won't stop they believe in a game of chicken they're
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.680]  about to win i've never heard you and i've seen you back 40 years ago on tv talk like this you're
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:03.840]  not an alarmist you're a realist this is the wheelhouse they've taken us to well the republican
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:09.200]  structure in the states and nationally is not prepared for the aftermath of this election
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:15.680]  legally or politically they're not prepared there's going to be widespread obvious late
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:23.280]  late lagrant illegality the authority exists to stop that it will have to be used if necessary
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:29.840]  i'm not jumping the gun but i can just tell you right now the votes from nevada should not
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:36.960]  be should not be counted they are already flooded with illegals if harry reid is involved take harry
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:46.000]  reid into into custody and charge him this is not complicated and it is 100 legal governor special
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:52.400]  act is a punk don't he should not face down the president of the united states governor this is
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:57.920]  the president i have just nationalized your state police you follow me well and they've got
[1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:01.600]  grips marching everywhere saying death to america and burning down police stations i mean they're
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:09.280]  really making their move roger why do you think the big democrat websites daily beast all of them
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:14.800]  have come out and said they're particularly worried about info wars challenging their electors the
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:18.720]  ones for biden because they say they're gonna just like last time try to target trump electors
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:22.080]  with threats and they're claiming that we're going to be threatening them we know polosi's
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:25.840]  daughter tried to get me arrested four years ago claiming i harassed electors i didn't know
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:31.440]  such thing i said what she was doing was criminal uh you know again it's always with these groups
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:37.760]  projection it's projection but if the daily beast is involved in provably seditious and illegal
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:43.760]  activities their entire staff can be taken into custody and their office can be shut down they want
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:50.080]  to play war this is war i'm for a legal election everything i'm going to be involved with in terms
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:56.320]  of helping donald's won't get elected will be perfectly transparent and legal they cannot say
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:03.200]  that the average age of the person who writes to the daily beast is the average i2 pardon me is
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:09.680]  probably 75 they don't know what they're talking about well you said it they're playing war saying
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:13.680]  they're going to kill everybody and overthrow everything and in the country which is completely
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:18.320]  psychotic while saying we're the traders in bed with the russians and they've rebooted the whole
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:22.400]  russia canard again as you know with the coats running around putting that out saying well he
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:30.480]  felt like trump the trump might be under putin's control uh but dan coach is a moron dan coach
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:36.640]  i i challenge him publicly to take an iq test and publish the results i'd like to go back to the
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:42.640]  personnel files and see who it is that recommended his appointment to the president nothing the man
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:48.800]  says can be believed he is a deep state stewed with an iq of 70 how big is it though that the
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:53.360]  coup plot that you and i first reported on has now been confirmed by them so woodward can promote
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:51:02.080]  it as the as the solution as if as if mad dog madis is a good guy uh you know i actually think
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:08.560]  they hurt the chances of pulling this off uh if they i mean force will be met with force that's
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:13.760]  the way this is going to have to work it's really unfortunate i'm not an advocate of that i'd like
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:19.920]  to have an honest election in which the real winner takes office the real winner will not be
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:26.880]  go by there is too much voter fraud or even going on in Florida and Nevada stone defense fund dot

[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:03.120]  here on air but it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:08.080]  liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.320]  almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:17.200]  whole new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:20.880]  be taken off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:26.640]  nations enslaved and america still quasi free you can't have info wars has been proven right be on

[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:48.480]  you can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:52.880]  but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic
[1:52:53.520 --> 1:52:56.480]  you wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them
[1:52:56.480 --> 1:53:02.480]  so for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit and it's similar
[1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:07.600]  to how ducks and butterflies many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands
[1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:11.920]  of miles back to the exact place where they were born they're following magnetic lines
[1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:16.160]  they have magnetic cells in their brains we now know scientific what's going on there's even
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:21.200]  a lot more than that so we talk about the spirit we're talking about all the dark matter we're
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:24.960]  talking about all the things you don't understand but we know it's there and just like you can have
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:29.920]  a bunch of robots working off the wireless system that's what's going on with this satanic
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:35.360]  transmission that's working through people and that's how this entity behind it all is able
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:39.840]  to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space time continuum
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:51.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:54:02.240]  so
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:13.760]  roger stone ladies and gentlemen is here to respond to the public coup plot
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.880]  now being reported the associated press roiders by the deep state against president trump we are
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:25.360]  living in incredible times roger stone how would you define where we are right now well the uh the
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:32.320]  mainstream media the corporate owned media has now confirmed absolutely what we reported here on
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:40.560]  info wars almost two years ago there was a coup plot the coup plot involved general james madis
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:47.760]  involved acting attorney general rod roger steen uh it involved hr mcmaster these are open acts of
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:57.040]  sedition attorney general bill bar should order the arrest of these traders today that is an active
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:05.040]  act of sedition you have witnesses nicky hailey among them i understand that there were other
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:13.360]  cabinet members approached who declined and were appalled at this act of disloyalty the second
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:20.560]  attempt here is going to run a fraudulent election and then use their advantage in the fake news media
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:28.160]  megaphone to drown out objections they are said they are lighting the fuse to a powder keg the
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:35.920]  american people will not stand for a stolen election they simply won't so uh i think we're
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.800]  headed to very difficult times the reason info wars is so important is they want to cut our ability
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:49.600]  to communicate with each other that's what the sense of secondary purpose of all this internet
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:55.200]  censorship now alex i was supposed to give a speech in new york earlier in the week i had
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:03.920]  to cancel because mr stone has been diagnosed with with a very severe uh uh case of rheumatoid
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:11.920]  arthritis uh because the most effective medications for that malady lower your immunity
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:18.640]  lowering her immunity at this juncture during a pandemic is not a great idea so she is in a
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:25.840]  great deal of pain this is contributing to our continued financial problems which are caused
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:33.360]  by the mother witch hunt people who want to help us we need to help now at stonefamilyfund.com

[2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:10.800]  so a couple weeks ago i got on there and i said you better support us you better spread the
[2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:15.680]  articles the videos the links because the attacks are 10 times what they've ever been before this
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:20.080]  is a bellwether of what's going into this election and i'm not complaining i'm just saying the enemy
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:24.720]  wants us off air because we're effective telling the truth and countering their chi-com globalist
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:30.320]  america sucks capitalism sucks narrative because they just want to bankrupt us and collapse us
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.320]  and and kill the dollar i mean when you see all these fake right-wing hosts and all the liberal
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:40.960]  hosts and and people say oh the dollar's dead america's over our fiat currency is not halfway
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:46.400]  as devalued as a chi-com currency the eu they just want us out of the picture so they can take over
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:51.600]  and and obviously we inflate money too much obviously we have problems but if we end up not
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:56.960]  being the dominant currency when the musical chairs end we will be in a collapsed scenario
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:00.880]  the likes of which no one can even imagine i mean they'll make the 1920s and the great depression
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:07.840]  1929 look like a cakewalk in all experts views so anyone promoting that is your mortal enemy
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:14.960]  and now here we are with antifa marching saying death to america and the left and all and and
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:20.160]  their self-destructive stuff that psychiatrist dr steve pacinic talks about best-selling author co
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:24.400]  author with tom clancy uh ran a lot of psychological operations the state department and for other
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:30.160]  agencies camp david accords but has done a lot of work he's predicted a lot of this and he's
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:35.360]  confident but i see the death throes of the leftist state and the blue city is dying and
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.240]  hollywood dying as really black holes trying to take us with them it's kind of like captain you
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:45.200]  know a have goes down with moby dick i'm concerned we're going to go down with the whale or kind of
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:50.320]  like 20 000 leagues or what is under the sea like you know the captain goes down with a giant squitter
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:56.800]  whatever i i just they just they just don't give up they just keep chomping and biting and snapping
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:04.720]  and and spewing and and just everything so he's on the show today we appreciate him we've got what
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:09.200]  roger broke on the show that a couple years ago they were shopping a coup around with general mattis
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:13.920]  and boy did all hell break loose when we exposed that my god because they kept wondering how we
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.840]  knew we could just see them telegraphing it's not hard they think we're dumb i don't get that
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:23.120]  psychology where they they do it out in the open i think we don't see it and then you've got uh the
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:29.280]  new head of uh amazon board uh is the former head of the nsa we'll get pecheniks take on that
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.600]  we've got the ongoing lockdowns and the fact that covid's an overblown situation uh going on so
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:40.000]  much to cover so dr steve pechenick of steve pechenick dot com thank you for coming on what
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:45.600]  do you want to tackle first i would imagine 53 days out this this mattis revelation which i know
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:51.520]  most of what woodward says is it true but he's cheerleading mattis and the coup in this and and
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:57.440]  echoing the democrats and pelosi and them hoping for a military coup is that a ghost dance uh that
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:02.480]  they're hoping for or or do they really have some teeth to this public coup they're shopping around
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:10.800]  there's no teeth to it bottom line is that nancy pelosi is self-destructed already uh
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:17.600]  basically the democrats you've got an investigation going into diane feinstein for irregular trading
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:22.880]  of our husband same thing with nancy pelosi you've got schumer you've got a whole bunch of
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:31.520]  problems in california and they have no viability right now an attempted coup is really not a very
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:39.440]  serious problem the reason why i i say that number one the alex jon show sui generis with you there
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:46.080]  without you there is a powerful instrument of veracity in other words whether you like it or
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:54.880]  not it's there it's been there for 20 odd years the attempt for anything that general you know mattis
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:02.080]  might want to do is really result it resides in the fact that he was an ineffective general
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:07.680]  contrary to what he wanted to say and what he presented himself as an intellectual monk
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:13.760]  he was a disaster in iraq he killed our own people he was a disaster in afghanistan killed
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:20.160]  their own people he was a disaster in terms of the uh invasion into afghanistan which was
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:29.680]  ridiculous he was on theranos which was a bankrupt company so mattis is nothing more than a
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:37.760]  cherry marine who goes around and sells for grandaisers but it's not valid for the most part
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:44.160]  what has happened now and i'm going to say very simply what's happened is our military is not
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:53.120]  viable we got 2.2 million men in in uniform there's no value to it trump understands that trump took
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:05:00.480]  us out of syria he took us out of iraq afghanistan why did he do that for number one he is very smart
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:07.040]  he knows we do not win wars they're not effective we do not make money and the bottom line is that
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:14.400]  we have a far more serious problem in terms of the economy and in terms of getting our growth back
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:19.200]  i was about to say for people that were actually there they said woodward and others are lying
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:24.960]  and uh you know these other people the atlantic are lying trump was like these wars are done to
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:29.040]  chew up our good people we can use economic power to make a better deal than this why are we doing
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:33.040]  this for china he wasn't putting our military down he was saying it's stupid just to kill our troops
[2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:38.480]  for the reason he says that publicly yeah he said that repeatedly and one of the reasons i've always
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:45.440]  supported him is he's always been against war he is not deprecating anybody he's not an anti-semite
[2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:52.400]  he's not a racist what happens is the left or anybody wants to pick up a few words now here's
[2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:59.280]  the very clever dynamic of trump and also of an alex jones but more of trump right now and i'm
[2:05:59.280 --> 2:06:08.080]  going to explain it why would trump allow bob woodward to have 18 interviews with him when
[2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:14.480]  trump knew very well from boardwords history that he's going to get a hit piece it's going to be a
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:22.560]  disaster about him and there's no upside yet he spent a whole hours in the beginning at the white
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:29.200]  house and then every night for 18 nights he would call woodward now why would a man who's so smart
[2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:39.920]  do that is he self-destructive not really is he stupid not really is he in any way sorry
[2:06:39.920 --> 2:06:47.360]  that he did it not at all when you interview him so what was the basic point in having a guy who
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:53.840]  and i have to know what word i thought he was a phony to begin with he and i started it at a newspaper
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:07:00.480]  called the montgomery county sent no he never had any journalism behind him he's a cia operative
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:07.520]  i've known all about him for years he's basically not a very effective a writer jones diddy in the
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:14.080]  famous novelist said he's an idiot he basically writes nonsense which i agree and i was involved
[2:07:14.080 --> 2:07:19.120]  in the s and l crisis and he knew nothing about it he basically cares so why did trump do it so
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:25.440]  he'd know what his enemies were up to that's one thing but trump like yourself and possibly like
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:34.000]  me we like the game the game to us is far more important than anything anyone else can see now
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:42.160]  what do i mean trump look how many books came out now about him negatively mary trump says
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:48.960]  that he is a terrible man his sister says he's worse than terrible michael kohn his jewish
[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:54.240]  corrupt lawyer says he's corrupt and then you have other books coming out says that he's a
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:08:02.640]  disaster john bolton why does he do that one word only it's called trump you can knock it
[2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:10.720]  you can praise it he doesn't give a damn either way as long as you use the word t r um p and
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:16.880]  every one of these people who goes negatively against them including the stupid publishers
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:23.280]  are doing nothing more than to help trump self-aggrandize because he understood something a long time
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:29.680]  ago that you and i understood every knock is a boost you don't like that's fine just pronounce
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:35.200]  like bt barnum said just get my name right and trump understands that that gives him the name
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:40.080]  recognition and then there's also so much dis info that none of it matters and the more he survives
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:46.000]  dis info the more he almost becomes invincible to anything they might have it's real you got it
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:50.480]  and that's true of alex jones so the more you know about me the point is is that i want to know about
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:59.360]  you you've started off you've been there 20 some odd years and the testimony to your strength
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:07.040]  and viability is that you're getting hit right and left i get hit every morning my internet is hit
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:13.440]  a or wells down these guys play games with me until you know i work a couple hours later
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:19.920]  and they're off but the point is we will continue to be attacked however trump has made the art
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:24.800]  he is the grand manipulator well here let's talk about what you predicted for the election and so
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:30.000]  much more i mean when i go on to 11 a.m the hack attack start and it's right out of china and i wonder
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.520]  it's probably the left funding that what do you expect them to do when they try to challenge the
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:39.040]  election they've set up this group to do it dr steve machinic steve machinic dot com is our guest
[2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:43.040]  an incredible time to be alive please stay with us and spread the live link you got some of the
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:49.280]  video things up at info wars dot com on the whole general matter situation share those i don't want
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:53.920]  to say i'm a practical person i'm i am a humble person overall i've not come off as aggressive
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:58.320]  and things because i'm under threat here under threat and i'm i'm fine as hard as i possibly
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:02.880]  can and i appreciate your support your prayers but i know i come off as obnoxious sometimes
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:07.600]  and i wish i did a better job so that's why when you call in thanking me all the time it just it
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:12.480]  just kind of makes you feel pathetic because i guess call it pride i don't like begging you all
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.880]  the time to try our products or to donate or to spread the word or to pray for us i just know
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:21.760]  that's what keeps us on air and so i want to thank you you it's it's it's put the cart before the horse

[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:42.400]  now that's why they want to solve here because all of our credibility so high let's just stay
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:45.600]  together fight hard spread the word pray to god take us through this we're gonna make it
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:54.480]  it couldn't have been scripted any better that's because it was completely scripted and we even
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:11:00.960]  know the names of the united nations rockefeller foundation bill mullin decades and john hotkins
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:07.280]  top prince we have the script just like you'd have for a hollywood movie and it's designed to
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:15.920]  freeze civilization and have a post renaissance stagnation or new dark age and a total consolidation
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:22.320]  of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post humanist the magnitude of this
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:27.760]  is unfathomable but you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully every
[2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:33.600]  eye dotted every t crossed a total societal vertical integration takeover medical tyranny
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:38.000]  total surveillance the big tech heads on average have had their wealth cook up 35 percent in the
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.960]  last eight months of course jeff bezos has basically doubled us everyone is being forced
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:46.480]  out of their system the post human robot takeover you're being made obsolete
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:53.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:10.960]  all right daughter pochinix our guests on alex jones your host who just joined us
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:16.960]  is website steve pochinix dot com our sites are info wars dot com news wars dot com they're under
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:21.840]  massive the novel service and a bunch of other attacks the shopping cart's under attack everything
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:27.760]  that we do have a lot of the feeds up at info wars dot com port slash show so be sure and share
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:32.400]  those and we also have record traffic coming in daughter pochinix i want to get into a few topics
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.680]  of whatever you want to cover but i want to just ask you going back to the boby dick thing and we're
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:43.040]  like aab and they're the whale or vice versa i get they're self-destructing you're absolutely right
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:51.840]  it's crazy biden can't even talk down this is like unbelievable it's so bizarre but still they could
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:58.000]  get a blow in somebody could kill trump they could i mean they're saying they're gonna hold up the
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:03.680]  election and make people think trump stole it that's a very terrific thing to do what do you expect
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.400]  to come out of that because their official policy is now as you know to contest the election try to
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:12.240]  hold it off for months and have a bunch of riots what does trump do what do you expect to come out
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:21.840]  of that well number one i trump is i i always go back to what trump is trump is not about words
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:29.360]  he's about action so trump just made a major treaty thanks to jared christian oh brian and a
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:37.440]  bunch of others that allowed israel and ua to get together he's going to continue this with saudi
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:45.040]  arabia oman barain what he's going to do and why i think he's going to get reelected americans know
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:52.000]  in their heart of hearts when they have to put down a ballot that there's only one person only one
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:59.280]  who can bring back our economy that's not biden because they know for 47 years i would dare anybody
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:06.000]  to tell me what he has accomplished other than killing 5000 of our men in the iraq war which he
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:17.120]  initiated 2500 soldiers 2500 contractors but trump does not want a war that already negates the entire
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:24.240]  military industrial complex so what does he do he transfers all the capability to the startup
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:31.280]  that he needs again to bring back the economy as we said on your show fauchi made a major
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:37.360]  major mistake he should have been fired he's not and i've said trump is still not strong enough to
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:43.440]  get rid of the people in the administration who he does not need including fauchi redfield a whole
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:51.040]  bunch of them cdc but in turn he will concentrate on getting the economy back because the economy
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:58.800]  and the markets as a day trader trust trump they will never never accept biden because you'll have a
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:05.920]  v shape curve which one of the markets love trump so much because he's a businessman he knows exactly
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:12.240]  what he had to do we had the highest gdp he understands how to work a business he understands
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:19.200]  how to do discounted cash he's built assets we've never had a president who's built assets
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:24.640]  in the past 50 years i don't know of one president i searched five of them who knew anything about
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:33.040]  business yet bush jr a retard of the highest order creates 9 11 bush senior his own father
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:39.120]  goes into a war in the in the middle east which he didn't need also a disaster you got reagan
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:44.160]  whom they laud but he was a disaster and you get jimmy carter so what are we talking about
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:50.640]  we're not talking about the best and the brightest we're talking about simple competency which
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:58.240]  biden does not have in 48 years i want somebody to tell me other than the iraq war and killing
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:05.760]  people being completely corrupt garnering a huge amount of assets allowing his son a hunter
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:13.680]  to be corrupt as well as he what has biden done nothing to do nothing in 48 years as
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:19.680]  a politician means you're basically a welfare case and that's what the democratic party has
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:27.120]  created their own welfare leader and on top of that they got camala harris an attorney general
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:33.280]  who has a questionable background history who really doesn't know anything about power on the
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:38.720]  so that's my next question who is it they're planning to shoe shoehorn in if biden and kamala
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:44.800]  were able to get in who is it behind them who's that constellation of power and again why are
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:51.840]  they self-destructing so bad they're self-destructing in theory if i were to suggest anybody would be
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:58.480]  michelle obama because they're putting she's going on the air all the time talking about
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:04.560]  nonsensical issues how they had trouble in their marriage how she loves her kids all of it which is
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:09.200]  desultory she's trying to build up a credibility background with people like trump did with his
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:17.680]  tv shows correct but trump doesn't say a word about his family he doesn't have to malania
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:27.360]  smart as a whip eric and ivanka and all the other kids that he has they're highly competent
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:32.160]  they're taken care of they know he used to be a little bit down on kushner and i've been neutral
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:37.600]  on him but you seem to like him more have you got more info he's well let me put it this way i'm
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:44.720]  always an individual willing to learn i i'm not perfect i i i i read kushner in a certain way as
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:52.320]  an orthodox jew came out of new jersey whose father i knew about had been in prison however jared
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:58.960]  came to the forefront over the past couple of years and i had to change my opinion on the simple
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:06.640]  notion that jared understood a dynamic which we would be in the middle east strategies never used
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:10.720]  and i can say that i mean i've been involved in camp david you you're the only other person
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:13.200]  i should have said this in the start of the interview you were credited as the head of
[2:18:13.200 --> 2:18:16.800]  psychological operations state department they're getting the camp david accords down the only
[2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:21.760]  successful piece still ever and now you see trump getting it with the ua in israel with
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:29.360]  syria and bosnia that with all these big deals baren and oman and i give credit to trump and
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:36.320]  kushner and o brian because kushner came up with a concept a sophisticated concept where
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:42.560]  he said three years ago we're going to use the economy stupid and basically he said one other
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:47.680]  thing that we at the time could not do and he said really i'm not interested in the what the
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:53.520]  palestinians have to say if they don't understand this business deal too bad for them and you said
[2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:57.200]  that last time and now the arab league has come out and said tell the palestinian stop
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:01.680]  trying to control everybody as the little victims instead of just making deals with actual powers
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:07.600]  that'll help everybody correct and ironically the palestinians are known as the jews of the
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:14.000]  middle east so eventually i predict they will go back to deal with kushner kushner will be
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:19.840]  successful with saudi arabia and israel an amazing treaty because they're already there
[2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:23.840]  and certainly average liberal like love trump getting us out all these wars all these peace
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:31.520]  stills this is ridiculous no because when you have an ideology remember this alex if you're
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:39.200]  liberal it allows you by definition to be open-minded it says liberal you're caring about
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:46.480]  people you're good-hearted you know when you say conservative it has a harsh tone to it it means
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:52.160]  oh well we're conservative that doesn't mean in any sense that we're more liberal than they are
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:58.480]  we're more advanced we take risks liberal means we really are compassionate understanding you
[2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:04.880]  should love us in reality it's the reverse we don't want to be loved trump doesn't need to be
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:11.200]  loved all he needs to do is to affect change and that's what he's been doing and will continue to do
[2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:17.200]  the mistake he made he learned you don't shut down the government but everybody will come back
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:22.240]  quickly because they have millions of people which he understands is a small business let's talk
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:27.920]  about that next let's talk about that next the lockdown the vaccines the un trying to step forward
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:33.200]  through immunized cities they control to establish un power and trump's starting to pull us out of the
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:37.680]  un how we should get back control the un or get out of it create a new international

[2:21:58.400 --> 2:22:04.720]  call their new transcended silicon gods but that's really what they're now externalizing they're now
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:09.520]  taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago and actually openly announcing it
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.720]  everywhere they're going from beta to operational and think about all these major corporations they
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:18.400]  tell you humans are horrible they tell you humans are a parasite they tell you that we've all got
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:22.960]  to be gotten rid of and then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:29.120]  in COVID to kill them that's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:35.200]  is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:39.760]  roll out look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics they're
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:46.080]  absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19 this is all absolute information control

[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:31.200]  and say no and reverse himself we've got to get trump to go more on the offense exposing
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:37.520]  covet 19 as an overblown hoax yes it's a virus yes it kills people maybe one percent as bad as the

[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:53.600]  to bring in the end of liberty and freedom as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:25:10.320]  all right daughter steve machinist our guest i got a lot of questions for him smart guy
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:14.000]  psychiatrist best-selling author researcher worked in and out of the state department
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:19.120]  and other government agencies been involved in regime change you name it i just don't ever want
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:25.280]  to be overconfident and i get you live in a nice area around more conservatives in florida and i was
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:28.640]  just in the panhandle with great people that's one of the best places in the country i know you're
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:33.520]  a little bit closer to that but not quite there but i live in austin i've seen it go from a good
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:39.280]  nice kind of libertarian place to a leftist toilet of la i mean you know the people that have moved
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:45.200]  in are horrible on average they just are mindless they're vapid they're rude they're hateful they
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:50.400]  honk at you they cut in line in front of you they're just stupid and i don't see leftist
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:54.480]  learning from what they've left and then i see them when biden couldn't talk when you were on two
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:59.120]  years ago you said clearly he's out of the stroke yeah made a big natural story out of it now it's
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:03.600]  it's not they're not cherry picking i watch any speech he makes uh clearly he's out of stroke
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:10.400]  clearly he doesn't close my wife uh shoot max my wife and it's like he's literally in the top 30
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:15.520]  percent the most seen on a nursing home that scares me more that the leftist globalist chai
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:22.080]  com establishment with the people's daily endorsing him saying he's in sync simpatico with zizi ping
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:28.240]  and uh he's our man and to see policy going yeah china's helping get biden elected while they say
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:36.160]  trump's in league with russians it's just the attacks on truth the attacks on logic uh i i look
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:41.120]  at it and it actually makes me feel weak that things this week and evil and twisted and stupid
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:46.880]  and lazy are actually having a chance to defeat us and defeat their own self-interest like how the
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:51.600]  hell did we get this and to me it's even more dangerous they don't even care about their own
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:58.000]  self-interest they have taken on the hatred of the host that they have been destroying and i just
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:02.560]  wonder what they're gonna do next because you say oh they won't they won't have the nerve to pull off
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:09.200]  a coup they're they're so stupid they might try it you know i mean you know a monkey with a flamethrower
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:13.520]  inside a fireworks factory is pretty damn dangerous even if it's a monkey so i'm just really
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:16.480]  i mean i agree with what you said years ago they're self-destructing they're gonna self-destruct
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.400]  you've been proven right but okay but they're trying to take us i go back to the moby dick thing
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:27.600]  okay let let me start with coups there are what we call the soft coup that i've been involved in
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:34.080]  the hard coup that i've been involved the hard coup was overseas so the union panama where we
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:40.480]  used military financial assets i've been involved in two soft coups directly here in the united
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:47.040]  states one was in the nixon transition of power where i was brought in and it was done quietly
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:52.640]  it was done with the help of the cia and other agencies and we transferred power to forward
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:28:00.080]  the other soft coup i won't get into the details was involved when i was warned by robert gates
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:08.000]  and i was dealing with our military to say okay cheney and our secretary of defense are gonna
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:16.400]  have to go rumsfeld and gates was brought in now i happen to know gates and gates has been
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:23.360]  in let me put it this way he's associated with many different people but when he was put in
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:30.160]  a director of the cia he was not exactly the most intelligent director so it was not hard
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:37.200]  to initiate a soft coup and bring in someone else into the position that we needed the military
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:44.320]  understood it we kept quiet let me put this again i've said it a couple years ago in on your show
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:50.000]  that the hill the clinton's would never come back and i said that there was a coup at the time
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:57.360]  let me put it again if there's any attempt by the democrats to come in legally or illegally
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:03.120]  i can assure you in your audience that's not going to happen i'm not going to pronounce what i have
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:09.920]  to say because i'll have the fbi right at my door as i had last time when i criticized obama but
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:16.640]  the bottom line is that there are many ways to make sure that the democrats don't come to power
[2:29:16.640 --> 2:29:22.320]  the legal way and there are other ways trump understands pretty much what has to be done
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:26.560]  no i agree when they're running around saying death to america and burning cities and this i'm
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:31.760]  getting i mean i'm not looking for i just wanted to stop it i mean i feel guilty watching them do
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:38.480]  this you shouldn't feel guilty the i understand what you're talking about in terms of what happened
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:46.720]  to the cities it's shameful but the reality is coronavirus hit on a very interesting dynamic
[2:29:46.720 --> 2:29:54.240]  and that was do we need cities and do we need cities that were in it really in effect no obviously
[2:29:54.240 --> 2:29:59.920]  the cities are obsolete and corrupt and a big problem well but you see when you say obviously
[2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:06.000]  had it not been meant for coronavirus we wouldn't have seen that so you've got los angeles in trouble
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:10.720]  you've got chicago and trouble yeah but you said 15 years ago that they would collapse along the eu
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:18.800]  so and that's what i predicted so what happens is the rural areas the end of the areas around
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:24.640]  the west and southwest when i said to you the east coast and the west coast are finished they were
[2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:27.760]  you said that actually more than 15 years ago you said people should sell their stuff on eastern
[2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:33.280]  west coast they should move into the south the midwest places like that exactly and that's exactly
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:41.120]  what happened did we initiate the coronavirus no is the coronavirus that lethal absolutely not
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:45.920]  what happened in effect instead of getting rid of some of the politicians which should get rid of
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:53.760]  Fauci NIH and one of the things that i wanted trump to do is to decrease the size of this humongous
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:59.360]  federal government that's useless two million people with more agencies that you can think of
[2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:06.640]  we don't need that i don't need 16 intelligence units i don't need a 2.2 military a million
[2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:10.480]  military army so let me ask you this what are the democrats do then i'm at the final segment
[2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:14.800]  we'll get into 9 11 because the anniversaries tomorrow what are the democrats in the deep
[2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:20.240]  state do i don't see them adopting chai com anti american policy being a viable second party we
[2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:25.760]  need a second party obviously so what what happens to democrats i just don't i just don't see leaving
[2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:32.400]  them there well well it's not an issue about you or me it's an issue that they're fading away in
[2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:38.000]  other words those people who are really active in the democratic party they're older they're about
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:44.080]  my age they no longer have the enthusiasm for the progressive issues that they were involved in in
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:50.560]  the 60s and 70s when we had a war now the young kids who went into the progressive movements are
[2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:55.440]  beginning to realize wait a minute i'm listening to podcasts where i have to learn how to make
[2:31:55.440 --> 2:32:01.760]  a living but i don't want to go to the universities one of the great benefits of this coronavirus
[2:32:01.760 --> 2:32:08.000]  despite the fact that i went to all the elite university is to make sure that cornell university
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:14.560]  understands it is not essential to have cornell university what i said when i went there was a
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:20.400]  waste of time i was on a new york state scholarship when i went to cornell university medical college
[2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:26.160]  as fouchy did i said that was a waste of time i didn't need four years you need two years in a year
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:32.880]  and a half when i went to harvard and psychiatry i said that was a complete waste of time and by the
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:39.600]  way they went under five years so what i'm getting at is there's selective entropy that is occurring
[2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:44.960]  with the virus that's taking out universities in other words we're getting into a whole new
[2:32:44.960 --> 2:32:50.640]  landscape that you and i predicted years ago there won't be those expensive universities
[2:32:50.640 --> 2:32:58.480]  for 65 000 or 50 000 a year in education i see young people particularly young women going to
[2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:04.880]  colleges community college to study nursing para nursing you're not going to have the medical
[2:33:04.880 --> 2:33:09.920]  doctors you're not going to have the big hospitals that really don't need to be around you're not
[2:33:09.920 --> 2:33:15.280]  going to have the multi-million dollar bills that come in from the medical department you're going
[2:33:15.280 --> 2:33:22.240]  to see a whole transformation of society do we need academicians and retain them on a union no
[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:30.560]  do i need uh all these uh military men no do i need generals you never fought a war never won a war
[2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:36.800]  no do i need the bankers with the banks really are no longer saying the vestigial bureaucracy
[2:33:36.800 --> 2:33:41.680]  there wasn't even vestigial it was never actually anything real it was the imitation of the vestigial
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:44.480]  that's going to fall away my concern is we'll come back and talk about this
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:50.720]  is what do they do in their destructive process trying to take us with them or trying to stay
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:56.960]  relevant because they are obsolete they are collapsing and they don't even get the lockdowns
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:01.040]  killing universities the teachers unions don't even want to go back to work they're so dumb
[2:34:01.040 --> 2:34:05.520]  they're being made obsolete by off-site training they're so stupid that they've been completely
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:11.920]  set up by their own behavior and how would they then trigger the exact scenario to destroy themselves
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:16.160]  that makes me ask what you said oh the u.s government or any intelligence agencies we're not behind
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:22.800]  this i agree with you it's the magic of their own craziness has dug their own pit and thrown
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:27.760]  themselves into it and so i just wonder when you say well they're fading away yeah but
[2:34:27.760 --> 2:34:33.040]  how do they fade away we'll come back and then talk about what is it 20 years later yeah 19 years
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:38.880]  later the 9 11 anniversary wasn't an inside job obviously but what is an inside job we'll
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:52.160]  right back stay with us there is a metaphysical rule that god has put in place that controls the
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:57.840]  universe and its free will that's why the social engineers the robber barons the globalists the
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:06.000]  post-humanist the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing and openly tell you that your
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:10.720]  work was crap and you need to die because that will save the earth but they do everything they can to
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:16.960]  make the most dystopian ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:21.760]  publications they are making you hate yourself they are making you be depressed they are making
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:25.760]  you not have a connection to god because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:30.080]  the future and that's what all this is about you know they say they're setting up world government
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:34.480]  to protect us all from our super technologies while they're the ones running around like mad
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:39.680]  scientist endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies the globalist are what is
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:48.480]  disruptive to human species they call us disruptive to their power grab it's time to say no in germany
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:58.000]  in australia in canada and now even in ohio every blue state every blue city is announcing that they
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  are establishing emergency covid centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:09.360]  are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:15.280]  break quarantine this of course is all based on the tests that are over 90 fraudulent and were
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:23.360]  designed to be so this is a power grab the world government globalist system is in trouble
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:29.760]  all over the planet free peoples are trying to pull out of it and every blue area i use the term
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:36.000]  blue as if in the u.s for blue for democrats red for republicans is basically globalist or communist
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:41.600]  and authoritarian and they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:45.920]  know the world's waiting to them it's a very simple equation it's illegal we must resist it
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:52.400]  you've always had a pledge for me and it's that i'll come to you with the truth at least as good as
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:58.160]  my human temporal truth can get because as the bible says we all see through a rose colored
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:03.920]  darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive so that everything we do is
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:09.600]  actually a fallen sin everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of god's will so when i tell
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:15.120]  you the truth it's the best truth this fallen creature's god but i'll tell you it's all i got
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:22.000]  and when i tell you this country and the world is under major satanic threat you don't need me
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:26.160]  to tell you that you can look out the window you can look into your own family you can turn on the
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:32.000]  news you can see it but you've got this commitment i do recognize the truth of god so to you we're
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.720]  going to win this fight but it's going to be hard and i want to keep info wars in the main position
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:41.280]  to fight and it only happens when you support what you've been doing so again i thank you but
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:46.400]  go to info wars store dot com buy the product spread the word because that's how we're gonna win
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:55.040]  again i thank you all ignorance does not equal bliss ignorance equals slavery if you're ignorant
[2:37:55.040 --> 2:38:00.080]  walk through a field at night that there's a six foot hole up ahead you're gonna step in it and
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:05.280]  probably break your ankle or maybe worse well it's the same thing happening to human civilization
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:10.960]  the industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects but also took us away from the
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:15.760]  land made us very very domesticated and very very easy to manipulate and now corruption and
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:20.800]  predatory activity can hide behind that complexity now i know what's going on behind the complexity
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:26.000]  because i go read what the u.n and the rockfeller foundation the davos group and the boulderberg
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:32.800]  group and all their subsidiaries what the club of rome say so i know exactly what's going on
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.520]  not because i'm even that cool or special a person but i'm actually
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:41.840]  want to be empowered and informed because i'm a history buff i know that those that don't
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:45.200]  know history don't repeat it the globalists think you're stupid they laugh at you because
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:39:04.160]  you won't research their own admissions you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:13.280]  since uh steven schenick earlier mentioned that's how we actually play the clip
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:18.960]  where he talks about how biden has dedicated his whole career to deindustrializing this country
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:27.760]  here's the president had to say but the other is a basic disaster for our country joe biden
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:34.960]  devoted his career to offshoring your jobs throwing open your borders dragging us into
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:40.800]  endless foreign wars along with some of his other friends now in the time we have left
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:44.160]  him a little bit of 911 dr pichett he's walking back tomorrow if he wants you to get into 911
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:48.080]  it's important to talk about what happened there and what went on now that we've moved on past
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:51.280]  that group i don't talk about it a lot because i want to moralize people but you know we've covered
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:54.800]  it at nauseam it's important to remember what happened so it doesn't happen again and to know
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:58.080]  that trump called in the day after it happened and said yeah they had bombs the buildings they
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:01.520]  blew it up i mean he could see what happens he's a good guy at the end of the day we're blessed
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:05.440]  to have him he deserves to know about peace prize that would bring credit back to that prize that's
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:13.440]  become a joke with obama getting one but what about big tech we know the creep keeper left and
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:18.480]  all their behavior is a joke and is in trouble and herman von rumpi dancing around two years ago
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:22.720]  saying gg ping will crush america and the washington post running the headline i mean that that's
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:28.000]  delusional craziness but what about the big corporations that jeff bezosis of the world
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:33.200]  and and all and all the rest of them that that you know say they're not against america but at
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:37.360]  the end of the day i don't see them strengthening america what do we do about big tech censorship
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:42.400]  because most people couldn't hold on we've held on thanks to our listeners uh and we can say we're
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:46.320]  winning i guess culturally trump gets back in we should see some action but what should be done
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:52.640]  about big tech and the incredible censorship uh that's the and the oppression and twitter blocking
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:58.480]  trump's tweets i mean uh these big corporations still think they're in charge and and i'm i don't
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:03.120]  want a big powerful government like you well these corporations are already operating like i mean if
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:07.040]  the nsa did the stuff that google did they'd all be arrested and they should that's what i'm saying
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:13.440]  i think you hit it on the head the real problem is what we've been talking about the major
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:20.160]  corporation as i said last time many of them were funded by the cia what we call incutel
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:29.120]  and we have a vested interest in it but trump was starting to take down uh amazon he was already
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:37.040]  threatening google he understood more than anybody else that these are not viable economic entities
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:41.600]  in terms of american business no they're out of control imperiums that are cozyed up in china
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:49.040]  correct well the china let me put the china issue in context number one we've confronted china in
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:53.120]  the south china sea i wrote about that years ago sure you said it was coming in your book
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:59.280]  right it impacts pacifica i'm not worried about china right now because china has a
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:07.440]  bigger problem in the united states and that is trump's personal friend modi of india because modi
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:14.320]  of india will not tolerate g's incursions into the him we put them in check with modi absolutely i
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:19.120]  know i agree economically we can defeat them but what about what about the left's hatred of themselves
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:25.280]  in the country that's what i'm saying the hatred that they have is going to exhaust themselves out
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:32.640]  the left will no longer be a viable entity that students really don't care i mean much of what
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:39.200]  you're seeing in terms of demonstrations and all that it's not ideological it's boredom it's what
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:46.400]  happened when we put in six months of corona virus sit down or shut down and lock down and so they
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:52.720]  went out and started to protest absolutely that was all done by design correct that there are no wars
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:42:57.680]  there's nothing they can really come in that's like a coming of age thing for a bunch of methods
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:04.080]  correct and that's exactly it those who will want to get ahead are gonna understand one thing better
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:10.000]  than anybody else you better understand how to get an education for the new world you're not going to
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:16.640]  four years of harvard mit to be cyber communication you're gonna have to go to a community college
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:21.680]  if that if not you're gonna go on youtube so it's a no everything is about what you can do in the
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:28.160]  real world now it's it's gonna be absolutely back to me what you can do right and why does alex
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:34.240]  jones important i'm not i'm not glorifying you i'm just saying the validity and the the reality of
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:43.120]  alex jones was you can't you maintain a certain entity and integrity for 25 odd years washington
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:50.080]  post couldn't do that new york times couldn't do that none of our media could do that tv is gone
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:54.880]  newspapers are gone radios gone they've all got to be propped up because they don't give people
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:44:01.280]  what they want that's the point they're antiquated so you can say whatever you want in the new york
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:05.920]  times nobody's going to look at it seriously but they're going to listen to a podcast they're going
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:12.080]  to call what we call the alternative media became the mainstream media you and i talked about it for
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:18.000]  decades this would become the mainstream media no i've called it all dr patrick steveson.com
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:22.720]  but a true visionary so in the few minutes we have left what do you predict they're due sex or
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:27.120]  they're ace in the hole could be a false flag i mean i don't want to be overconfident what could
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:32.880]  this corrupt establishment do to make sure trump doesn't get in they're not going to do anything
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:39.520]  because what happens when you're incompetent and self-destructive you're trying to maintain the
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:44.800]  last vestiges of your own entity in other words there's nothing they can do right now so all they
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:48.400]  can do is destroy what they already have control of which destroys them but that's the only power they
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:55.120]  have that's about it i mean basically if i were camala harris i'd get out of that and and wait for
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:02.480]  another five to six years to have an independent race but i wouldn't want to be next to biden i
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:08.000]  wouldn't want the democratic party next to biden is there going to be a democratic party no i think
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:13.520]  what's going to happen on those individuals the youth of this country should start coming in they
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:19.440]  will develop their own organization whatever it's called it can be progressive it can be called
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  independent but i predict that independent movements will arise from these young individuals
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:31.920]  some will come into the republican and conservative parties some will try to become more centrist on
[2:45:31.920 --> 2:45:37.920]  the left wing but i think the old notion of republican party that's gone it's called the
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:43.440]  trump party there is nothing i was about to say with the republicans already had their renaissance it's
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:50.560]  correct and trump is an entity on to himself it's sui generis alex jones sui generis steve
[2:45:50.560 --> 2:45:57.360]  machanic sui generis maybe tom plansey along with that but my point is we each created our own
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:04.400]  viability without self-destructing and as you said that's the american system is the individual
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:09.200]  developing something others like then they adopt and expands which which brings real diversity the
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:16.160]  market now hit it on the head we're about individualists we're about risk taking we're about consistency
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:23.200]  we're about constant risk taking constant bombardment but we're the only system that's viable in this
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:30.080]  world you go to europe totally stagnant stagnant i know i mean i'm i'm blessed to be under attack
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:34.080]  and i know you are as well it's it's just crazy and it's a wild time to be alive we didn't get
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:40.560]  into 9 11 but we don't have to get into that tomorrow about 9 11 you want to come on tomorrow
[2:46:40.560 --> 2:46:46.000]  what's what hour of course i'm always happy to go on but basically you're there and you will
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  continue to be there as long as you're there trump continues as long as trump continues we're going
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.080]  to make all kinds of treaties and economic recovery the country knows it what you don't see in the
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:05.280]  cities are the flags and the cars flag showing trump signs everywhere you're not going to go
[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:11.680]  to new york and fly a huge trump sign you go here in central florida in a baptist area you're going
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:18.320]  to see trump signs everywhere you go into a local restaurant this trump signs on the one side the
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:24.000]  other you don't even have to say a word because you know you belong with the people you belong to
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:29.280]  and that's what's going to happen to you and me you're going to crew more people on the alternative
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:35.040]  media we're going to crew more problems that's the nature of what we do and trump will eventually
[2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:40.560]  come back will they attempt to coo not really there's no one there who knows really how to do
[2:47:40.560 --> 2:47:45.040]  i was going to say there are a bunch of talkers that try to get somebody else to do it yeah but
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:49.360]  you know it's like saying you know do something that you don't know how to do i mean it's very
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:55.520]  nice to say to people go do a coup you might as well tell them to go cook a bake a bake a cake
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:01.280]  because they don't know what a coup is it sounds nice it sounds easy no those of us who this madis

[2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:43.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:59.840]  all right folks we are back live and i should have just led the show with this there's all this
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:05.040]  attempt at coup news main street news against trump and just all the insanity that i i went
[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:09.440]  off down that area i think it's been a powerful three hours matt bracken's about to take over
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:12.400]  but let's go over some of these headlines some of the recent ones and the new ones today
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:19.120]  un says a new polio outbreak in sudan caused by oral vaccines and the actual reports to the
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:24.240]  un admit that most polio worldwide is the vaccine oh and there's a cancer virus they give them on
[2:52:24.240 --> 2:52:30.640]  top of it i mean come on man and then they starve the africans and the un helps fund all that so
[2:52:30.640 --> 2:52:37.040]  they've got lower iqs because they're not getting any protein and then they ship them here you
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:40.640]  take white people and not give them food and do the same damn thing i mean it's dangerous as hell
[2:52:40.640 --> 2:52:48.560]  let's continue un forced to admit gates funded vaccine is causing polio outbreak in africa
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:58.160]  and that leads us to this okay i've been studying these vaccines they're creating
[2:52:58.880 --> 2:53:06.480]  these new ones that go in and change the dna these m rna vaccines and so i spent a couple
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:12.640]  hours this morning going and just reading just random scientific reports and peer reviewed
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:17.280]  studies by prestigious universities and medical centers and i found stuff five years ago
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:22.640]  when they were first getting funding and the first studies were well the problem is if you
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:31.520]  randomly change the nuclei of a cell it can release proteins that actually flip off the
[2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:37.360]  switches in the cells and make them start dying when your cells start dying you start dying and it
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:42.320]  causes cancer mutations you name it so just randomly searching this today
[2:53:47.040 --> 2:53:51.840]  it blew me away so so what normally goes on is they inject you with tetanus or they inject you
[2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:56.240]  with something else your white blood cells go and learn how to kill it they they they they weaken the
[2:53:56.240 --> 2:54:01.040]  smallpox whatever they put in you see your body learns how to defeat it and creates an auto
[2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:09.760]  immunity this goes into the cell nucleus and reprograms the cell to create a protein that
[2:54:09.760 --> 2:54:15.120]  they claim then will block the virus getting into the cell and they admit they don't even know if it
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:21.440]  works what they're really doing is a mass experimentation so let me just show you some
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:27.680]  of these reports genetic alterations of chromosome eight gene in oral cancer so this is what i came
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:33.120]  up with and it turned out then when i searched at others that already figured it out and i'm not
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:41.200]  even a scientist that when you alter protein in the cells with one of these new so-called vaccines
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:50.480]  that when you do that it can turn off chromosome eight and when you do that the whole body falls
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:55:00.720]  apart it's basically a kill switch and that's ncbi.nlmnih.gov i mean this is what they say
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:06.000]  creating a path of treatment for chromosome eight p disorders through research community and
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.880]  intelligent information the promise of mRNA vaccines a biotech and industrial perspective
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:22.080]  these are the ones that change your whole body and it goes in it changes the DNA of the cell
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:27.920]  with the RNA and then has the cell that's what a virus does it goes in reprograms the cell
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:32.160]  they're not trying to teach your white blood cells how to stop this they've created a virus that
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:37.760]  reprograms your cell to then become immune to something but they admit it's pure testing
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:41.840]  on the public they skipped the animal testing they didn't really do that they actually did the
[2:55:41.840 --> 2:55:46.960]  animal testing and killed a bunch of the animals we looked all that up too RNA vaccines a novel
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:55.920]  technology to prevent and treat disease hms harvard glitches in dna replication of important
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:56:01.680]  implications for treating cancer and it all goes into that when you start taking these new vaccines
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:07.120]  these mRNA vaccines it can actually give you cancer and again i'm no rocket scientist i said
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:11.360]  they're from the start i said you're randomly going in to reprogram a cell to start replicating
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:20.080]  that sounds like cancer to me that's what cancer viruses do is they go in most cancers viral and
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:25.200]  cause your body to do that so we'll cover this more tomorrow but mitochondrial analysis of
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:31.200]  eight p three one deletion of new patients atypical RNA vaccine i mean it's just all
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:36.000]  Pfizer's latest stealthy move could help it when the coronavirus vaccine race on and on and on
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:41.040]  and we're all just getting picked the psychotic person bill gates who says he wants is dead i
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:46.320]  mean this is real simple what's going on here folks these people are out of their minds the
[2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:51.840]  mask is more than just a symbol of subservience being a blind follower not knowing facts and
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:56.800]  science it's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman and they tell you you are not
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:01.360]  essential remember first they said no more industry you'll be a service economy and now they tell
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:05.440]  you service is not essential this has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time
[2:57:05.440 --> 2:57:12.400]  and operation long step and other documents the Rockefeller foundation admits that this is how
[2:57:12.400 --> 2:57:17.040]  they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor and under their controls you can finally be
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:22.560]  starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very very weak bio weapons won't affect anyone
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:26.800]  that actually gets their rda of vitamins and minerals and so that's the plan for you and your
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:30.720]  family none of you are tuned into this broadcast you check this out for yourself you know it's true
[2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:37.360]  so let's start warning the sheep let's start educating them now i just went and swam at the
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:41.600]  lake and i walked around 20 minutes educating people after i got out of the water it's that simple
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:44.640]  we must take action now or be slaves forever this is life and death
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:58:06.000]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  okay um it's going to be a little bit different today because i i wrote a piece for american
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:21.360]  partisan i actually wrote it over like the last two days but it went up this morning it's called
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:29.760]  armed citizens must defend their communities from rioting mobs if the politicized police will not
[2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:36.400]  i kind of put my thoughts about all of this uh down on paper and i think it's a good starting point
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:41.920]  for crystallizing the view that if the police aren't going to defend us we're seriously going to
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:49.120]  have to defend ourselves so here it goes it's going to take probably this whole block in societies
[2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:55.520]  living under the rule of law sworn law enforcement officers have always been considered fully
[2:58:55.520 --> 2:59:03.360]  justified in applying lethal force against violent mobs during arson riots such as those
[2:59:03.360 --> 2:59:09.440]  which we have been seeing with regularity in american cities during the summer of 2020
[2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:16.320]  this was the intent and meaning of police officials publicly reading the riot act
[2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:22.640]  announcing over a loud speaker that a violent mob had been declared to be an unlawful assembly
[2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:30.160]  that is to say a riot rioters who lingered on the street after that final warning could be
[2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:37.600]  engaged by law enforcement at any level up to and including the use of deadly force with no
[2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:46.320]  further announcement this was in more prior civilized times a basic understanding of all
[2:59:46.320 --> 2:59:54.400]  citizens living under the rule of law this is why a police officer's standard issue pump shot gun
[2:59:54.400 --> 3:00:01.920]  was traditionally referred to as a riot gun long before the development of modern less than lethal
[3:00:01.920 --> 3:00:10.480]  munitions this is also why arson riots were uncommon and short-lived everyone understood
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:20.400]  the ground rules there was no right to burn loot or murder thomas sol put it this way if you are
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:28.640]  not prepared to use force to defend civilization then be prepared to accept barbarism note that
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:36.400]  he did not say the government or the police department he said you must be prepared to
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:46.400]  defend civilization abr which is my own acronym for the current working coalition of antifa
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:55.440]  blm and the revolutionary communist party of the united states known as revcom they are now routinely
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:03.760]  using molotov cocktails which are gasoline bombs and other incendiary and explosive devices as
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:12.560]  offensive weapons in both an anti personnel and an anti property role that's arson as far as the
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:21.360]  bat fe is concerned a molotov cocktail is an illegal explosive device and so are powerful
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:30.160]  high-altitude fireworks when they are deployed at ground level as anti personnel and anti property
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:40.160]  explosive and incendiary grenades abr deliberately uses the anonymity of their black clad and face
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:48.400]  masked mobs to continue to conceal the identity of their individual bomb throwers in exactly the
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:57.120]  same way that the 19th century Ku Klux Klan night riders carrying torches on arson missions
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:05.440]  concealed their identities with white robes and hoods there is no moral or ethical requirement
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:13.680]  for either police or ordinary citizens protecting their communities from violent mobs to identify
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:20.240]  and ferret out the individual bomb throwers when the rest of the mob is intentionally
[3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:27.680]  surrounding and protecting them in order to shield them from that identification because of the
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:35.600]  deliberately created synergy of bomb throwers utilizing the anonymity of the mob the entire
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:44.720]  abr mob becomes a legitimate target for police arrest or for armed community self-defense
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:52.080]  furthermore at this writing in september of 2020 there is no moral or ethical requirement
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:59.600]  for a law abiding american citizen to wait for a lit molotov cocktail to crash through the window
[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:07.680]  of their home or business while abr mobs are rampaging through the streets conducting arson
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:16.800]  attacks as we have seen in kenosha portland minneapolis and elsewhere once the fires begin
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:25.520]  morally and ethically the same rules for the use of force should apply that would attach to a lynch mob
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:34.800]  or to Ku Klux Klan night riders on their way to burn homes or businesses both kkk night riders
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:42.400]  bearing torches in olden times and violent mobs of abr terrorists with molotov cocktails
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:51.520]  can and should be engaged by armed citizens with any necessary level of force required
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:59.680]  to halt their terroristic depredations in numerous recent cases law enforcement under
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:06.960]  leftist political control has repeatedly abdicated its traditional and expected role
[3:04:06.960 --> 3:04:14.160]  in breaking up violent riots and presenting and preventing arson and other terror attacks
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:22.480]  week by week the level of abr violence has been steadily escalating and it's logical to assume
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:30.000]  that this will only worsen as the hotly contested presidential election draws near we know this
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:39.920]  is a fact so let me be very clear if democrat party governors mayors and da's have hamstrung
[3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:46.560]  their police for political reasons and won't allow them to protect the lives and property
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:55.520]  lives and property of their local citizens using all required force abandoning their primary role
[3:04:55.520 --> 3:05:03.920]  in order to bow to the abr mob then it is time for their undefended citizens to apply the clear
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:11.120]  intent of the second amendment there should be deep regret about the abandonment of the rule
[3:05:11.120 --> 3:05:18.240]  of law by the democrat party political ruling class but there should be no moral quibbles or
[3:05:18.240 --> 3:05:26.160]  hesitation by american citizens concerning the legitimacy of armed community self-defense
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:34.880]  in the absence of expected law enforcement protection therefore it is my carefully considered
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:44.160]  opinion that black clad and masked abr mobs rampaging and terrorizing innocent citizens
[3:05:44.160 --> 3:05:53.120]  under the cover of darkness in the style of the kkk of old may morally and ethically be taken
[3:05:53.120 --> 3:06:01.600]  under preemptive fire by armed citizens at any level to drive them out of their peaceful neighborhoods
[3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:08.640]  and away from their businesses before the abr terrorists can reach their targets
[3:06:08.640 --> 3:06:16.240]  and throw their molotov cocktails as an historical note it should be understood
[3:06:16.240 --> 3:06:24.080]  that the national rifle association yes the nra was founded after the last american civil war
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:33.680]  or by former union army officers and republicans at that in order to empower freed african american
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:44.880]  former slaves to defend themselves with firearms against kkk night raids in the 19th century the
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:52.720]  democrat party then allied with the clan as the democrats of today are aligned with antifa and
[3:06:52.720 --> 3:07:01.680]  blm had favored strict gun control in the form of narrowly written laws restricting the legal
[3:07:01.680 --> 3:07:09.680]  ownership of firearms by black citizens the more things change the more things stay the same
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.720]  only the color of the robes have really changed it's the same democrat party they're just uh

[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:58.960]  red mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that trump has won on election
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:04.160]  night now he's come out the statement and told all the media in the united states they better get
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:09.600]  behind saying that trump basically lost they're not going to let trump declare victory even though
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:14.400]  it's overwhelming they'll have 95 percent of the vote done on election night and even if you added
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:19.040]  all the other votes in against it he'd be the winner they are going to steal this election
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:23.840]  they're preparing everyone you've seen all the scams they've already run trump is surrounded by
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:30.240]  tyrants but he has we the people and he has true media not independent media the real media
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:34.320]  so now more than ever it's critical to share the live streams the videos the articles the
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:39.040]  information info wars dot com because the globalist fear at most because you were the first to
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:44.320]  expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out to keep the american people from
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:12:00.240]  re-electing president trump you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:19.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:29.200]  i'm really i'm really glad i was able to get that get that piece on arm community
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:34.720]  self-defense out in one block you know i feel very passionate passionately about this
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:41.280]  that the the uh legal establishment both both you know republicans and democrats
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:46.240]  politicians in general they're never going to empower you give you permission they're never
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:50.800]  going to come out and say look if the police aren't going to defend you you'll just have to do it
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:57.120]  yourself at most they'll say well you know you can defend your home i mean if they get if they get
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:13:03.600]  right to your house then you can defend your own house but if if you look at the way that
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:11.040]  this escalation is proceeding we're going to see molotov cocktails used against homes
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:17.520]  that's how this is going to go everybody by now should be familiar with this operation red mirage
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:24.960]  that's where they expect that trump will win on election night but over the next couple weeks
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:31.760]  after that they're going to just keep finding those mail-in ballots so what election night really is
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:38.480]  is the count for the democrats of how many ballots they need in which key swing states
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:45.840]  they're going to pull an al franken in four or five states that is their plan and during this chaos
[3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:52.320]  they are going to go for the street fight they are not they are not going to do this just in court
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:58.560]  they are they are lifting this to the crisis stage and they are they are assuming that
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:04.320]  americans are just eventually going to cry uncle you know everybody by now or that's watching this
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:11.840]  show should be fully familiar with the x kgb officer yuri bezmanov and i don't need to you
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:18.880]  know go into it but he he has explained in brilliant lectures that were taped by e edward griffin
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:27.360]  you know 30 years ago how the kgb first promotes demoralization which may take decades 15 20 years
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:35.280]  then a destabilization period then a crisis leading to a change of government and we are now
[3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:40.560]  in the end of the destabilization and the beginning of the crisis phase so when your friends and
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:46.560]  relatives tell you i just have no idea how this is happening it's so unexpected i never thought
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:52.000]  anything like this could happen in america you need to teach them about color revolutions
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:59.520]  and how this is a plan that's often used by our cia their kgb against you know third world countries
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:06.560]  to flip their governments now it's being used in our own country we even have former generals like
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:13.920]  stanley mccrystal working on disinformation campaigns which i guarantee you is how that
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:19.440]  trump called the sold the dead soldiers losers and suckers classic disinformation campaign
[3:15:20.160 --> 3:15:27.760]  and they always camouflage these as we're just defending against trumps disinformation
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:33.520]  we're at we have to put out the truth that's always the camouflage when they set up their own
[3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:41.040]  their own active measures division they just say it's self-defense but it's actually pure
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:48.480]  active measures now being used at home against americans and it's and to me it's pure treason now
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:56.960]  as we come closer to the election expect this violence to ramp up and escalate and people
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:03.360]  are very or are constantly asking what what's the trigger what's the go what's the signal
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:09.600]  when do we charge back when do we counterattack well i've got to tell you it's count it's actually
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:18.320]  counterproductive to meet antifa and blm which is the democrats new kkk or brown shirts or red
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:25.440]  guards it's counterproductive to meet them on the public square with your own shields and batons
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:32.560]  that is actually what antifa is attempting to get the right to do they want that's that's
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:39.040]  that's putting the the heat up under the pot to bring the destabilization to the crisis phase
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:46.720]  then at the end of the crisis you get antithesis then synthesis and a new and a new government
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:53.680]  which we predicated upon there will be no peace until antifa or whatever they're calling it later
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:17:00.560]  the progressives are put on the police department are are included in the the police department
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:06.080]  so when they talk about defunding the police they're not talking about getting rid of police
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:12.560]  they're talking about antifa becoming the police and there will be a synthesis phase
[3:17:12.560 --> 3:17:18.640]  where they'll say look the only way we can get peace back in this country is to have antifa
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:26.960]  a former antifa boss be on the police department commission this is coming but in order to get that
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:34.320]  pot really boiling they're going to increase the night attacks like we saw in Kenosha like we saw
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:40.560]  in in Minneapolis Portland every night for a hundred nights but instead of just attacking
[3:17:40.560 --> 3:17:45.440]  the government structures as they were in Portland night after night they're now taking it to the
[3:17:45.440 --> 3:17:51.920]  suburbs the way that we we saw BLM do it in Rochester New York attacking a restaurant
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:58.960]  then fanning into the neighborhoods saying you know no justice no sleep well the Kenosha style
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:08.800]  arson riots against businesses and and automobiles that's going to gradually move to targeted attacks
[3:18:08.800 --> 3:18:16.320]  against residential dwellings and if you if you can um roll that that security tape of a guy bringing
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:23.680]  in a Molotov cocktail the first one the black and white one imagine you're in your house and you've
[3:18:23.680 --> 3:18:31.040]  been somebody you know who's active on social media and this is what comes through your front door
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:39.520]  okay this is this is through your front window not lasers not fireworks on your front lawn the Molotov
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:45.920]  right through your window at 3 a.m that's coming so why am i talking about all this Molotov cocktail
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:53.600]  business when our side is looking for somebody to say what's the signal where do we counter
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:19:00.480]  attack we want to do something let's get a hundred trucks with trump flags and drive into antifa land
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:08.560]  let's uh let's meet antifa with the proud boys and smash our shields together they would love to see
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:16.080]  that erupt in gunfire the communists would that will be portrayed as the right-wing attacking
[3:19:16.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  peaceful demonstrators but there's one target out there this is the low-hanging fruit there's one
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:30.400]  target that nobody will defend and that is an arsonist who is in the commission of arson when a
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:36.080]  guy is holding the Molotov cocktail when when the store next door has been lit on fire and they're
[3:19:36.080 --> 3:19:42.320]  moving from the furniture store to the liquor store to the pharmacy with Molotovs those guys
[3:19:42.320 --> 3:19:50.160]  can and should be shot the police used to do that that used to be the police job nobody had a right
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:57.200]  to go around burning cars and businesses the police would shoot them that was how civilization
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:05.440]  was defended throughout all of history period that's why a shotgun was called a riot gun okay
[3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:11.120]  now the police for political reasons are told they can't do that they've got to just send social
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:16.720]  workers as buildings are being burned well let me tell you if it doesn't stop it's going to move
[3:20:16.720 --> 3:20:24.720]  from businesses and cars to homes this is going to happen and not only Molotovs but the the high
[3:20:24.720 --> 3:20:30.480]  altitude fireworks that you know explode thousands of feet in the air you throw that into a building
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:35.440]  it's an incendiary explosive device and we're going to talk about this on the other side
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:40.400]  and the way that we're going to fight back against this thing starting with the arsonists
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:51.200]  big tech is the global straight jacket of the new world order it is the enforcement system
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:55.520]  the surveillance system it's going to track everything you do everywhere you go everything
[3:20:55.520 --> 3:21:01.200]  you say everything you basically think and then reward or punish you for those behaviors and
[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:07.760]  they're not liberals that's a complete and total cover they are monsters that love authoritarianism
[3:21:07.760 --> 3:21:12.960]  and are building towards the post-human world their mission is destroying the indigenous communities
[3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:19.280]  annihilate small towns annihilate all human culture and consolidate us all isolate us all
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:25.760]  and then carry out our orderly extermination this is their public master plan the COVID-19
[3:21:25.760 --> 3:21:31.520]  is the cover for the rollout of this digital control system ladies and gentlemen it's only
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:36.080]  going to get worse from here when you see officials from apple google facebook twitter
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:41.600]  you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than hitler they want to murder you
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:48.640]  and your family you have been warned as of 54 days out the globalist child molesting
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:53.120]  devil worshipers know they're in trouble and they know trumps can win in landslides they're
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:56.880]  saying they're going to test the election to plunge the country in civil war and they're
[3:21:56.880 --> 3:22:03.040]  throwing hack attacks at info wars dirty tricks attempts to shut us down it's incredible that's

[3:22:49.280 --> 3:22:55.360]  true i don't say it to scare you a lot of people say man this show is dark well you've got to know
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:00.000]  you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it and if we just listen to the surface of what
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:05.760]  the nwo propagandists are saying they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public but
[3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:11.040]  if you just scratch the surface they're so arrogant they've all written to tell blueprints
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:16.560]  of this plan and more and more being honest about it because there comes a point where as
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:22.480]  david eich says they have to stop hiding it and start selling it so we're at the point of the
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:29.120]  emergence now and it's coming out in the open and some people under mass Stockholm syndrome are
[3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:34.560]  going to submit to any level of tyranny that others are going to fight this isn't like some old
[3:23:34.560 --> 3:23:40.480]  dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it be okay no this thing is post human
[3:23:40.480 --> 3:24:06.400]  and exterminism research what that is you're listening to the alex jones show okay when we
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:14.400]  uh when we left off we were talking about the perfect low-hanging fruit the communist revolutionary
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:23.680]  target that nobody is going to mourn or grieve this is this is not even a george floyd or uh
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:32.960]  or uh jacob blake or anybody like that somebody who is engaged in the act of preparing and throwing
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:41.600]  molotov cocktails can and should be shot go to youtube or bit shoot probably you tap youtube has
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:51.280]  more and just do a search for police officer or policemen you know set on fire by molotov cocktail
[3:24:51.280 --> 3:24:59.360]  and you will see some really horrible stuff when police have to be you know 20 feet from these
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:09.840]  these guys they are in molotov range and a molotov cocktail can change your life because that stuff
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:14.480]  burning on your back you know the it's it's kind of funny because the guy had it coming he was an
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:22.480]  antifa in portland and it was his legs but when you see police officers getting third degree burns
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:30.480]  you know they are on fire until they can be put out for enough time to if the if not kill them put
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:39.120]  them in pain and change their lives dramatically and horribly not to mention just using molotovs
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:45.600]  against property you know furniture stores the clock store and in uh you know in kenosha the
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:52.960]  100 year old camera store that is destroying people's lives things that they have built for
[3:25:52.960 --> 3:26:00.480]  their entire life so nobody is going to mourn if they're shot when we used to be civilized
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:09.120]  and there used to be ground rules for civilized behavior arsonists in the act were shot so what
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:16.320]  happens if you're in a democrat city democrat governor democrat marxist da and they just let
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:22.160]  these guys out night after night to escalate their operations you know throwing the high altitude
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:28.240]  fireworks as grenades for example which is like a almost like a white phosphorus grenade you know
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:35.200]  you've got magnesium and other burning metals that are stuck into your skin burning well these
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:41.760]  guys that are doing this if the police aren't around because the police have been told just let
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:47.760]  that antifa mob go you go back to rochester the night that they were attacking the restaurants
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:54.800]  they had to park you know maybe 50 to 100 cars at some nearby parking lot and assemble and march
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:27:01.040]  down there do you think that the police didn't know what was happening the police were told to avoid
[3:27:01.040 --> 3:27:10.000]  the area so this is a two-way a two-way street when the police are told to avoid an antifa riot
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:15.920]  to just let them go into a neighborhood because confronting them will lead to a bigger crisis
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:21.280]  and they're just crossing their fingers and hoping that these antifas will just march through
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:29.040]  make some noise and leave but what if they don't there's no police around at the first sign of
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:36.720]  anything being lit one car one abandoned business as far as i'm concerned the rule for the use of
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:43.600]  force the rules of engagement should be nobody gets the light molotov cocktails you know in my
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:51.040]  city in my county and if the police aren't around to stop it then we'll stop it now how do you how
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:56.960]  do you stop this matt you're just going to get arrested remember the police aren't around and
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  i'm not saying stand on your front porch under your front porch light holding your ar like the
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:11.280]  mcloskey's in st louis i'm talking about hearing something blocks away banging drums you know
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:18.480]  bull horns at three o'clock in the morning coming into the neighborhood as as soon as the first
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:25.360]  for the first molotov is lit as far as i'm concerned the entire mob is a legitimate target
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:32.080]  you know the antifa themselves have diagrams of how to work this where the the bomb throwers
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:38.880]  are are shielded by the outer ring of human shields so the guys with the fakers with the
[3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:44.640]  press and the medic all over their helmets they're on the outer ring against the police
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:52.720]  the molotov throwers are 10 people back behind them using them as human shields well if you're
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:58.640]  part of a team and your your role is to be a human shield for a molotov cocktail thrower
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:05.440]  then you have no right to expect that you will be treated any better than the molotov cocktail
[3:29:05.440 --> 3:29:11.680]  thrower you can see this the diagram that is up shows how they do this you know they've got their
[3:29:11.680 --> 3:29:17.440]  umbrella people their medics this is carefully calculated they have people driving along passing
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:23.120]  out the high power fireworks and and they use cutouts so the guy that throws the firework
[3:29:23.120 --> 3:29:27.840]  doesn't even know what it is he's just going to light it and throw it and he can't point if he
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:33.200]  even if he has stopped and questioned all he can say is some guy in a van handed it to us
[3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:40.880]  that's all he can say it's very carefully thought out we are up against an evil communist
[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:47.520]  national militia some of the same characters from portland have been traveling to canosha
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:54.400]  to chicago to washington dc during the convention it's the same characters i don't know if and
[3:29:54.400 --> 3:29:59.920]  when the department of justice is ever gonna actually arrest the leadership they should
[3:29:59.920 --> 3:30:07.600]  before the election but if they don't and the go code as far as i'm concerned in your neighborhood
[3:30:07.600 --> 3:30:13.680]  i'm not saying travel out of state pursuing antifa but in in your zip code in your barrio
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:21.920]  when you hear the antifa is coming and the first the first item is lit on fire it can be a car
[3:30:21.920 --> 3:30:28.640]  it can be an abandoned gas station it doesn't matter there is nothing separating the mob then
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:35.040]  from throwing the molotov cocktail through your front bedroom window nothing this is like saying
[3:30:35.040 --> 3:30:41.360]  well you know the sniper is only shooting over there so i don't have a re i don't have any
[3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:46.720]  justification in shooting the sniper he hasn't shot in my direction yet yes when a sniper is
[3:30:46.720 --> 3:30:52.240]  up on a building shooting over toward the freeway you do have the right to shoot the sniper when
[3:30:52.240 --> 3:30:59.280]  people are lighting molotov cocktails they have given up their civil rights there's no civil right
[3:30:59.280 --> 3:31:07.120]  to burn loot and murder none and and in all previous eras this was completely understood
[3:31:07.120 --> 3:31:14.000]  this is this has been a a negative consequence of of phenomenon like the uh the less than
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:21.840]  lethal munitions tasers rubber bullets it used to be say up and through the 50s and 60s police
[3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:27.760]  actually had a height limit in city police you had to be a big dude five ten or taller in general
[3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:33.920]  you had a six shooter no personal radio right you had to like go down a block and call in a
[3:31:33.920 --> 3:31:40.720]  police box you had a six shooter and you had an hickory baton that was it you were expected to
[3:31:40.720 --> 3:31:47.280]  go into a bar room brawl and if they didn't obey you as as a as a police officer you were
[3:31:47.280 --> 3:31:54.240]  justified in just busting heads period the six shooter was the last thought that would be like
[3:31:54.240 --> 3:32:01.200]  a bank robber running out of a bank otherwise you were expected to cause mayhem with that truncheon
[3:32:01.200 --> 3:32:07.360]  and you were justified in doing it now you need social workers you need to try to wrestle a guy
[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:12.320]  down with five cops that aren't going to actually hurt him and then you see what happened like in
[3:32:12.320 --> 3:32:18.560]  atlanta you know where there's a brawl the guy's been tasered he's running the adrenaline is flowing
[3:32:18.560 --> 3:32:26.240]  then there's gunshots or in canosha where the the suspect is is resisting arrest fighting
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:34.080]  actively may or may not have had a knife brawling with the cops in previous day eras there wasn't
[3:32:34.080 --> 3:32:41.360]  this multi-step escalation process therefore people knew if the cops say stop and you don't stop
[3:32:41.360 --> 3:32:47.280]  you're going to get a hickory club to the head or a bullet that's it we don't mess around now
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:52.720]  it's got to be social workers in the 10-step process with body cameras it'll be reviewed by
[3:32:52.720 --> 3:32:59.520]  everybody the police may end up going to jail for it and what is the result the police say forget
[3:32:59.520 --> 3:33:05.360]  it i won't get involved if if antifa is marching through your neighborhood i just don't want to
[3:33:05.360 --> 3:33:12.160]  be there i'm just going to to park around back of the donut shop and wait till the noise dies down
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:20.080]  what that means what that means people is it's up to us if the police can't do their job or won't
[3:33:20.080 --> 3:33:27.600]  do their job as men as honorable people then it's up to us to defend our neighborhoods you know there
[3:33:27.600 --> 3:33:33.920]  was a second amendment before there were police and there is still a second amendment after the
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:47.040]  police run away or are defunded and abandoned ever wondered why big tech axon unison to create
[3:33:47.040 --> 3:33:53.680]  monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human love to censor people love to cover up for corrupt
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:58.720]  authoritarian regimes and dictatorships well it's very simple the first computers ever created were
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:03.920]  created by thomas watch the founder and owner of ibm to carry out eugenics and they helped run the
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.640]  death camps in nazi germany that's what the tattoos were on the slaves arms to decide who
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:13.920]  lived and who died so from the beginning it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:18.400]  and making humans obsolete the same people brought us baby formula it doesn't have enough
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:23.520]  protein fat in it to make your child's brain small the same people said put babies in cribs
[3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:29.200]  separate from their mothers the lower IQs about 20 points on average as well these are hardcore eugenics
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:35.360]  survival of the fittest social Darwinists grow up world admit the truth with being soft as much
[3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:40.880]  letting these globalists run your lives they are your mortal enemies they want you dead do you
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:48.400]  understand that the clock is ticking on the once free world and the free press is under attack
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:54.880]  more than ever i now see videos 10 or 15 times a day without even trying to find them of press
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:34:59.600]  being arrested in the united states press being arrested in Canada the uk europe australia new
[3:34:59.600 --> 3:35:05.760]  zealand and it's always the so-called liberal left the defenders of speech doing it they are
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:12.000]  the authoritarians they work for the chai con globalist combine and they are working around the
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:17.440]  clock to silence info wars just as we were the group they started with three years ago
[3:35:17.440 --> 3:35:22.640]  they test out everything new on us and a lot of what i can't get into on air at this point

[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:19.680]  maybe i'll wake a bunch of people up and i can kind of recede into the background because fighting
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:24.240]  this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but now with the evil so out in the open and
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:27.840]  everything we've said being vindicated i never questioned what i was saying because i knew it
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:32.400]  was true but i i did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out well now we know
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:36.640]  they're gonna carry it out and then some so we gotta fight and i just really appreciate you and

[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:52.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:38:01.360]  you
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:12.560]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:23.920]  i am i have a little bit more to say about uh defending your own neighborhood not only your
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:30.000]  immediate subdivision but you know your your larger neighborhood from these uh these communist
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:37.200]  revolutionaries because that's what they are you know blm and i i rarely name them because naming
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:44.640]  them is actually uh cooperating with their propaganda their agit prop they name themselves
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:52.480]  black lives matter as camouflage and as a psychological shield same thing with anti fascist
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:59.680]  these are fascist communist organizations they name themselves that purely as a shield
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:08.560]  i just call them abr antifa blm revcom that's who they are everybody should understand this
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:16.240]  this didn't come out of of nowhere this is a very carefully and deliberately set plan we're now
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:21.200]  coming to the culmination it's like we've been cranking up the roller coaster click click click
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:26.640]  click click now we're at the top you think it's been crazy so far we're just at the top of the
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:33.360]  roller coaster now folks this is the end of destabilization that's the catapult being wound
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:40.640]  up crisis is the catapult released and that's what's going to happen between now and the election
[3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:49.120]  and between the election and and uh january 20th uh inauguration day the democrats are very upfront
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:55.920]  talking about this i call it operation red mirage again they couch up they couch their own
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:04.000]  active measures in self-defense like a mirror image as camouflage don't be fooled by it the plan is
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:10.160]  trump will probably win the electoral college on election night because you know the old
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:16.400]  conservatives they like to go to the actual poll the modern the modern hip hip kids they want to
[3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:23.360]  mail it in which is just you know bs they're just they just need to know after november 3rd
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:30.640]  3rd how many fake mail-in ballots do they need to al franken a half you know four or five swing
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:38.080]  states if they need 50 000 in florida they'll find 60 000 if they need 20 000 in pennsylvania
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:46.560]  they'll find 30 000 that is the plan now republicans will be saying forget it and losing their minds
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:54.000]  but part of the plan is also literally taking it to the streets they're going to with full cooperation
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:00.880]  by the mainstream media they're going to to say trump and the evil republicans are trying to
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:08.160]  disenfranchise good progressive americans he refuses to count those mail-in ballots you know
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:14.880]  that we just printed yesterday and um you mass produced he refuses to count them he's disenfranchising
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:23.120]  us therefore our democracy is finished therefore we are justified in mass producing the molotov
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:29.840]  cocktails we're going to see much more than just marches into restaurants we're going to see the
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:37.760]  tactics escalated you know to the war wagon kind of like the um uh somali troop carrier with people
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:44.000]  fanning out with molotov cocktails we are going to see that level of violence you know immediately
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:50.720]  before the election and between the election and inauguration the plan by the democrats who are
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:59.600]  fully synthesized at this point with antifa and blm the plan is to deny trump any chance
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:05.840]  of staying in office after january 20th even if they have to burn this country to the ground
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:13.280]  as long as they can do it with the media blaming it on conservatives you know for not counting those
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:20.400]  bogus mail-in votes they are going to do anything required this is why they're even talking about
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:29.280]  these disloyal generals like madison kelly being part of a coup plan or stanley mccrystal working
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:39.600]  for an active measures cia style disinformation campaign where they make up a story like oh
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:47.120]  trump called the war dead of world war one losers and suckers you make up the story this is like
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:53.440]  cia 101 this is like you know being running a banana republic against some el presidente
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:43:02.000]  we want out and now these disloyal trick treasonous generals are doing it in their own country against
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:09.840]  their own duly elected president so they roll out a fake story plant it in a in a in all their media
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:15.040]  and then say oh it's confirmed it's just confirmed well they're still anonymous yeah
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:20.880]  but it's confirmed and then you start making ads about it the lie just repeats and repeats and
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:27.360]  repeats in a loop and we're going to see this again and again up until the till election day
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:34.720]  that's just stanley mccrystal and other disloyal traitorous former officers working against the
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:41.680]  duly elected president now after the election when the democrats say oh those republicans trump
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:47.120]  they're refusing to count the mail-in ballots that were mass producing in the back room they're
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:54.160]  going to hopeful they think that they're going to get the military to then step in to quell these
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:44:01.120]  street fights between the conservatives and the and the progressives because this is the plan
[3:44:01.120 --> 3:44:07.840]  to take it to a street fight you need to go from destable demoralization that was from the 60s
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:17.200]  through you know recently destabilization that's 2020 to crisis that's the roller coaster crisis
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:24.720]  now crisis street fighting that's so bad that the power grid is threatened people can't get
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:33.040]  to work and then the plan is who can stop that only the military but the military will not answer
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:38.720]  to donald trump we've already seen that with the chairman of the joint chief of staff and
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:46.880]  secretary of defense being extremely disloyal to the president and saying no if you try to
[3:44:46.880 --> 3:44:52.000]  send the 82nd airborne to portland we'll just deny it we just won't won't permit it they wouldn't
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:57.760]  even allow national guard to guard the white house with weapons they kept them miles away useless
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:45:05.280]  you know while the white house is being pelted with bricks these disloyal generals and it's going
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:11.520]  to get worse and worse so we need to be prepared for this because going into something with your
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:18.000]  eyes wide open is always better than being blindsided when you think that it can't get worse
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:24.320]  and suddenly it goes up in order of magnitude it's better to know it that's why i use the catapult
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:31.600]  and the the roller coaster analogy i hear all the time what next there's never been a year like this
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:36.560]  i can't take it anymore yeah you're just you haven't seen anything you're just on top of
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:41.600]  the roller coaster it's about to go you know ballistic gravitational out of your control
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:46.400]  and you've got to be able to hang on and hang tight because it's going to get nuts
[3:45:47.280 --> 3:45:54.720]  and the and like i said before you can't just wait to defend your house your little stick built
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:46:01.440]  house in the subdivision is not defensible and it's not enough to say i'll wait till they're on my
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:08.000]  lawn would you let them burn your local pharmacy yeah would you let them burn your supermarket
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:11.840]  you're going to wait for them to come down your actual street before you stop them
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:16.960]  so okay matt well you're you're talking about vigilantism you're talking about
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:25.920]  things that'll get you arrested look nobody will have pity for an arsonist who is shot
[3:46:25.920 --> 3:46:32.240]  this is where i'm saying there is there is a piece of low-hanging fruit that you can grab
[3:46:32.800 --> 3:46:38.080]  just like the the portland murderer and you everybody here should have seen that analysis
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:44.640]  already of that hit team following uh the j danielson in portland it was a hit team it was at least
[3:46:44.640 --> 3:46:51.040]  a 10-man hit team following him and assassinating him when the trigger man was killed did anybody
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:57.920]  weep for him did anybody have a protest in his honor maybe some antifa radicals saying you know
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:04.480]  rest in peace you good old killer but did any americans have a riot for that guy awake no
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:11.600]  will anybody care how about the guy in portland the hotfoot mr burning man he was made fun of
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:18.080]  nobody had any sympathy for him and he didn't even throw the Molotov cocktail he was just out in front
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:25.840]  of the human shields he was his position was cop taunter so he was actually ahead of the shield line
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:33.840]  and the weak lame arm uh bomb thrower couldn't get to the police to light a cop on fire which
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:39.920]  was his goal instead he had an own goal and let his own guy on fire did anybody care about him
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:49.600]  has anybody been you know sending him flowers at the hospital hell no so once a riot escalates to fire
[3:47:50.320 --> 3:47:57.120]  as far as i'm concerned the the the Molotov cocktail the incendiary incendiary thrower
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:03.680]  and anybody around him is a legitimate target and if i was just thinking of a good weapon i would
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:09.840]  probably say just like days of old the riot shotgun is a beautiful thing about a shotgun is
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:18.240]  you can use dove shot which is tiny little pellets up to turkey shot which are like bbs up to buck
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:28.080]  shot and fired at the ground turkey shot is like a scythe at knee level if you want to deter Molotov
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:36.320]  cocktail throwers nobody is going to have any pity for them
