[00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:17.235]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:22.859]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.780]  It's Thursday, September 10th.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.481]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.462]  53 days out.
[00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.384]  And look at these mainstream headlines.
[00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:38.408]  Mad Dog Madness Discusses Secret Military Coup Against President Trump While Serving in His White House.
[00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.619]  Plot to overthrow U.S.
[00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:45.461]  government.
[00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:50.966]  Who told you about that back at the time and who fingered Mattis specifically?
[00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.869]  Ann McMaster and Fiona Hill.
[00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:02.816]  She was before Congress last year and she went on 60 Minutes and said, I don't even know what a globalist is.
[00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:06.440]  She headed the most powerful Soros Foundation
[00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:17.888]  And she was on the board of some of his other foundations, and she's the main writer at TheGlobalist.com.
[00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:24.232]  That's like Batman saying his uniform isn't black.
[00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:26.914]  It's like Superman saying he doesn't have an ass on his chest.
[00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.937]  But this is their level of gaslighting.
[00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:31.137]  Like Nadler.
[00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:32.578]  And there's no such thing as Antifa.
[00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:41.605]  My wife was even talking to some of her family that are liberals, and she's like, what do you think of Antifa attacking?
[00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:45.387]  And they go, oh, that doesn't exist!
[00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.428]  Because the news said so!
[00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:56.813]  It's like saying, you know, the American flag was designed by Betsy Ross in 1776, and it's red, white, and blue.
[00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:58.954]  Betsy Ross, George Washington.
[00:01:58.954 --> 00:01:59.714]  And people go, no, it's not.
[00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:02.516]  It's green, yellow, and black.
[00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:03.136]  You go, no, it's not.
[00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.036]  They go, yes, it is.
[00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:04.737]  CNN says so.
[00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:08.150]  Cue the Twilight Zone music.
[00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.811]  So, we've been aware of this coup.
[00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.294]  Oh, let me tell you, I've been aware of it.
[00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:22.864]  I have really gotten to enjoy the FBI and the CIA and all of these different state agencies harassing me and trying to destroy us and trying to destroy my family.
[00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:29.571]  But, you know, I've signed on for this, so I understand that these are illegitimate rogue groups and that I believe America will wake up and get rid of them.
[00:02:31.394 --> 00:02:34.195]  Woodward's book is a lot of lies and a lot of stuff that's true.
[00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:38.315]  I know it's true, I know it isn't because I've studied the whole thing.
[00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:41.576]  And he's saying Mattis wanted to coup because Mattis is a good guy.
[00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:45.417]  This is selling the idea of a coup 53 days out.
[00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:47.337]  That we told you they're going to try.
[00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:50.097]  We told you they're canvassing behind the scenes.
[00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:52.198]  So this is coming out in the open to make it look legitimate.
[00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:57.979]  So he mixes a bunch of lies in with the fact that Mattis met with
[00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:09.527]  Republicans and Democrats overseas and conspired to have a 25th Amendment coup d'etat against El Presidente.
[00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:11.549]  Well, that didn't happen, but they're trying again.
[00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.675]  Now, we now know, and it's in his book, the reason I know it's accurate, in 2017, and then again in 2018, right before he left,
[00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:31.126]  They would go on CNN, all these different CIA, FBI, Globalist, Phil Mudd, Clapper, Brennan, and they'd say, oh, he'll be gone by December.
[00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:37.228]  And Blitzer, Wolf Blitzer would say, you mean impeachment?
[00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:37.509]  25th Amendment?
[00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.789]  They go, no, something else.
[00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.091]  And Blitzer, like, why are you saying that on TV?
[00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:49.314]  They were saying it so their stay-behind networks in the government would believe it was legitimate and would believe they were about to take out a Russian agent.
[00:03:53.871 --> 00:04:06.974]  So the first thing I did reading where Woodward said this happened was go back and look at the dates and it's indeed when they were, it was about a month before the two times they came out and put it out in the news as a trial balloon.
[00:04:06.974 --> 00:04:08.955]  Hey, the government's going to kill the president.
[00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:10.075]  Hey, we're going to remove him.
[00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:14.236]  Hey, we're going to drug him and arrest him.
[00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:18.917]  And we knew at the time that they were trying to spike his food with some type of, uh,
[00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:29.052]  Chemical that would make him have a hallucination or pass out and then by the time they got into the hospital Trump would never make it out of there alive or in a coma.
[00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:36.064]  So that's the type of people we're dealing with.
[00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:37.725]  Mattis is a wimp.
[00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:39.406]  Mattis can't tie his shoelaces.
[00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:41.287]  He couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:04:41.287 --> 00:04:53.754]  He's built up as this tough guy because he's an empty, no one piece of un-American garbage in a coup plot against the President with John McCain, Obama, and Hillary, and all of them will pay.
[00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:56.216]  Mad Dog, he's a little shrunken rat.
[00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.437]  He's a disgrace to America and the Marine Corps.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.905]  You've always had a pledge from me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human, temporal truth can get.
[00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:18.313]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored, darkly, kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive, so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:21.376]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:26.480]  So, when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.621]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.301]  And when I tell you that this country and the world is under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that.
[00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.024]  You can look out the window.
[00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:38.187]  You can look into your own family.
[00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:38.968]  You can turn on the news.
[00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:42.433]  But you've got this commitment.
[00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:44.455]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:46.116]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:52.463]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and that only happens when you support what you've been doing.
[00:05:52.463 --> 00:05:53.404]  So again, I thank you.
[00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:59.010]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.871]  Again, I thank you all.
[00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:13.191]  Total.
[00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.393]  Absolute.
[00:06:15.393 --> 00:06:16.934]  Complete.
[00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:18.095]  Vindication.
[00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.897]  Yet again.
[00:06:19.897 --> 00:06:21.698]  It is Thursday, September 10th, the year of 2020.
[00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:29.666]  We are 53 days out from the deep state, loveless, shycom, Hollywood, pedophile, devil worshipper backed
[00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:35.814]  Axis of Evil attempting to throw the election into question when it's going to be a landslide.
[00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:38.995]  All the internal numbers, the external numbers show for President Trump.
[00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:47.120]  They will then use that crisis with big tech ganged up on America with our enemies to try to plunge us into a hot civil war.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.363]  But they have failed and they have failed again and they will fail again if we take action and if we speak up.
[00:06:54.861 --> 00:07:02.066]  So don't panic, but get very, very active and very, very aggressive like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:09.792]  And that's why you've seen all the Democrats come out and say, this is like your life depends on it.
[00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:13.855]  You got to get rid of Trump because they're painted into a corner.
[00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:18.998]  They're rats that don't have a sinking ship to even escape from.
[00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:20.079]  They don't know what to do.
[00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.880]  They're going down.
[00:07:22.847 --> 00:07:24.889]  So they want to take America down with them.
[00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.953]  Here are the headlines at Infowars.com, Newswars.com, but you can also just find this in the Associated Press or Reuters.
[00:07:30.953 --> 00:07:38.239]  Just type in to the search engine, General Mattis plot to overthrow the U.S.
[00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:44.163]  government or General Mattis coup plot against President Trump.
[00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:50.428]  Isn't that just absolutely special?
[00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.429]  Let's go over this right now.
[00:07:53.194 --> 00:08:02.356]  New book reveals General Mad Dog Manus discussed secret military coup against President Trump while serving in his White House.
[00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.117]  And so did the members of the Justice Department with them as well.
[00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:16.099]  And then they would all rule over America and put someone in weak like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that their plutocracy of plutocrats would control.
[00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:30.369]  It was reported that General Mad Dog Mattis last night discussed a likely coup with fellow government officials back when he was working for President Trump.
[00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:40.737]  In the book released by Watergate-related Bob Woodward, Mattis reportedly did the following trending exclusive video.
[00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.713]  Another article, 15 armed agents raid another one of the folks trying to build the wall.
[00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:47.054]  That's the story we're going to get to.
[00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:52.717]  Mattis quietly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern for the nation.
[00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:59.682]  So this is all pitched by Bob Woodward of Oats Needed.
[00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:05.246]  These were heroes that just had this on their conscience and just knew what they had to do.
[00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:21.679]  So all of Woodward's book is a lie, we'll go over that, except for the fact that they were plotting a coup, which is totally illegal and criminal, but now they're lionizing it because they're preparing another one when Trump doesn't accept the fraudulent results when they try to steal the election.
[00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:30.295]  Mattis quietly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern for the nation's fate under Trump's command.
[00:09:30.295 --> 00:09:37.377]  And according to Woodward, told Coates, the head of national intelligence, that there may come a time when we have to take collective action.
[00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:41.618]  Since Trump's dangerous, he's unfit, and more.
[00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:46.940]  And it goes on from there.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.580]  Think about that.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.502]  We'll get more into all of this here today.
[00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.679]  It was a consortium of Republican and Democrat leaders.
[00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.141]  They also met secretly in Europe.
[00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.102]  General Mattis plotted a Democratic Party to overthrow U.S.
[00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:06.264]  government, and it's called Deep State Dictatorship.
[00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:09.065]  That's the big article on live feed on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:10.105]  Here's one on the Zero Hedge.
[00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:15.148]  Woodward Book exposes General James Mattis' plot to overthrow the U.S.
[00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:15.508]  government.
[00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:19.410]  But again, it's something that the Lord told him to do.
[00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.947]  Even though he doesn't even really believe in God, isn't a Christian if you read his deeper writings.
[00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:27.590]  He's an occultist, anti-American piece of garbage.
[00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:42.821]  According to a pre-released excerpt from the Washington Post, Bob Woodward writes about a discussion between General James Mattis, known as the Ultimate Wimp, and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats about a plot to overthrow the elected government of the United States.
[00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:49.986]  Mattis quietly went to Washington National Cathedral to pray about his concern for the nation's fate under Trump command, and according to Woodward, told Coats,
[00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:56.621]  There may come a time when we have to take collective action since Trump is dangerous and he's unfit.
[00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:00.002]  What do you call a conversation between the Defense Secretary and the head of the U.S.
[00:11:00.002 --> 00:11:04.564]  intelligence apparatus where they are talking about collective action to remove an elected president?
[00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:06.545]  That's called sedition.
[00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:11.568]  A seditious conspiracy punishable by execution, I should add, under the Constitution.
[00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:27.475]  As alarming as it sounds on the face, this actually aligns with our own previous research into key military leadership and Joint Chiefs of Staff and the corrupt intent to overthrow an elected government using COG that Nancy Pelosi is talking about on TV, saying she will be in command now.
[00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:35.778]  She said, I met with the military last week, this is five weeks ago, cue that up guys, she said, I met with the military last week and
[00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.732]  I'm gonna take over, I'm second in command.
[00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.874]  Meaning get rid of the Vice President and everything.
[00:11:41.874 --> 00:11:44.337]  And we will fumigate him out of the White House one way or another.
[00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:47.500]  No matter if he leaves, we'll have another inauguration, another location.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.724]  They've got it all set up now where they won't just kill him or drug him.
[00:11:52.724 --> 00:11:59.931]  They'll just say he didn't win and then they go to Colorado or whatever and have their coronation or LA.
[00:11:59.931 --> 00:12:00.792]  Not their inauguration.
[00:12:02.608 --> 00:12:12.916]  As alarming as it sounds on its face, this actually aligns with our previous research and ours too into key military leadership, the Joint Chiefs, and their corrupt intent to overthrow the elected government.
[00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:22.684]  Remember when we noted this very issue as Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vidman compromised his position, yet not removed by his command structure within the Pentagon.
[00:12:24.022 --> 00:12:35.027]  That's why Trump came out last week and he said, and this week, he said, the troops love me, the soldiers love me, but a lot of the brass don't because they're part of this military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us of.
[00:12:35.027 --> 00:12:37.908]  That's such an American tradition.
[00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:45.271]  George Washington warned of a military getting too much power, but that's just George Washington and General Eisenhower.
[00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:49.793]  You know, they were good guys, but when Trump says it, he's bad.
[00:12:49.793 --> 00:12:52.254]  And now we know why Trump said, hey, you may not see me for a while.
[00:12:53.814 --> 00:13:00.958]  Because the deep state's angry at me, not letting us have one-sided deals with China, and they're trying to overthrow the government right now.
[00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.719]  I need your help, we're in trouble.
[00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:06.862]  That's Trump firing the bat signal.
[00:13:06.862 --> 00:13:15.307]  That's not, oh everything's fine, we're totally winning, don't get involved, don't get informed, Durham's gonna handle it all, Hillary secretly arrested in 2017.
[00:13:15.307 --> 00:13:16.748]  None of that happened.
[00:13:16.748 --> 00:13:19.770]  This is neck and neck.
[00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.531]  We've got more on Durham today.
[00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:23.552]  We'll be getting into some of that.
[00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:31.073]  The Attorney General says there might be more indictments.
[00:13:31.073 --> 00:13:32.894]  I wouldn't hold your breath.
[00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:35.916]  This is very serious and we'll discuss what this means.
[00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.517]  Because we already all knew this.
[00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.558]  But now we know more details.
[00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:43.540]  But it was all transparent because they were getting everybody ready and preparing the public.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.222]  They were PRing it.
[00:13:46.222 --> 00:13:46.902]  We're going to go to break.
[00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:48.443]  I'm going to come back and get into all this.
[00:13:48.443 --> 00:13:49.824]  The latest COVID news.
[00:13:49.824 --> 00:13:52.345]  The latest lockdown news and how we fight back against it.
[00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:53.386]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:54.921 --> 00:14:03.369]  If you tell other folks to tune in and tell them to tell others to tune in, like, hey, be part of the Second American Revolution, the truth is at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:04.850]  Ban.video.
[00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.011]  2020ElectionCenter.com.
[00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.313]  That URL isn't banned yet.
[00:14:08.313 --> 00:14:10.055]  NewsWars.com.
[00:14:10.055 --> 00:14:15.199]  And if you tell people about the live feeds, about the local radio stations you're listening to, that station has a stream.
[00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:15.840]  Share that link.
[00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:26.251]  And tell others, hey, here's the forbidden link, share this, we're going to save the republic, but you've got to recruit them into it, then it causes the chain reaction.
[00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:30.092]  Our regular show has up to 3 million real people a day that come and listen to it.
[00:14:30.092 --> 00:14:31.552]  Most shows exaggerate their numbers.
[00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:33.332]  Ours is about 3 million.
[00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:38.713]  When we do special shows, sometimes a million tune in, usually about 300,000 that evening.
[00:14:38.713 --> 00:14:40.594]  When you get excited, it's millions.
[00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:41.634]  So, tonight,
[00:14:42.602 --> 00:14:52.385]  There's going to be the special show that we've been doing for the election, Election Countdown, five nights a week, seven to nine, only six minutes of breaks every hour.
[00:14:52.385 --> 00:15:00.528]  And it is great for your stations to pick it up and great for you to share with everybody saying, hey, here's real election coverage that the system doesn't want you to get.
[00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:04.409]  There is so much more we're going to be covering as well.
[00:15:04.409 --> 00:15:10.691]  Another issue I'm going to cover in the last segment of this hour, another excellent ZeroHedge.com article, what possible
[00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:19.438]  Disruption is coming that requires China to start mass stockpiling of all possible commodities.
[00:15:19.438 --> 00:15:23.639]  They've already broken the worldwide supply chain to a great extent.
[00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.600]  And it's already causing mass starvation in the third world.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.800]  It's already causing food prices to go up here.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:35.542]  And they plan to lock things down again this winter, causing all the flu deaths and regular deaths from other things, calling it COVID-19.
[00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:38.983]  And they're going to try to have another big lockdown that will guarantee a mega depression.
[00:15:38.983 --> 00:15:40.264]  And so China is buckling
[00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:46.473]  And battening down the hatches for the storm they're helping create against America.
[00:15:46.473 --> 00:15:52.156]  And so that's why they're doing all this because this is economic 21st century war and our Republic is fighting for its life.
[00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:54.076]  That's why all of you should go to mfowarstore.com.
[00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:58.178]  Get your storable food before the big surge.
[00:15:58.178 --> 00:16:02.720]  Introducing MFOWARS LIFE Pure Turmeric Extract.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.261]  This is taken under the tongue.
[00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:06.402]  It is pure turmeric.
[00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:16.645]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[00:16:16.645 --> 00:16:22.491]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:24.654]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[00:16:25.094 --> 00:16:28.335]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[00:16:28.335 --> 00:16:30.175]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:32.275]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[00:16:32.275 --> 00:16:34.476]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.836]  Some like bodies better.
[00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:39.957]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:41.157]  And they fund the InfoWare.
[00:16:41.157 --> 00:16:45.758]  So get our new Liquid Timuric Extract exclusively at InfoWareStore.com today.

[00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:58.822]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:58.822 --> 00:17:02.023]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[00:17:02.023 --> 00:17:13.006]  That's because it was completely scripted, and we even know the names of the United Nations, Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates, and John Hopkins documents.
[00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:15.607]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.516]  And it's designed to freeze civilization and have a post-Renaissance...
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:31.886]  Stagnation or New Dark Age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:34.028]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[00:17:34.028 --> 00:17:38.111]  As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:40.613]  Every I dotted, every T crossed.
[00:17:40.613 --> 00:17:45.337]  A total societal vertical integration, takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[00:17:45.337 --> 00:17:49.680]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cut about 35% in the last eight months.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.682]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:55.984]  Everyone is being forced out of their system to post human robot takeover.
[00:17:55.984 --> 00:18:00.606]  You're being made obsolete.
[00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:03.267]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:33.771]  Well, the former head of the National Security Agency joined the board of Amazon.com.
[00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:37.596]  Alexa, what is the world saying?
[00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:42.604]  Of course, Amazon is a technological takeover of everything.
[00:18:44.226 --> 00:19:00.419]  Robots replacing humans, driverless cars, drones delivering food, shutting down all other businesses, consolidating the economy as everybody else goes bankrupt and poor, with Alexa pods monitoring you inside your house and tracking everything you do for social credit score control.
[00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:08.826]  It's all the big five tech companies competing with each other for global domination in the post-human world.
[00:19:08.826 --> 00:19:10.408]  And then meanwhile you've got all these snakes
[00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:36.025]  Like Mattis and McMaster and the rest of them who were chosen from the military and chosen from college because they were sent to globalist courses to believe that they were going to graduate out of the American system into the global government system that the Clintons and others control through their foundations.
[00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:50.814]  Whether it's Tony Blair or Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, they simply graduate on the multinational systems and the corporate governing systems that they've set up above the nation state.
[00:19:50.814 --> 00:20:05.377]  And they are authoritarian, they are autocratic, they are dictatorial, they are centralized, they are vertically integrated, they are anti-human, they are disconnected, they are bloodthirsty from their very core position and proud of it.
[00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:13.012]  And they give you this neoliberal love the black people, love the brown people while they run slave camps all over the world.
[00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:22.942]  While the UN goes in and just will murder whole giant villages of thousands in Africa and in Asia and Burma and admit they did it and say, well, they wouldn't leave the land.
[00:20:22.942 --> 00:20:25.385]  We're setting it aside for a carbon sink.
[00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:28.929]  It's just a footnote.
[00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:31.711]  Yeah, they mowed them down with helicopters and tanks.
[00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:32.591]  Big deal.
[00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:34.512]  Okay, the Clintons oversaw the U.N.
[00:20:34.512 --> 00:20:36.513]  killing 900,000 Rwandans.
[00:20:36.513 --> 00:20:36.973]  Big deal.
[00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:39.154]  We need the land.
[00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:41.876]  But then, oh, George Floyd.
[00:20:41.876 --> 00:20:43.236]  And, oh, the local police are bad.
[00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:44.537]  Let's get rid of them with a U.N.
[00:20:44.537 --> 00:20:48.299]  initiative called Strong Cities that takes over.
[00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:51.621]  And if you don't address this as a world government takeover, you can't beat it.
[00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:52.621]  But that's what it is.
[00:20:52.621 --> 00:20:53.462]  And now the U.N.
[00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:53.922]  dictates
[00:20:55.011 --> 00:21:06.274]  What medical treatments, medical doctors can have, and even if state law says a doctor can give you hydroxychloroquine, the UN says, no you can't, and those doctors get in trouble.
[00:21:06.274 --> 00:21:08.355]  But it's had people really wake up.
[00:21:08.355 --> 00:21:15.177]  Every doctor I run into, every doctor I hear about that friends and family talk to, you see doctors everywhere coming public and saying, this is all a fraud.
[00:21:15.177 --> 00:21:20.418]  First they said it was 25 times stronger than it was, and then they downgraded it 10 times, and then 10 times, and then 10 times.
[00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:22.799]  Till now it's hundreds of times weaker than the flu.
[00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:30.653]  Unless you have a total vitamin and mineral deficiency and then any virus can kill you.
[00:21:30.653 --> 00:21:33.796]  But it is man-made so Bill Gates can own it and control it.
[00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:47.550]  And then what is it like now to sit here and watch big tech heads in Congress a month ago say, we don't allow speech if the UN doesn't authorize it.
[00:21:48.848 --> 00:22:06.351]  And under Article 30 and Article 31 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, they say you have the right for us to keep you safe by taking your rights away and the other 29 rights they say don't exist when the United Nations decides they don't.
[00:22:06.351 --> 00:22:08.171]  It's not fine print.
[00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:12.512]  It's how the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights ends.
[00:22:12.512 --> 00:22:16.133]  That you have no right, you have no speech, no right to defend yourself,
[00:22:18.328 --> 00:22:31.098]  Children have a right to be taken out of their homes, to be protected, and now, in the U.S., in every major blue area, in Canada, in the leftist areas, in Australia and Europe, they're coming and taking the children.
[00:22:31.098 --> 00:22:32.799]  Because they wouldn't be brought in for testing.
[00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.160]  They're not even sick.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.282]  Now you gotta come in for the testing and the contact tracing.
[00:22:41.687 --> 00:22:42.788]  Now there's Article 30.
[00:22:42.788 --> 00:23:00.315]  Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying that any state, group, or person or any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth therein.
[00:23:00.315 --> 00:23:05.598]  And then they can argue that they can take your rights away, you see, in the name of guarding the rights.
[00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:08.496]  And everyone has duties, they say.
[00:23:08.496 --> 00:23:10.897]  Guys, print that for me.
[00:23:10.897 --> 00:23:15.119]  In Article 30, you have duties to the UN.
[00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:17.060]  You're a slave.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:33.688]  Folks might want to go read that, but see, boom, you wake up, AI's surveilling you, AI's controlling you, medical doctors can't talk about what the facts are, everyone's controlled, and now they're coming to take you to a secret facility like they just announced in Canada.
[00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:43.876]  We're taking you to a secret facility because you didn't do what they told you.
[00:23:43.876 --> 00:23:55.206]  Meanwhile, everybody's focused in on the show Cuties, which I bit my lip and watched some of the boil downs.
[00:23:55.206 --> 00:23:56.026]  It's absolutely
[00:23:57.068 --> 00:24:05.285]  Sexualization of little girls and pedophilic behavior and teaching little girls to be aggressive, crazy, you know, the equivalent of like 35-year-old veteran hookers.
[00:24:06.792 --> 00:24:07.853]  Very dangerous behavior.
[00:24:07.853 --> 00:24:10.074]  Training them to go into dangerous places, do dangerous things.
[00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.215]  It'll get them killed.
[00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:13.777]  And shake their ass in front of men to get off and not get in trouble.
[00:24:13.777 --> 00:24:15.999]  And the guys drool looking at the ten-year-old girls.
[00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:17.220]  I mean, it's really disgusting.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.843]  Folks, they got Netflix shows where they go, I didn't know, I never knew a ten-year-old boy that's a top.
[00:24:21.843 --> 00:24:23.824]  That means, you know, he's pitching.
[00:24:23.824 --> 00:24:30.409]  And then the ten-year-old boy goes in there with this man dressed as a woman into a dungeon with a dirty mattress and they close the door.
[00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:32.791]  I mean, this is just, it's way beyond.
[00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:35.161]  Because this is Hollywood.
[00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:40.764]  This is Hollywood injecting its poison in everybody.
[00:24:40.764 --> 00:24:41.744]  And creepy dudes.
[00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:48.127]  I mean, you know, the guys they cast look like that guy that Vice and the New York Times call the good pedophile.
[00:24:48.127 --> 00:24:56.131]  They go, oh, he's a nice guy and he's got a prosthetic arm and, you know, he he's hunted and harassed.
[00:24:56.131 --> 00:25:02.274]  I mean, even the guys they got from casting look just like the guy that Vice interviews as the as the
[00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:04.811]  As the good pedophile.
[00:25:04.811 --> 00:25:06.072]  I'm not saying those guys are pedophiles.
[00:25:06.072 --> 00:25:13.576]  I'm just saying, if I was casting somebody who looked like a pedophile, I would bet that guy's central casting.
[00:25:13.576 --> 00:25:16.857]  In fact, I forget that guy's name.
[00:25:16.857 --> 00:25:18.838]  Even the New York Times had an article about it.
[00:25:18.838 --> 00:25:21.480]  A bunch of others did last week.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.280]  Yeah, that's not him.
[00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:25.933]  There he is!
[00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:26.634]  Boom!
[00:25:26.634 --> 00:25:27.415]  Bingo!
[00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:28.395]  Bingo!
[00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:31.038]  A pedophile opens up about being targeted by vigilantes.
[00:25:31.038 --> 00:25:32.038]  Now, that's vice.
[00:25:32.038 --> 00:25:33.099]  HBO loves pedophilia.
[00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:36.782]  Now go back to the security guard in the last piece.
[00:25:36.782 --> 00:25:40.926]  I said if I was going to cast a pedophile, that's exactly what they look like and they got that look in their eyes.
[00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:44.589]  And then look at who they cast for the show for little girls to shake their ass.
[00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:46.110]  Look!
[00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.351]  They don't even know what they're doing!
[00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:51.776]  Wow, man!
[00:25:51.776 --> 00:25:53.697]  Let me tell you what the hardcore one's that.
[00:25:53.697 --> 00:25:57.759]  That looks like a Renfield, the guy that delivers kids.
[00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.701]  You want to see what a Dracula looks like?
[00:25:59.701 --> 00:26:03.923]  Sacha Baron Cohen or Brian Stelter.
[00:26:03.923 --> 00:26:06.424]  They do the shark fish.
[00:26:06.424 --> 00:26:09.526]  And let me tell you, that's what the kids see when they're not just going to get fondled or raped.
[00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:12.488]  No, that's what kids see when they're about to die.
[00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:16.370]  We're talking getting chopped up and bled out good, begging for mommy.
[00:26:18.294 --> 00:26:20.800]  So, anyways, I digress.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.562]  Sorry about that.
[00:26:23.988 --> 00:26:34.836]  We're gonna come back from break and I'm gonna be a good boy and tell you the latest COVID news where they're now assaulting families where young babies have to be smothered by the high priest of evil.
[00:26:34.836 --> 00:26:39.219]  It's all about jabbing needles in you and Bill Gates putting something in you.
[00:26:39.219 --> 00:26:42.461]  It's all about smothering your face and all about tracking you.
[00:26:42.461 --> 00:26:45.843]  All about creepy weirdos like General Hayden.
[00:26:45.843 --> 00:26:48.545]  Not saying he's a pedophile, just he looks like one.
[00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:49.666]  Looks like a little Dracula.
[00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.168]  A little Nosferatu, but worse.
[00:26:57.674 --> 00:27:08.984]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[00:27:08.984 --> 00:27:12.607]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[00:27:12.607 --> 00:27:16.210]  So, for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:25.478]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:27.419]  They're following magnetic lines.
[00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:29.861]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[00:27:29.861 --> 00:27:32.443]  We now know scientifically what's going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:36.526]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[00:27:36.526 --> 00:27:38.628]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:45.994]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's going on with this satanic transmission.
[00:27:46.574 --> 00:27:55.001]  It's working through people, and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct, because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space-time continuum.
[00:27:56.638 --> 00:28:02.760]  The mask is more than just a symbol of subservience, being a blind follower, not knowing facts and science.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.941]  It's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman.
[00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:07.882]  And they tell you, you are not essential.
[00:28:07.882 --> 00:28:13.624]  Remember, first they said no more industry, you'll be a service economy, and now they tell you service is not essential.
[00:28:13.624 --> 00:28:18.446]  This has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time, in Operation Lockstep and other documents.
[00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:35.709]  Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor, and under their controls, you can finally be starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very, very weak bio-weapons that won't affect anyone that actually gets their RDA of vitamins and minerals.
[00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:38.130]  And so that's the plan for you and your family.
[00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:43.311]  Now that you're tuned into this broadcast, you've checked this out for yourself, you know it's true, so let's start warning the sheep.
[00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:46.073]  Let's start educating them now.
[00:28:46.073 --> 00:28:51.398]  I just went and swam at the lake and I walked around for 20 minutes educating people after I got out of the water.
[00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.159]  It's that simple.
[00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:54.461]  We must take action now or be slaves forever.
[00:28:54.461 --> 00:28:55.022]  This is life and death.
[00:28:56.658 --> 00:29:02.542]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[00:29:02.542 --> 00:29:04.343]  I don't say it to scare you.
[00:29:04.343 --> 00:29:06.865]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:10.627]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[00:29:10.627 --> 00:29:18.353]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:24.296]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[00:29:24.296 --> 00:29:26.458]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[00:29:27.178 --> 00:29:33.841]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:36.722]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[00:29:36.722 --> 00:29:38.603]  And it's coming out in the open.
[00:29:38.603 --> 00:29:43.965]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:45.925]  But others are going to fight.
[00:29:45.925 --> 00:29:50.907]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[00:29:50.907 --> 00:29:51.427]  No.
[00:29:51.427 --> 00:29:54.409]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:55.249]  Research what that is.
[00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:02.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:26.134]  We never give up, because we don't have a choice.
[00:30:41.052 --> 00:30:42.993]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:30:42.993 --> 00:30:44.595]  Let's get right into it.
[00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:49.658]  Everybody knows now that it's confirmed that COVID is a giant fraud, a giant scam, a giant con job.
[00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:14.729]  To say it's a hoax is really not the proper term.
[00:31:14.729 --> 00:31:18.932]  You can use it because they hoaxed the test.
[00:31:18.932 --> 00:31:20.814]  90 plus percent false positives.
[00:31:20.814 --> 00:31:24.016]  They hoaxed most of the people that died of other things, putting them in the list.
[00:31:24.016 --> 00:31:31.182]  They sent people that were sick into nursing homes knowing the people hadn't had sunlight and that they didn't have good vitamins and minerals and they could actually get a kill rate.
[00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:33.683]  So that was, that was a scam.
[00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:34.344]  That was a murder.
[00:31:34.344 --> 00:31:35.665]  That was a conspiracy.
[00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:38.227]  COVID is a organized criminal conspiracy.
[00:31:40.353 --> 00:31:46.135]  To not let people have regular medical care so the insurance companies can keep trillions of dollars worldwide.
[00:31:46.135 --> 00:31:56.198]  Be able to decide who's essential and who's not and have martial law and home arrest and then apps that track you and big tech can all, on average, expand their wealth over 35% in just the last eight months.
[00:31:56.198 --> 00:31:59.459]  Jeff Bezos' company's doubled.
[00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:03.020]  Because you're not going to go to the store and put on the mask and go through all the crap and be yelled at.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.060]  So you call Amazon.
[00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:17.787]  And it's the dying of Main Street, the dying of the restaurants, the dying of the shops, you know, the laundry mats, and the dying of the real estate market.
[00:32:17.787 --> 00:32:30.039]  A great reset to collapse markets so the globalists can buy it up for pennies on the dollar, and then dictate the terms of our surrender to the megacorporations that have all the money through fraud, and through fractional reserve banking.
[00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:30.699]  And at Davos,
[00:32:31.684 --> 00:32:37.487]  They admit this and they come out and have books and articles this year saying, this is our Great Reset.
[00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:44.150]  They said it within the end of January when COVID wasn't even a big story here.
[00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.972]  They were saying, we're coming, we're going to take over, we're going to vertically integrate, we're going to have the Global Reset.
[00:32:48.972 --> 00:32:54.595]  We'll teach America to not have a big carbon footprint.
[00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:57.917]  Now there it is, Economic Forum, World Economic Forum, the Great Reset.
[00:32:57.917 --> 00:32:58.497]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:33:01.553 --> 00:33:10.876]  And the hundreds of articles about, oh, it's good for the earth, now you're poor, now you know, now you're made to wear your mask.
[00:33:10.876 --> 00:33:13.317]  And first it's, oh, people under six don't have to wear masks.
[00:33:13.317 --> 00:33:15.598]  Oh, now two-year-olds need to.
[00:33:15.598 --> 00:33:19.419]  Now they're like, babies need to.
[00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:21.660]  And boy, the virtue signalers love...
[00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:44.913]  At the corporations to have their minions follow orders because they know rail stations and borders and airports are places where people tend to give up their rights where they can then beta test the next level of control like the border staying wide open but the TSA groping your child's genitals.
[00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:49.617]  And so now 19 month old babies which can die by the way
[00:33:51.257 --> 00:33:51.937]  We're good to go.
[00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:13.306]  This is part of their larger plan.
[00:34:13.306 --> 00:34:14.847]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:14.847 --> 00:34:21.652]  Airliner kicks off family, cancels entire plane journey because baby, 19-month-old, wasn't even wearing a face mask.
[00:34:21.652 --> 00:34:25.175]  And their policy's 24 months, which is incredibly abusive.
[00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:32.640]  A video posted to Twitter shows a family being kicked off WestJet plane because their 19-month-old baby wasn't wearing a face mask.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.342]  And remember, we'll play the audio in a moment,
[00:34:36.308 --> 00:34:40.703]  How they said 10 years ago, we're going to make you wear bracelets that can shock you when you're on a plane.
[00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:41.747]  Homeland Security proposed that.
[00:34:43.464 --> 00:34:44.305]  Under Obama.
[00:34:44.305 --> 00:34:45.726]  People said, that's crazy.
[00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:49.268]  And then they proposed a camera in the back of every seat to make sure you behave.
[00:34:49.268 --> 00:34:55.613]  Well, now the airlines are saying, oh, a lot of our airlines actually already had hidden cameras, and we're going to have AI watching you.
[00:34:55.613 --> 00:35:03.059]  It's a program we just so happen to have, that if you take your mask down, we'll have you banned from the flight, and next it'll be the grocery store.
[00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:07.663]  I mean, think of the science fiction dystopia, where now they go, oh, wear it when you have sex.
[00:35:08.263 --> 00:35:23.171]  Democrat Party in Wisconsin and now in New York and now in California and now in Washington make you wear masks while you're at your home on a Zoom or FaceTime because you can't ever see one not wearing.
[00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:25.032]  We've got to all have the peer pressure.
[00:35:25.032 --> 00:35:28.134]  It's called a cult.
[00:35:28.134 --> 00:35:31.456]  And they're announcing at all these universities, West Virginia University,
[00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.750]  All of them.
[00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.891]  It's all coming out.
[00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:35.231]  Oh, it's an app you get to be here.
[00:35:35.231 --> 00:35:37.853]  Oh, the app tracks you and makes sure you wear your mask.
[00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:40.194]  And you've got to hold the phone up every hour and show you've got a mask.
[00:35:40.194 --> 00:35:41.434]  And you've got to tell them where you're going.
[00:35:41.434 --> 00:35:42.335]  You can't leave campus.
[00:35:42.335 --> 00:35:43.255]  You're not allowed to.
[00:35:43.255 --> 00:35:46.697]  And it's all a COVID test, they call it.
[00:35:46.697 --> 00:35:48.557]  You answer some questions and it tells you at the end.
[00:35:48.557 --> 00:35:49.638]  By the way, we'll be watching you.
[00:35:49.638 --> 00:35:50.638]  We'll be listening to you.
[00:35:50.638 --> 00:35:51.959]  We'll be tracking you.
[00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:53.099]  It's beyond 1984.
[00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:54.180]  Boom.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.301]  Oh, and the former head of the NSA now runs Amazon.
[00:35:59.138 --> 00:36:03.279]  Remember what they said, that headline six, seven years ago?
[00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:07.181]  Your refrigerator and your toaster will be watching and listening to you.
[00:36:07.181 --> 00:36:10.862]  Remember I told you all this 27 years ago?
[00:36:10.862 --> 00:36:12.122]  Oh, but I'm the bad guy.
[00:36:12.122 --> 00:36:12.862]  Oh, I'm the cook.
[00:36:12.862 --> 00:36:16.103]  And now COVID's the excuse for the whole rollout.
[00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:18.964]  Here's the report.
[00:36:18.964 --> 00:36:20.305]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:27.699]  And American Airlines, and Delta, and WestJet, they're all doing it.
[00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:30.983]  Let's go ahead and roll the report.
[00:36:30.983 --> 00:36:31.564]  Bullshit!
[00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:32.625]  Bullshit!
[00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:34.448]  Bullshit!
[00:36:34.448 --> 00:36:36.691]  Bullshit!
[00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:37.172]  Bullshit!
[00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:41.826]  This is all about forced inoculation.
[00:37:20.748 --> 00:37:28.614]  So, when cops arrest people, when cops shut down planes, when cops beat up black people, white people because they're not wearing a mask properly,
[00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:34.422]  It's wonderful and good, but then when a guy pulls a gun on cops and they shoot him, the cops are bad.
[00:37:34.422 --> 00:37:36.205]  And so the cops follow worse.
[00:37:36.205 --> 00:37:39.109]  So a lot of the police will follow whatever the media says.
[00:37:40.213 --> 00:37:44.695]  So they won't respond to a black thug with a gun, but they'll respond to a white thug with a gun.
[00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:51.058]  And they won't respond to somebody burning down a police station, but they'll respond when you're not wearing a mask and click their heels.
[00:37:51.058 --> 00:37:53.259]  It's all about who's in control of the police.
[00:37:53.259 --> 00:37:55.200]  And this is all unconstitutional.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.501]  It's all very, very dangerous.
[00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:00.002]  And complying with the airlines doesn't get us out of this.
[00:38:00.002 --> 00:38:01.723]  It only makes it worse.
[00:38:01.723 --> 00:38:05.605]  Now, I've got some really horrifying news I'm going to cover next segment.
[00:38:08.075 --> 00:38:18.638]  I've been looking into what these new vaccines do that go in and actually reprogram the DNA, the RNA vaccines that are so dangerous.
[00:38:18.638 --> 00:38:24.439]  And I went and did over an hour of research this morning in medical papers on them, and it does exactly what I thought.
[00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:34.561]  It turns off a gene that when it turns it off, it makes you sluggish, low IQ, and you don't live as long as your cancer and die.
[00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:36.522]  Skill switch.
[00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:37.022]  And so the
[00:38:38.786 --> 00:38:56.119]  Bill Gates main vaccine is a kill switch and I'm sitting there reading mainline literature that messing with the protein in a cell tends to flip its kill switch and that that's why vaccines are dangerous because they can
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:08.982]  Mess with those proteins by having an autoimmune response, but these new vaccines go in and actually turn them on, and it's much worse!
[00:39:08.982 --> 00:39:11.403]  I mean, you can't make it up!
[00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:13.623]  You can't make it up!
[00:39:13.623 --> 00:39:23.025]  And people will follow orders, and they'll wonder why they get fat, why they're unhealthy, why they're so stupid, why a regular cold comes by and kills you, and it's because they're going to turn your gene off.
[00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:35.491]  This is just one thing I found about it, just doing random searches about proteins and protein tests in animals with these vaccines and they found it.
[00:39:35.491 --> 00:39:39.834]  They don't know why, it just turns the gene off and then the animal just gets sick and dies.
[00:39:39.834 --> 00:39:42.016]  They're gonna murder all of us, isn't it good?
[00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:43.677]  We're gonna take it too, it's who we are.
[00:39:43.677 --> 00:39:46.640]  Bill Gates is gonna murder every one of us with pleasure.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.304]  Because it's their planet now and we rolled over and we asked for it, so we're gonna die.
[00:39:56.525 --> 00:39:58.126]  It was a sleeper product.
[00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:03.028]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[00:40:03.028 --> 00:40:06.150]  I'm talking about the 8-pack Power Stack.
[00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:13.234]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more that you take in the morning in one pack and at night.
[00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:14.855]  It's available right now at $60.
[00:40:15.635 --> 00:40:21.477]  percent off for a limited time when you get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[00:40:21.477 --> 00:40:23.998]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[00:40:23.998 --> 00:40:24.978]  Now here's the problem.
[00:40:24.978 --> 00:40:30.440]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in APEC Power Stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.120]  We're good to go.
[00:40:56.525 --> 00:41:19.872]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[00:41:19.872 --> 00:41:25.694]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[00:41:26.474 --> 00:41:28.775]  This is a power grab.
[00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:32.176]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[00:41:32.176 --> 00:41:35.538]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[00:41:35.538 --> 00:41:39.720]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:46.122]  for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[00:41:46.122 --> 00:41:51.404]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them.
[00:41:51.404 --> 00:41:53.205]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:41:53.205 --> 00:41:53.785]  It's illegal.
[00:41:53.785 --> 00:41:54.626]  We must resist it.
[00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:05.773]  As of 54 days out, the globalist, child-molesting, devil-worshippers know they're in trouble, and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:09.395]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil war.
[00:42:09.395 --> 00:42:14.417]  And they are throwing hack attacks at InfoWars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[00:42:14.417 --> 00:42:15.757]  It's incredible.
[00:42:15.757 --> 00:42:20.539]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at InfoWarshore.com is critical.
[00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:21.879]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:23.120]  We've only got a few months
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.721]  A backup.
[00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:28.223]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[00:42:28.223 --> 00:42:34.188]  We need to have extra money in our coffers to be able to expand in this homestretch, not just contract.
[00:42:34.188 --> 00:42:38.651]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[00:42:38.651 --> 00:42:40.012]  So I know you're going to step up.
[00:42:40.012 --> 00:42:51.601]  At InfoWarsTore.com, we've got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock, we've got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts, and so much more.
[00:42:51.601 --> 00:42:53.082]  Get prepared and fund the InfoWar.
[00:42:53.482 --> 00:42:59.607]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person.
[00:42:59.607 --> 00:43:00.928]  I am a humble person overall.
[00:43:00.928 --> 00:43:17.480]  I've not come off as aggressive in things because I'm under threat here, under threat, and I'm fighting as hard as I possibly can, and I appreciate your support and your prayers, but I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes, and I wish I did a better job, so that's why when you call in thanking me all the time, it just kind of makes me feel pathetic because
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:24.643]  I guess Call It Pride, I don't like begging you all the time to try our products or to donate or to spread the word or to pray for us.
[00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:26.083]  I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:28.104]  And so I want to thank you.
[00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:32.066]  It's put the cart before the horse to call in and thank me.
[00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:34.327]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:36.607]  So understand you're my equal 110%.
[00:43:36.607 --> 00:43:38.788]  And I just want to thank you all.
[00:43:38.788 --> 00:43:42.070]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody else, man.
[00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.270]  I just want to stay in this fight.
[00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.991]  And it's so serious now.
[00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:46.211]  Things are getting so clear now.
[00:43:46.211 --> 00:43:47.632]  That's why they want us off air because
[00:43:48.072 --> 00:43:49.412]  All of our credibility is so high.
[00:43:49.412 --> 00:43:53.274]  Let's just stay together, fight hard, spread the word, and pray to God to take us through this.
[00:43:53.274 --> 00:43:59.616]  We're gonna make it.
[00:43:59.616 --> 00:44:02.237]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:16.485 --> 00:44:22.749]  We are back live, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas with George Strait bringing us in.
[00:44:22.749 --> 00:44:27.333]  Amarillo by morning.
[00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:31.055]  Up from San Antonio.
[00:44:31.055 --> 00:44:34.758]  I think I'm going to listen to a bunch of country music this weekend.
[00:44:34.758 --> 00:44:39.161]  Alright, let me just do this.
[00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:40.402]  I read all this this morning.
[00:44:41.906 --> 00:44:42.947]  I spent over an hour actually.
[00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:44.048]  I got up at like 3 a.m.
[00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.328]  again.
[00:44:45.328 --> 00:44:57.757]  Okay, I spent like two hours scanning over hundreds of pages and reading through quite a few documents.
[00:44:57.757 --> 00:45:01.920]  And during the last four-minute break, I realized I hadn't highlighted a lot of what I wanted to hit.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.083]  So I've got to re-scan over this during the next couple breaks to actually do this right.
[00:45:06.083 --> 00:45:10.326]  But believe me, you're going to want to tune in to the start of the next hour in just a few minutes because
[00:45:12.935 --> 00:45:14.675]  I'm not a scientist.
[00:45:14.675 --> 00:45:17.316]  I can go read what the scientists say.
[00:45:17.316 --> 00:45:22.697]  And it's very, very clear and it's very, very frightening.
[00:45:22.697 --> 00:45:24.817]  And I've got the big picture and you've got the big picture.
[00:45:24.817 --> 00:45:38.400]  Why in the hell would Bill Gates be running around saying, well, one of my vaccines makes 100% of people sick and some of them die, but my weaker ones only make 80% sick.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.960]  And only 20% get paralyzed or have to go to the hospital.
[00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:49.256]  Why would they suddenly in AP go, okay, number one cause of polio is vaccines?
[00:45:49.256 --> 00:46:03.890]  Because they're getting ready to hurt people really bad and they've done the psychological studies at Stanford and at Yale this year that at least 35% of the public will take a vaccine even if it maims them or kills them.
[00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:04.851]  They're that limiting.
[00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:22.481]  Hey, ancient Germans, ancient Goths, ancient Brits, ancient Mesoamericans, every ancient culture, the majority of people would give their children to the priest to be gutted in front of them or burned on an altar.
[00:46:22.481 --> 00:46:25.762]  In what is Mexico today, all the way down into Central and South America,
[00:46:26.707 --> 00:46:30.349]  By the collapse of the Mesoamerican society that happened right as Cortez arrived.
[00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:31.849]  They were already collapsed.
[00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:35.891]  The main source of meat was human flesh of children.
[00:46:35.891 --> 00:46:42.074]  They had shops down at the bottom of the pyramids with hanging children and people came and bought the meat.
[00:46:42.074 --> 00:46:45.155]  People would routinely eat their own children after they were gutted.
[00:46:45.155 --> 00:46:48.036]  They'd go buy an arm or a leg.
[00:46:48.036 --> 00:46:51.077]  That's how they can get us to not care about human life.
[00:46:51.077 --> 00:46:52.878]  That was going on everywhere.
[00:46:52.878 --> 00:46:54.359]  People were sacrificing their children.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.283]  You go back 6,000 years ago, and the Mayans would sacrifice a few people on a few holidays.
[00:47:02.283 --> 00:47:04.445]  And then it got more, and it's always the same.
[00:47:04.445 --> 00:47:09.708]  And you look at us, we've killed more people than the Mesoamericans ever did with abortion.
[00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:13.590]  This is the religion of the Satanist.
[00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.132]  Who did they worship down in South America, Central America, and Southern North America?
[00:47:17.132 --> 00:47:19.334]  The winged serpent.
[00:47:19.334 --> 00:47:20.814]  Who did the Egyptians worship?
[00:47:20.814 --> 00:47:22.455]  And they did human sacrifice too.
[00:47:22.455 --> 00:47:23.256]  Winged serpent.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.967]  This is a global cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:30.967 --> 00:47:35.053]  And we ain't in it.
[00:47:35.053 --> 00:47:39.799]  Now I've got a special report here that we put together, some levity, a little bit of fun.
[00:47:39.799 --> 00:47:42.403]  We'll air this and then we'll come back on the other side.
[00:47:43.573 --> 00:47:59.297]  And we will get to this hardcore news of, now we know, at least in some of the studies, I'm sure it does much worse stuff, but of course, the Bill Gates vaccines are linked to turning off a chromosome in the cells that is a life switch.
[00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:02.038]  It throws a kill switch.
[00:48:02.038 --> 00:48:03.398]  I just can't make this up.
[00:48:03.398 --> 00:48:05.339]  Of course it's a kill switch.
[00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:06.199]  He wants us to die.
[00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:08.119]  He really wants you to take this.
[00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:09.260]  He says it's going to make you really sick.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.800]  You're going to need a lot of these shots.
[00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:14.460]  Then they're going to manage covering all that up.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.947]  It's all a big sick laboratory test.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:30.827]  But listen, with what's happening in the supply chain breakdown and all the craziness and China hoarding food and Europe and governments and elites digging into bunkers, you need to get your storable food one to two weeks from delivery now before the big rush comes when they contest the election and all the fireworks that are coming.
[00:48:30.827 --> 00:48:33.708]  This is a checkbox you need to check off and it funds the InfoWar.
[00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:34.588]  A 360 win.
[00:48:34.588 --> 00:48:39.231]  Get your storable foods before the next big rush comes at InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:39.231 --> 00:48:42.472]  And the supplements and then other big sales.
[00:48:47.314 --> 00:49:03.438]  I always own up to stuff when we make a mistake.
[00:49:03.438 --> 00:49:06.579]  But what we got caught doing here at InfoWars was downright criminal.
[00:49:06.579 --> 00:49:08.160]  So I'm just gonna lay it out.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.260]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.721]  We're gonna have to let Rob Dood go.
[00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:13.161]  Zoinks!
[00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:27.019]  We just got notice from YouTube, parent company, Google, parent company, of course, Alphabet, that he stole someone's identity.
[00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:28.820]  And we're not going to stand for that type of activity.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:35.945]  So it's with a heavy heart that we're going to show you what was done, and I'm going to summarily throw Rob Dewey out of the building.
[00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:52.793]  Viewers and listeners of InfoWars have always got a commitment from me that when we do something wrong, we'll own up to it.
[00:49:52.793 --> 00:50:01.777]  And it's with heavy heart that I've got to go ahead and admit this to all of you, and I apologize for myself and the whole crew, but we're going to have to let Rob Dew go.
[00:50:01.777 --> 00:50:12.641]  We just got notice today from YouTube, Parrot Company, Google, and Alphabet that he stole someone's identity, and that's really a crime.
[00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:13.822]  Now, we've got the notice from them,
[00:50:14.773 --> 00:50:17.596]  Well, so we put out a video about...
[00:50:34.445 --> 00:50:38.788]  About two weeks ago called, Scooby-Doo Solves the Mystery of the Pandemic.
[00:50:38.788 --> 00:50:40.229]  And you can even watch it here.
[00:50:40.229 --> 00:50:43.471]  Here's to you kids, we now know that the virus is a hoax.
[00:50:43.471 --> 00:50:47.893]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[00:50:47.893 --> 00:50:49.955]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[00:50:49.955 --> 00:50:56.318]  President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[00:50:56.318 --> 00:50:58.880]  Gigi Pink?
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.021]  Dr. Fauci?
[00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:03.423]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[00:51:04.918 --> 00:51:06.778]  Microsoft's Bill Gates?
[00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:13.240]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:13.880]  I get it.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.281]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:20.341]  That's diabolical.
[00:51:20.341 --> 00:51:22.282]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:23.602]  Don't worry, kids.
[00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:27.063]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[00:51:27.063 --> 00:51:31.804]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[00:51:31.804 --> 00:51:32.124]  Yeah.
[00:51:38.076 --> 00:51:39.537]  Stop making excuses.
[00:51:39.537 --> 00:51:43.040]  We're going to read the notice of what you did in a moment.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:50.985]  He stole the identity of not just Scooby Doo, not just the Scooby friends, but also defamed Bill Gates, Xi Jinping, and other great humanitarians.
[00:51:50.985 --> 00:51:52.406]  OK?
[00:51:52.406 --> 00:51:56.048]  So let's go ahead and read the notice from them about how you stole the identity.
[00:51:56.048 --> 00:51:56.329]  Go ahead.
[00:51:57.242 --> 00:51:58.502]  Impersonation.
[00:51:58.502 --> 00:52:03.364]  Upon review, we've determined your content violates our guidelines and we've removed it from YouTube.
[00:52:03.364 --> 00:52:09.426]  We know this might be disappointing, but it's important to us that YouTube is a safe place for all.
[00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.447]  If content breaks our rules, we remove it!
[00:52:14.133 --> 00:52:15.514]  Now tell them about your note to them.
[00:52:15.514 --> 00:52:16.955]  So here's my note.
[00:52:16.955 --> 00:52:18.416]  I know I'm bad, but this is what I said.
[00:52:18.416 --> 00:52:19.376]  This is satire.
[00:52:19.376 --> 00:52:20.477]  This is where you come clean.
[00:52:20.477 --> 00:52:21.017]  This is it.
[00:52:21.017 --> 00:52:24.399]  This is satire and is protected under fair use.
[00:52:24.399 --> 00:52:37.807]  If this video is guilty of impersonation, as you claim, then the entire Bad Lip Reading channel, which is a channel made up entirely of movie clips and NFL clips of people impersonating those people.
[00:52:38.527 --> 00:52:39.688]  Okay, the entire channel is that.
[00:52:39.688 --> 00:52:41.249]  The White House Correspondence Center.
[00:52:41.249 --> 00:52:44.470]  Now Alec Baldwin can't personate Trump, but just finish up, criminal.
[00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.631]  Alright.
[00:52:45.631 --> 00:52:46.872]  Should be removed as well.
[00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:52.375]  This is a meme and satire channel, and I am not guilty of anything except a quality shaggy voice.
[00:52:53.311 --> 00:52:55.312]  I didn't really like my scoob voice, but I'll- Good job.
[00:52:55.312 --> 00:52:56.453]  The shaggy voice, I'll take.
[00:52:56.453 --> 00:52:57.694]  He's fired.
[00:52:57.694 --> 00:53:00.916]  But we know that this is not about impersonation.
[00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:09.261]  This video places your false idols Fauci and Gates in a bad light and disparages the real master of YouTube, Gigi Ping.
[00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:11.202]  Now, do your scooby imitation for us.
[00:53:11.202 --> 00:53:15.805]  I mean, that's about it.
[00:53:15.805 --> 00:53:19.087]  Like, it's okay to make fun of Gigi Ping in America!
[00:53:19.087 --> 00:53:22.629]  Since when did we wake up and we don't have any free speech?
[00:53:23.636 --> 00:53:25.038]  Hey, let's stop right there.
[00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:37.351]  I would say go to Band.Video or 2020ElectionCenter.com, but we've had the DDoS attacks and the hack attacks on Infowars, InfowarsStore.com, and now they have successfully shut down Band.Video right now, and it's all out of China.
[00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:38.849]  It's all out of China.
[00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:39.529]  They don't even hide it.
[00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:45.554]  It's right out of the government servers over in China, and it takes huge amounts of money to keep these up in the face of this.
[00:53:45.554 --> 00:53:47.155]  So that's why it's a daily fight.
[00:53:47.155 --> 00:53:50.337]  We're pretty cheerful about it here, but we're just pro-America.
[00:53:50.337 --> 00:53:51.018]  We're pro-freedom.
[00:53:51.018 --> 00:53:51.919]  We're pro-unborn.
[00:53:51.919 --> 00:53:52.999]  We love God.
[00:53:52.999 --> 00:53:54.881]  We love this country, and we love you.
[00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:58.704]  And so please tell folks about every AM and FM station you listen to.
[00:53:58.704 --> 00:54:00.865]  They're precious for us to get out.
[00:54:00.865 --> 00:54:03.427]  Their local streams are great to share.
[00:54:03.427 --> 00:54:05.189]  And know that every day you share the links.
[00:54:06.195 --> 00:54:06.395]  I think?
[00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:32.431]  They want us off air when they contest the election, try to overthrow the president.
[00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:38.479]  But we're fighting hard to stay on air, and it takes a lot of money to do this, so visit m4warrestore.com while you still can.
[00:54:38.479 --> 00:54:41.002]  Seriously, folks, we need your support now.
[00:54:41.002 --> 00:54:41.924]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:54:46.676 --> 00:54:53.443]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and it's free will.
[00:54:53.443 --> 00:55:02.633]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists, the anti-humans, openly tell you what they're doing.
[00:55:03.334 --> 00:55:08.495]  And openly tell you that your work will suit crap and you need to die because that will save the earth.
[00:55:08.495 --> 00:55:16.396]  They do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[00:55:16.396 --> 00:55:18.057]  They are making you hate yourself.
[00:55:18.057 --> 00:55:19.937]  They are making you be depressed.
[00:55:19.937 --> 00:55:25.178]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[00:55:25.178 --> 00:55:26.838]  And that's what all this is about, you know.
[00:55:26.838 --> 00:55:30.719]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[00:55:31.299 --> 00:55:40.890]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies, the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.794]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[00:55:43.794 --> 00:55:44.414]  It's time to say no.
[00:55:46.591 --> 00:56:00.285]  It sounds over the top when I go on air, and I explain that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population, except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods.
[00:56:00.285 --> 00:56:02.647]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[00:56:02.647 --> 00:56:08.513]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago, and actually openly announcing it everywhere.
[00:56:08.953 --> 00:56:11.454]  They're going from beta to operational.
[00:56:11.454 --> 00:56:13.135]  And think about all these major corporations.
[00:56:13.135 --> 00:56:14.496]  They tell you humans are harmful.
[00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:15.857]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[00:56:15.857 --> 00:56:17.958]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of.
[00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:23.041]  And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[00:56:23.041 --> 00:56:26.743]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations.
[00:56:26.743 --> 00:56:34.168]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[00:56:34.588 --> 00:56:41.732]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics that are absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:44.574]  This is all absolute information control.
[00:56:44.574 --> 00:56:49.697]  This is beyond 1984.
[00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:52.418]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:52.418 --> 00:56:57.901]  Because I did this last time in 84.
[00:56:57.901 --> 00:57:02.484]  Everybody, including the NRA, thought background checks made sense.
[00:57:02.484 --> 00:57:03.044]  Remember that?
[00:57:03.044 --> 00:57:04.045]  Remember those good old days?
[00:57:05.717 --> 00:57:07.478]  It would have made sense.
[00:57:07.478 --> 00:57:09.499]  Keep guns out of the hands of those folks.
[00:57:09.499 --> 00:57:13.122]  I am very optimistic about Iraq.
[00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:16.264]  I think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration.
[00:57:16.264 --> 00:57:19.226]  Are you aware that you're misquoting Donald Trump in Charlottesville?
[00:57:19.226 --> 00:57:21.607]  He never called neo-Nazis very fine people?
[00:57:21.607 --> 00:57:25.409]  No, he called all those folks that walked out of that, they were neo-Nazis.
[00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:27.751]  Shouting, hate, the veins bulging.
[00:57:27.751 --> 00:57:29.812]  But he said specifically that he was condemning them.
[00:57:29.812 --> 00:57:30.893]  No, he did not.
[00:57:30.893 --> 00:57:32.494]  He said he walked out and he said.
[00:57:32.894 --> 00:57:34.035]  Let's get this straight.
[00:57:34.035 --> 00:57:36.876]  They said there were very fine people in both groups.
[00:57:36.876 --> 00:57:40.379]  They're chanting anti-semitic slogans, carrying flags.
[00:57:40.379 --> 00:57:43.120]  I've condemned neo-Nazis.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.902]  I've condemned many different groups.
[00:57:45.902 --> 00:57:49.644]  But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.
[00:57:49.644 --> 00:57:53.086]  Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
[00:57:53.086 --> 00:57:54.307]  People that were
[00:57:55.768 --> 00:57:58.311]  Very fine people on both sides.
[00:57:58.311 --> 00:58:03.518]  You had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures as you did.
[00:58:03.518 --> 00:58:14.552]  You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
[00:58:15.032 --> 00:58:15.893]  So you know what?
[00:58:15.893 --> 00:58:16.714]  It's fine.
[00:58:16.714 --> 00:58:26.223]  You're changing history, you're changing culture, and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.
[00:58:26.223 --> 00:58:32.429]  But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?
[00:58:32.429 --> 00:58:36.032]  And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
[00:58:36.032 --> 00:58:37.354]  This, the senator made a very
[00:58:38.188 --> 00:59:06.216]  Moving an eloquent speech as a son of the Confederacy, acknowledging that it was time to change and yield to a position that Senator Carol Moseley Braun raised on the floor of the Senate, not granting a federal charter to an organization made up of many fine people who continue to display
[00:59:07.432 --> 00:59:11.393]  The Confederate flag as a symbol.
[00:59:11.393 --> 00:59:12.613]  Look for Snopes to say it's true.
[00:59:12.613 --> 00:59:14.174]  I mean, if Biden says it, it's got to be true.
[00:59:14.174 --> 00:59:16.775]  I mean, 2.5 million Americans died of COVID.
[00:59:16.775 --> 00:59:17.895]  I mean, what he said.
[00:59:17.895 --> 00:59:20.936]  And a lot of people you have unnecessarily.
[00:59:20.936 --> 00:59:24.317]  Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.
[00:59:24.317 --> 00:59:29.498]  Joe Biden rewrites history, tells Wisconsin audience a black guy invented the light bulb.
[00:59:29.498 --> 00:59:30.178]  I love it.
[00:59:30.178 --> 00:59:36.560]  We gotta, for example, why in God's name don't we teach history in history classes?
[00:59:38.493 --> 00:59:43.519]  A black man and men at the lightbulb, not a white guy named Edison.
[00:59:43.519 --> 00:59:45.041]  Okay?
[00:59:45.041 --> 00:59:47.804]  Lewis Howard Latimer.
[00:59:47.804 --> 00:59:48.925]  Born September 4th, 1848.
[00:59:51.553 --> 00:59:52.053]  We're good to go!
[01:00:12.398 --> 01:00:17.140]  And he sold the patent to the United States Electric Company in 1881.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:32.104]  I mean, this cultural appropriation that white people never done anything good, that's going on in Europe and in the BBC where all the shows now show ancient Britons and like half of them are black.
[01:00:32.104 --> 01:00:34.705]  There weren't any black people in Britain 2,000 years ago.
[01:00:34.705 --> 01:00:36.986]  And 2,000 years ago, it was a Roman colony.
[01:00:38.644 --> 01:00:43.565]  And the people were slaves, and they lived in stone houses and huts.
[01:00:43.565 --> 01:00:46.125]  I mean, it's just like the Africans were.
[01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:50.346]  I mean, it's just total, absolute crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.367]  And it's not taking something away from black people.
[01:00:52.367 --> 01:01:00.588]  The mental illness of the left making movies where you'll see ancient Rome and a third of the people are black.
[01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:04.169]  There were some black people there, maybe one out of a thousand, but the Romans
[01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:09.843]  took white slaves so they didn't have black slaves from the African slave trade.
[01:01:09.843 --> 01:01:12.205]  The Arabs liked black slaves.
[01:01:12.205 --> 01:01:15.246]  The Romans wanted white slaves for whatever reason.
[01:01:15.246 --> 01:01:17.407]  That's why they were in Albion.
[01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.508]  That's why they were in Gaul.
[01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.889]  That's why they were in Germania.
[01:01:19.889 --> 01:01:25.332]  That's why they were in the kingdoms of the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
[01:01:25.332 --> 01:01:26.492]  Again, that's history.
[01:01:26.492 --> 01:01:31.855]  It's all being rewritten mindlessly because you can't have any European history.
[01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:32.656]  You can't have any of that.
[01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:32.956]  No!
[01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:34.277]  No, no, no!
[01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:41.332]  Alright folks, we're getting a lot of phone calls.
[01:01:41.332 --> 01:01:43.692]  People are noticing that most of the video and audio streams are down.
[01:01:43.692 --> 01:01:49.314]  We are on satellite, on radio and TV stations, but we're under massive, sustained attack out of Communist China.
[01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:51.355]  I've told you this is going on for weeks.
[01:01:51.355 --> 01:01:53.356]  I've told you it gets more intense each day, so here we are.
[01:01:53.356 --> 01:01:58.418]  I know I say it all the time, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[01:01:58.418 --> 01:02:07.741]  I want to thank you, the listeners and viewers of this broadcast, and all the stations, and all the affiliates, and sponsors, and my family, and the crew, and just everybody out there.
[01:02:08.955 --> 01:02:14.497]  The listeners and viewers have just said, this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on.
[01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.978]  We've been proven we're right because we're being led by God.
[01:02:16.978 --> 01:02:19.099]  We have a spirit and we're very humble about that.
[01:02:19.099 --> 01:02:19.999]  This is not us.
[01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:21.080]  This is God working through us.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.641]  But man, now it's so precious to stay on air.
[01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:28.643]  I used to think, you know, maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of proceed into the
[01:02:29.523 --> 01:02:52.723]  background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day is a little bit old but now with evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true but I I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out well now we know they're gonna carry it out and then some so we got a fight and I just really appreciate you we're in this together and praise God past the ammunition the info war again take action folks this is it
[01:03:13.954 --> 01:03:22.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, a major coup plot patched by Republican and Democrats in the deep state led by General Mattis.
[01:03:23.709 --> 01:03:25.030]  Has come out in mainstream news.
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.373]  It's in Bob Woodward's book, but Bob Woodward says he's a hero and a good guy for it.
[01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.374]  So it's not the only thing that's true in the book.
[01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:36.117]  The rest of it is a bunch of garbage, and I have all the evidence right here.
[01:03:36.117 --> 01:03:43.102]  So we're going to be laying all of that out more here today.
[01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:47.785]  Now, they're planning another military coup, but they can't get the general military to be part of it.
[01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:50.027]  But Trump warned just this last weekend, he said,
[01:03:51.903 --> 01:03:56.044]  A lot of the generals don't like me because they've, you know, sold the country out.
[01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:57.124]  But the troops love me.
[01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:58.044]  The soldiers love me.
[01:03:58.044 --> 01:04:00.325]  In fact, let's get that queued up.
[01:04:00.325 --> 01:04:03.646]  So remember Trump was saying that.
[01:04:03.646 --> 01:04:14.668]  And he said a month ago, I've ended one-sided trade deals with China where middlemen buy 90% of our drugs that are overpriced and rip us off.
[01:04:14.668 --> 01:04:19.490]  So this should bring down our cost upwards of half because it's all middlemen that set up the deals.
[01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.170]  And who are the middlemen?
[01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:20.690]  The globalists.
[01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:23.087]  Why do we pay the most for drugs in the world?
[01:04:23.087 --> 01:04:24.849]  Because most of our drugs are made overseas.
[01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:27.751]  Most of those are made in China.
[01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.153]  And it's a rip-off!
[01:04:29.153 --> 01:04:30.974]  And Trump's like, you're not ripping us off!
[01:04:30.974 --> 01:04:31.975]  You're not ripping us off!
[01:04:31.975 --> 01:04:32.916]  You're not ripping us off!
[01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:34.357]  You're not ripping us off!
[01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:38.141]  So he said, they're going to try to take me out.
[01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:43.225]  And I said then, I said, that is the bat signal.
[01:04:43.225 --> 01:04:46.228]  Now, I'm just going to say this here, and then I'll get into this other big news next segment.
[01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:54.891]  The Globalists have tried to go around and harass all of our AM and FM affiliates and TV stations, and it hasn't worked.
[01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:58.232]  In fact, a lot of the stations we were on at night, they said, oh, you're threatening us.
[01:04:58.232 --> 01:05:00.793]  We'll just put them on primetime.
[01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:03.154]  And so that's not worked on them.
[01:05:03.154 --> 01:05:06.775]  And so when they deplatformed us everywhere, they thought that would shut us down.
[01:05:06.775 --> 01:05:11.617]  It hurt us, but we were able, thanks to the listeners spreading the word, to circumvent that.
[01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:20.320]  And so we're on over 200 radio stations and over 100 cable and TV stations around the country, and I really should promote that more.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:29.486]  For the point of, now we get daily hack attacks and daily DDoS denial service attacks and zombie attacks, where they hijack people's computers and attack us.
[01:05:29.486 --> 01:05:30.927]  I mean, it's ongoing.
[01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.550]  We have a couple companies that help us, it costs a lot of money.
[01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.431]  And some of these attacks have been as big as anybody's ever seen.
[01:05:37.431 --> 01:05:40.694]  I mean, these are big attacks.
[01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:50.015]  But now they're like five types of attacks against Infowars and three attacks against the store and, you know, two or three different types of attacks against Bandai Video.
[01:05:50.015 --> 01:05:52.157]  Probing.
[01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:55.580]  So the Chi-Coms working for the Democrats, the Democrats have said want them to win.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.324]  The Chi-Coms openly are election meddling.
[01:05:59.324 --> 01:06:01.446]  So they can shut us down on election day.
[01:06:02.898 --> 01:06:11.582]  When Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter have announced they're not going to let the Republicans or Trump say that they've won the election, even the numbers show they have.
[01:06:11.582 --> 01:06:14.263]  And they're going to contest it and plug us in a civil war.
[01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:24.207]  So they can't have InfoWars on the air when this happens in 53 days.
[01:06:24.207 --> 01:06:26.808]  And so this is a test on turning us off.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.281]  And Brian Stelter's got drones above the building on a routine basis.
[01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:33.461]  I told you that a few years ago.
[01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:36.141]  It's on HBO special, Stelter Outside Stalking Us.
[01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:37.602]  They've got PIs.
[01:06:37.602 --> 01:06:38.982]  They've got stalking teams.
[01:06:38.982 --> 01:06:40.462]  They've got payoff teams.
[01:06:40.462 --> 01:06:47.984]  They've tried to use Facebook to canvas any women that they think I ever knew and offer them money to say I raped them.
[01:06:47.984 --> 01:06:53.004]  These women call up and say, I've never even met you, but CNN's calling saying you raped me and they'll give me money.
[01:06:53.004 --> 01:06:55.445]  I mean, that's just what they're doing to me.
[01:06:56.752 --> 01:07:06.075]  This is organized criminal operations by the New York Times, by CNN, that are terrorist organizations that run Antifa.
[01:07:06.075 --> 01:07:08.416]  And they are criminally empowered.
[01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:11.037]  They have criminal energy.
[01:07:11.037 --> 01:07:17.659]  And the harassment of my family, the stalking, the lawsuits, all of it, I expect it.
[01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:24.461]  But when I get up here and I tell you that the attacks ramped up ten times whatever it was, and I don't know how long we can hold on, that's not hyperbole.
[01:07:26.274 --> 01:07:27.255]  That's actually what's going on.
[01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:31.018]  But I understand it's because we're in a war for the very future of this country.
[01:07:31.018 --> 01:07:34.881]  We're all trying to think of ourselves individually, and I am an individualist.
[01:07:34.881 --> 01:07:36.483]  But I'm under attack.
[01:07:36.483 --> 01:07:38.304]  People are like, how are you taking it being de-platformed?
[01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.045]  I said, you're next.
[01:07:39.045 --> 01:07:40.666]  Now you are.
[01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:42.728]  Now they censor the president.
[01:07:42.728 --> 01:07:44.730]  And they've been incrementally turning up the heat.
[01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:51.976]  So we should probably play this video that Harrison Smith put together that's titled, Why They Banned Alex Jones.
[01:07:51.976 --> 01:07:52.896]  It's three minutes long.
[01:07:52.896 --> 01:07:54.498]  We'll air it in the last three minutes of this segment.
[01:07:55.993 --> 01:07:59.136]  They tell me how long it is, I think it's three minutes.
[01:07:59.136 --> 01:08:01.818]  And I said this two years ago, and it's even more true today.
[01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:11.746]  That's why, just for the radio and TV end, and us to get backups for you to get it when you can, we need capital in here, because of some of the other strategic attacks they've got going on.
[01:08:11.746 --> 01:08:17.691]  I need to be able to plan and know how much energy, and that's what money is, is a symbol of energy I've got in this fight.
[01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:20.573]  So thank you all for the support since I fired the bat signal last Thursday.
[01:08:20.573 --> 01:08:23.015]  A lot of support's come in.
[01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.456]  It was even greater, it'd be better, but
[01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:30.044]  It's helped us make some decisions, and we're just going to go 110% into this.
[01:08:30.044 --> 01:08:32.585]  But just know, the war is now, this is not a game.
[01:08:32.585 --> 01:08:34.165]  Now listen to me.
[01:08:34.165 --> 01:08:40.608]  China is hoarding food, medicine, gold, silver, everything.
[01:08:40.608 --> 01:08:48.671]  Big article on Zero Hedge, what possible disruption is coming that requires China to start massive stockpiling of all possible commodities.
[01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:50.692]  Oil, you name it.
[01:08:50.692 --> 01:08:53.173]  You do that ahead of a war, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:59.932]  They are making their move, okay?
[01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:05.415]  So we're just a leading, use a naval analogy, a scout ship.
[01:09:05.415 --> 01:09:10.718]  And so we go over the horizon, see a giant armada, it starts attacking us, and then we radio back.
[01:09:10.718 --> 01:09:12.019]  They don't say, how are you doing?
[01:09:12.019 --> 01:09:18.342]  We're like, get ready, there's this many ships, there's this many planes, they're coming fast, they're firing missiles.
[01:09:18.342 --> 01:09:20.323]  This is real, folks, okay?
[01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.705]  And so we're the leading edge of this, everybody knows that.
[01:09:23.365 --> 01:09:23.885]  Which is good.
[01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:24.806]  It's good to be in this position.
[01:09:24.806 --> 01:09:25.106]  I like it.
[01:09:25.106 --> 01:09:26.467]  It's actually exciting.
[01:09:26.467 --> 01:09:28.169]  But I'm just telling you, this is the big move.
[01:09:28.169 --> 01:09:30.010]  The enemy is going to try a coup.
[01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:31.991]  They're going to blow up power plants, set nukes off.
[01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:33.453]  I don't know, anything.
[01:09:33.453 --> 01:09:34.994]  Race riots, false flags.
[01:09:34.994 --> 01:09:36.435]  We're in the season of war.
[01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:38.036]  America is fighting for its life.
[01:09:38.036 --> 01:09:39.497]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:09:39.497 --> 01:09:40.898]  This is absolutely horrible.
[01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:42.719]  The Justice Department's got a bunch of wimps in it.
[01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:44.221]  They're not in control of anything.
[01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.882]  And we are just sitting ducks to authoritarians.
[01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:47.723]  But I think God will help us with Providence.
[01:09:47.723 --> 01:09:48.524]  We'll make it out of this.
[01:09:48.524 --> 01:09:49.344]  But it's up to you now.
[01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:51.326]  But get your storable food and products now.
[01:09:51.326 --> 01:09:52.647]  Nimphomerestorer.com while you still can.
[01:09:54.195 --> 01:09:57.136]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[01:09:57.136 --> 01:10:05.859]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:08.340]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.161]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:10:10.161 --> 01:10:12.321]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:14.662]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:10:14.662 --> 01:10:15.763]  This is all confirmed.
[01:10:15.763 --> 01:10:16.663]  This is not a drill.
[01:10:16.903 --> 01:10:21.346]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:23.608]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:10:23.608 --> 01:10:24.149]  Apple 100%.
[01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:29.613]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:10:29.613 --> 01:10:34.697]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:35.577]  This is happening.
[01:10:35.577 --> 01:10:43.603]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:10:43.603 --> 01:10:46.706]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:47.366]  I think?
[01:11:06.164 --> 01:11:16.395]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:11:16.395 --> 01:11:21.640]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.222]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[01:11:23.302 --> 01:11:24.043]  We're good to go.
[01:11:43.906 --> 01:11:52.652]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:11:52.652 --> 01:11:57.915]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:11:57.915 --> 01:12:02.798]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:12:03.138 --> 01:12:11.360]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:18.521]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:12:18.521 --> 01:12:24.102]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum, and it's being used against you.
[01:12:24.102 --> 01:12:28.843]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:12:28.843 --> 01:12:31.044]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:12:31.044 --> 01:12:31.984]  Now break free!
[01:12:35.704 --> 01:12:45.226]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:12:45.226 --> 01:12:47.787]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:12:47.787 --> 01:12:52.888]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:12:52.888 --> 01:12:55.768]  Ignorance does not equal bliss.
[01:12:55.768 --> 01:12:58.329]  Ignorance equals slavery.
[01:12:59.537 --> 01:13:06.868]  If you're ignorant, walking through a field at night, that there's a six-foot hole up ahead, you're gonna step in it and probably break your ankle.
[01:13:06.868 --> 01:13:08.110]  Or maybe worse.
[01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:10.534]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization.
[01:13:11.411 --> 01:13:19.955]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very, very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate.
[01:13:19.955 --> 01:13:24.237]  And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[01:13:24.237 --> 01:13:35.662]  Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries, like the Club of Rome, say.
[01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:37.943]  So I know exactly what's going on.
[01:13:38.923 --> 01:13:46.374]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person, but I actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff.
[01:13:46.374 --> 01:13:48.497]  I know that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:13:48.497 --> 01:13:49.659]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.143]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[01:13:53.359 --> 01:14:06.988]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this Operation Red Mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night.
[01:14:06.988 --> 01:14:14.954]  Now he's come out with a statement and told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically lost and that they're not going to let him.
[01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:17.697]  Trump declared victory, even though it's overwhelming.
[01:14:17.697 --> 01:14:20.800]  They'll have 95% of the vote done on election night.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.243]  And even if you added all the other votes in against him, he'd be the winner.
[01:14:24.243 --> 01:14:26.205]  They are going to steal this election.
[01:14:26.205 --> 01:14:27.306]  They're preparing everyone.
[01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:29.688]  You've seen all the scams they've already run.
[01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:34.453]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we, the people, and he has true media.
[01:14:34.833 --> 01:14:36.214]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:17.683 --> 01:15:19.384]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:22.485]  I'm going to hit the huge vaccine news, the biggest yet, next segment.
[01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:24.205]  But we're under attack.
[01:15:24.205 --> 01:15:28.227]  InfoWars is under giant attack from Communist China.
[01:15:28.227 --> 01:15:31.228]  InfoWarsStore.com is under attack.
[01:15:31.228 --> 01:15:37.670]  And I was talking to my IT people this morning, like 7 a.m., and I said, I'm surprised they haven't hit Band.Video yet.
[01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:39.630]  Well, 11 a.m.
[01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:46.453]  Central, when the show started, they hit Band.Video, because all these are on different hubs, different servers, different systems, so that we have lots of
[01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.804]  Lots of ships out there in the fight.
[01:15:49.804 --> 01:15:50.864]  I've learned that a long time ago.
[01:15:50.864 --> 01:15:53.145]  Don't have all your eggs in one basket.
[01:15:53.145 --> 01:15:56.146]  And we've got newswars.com and Paul Watson has summit.news.
[01:15:56.146 --> 01:15:58.307]  That's his site.
[01:15:58.307 --> 01:16:02.648]  And the enemy knows these are all targets and we're just going to launch five more sites because of this attack.
[01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:04.549]  That's our rule.
[01:16:04.549 --> 01:16:07.570]  Cut one head off Hydra, Hydra grows more.
[01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:09.671]  Cut the starfish up, we grow more.
[01:16:09.671 --> 01:16:11.512]  We grow.
[01:16:11.512 --> 01:16:12.972]  And we're going to do more too, don't you worry.
[01:16:12.972 --> 01:16:14.513]  And we have a lot of stuff the enemy doesn't even know is
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:17.961]  Ours.
[01:16:17.961 --> 01:16:20.142]  And not owned by me, but created by us.
[01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.763]  Created by the listeners and viewers.
[01:16:21.763 --> 01:16:24.425]  And their support.
[01:16:24.425 --> 01:16:27.086]  Because I am in this fight to win, not to lose.
[01:16:27.086 --> 01:16:28.807]  And I'll just be honest.
[01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:32.549]  I love it when the official Communist Party of China says I'm an enemy.
[01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:34.631]  I love it when the globalist pedophiles say I'm an enemy.
[01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:36.312]  And I love it when they attack us.
[01:16:36.312 --> 01:16:37.773]  Because I don't like pain.
[01:16:37.773 --> 01:16:39.234]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[01:16:39.234 --> 01:16:43.136]  But I do like being over the target and dishing out their destruction.
[01:16:44.318 --> 01:16:46.059]  And so I'm very, very excited about this.
[01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:59.226]  So let me tell you, you can't get the feeds right now at Bandot Video, but if you go to infowars.com or you go to newswars.com with this article, breaking, General Mattis plotted with Democratic Party to overthrow U.S.
[01:16:59.226 --> 01:17:02.128]  government and stall deep state dictatorship.
[01:17:02.128 --> 01:17:05.090]  That's even in the Washington Post, but they're saying it's a good thing.
[01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:08.772]  So they're now mainlining a coup off of the last planned coup they had.
[01:17:10.356 --> 01:17:12.358]  That has our backup feeds.
[01:17:12.358 --> 01:17:13.859]  We've got other backup feeds.
[01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:15.400]  We're sure they'll attack those.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.824]  We've got some other backup feeds from other servers and other systems.
[01:17:19.824 --> 01:17:28.092]  So right now, we've got a backup feed in there of audio and video so you can say, hey, this site is under attack.
[01:17:28.092 --> 01:17:32.595]  InfoWars is under attack for what they're saying, exposing the coup plan against Trump.
[01:17:32.595 --> 01:17:35.018]  This site's under hack attack for exposing the
[01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:38.303]  Coup plot by the Communist Chinese against Trump.
[01:17:38.303 --> 01:17:40.324]  That's what you tell them is what it is.
[01:17:40.324 --> 01:17:45.765]  And my crew's great, but there is a problem being in the trenches this long.
[01:17:45.765 --> 01:17:49.287]  We've been getting massive attacks that have been escalating the last few weeks.
[01:17:49.287 --> 01:17:52.027]  And I walked around and met with IT, and I said, we ought to write some articles.
[01:17:52.027 --> 01:17:53.128]  We're under attack, so folks, no.
[01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:55.969]  And they go, let's not make a big deal about it.
[01:17:55.969 --> 01:18:00.370]  And now that most of the sites are down, I'm walking around, and people are working.
[01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:01.211]  They're writing articles.
[01:18:01.211 --> 01:18:01.871]  They're doing research.
[01:18:01.871 --> 01:18:03.111]  It's like, eh.
[01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.292]  Because they've been around this so long that
[01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:25.045]  When the Huffington Post and this group funded by Soros that's going to contest the election comes out and says the main threat's InfoWars because they'll say we're stealing the election, they'll challenge us, and they'll expose that a bunch of the electors for Joe Biden are connected to pedophilia.
[01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:32.548]  That's what they war-gamed two days ago and they said we want Jones off air in official articles in Buzz.
[01:18:32.548 --> 01:18:34.108]  I mean, there it is right there.
[01:18:34.108 --> 01:18:34.988]  The Daily Beast.
[01:18:34.988 --> 01:18:36.469]  The left secretly preps for
[01:18:38.015 --> 01:18:40.196]  Make America Great Again to violence after election day.
[01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:42.597]  And then you read the article, print it again for me.
[01:18:42.597 --> 01:18:44.739]  They say the main threat is info wars.
[01:18:44.739 --> 01:18:46.519]  What do you think they're doing?
[01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:52.263]  I'm not up here saying that they think I'm the main threat because it's fun and I want to be the big guy.
[01:18:52.263 --> 01:18:57.185]  And I want everybody to go, oh, you're so smart, Alex.
[01:18:57.185 --> 01:18:58.526]  I am tickled pink.
[01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:00.807]  The Tucker Carlson gets it.
[01:19:00.807 --> 01:19:02.808]  The Gateway Pundit gets it.
[01:19:02.808 --> 01:19:04.549]  That Sean Hannity gets it.
[01:19:04.549 --> 01:19:05.930]  That Rush Limbaugh sounds just like me.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.504]  They don't sound just like me because I just made this up.
[01:19:10.504 --> 01:19:13.668]  I'm dialed in to what's going on.
[01:19:13.668 --> 01:19:21.978]  And yeah, it sounds radical to get up on the air and say, General Mattis with McMaster, like, let's get Roger Stone on immediately.
[01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:26.904]  We got... Dr. Stephen Cheney already wanted it.
[01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:31.306]  You usually can't get Pchenik on, but whenever this stuff's going on, he called us and wanted on.
[01:19:31.306 --> 01:19:33.667]  It's like, soon as I go, oh, Pchenik will call today.
[01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:35.287]  Yeah, Pchenik wants on today.
[01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:36.908]  And he used to run overthrow governments.
[01:19:36.908 --> 01:19:38.629]  I mean, he was high level.
[01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:39.950]  One of the founders of Delta Force, you name it.
[01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:43.291]  I mean, he's been the real deal, not the fake spies and all that fake crap.
[01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:44.572]  He's been the real deal.
[01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:51.455]  But what we're getting at here is this is an existential threat to the country and everybody right now.
[01:19:52.833 --> 01:20:03.296]  And so I just said to the producer of the show, I said, hey, call Pchenik and ask him on his Twitter to put out that InfoWars is under massive hack attack for exposing coup plots against Trump.
[01:20:03.296 --> 01:20:07.538]  And that I'm going on live right now with him from Pchenik's voice.
[01:20:07.538 --> 01:20:11.379]  And, you know, I walked around, I aired that little tape earlier and I walked around, I said, hey,
[01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:14.353]  I mean, you know we're under Chinese government attack.
[01:20:14.353 --> 01:20:16.273]  You can go talk to the server guys.
[01:20:16.273 --> 01:20:17.854]  They've got all the logs.
[01:20:17.854 --> 01:20:28.277]  We might want to make it a big deal that the Democrats say we're the main threat should be taken off air because we're blocking their attempt to challenge the electors and steal the election and cause a civil war.
[01:20:28.277 --> 01:20:30.097]  And again, they're like, Jones knows our plan.
[01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:31.618]  We've got to stop him, the main enemy.
[01:20:32.475 --> 01:20:33.736]  The main enemy cares about us.
[01:20:33.736 --> 01:20:35.398]  The main enemy knows we're dangerous.
[01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:37.319]  The main enemy knows we know what we do.
[01:20:37.319 --> 01:20:40.142]  But we're so close to it, everybody's like, eh.
[01:20:40.142 --> 01:20:41.863]  There could be firebombs.
[01:20:41.863 --> 01:20:45.206]  There could be a thousand pound bombs dropping on this building.
[01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:47.388]  And I love my crew.
[01:20:47.388 --> 01:20:52.012]  They are so used to being in the middle of this that they don't even care.
[01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:56.335]  It's like Colonel whatever his name is in Apocalypse Now that's actually based on real people.
[01:20:56.335 --> 01:20:56.916]  It's a composite.
[01:20:58.933 --> 01:21:01.575]  What's the name of the colonel in Apocalypse Now?
[01:21:01.575 --> 01:21:07.258]  And everybody's just shooting at him, explosions are going off around him, and he doesn't even care because he's done it so long.
[01:21:07.258 --> 01:21:10.740]  Colonel Kilgore, I think's the name, I won't remember.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.022]  And that's based on the real head of the air cab, the famous colonel that did all that stuff.
[01:21:16.912 --> 01:21:18.795]  This is what we're dealing with here.
[01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:20.618]  And our listeners have gotten used to it.
[01:21:20.618 --> 01:21:22.742]  Oh, 50 DNC lawsuits.
[01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:24.625]  Oh, all the attacks.
[01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:25.346]  Oh, all the dirty tricks.
[01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:26.247]  Well, that's just Jones.
[01:21:26.247 --> 01:21:27.569]  He can just handle it.
[01:21:27.569 --> 01:21:28.671]  I want you to understand.
[01:21:29.892 --> 01:21:47.881]  That we are a canary in the coal mine, that we are a bellwether, that we are a weathervane, and normally, you know, the weathervane is up there on top of the roof of the church or the building, and maybe it's a chicken or a rooster or a whale or a fish or a, you know, a bull, but when the wind blows, it lets you know which way it's blowing.
[01:21:47.881 --> 01:21:51.563]  The weathervane's bent down.
[01:21:51.563 --> 01:21:52.324]  The wind's so strong.
[01:21:53.097 --> 01:21:53.898]  It's never been like that.
[01:21:53.898 --> 01:22:02.543]  So I'm just trying to tell everybody, hey, I'm sitting here at the helm of this and I can tell you we got fire coming out the sides here.
[01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:08.107]  And I'm just trying to even get, because I figured it out, if I can't even get my crew excited about this.
[01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:12.411]  Then I can't get anybody excited about it.
[01:22:12.411 --> 01:22:15.593]  But see, that's a microcosm of all of us.
[01:22:15.593 --> 01:22:26.699]  With mass Stockholm Syndrome, myself included, we become accustomed to abuse, accustomed to pain, and instead of getting mad about it and overcoming it, we just learn to deal with it.
[01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:28.300]  I don't mind the pain.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:35.104]  Well, I don't mind the pain, but I don't want to be under the pain if it means my legs are being eaten off by a bunch of demonic globalist gremlins.
[01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:42.514]  And so, they don't want us on air, ladies and gentlemen, because we've got the enemy's number.
[01:22:42.514 --> 01:22:43.674]  We've got the data.
[01:22:43.674 --> 01:22:45.255]  We've got the Death Star codes.
[01:22:45.255 --> 01:22:46.356]  We've got the blueprints.
[01:22:46.356 --> 01:22:49.078]  WE GOT IT ALL!
[01:22:49.078 --> 01:22:53.181]  And I'm happy for the crew, who are great, hard-working folks, and I love them, to be oblivious in the middle of this.
[01:22:53.181 --> 01:22:53.641]  That's good.
[01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:54.882]  They're the best crew we ever had.
[01:22:54.882 --> 01:23:02.288]  But you've also got to then not adapt to not making it a big deal when, like, oh, Jones just got his head blown off in the parking lot.
[01:23:02.288 --> 01:23:03.188]  Well, that's no big deal.
[01:23:03.188 --> 01:23:03.889]  We expected that.
[01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:18.949]  Because we're so used to all their previous attacks that when the big one hits, this is a tactic, we don't respond because we're so used to being punched in the nose and pedophiles on TV saying we're gonna screw your son on Netflix for real.
[01:23:18.949 --> 01:23:21.730]  We got your 10-year-old, we're gonna have sex with him right now.
[01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:25.591]  We're gonna kill babies, we're gonna devil worship, pedophilia's good!
[01:23:26.525 --> 01:23:29.627]  It's all throwing it in your face to make you give up.
[01:23:29.627 --> 01:23:30.308]  Don't give up.
[01:23:30.308 --> 01:23:34.631]  And I know you're not even giving up where you accept it, but you give up where you just tune out.
[01:23:34.631 --> 01:23:35.352]  No!
[01:23:35.352 --> 01:23:36.633]  Don't tune out!
[01:23:36.633 --> 01:23:45.879]  Grab the electrical cords and... Because now is the time to fully face it and get into it and not tune out any of it!
[01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:48.481]  You must take it all on now!
[01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:49.602]  The answer to 1984.
[01:24:06.093 --> 01:24:10.476]  InfoWars has been banned.
[01:24:10.476 --> 01:24:10.836]  Arrested.
[01:24:10.836 --> 01:24:17.180]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.841]  Because we are effective.
[01:24:20.485 --> 01:24:22.306]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:24:22.306 --> 01:24:24.588]  Go to band.video.
[01:24:24.588 --> 01:24:28.710]  Download the videos and share.
[01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:36.035]  Support The Information War at infowarstore.com.
[01:24:36.035 --> 01:24:38.396]  And never give up the fight.
[01:24:38.396 --> 01:24:49.042]  InfoWars.com
[01:24:52.216 --> 01:24:58.841]  You've always had a pledge from me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human, temporal truth can get.
[01:24:58.841 --> 01:25:09.249]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored, darkly, kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive, so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:12.311]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[01:25:12.311 --> 01:25:17.435]  So, when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[01:25:17.435 --> 01:25:18.596]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[01:25:19.667 --> 01:25:26.280]  And when I tell you that this country and the world is under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.469]  You can look out the window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news, you can see
[01:25:31.749 --> 01:25:33.390]  But you've got this commitment.
[01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:35.391]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:37.052]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[01:25:37.052 --> 01:25:43.396]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and it only happens when you support what you've been doing.
[01:25:43.396 --> 01:25:44.357]  So again, I thank you.
[01:25:44.357 --> 01:25:50.040]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:50.821]  Again, I thank you all.
[01:25:52.122 --> 01:25:58.006]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[01:25:58.006 --> 01:25:59.827]  I don't say it to scare you.
[01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:02.329]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:06.071]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[01:26:06.071 --> 01:26:13.817]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[01:26:13.817 --> 01:26:20.481]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:21.902]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[01:26:22.642 --> 01:26:29.304]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[01:26:29.304 --> 01:26:32.164]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[01:26:32.164 --> 01:26:34.065]  And it's coming out in the open.
[01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:39.426]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:41.387]  But others are going to fight.
[01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:46.368]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:46.868]  No.
[01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.869]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[01:26:49.869 --> 01:26:50.709]  Research what that is.
[01:26:53.777 --> 01:27:03.319]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:16.322]  I'm just standing in this briefing room right now.
[01:27:16.322 --> 01:27:22.163]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:27:25.275 --> 01:27:37.122]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:27:37.122 --> 01:27:38.863]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:27:38.863 --> 01:27:42.505]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:28:03.417 --> 01:28:09.344]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[01:28:09.344 --> 01:28:15.312]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[01:28:26.857 --> 01:28:28.218]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:28:28.218 --> 01:28:29.580]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:35.206]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:28:35.206 --> 01:28:40.852]  This is CNN.
[01:28:40.852 --> 01:28:42.433]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:28:55.427 --> 01:28:59.749]  InfoWars has been banned.
[01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:00.229]  Arrested.
[01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:06.451]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:09.772]  Because we are effective.
[01:29:09.772 --> 01:29:11.513]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:13.894]  Go to Banned.Video.
[01:29:13.894 --> 01:29:17.995]  Download the videos and share.
[01:29:17.995 --> 01:29:21.677]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:29:25.323 --> 01:29:27.051]  And never give up the fight!
[01:29:47.202 --> 01:29:54.152]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:29:54.152 --> 01:29:58.458]  You better believe you got one!
[01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:03.505]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:30:21.168 --> 01:30:22.570]  I am not a sadomasochist.
[01:30:23.715 --> 01:30:24.556]  I'm not a masochist.
[01:30:24.556 --> 01:30:26.798]  I don't like to deal out pain.
[01:30:26.798 --> 01:30:28.900]  I like to deal out pleasure.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:31.863]  But I like to get tyrants off my back.
[01:30:31.863 --> 01:30:40.392]  And I do take a little bit of satisfaction when they're broken beneath my feet.
[01:30:40.392 --> 01:30:42.554]  And we've got big IT companies.
[01:30:42.554 --> 01:30:43.495]  We've got Cloudflare.
[01:30:43.495 --> 01:30:44.916]  We've got the biggest companies out there.
[01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:54.566]  We have been hit the last few weeks accelerating up by some of the largest private attacks ever and it's all out of communist China.
[01:30:54.566 --> 01:30:58.029]  And I'll just tell you, I'm proud of that.
[01:30:58.029 --> 01:31:02.553]  I'm proud that the Daily Beast and that CNN
[01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:28.675]  And on top of that, The Huffington Post came out and said that this group funded by Soros that's going to coordinate all the uprisings and the quote, transition to Biden getting into office, that that group's main fear is that Alex Jones and InfoWars, and that means Roger Stone, part of that, is going to expose Soros and pedophile rings and corruption.
[01:31:28.675 --> 01:31:30.016]  Let's put those articles up if we can.
[01:31:30.016 --> 01:31:31.077]  We have an InfoWars article about it.
[01:31:31.077 --> 01:31:32.999]  We also have the Daily Beast and others.
[01:31:34.537 --> 01:31:35.377]  Why do they fear us?
[01:31:35.377 --> 01:31:38.058]  Because they know we've got their number.
[01:31:38.058 --> 01:31:43.300]  Now, I already wanted to get Roger Stone on today about this, but I saw it last night, and he's suddenly able to come on.
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.741]  I really appreciate him.
[01:31:44.741 --> 01:31:53.224]  Talk about a almost political prisoner, but secretly, you know, investigated, lied about, financially bankrupted.
[01:31:55.117 --> 01:31:56.539]  And I'm in the same position.
[01:31:56.539 --> 01:31:57.640]  He knows the inside baseball.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:03.688]  We're not at liberty to get into at this point, but there is a massive harassment campaign against everybody that they see on the inner orbit of Trump.
[01:32:03.688 --> 01:32:05.571]  Everyone they see is loyal.
[01:32:05.571 --> 01:32:11.859]  And here is Roger Stone, who first exposed McMaster and Fiona Hill, and then General Mattis.
[01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:16.002]  Saying that Mattis and others may have been part of the coup plot.
[01:32:16.002 --> 01:32:17.083]  Now it's in Woodward's book.
[01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:19.004]  I know most of Woodward's book is bull.
[01:32:19.004 --> 01:32:21.886]  We'll walk that through and unpack that with Roger Stone.
[01:32:21.886 --> 01:32:31.872]  But, the way he fawns over the attempted coup plan, which we know was going on, because right at the time this was happening they were on the news saying there may be a coup, getting us ready.
[01:32:31.872 --> 01:32:36.775]  And Roger Stone and I, I'll just tell you, we're loyal Americans to ourselves, to our families, to the President.
[01:32:36.775 --> 01:32:38.376]  Which I don't see as a heroic effort.
[01:32:38.376 --> 01:32:40.657]  People call Roger a hero, they call me a hero.
[01:32:40.657 --> 01:32:42.819]  The reason I say that is I don't want to be seen as a hero.
[01:32:43.672 --> 01:32:45.713]  It's normal.
[01:32:45.713 --> 01:32:52.277]  You know, it turns out the FBI, under the control of the Deep State, reached out to over 2,000 people.
[01:32:52.277 --> 01:32:54.438]  It's in the Senate report and others.
[01:32:54.438 --> 01:32:57.180]  And they couldn't get one American to take Russian money.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.701]  They tried to get me to take Russian money.
[01:32:58.701 --> 01:32:59.661]  Oh yeah.
[01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:01.282]  It's been reported to the FBI.
[01:33:01.282 --> 01:33:03.183]  They sent fake informants at Roger.
[01:33:03.183 --> 01:33:04.264]  Everybody he knew.
[01:33:04.264 --> 01:33:09.146]  They couldn't get one American to take this Russian money.
[01:33:09.146 --> 01:33:09.947]  It wasn't Russian money.
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.202]  And this is before this was even a story.
[01:33:12.202 --> 01:33:13.283]  This was in the campaign.
[01:33:13.283 --> 01:33:20.993]  They had to set up Carter Page and CIA operatives that had a job to spy on Russians and say, oh look, he met with Russians because it was his job.
[01:33:20.993 --> 01:33:24.418]  And then, no, he was innocent.
[01:33:24.418 --> 01:33:26.621]  No, General Flynn's a patriot and a hero.
[01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:28.523]  And Roger Stone is a hero what he's gone through.
[01:33:29.458 --> 01:33:32.619]  And the way he's been stalwart about it, but it really is just our duty.
[01:33:32.619 --> 01:33:44.444]  But Roger, I had to get you on just because 50-something days out, and the attacks on us have never been anywhere near this, and it's a bellwether for the contested election, and the main Soros group says that they see us as the main enemy.
[01:33:44.444 --> 01:33:47.485]  Roger Stone, what do you make of the coup plot against America?
[01:33:47.485 --> 01:33:50.667]  I mean, even Zero Heads gets it right.
[01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:52.427]  Mattis wanted to overthrow the U.S.
[01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:52.868]  government.
[01:33:52.868 --> 01:33:53.708]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.501]  I know we were working on Roger's audio earlier.
[01:34:01.501 --> 01:34:07.065]  Roger, can you hear me?
[01:34:07.065 --> 01:34:08.486]  Let's just go with phone.
[01:34:08.486 --> 01:34:10.848]  Let's go with phone like I originally wanted, guys, okay?
[01:34:10.848 --> 01:34:13.090]  Let's just do that.
[01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:19.795]  Okay, well, Roger, can you hear me?
[01:34:19.795 --> 01:34:20.916]  Yes, he didn't hang up.
[01:34:20.916 --> 01:34:21.717]  He's on the line, guys.
[01:34:21.717 --> 01:34:23.498]  He just doesn't have audio.
[01:34:23.498 --> 01:34:24.258]  I'm with you.
[01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:25.139]  Yes, yes, you're there.
[01:34:25.139 --> 01:34:25.900]  Thank you, sir.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:28.662]  Okay, Roger, what do you make of the coup attempts and everything that's happening?
[01:34:30.478 --> 01:34:41.062]  Well, Alex, it's kind of ironic because you have, you predicted this decades ago, literally decades ago.
[01:34:41.062 --> 01:34:47.645]  For almost three decades, I guess, you have been saying, as I have, that this moment would come.
[01:34:47.645 --> 01:34:50.166]  And now it's here.
[01:34:50.166 --> 01:34:52.747]  And it's multifaceted.
[01:34:52.747 --> 01:34:58.550]  First of all, they use their fake news media outlets to destabilize the president.
[01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:59.490]  I'll give you an example.
[01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:17.743]  Atlantic Magazine reports that there are four unidentified sources who will not come forward by name because they fear retribution, who say that the President denigrated members of our military.
[01:35:17.743 --> 01:35:23.768]  The guy who wrote this, Jeff Goldberg, is a proven congenital liar.
[01:35:23.768 --> 01:35:27.991]  He has a journalistic history of making things up that are not true.
[01:35:28.917 --> 01:35:33.500]  Atlantic Magazine has no proof of this whatsoever.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.742]  But Alex, let me tell you what I heard.
[01:35:35.742 --> 01:35:39.484]  I have four anonymous sources who work at Atlantic Magazine.
[01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:47.609]  They're afraid to come forward, of course, because of retribution, but they tell me this story was completely and totally fabricated.
[01:35:47.609 --> 01:35:48.190]  How do you like that?
[01:35:49.022 --> 01:35:50.862]  Well, we know it was, and I'm glad we got you on the line.
[01:35:50.862 --> 01:36:00.424]  We'll come back next segment, give you the floor to talk about Jeffrey Goldberg, who I know came here and visited me six years ago, never wrote a story, wrote a story a few months ago that almost none of it was true.
[01:36:00.424 --> 01:36:02.445]  And so does he work for the Israelis, or who does he work for?
[01:36:02.445 --> 01:36:06.606]  I think he works in a larger sense for the deep state.
[01:36:06.606 --> 01:36:09.286]  First, of course, of course, he works for himself.
[01:36:09.286 --> 01:36:13.107]  There's a lot of money in denigrating Donald Trump.
[01:36:13.107 --> 01:36:13.967]  Now you have this
[01:36:14.503 --> 01:36:15.663]  Let's go
[01:36:36.471 --> 01:36:44.361]  But yet, the entire fake news media, like black words on the phone wire, they all jump on this story.
[01:36:44.361 --> 01:36:47.746]  Alright Roger, back in a few minutes, we'll get into it right now with Roger Stone.
[01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:57.796]  Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human?
[01:36:57.796 --> 01:36:59.217]  Love to censor people.
[01:36:59.217 --> 01:37:03.060]  Love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.180]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:10.585]  The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watson, the founder and owner of IBM, to carry out eugenics.
[01:37:10.585 --> 01:37:12.706]  And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany.
[01:37:12.706 --> 01:37:15.388]  That's what the tattoos were on the slaves' arms.
[01:37:15.388 --> 01:37:16.789]  It would decide who lived and who died.
[01:37:16.969 --> 01:37:23.314]  So, from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making humans obsolete.
[01:37:23.314 --> 01:37:28.498]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein and fat in it to make your child's brain small.
[01:37:28.498 --> 01:37:34.423]  The same people that said, put babies in cribs, separate from their mothers, that lowers IQs about 20 points on average as well.
[01:37:34.423 --> 01:37:39.046]  These are hardcore eugenicists, survival of the fittest, social Darwinists.
[01:37:39.046 --> 01:37:40.047]  Grow up, world.
[01:37:40.047 --> 01:37:41.048]  Admit the truth.
[01:37:41.048 --> 01:37:44.791]  Quit being soft as nuts and letting these loafers run your lives.
[01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:46.072]  They are your mortal enemies.
[01:37:46.272 --> 01:37:47.955]  They want you dead.
[01:37:47.955 --> 01:37:50.498]  Do you understand that?
[01:37:50.498 --> 01:37:53.162]  The clock is ticking on the once free world.
[01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:57.483]  And the free press is under attack more than ever.
[01:37:57.483 --> 01:38:08.008]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day, without even trying to find them, of press being arrested in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:38:08.008 --> 01:38:12.751]  And it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech, doing it.
[01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:19.795]  They are the authoritarians, they work for the Chai Com Globalist Combine, and they are working around the clock
[01:38:20.768 --> 01:38:22.549]  to silence InfoWars.
[01:38:22.549 --> 01:38:30.294]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us, and a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[01:38:30.294 --> 01:38:39.901]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential, and I thank you all for it.
[01:38:39.901 --> 01:38:47.246]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the InfoWar and make your life healthier and better at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:38:47.246 --> 01:38:48.787]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:38:51.533 --> 01:38:57.635]  The mask is more than just a symbol of subservience, being a blind follower, not knowing facts and science.
[01:38:57.635 --> 01:39:01.096]  It's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman.
[01:39:01.096 --> 01:39:02.777]  And they tell you, you are not essential.
[01:39:02.777 --> 01:39:08.519]  Remember, first they said no more industry, you'll be a service economy, and now they tell you service is not essential.
[01:39:08.519 --> 01:39:11.640]  This has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time?
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:13.521]  In Operation Lockstep and other documents, the
[01:39:14.341 --> 01:39:20.244]  Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor.
[01:39:20.244 --> 01:39:30.610]  And under their controls, you can finally be starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very, very weak bio-weapons that won't affect anyone that actually gets their RDA of vitamins and minerals.
[01:39:30.610 --> 01:39:33.011]  And so that's the plan for you and your family.
[01:39:33.011 --> 01:39:36.113]  Now that you're tuned into this broadcast, you've checked this out for yourself, you know it's true.
[01:39:36.113 --> 01:39:38.354]  So, let's start warning the sheep.
[01:39:39.014 --> 01:39:40.955]  Let's start educating them now.
[01:39:40.955 --> 01:39:46.299]  I just went and swam at the lake and I walked around for 20 minutes educating people after I got out of the water.
[01:39:46.299 --> 01:39:47.040]  It's that simple.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.361]  We must take action now or be slaves forever.
[01:39:49.361 --> 01:39:49.922]  This is life and death.
[01:39:50.808 --> 01:39:57.773]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[01:39:57.773 --> 01:40:03.216]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[01:40:03.216 --> 01:40:19.887]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[01:40:20.728 --> 01:40:21.268]  I think so.
[01:40:54.850 --> 01:41:04.196]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:04.196 --> 01:41:21.588]  Roger Stone joins us exclusively from the road.
[01:41:22.879 --> 01:41:31.491]  On AP Reuters, all of them have the headline, Mattis planned military coup against the president with bipartisan group.
[01:41:31.491 --> 01:41:32.312]  Incredible.
[01:41:32.312 --> 01:41:33.153]  How much of it's true?
[01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.135]  Well, we know they were planning a coup.
[01:41:34.135 --> 01:41:37.740]  It was Roger Stone on this show over two years ago, said Mattis with McMaster.
[01:41:39.127 --> 01:41:42.269]  Was planning a 25th Amendment coup.
[01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:47.974]  And then we've got all of the DNC and this new Soros group saying the main threat's Infowars.
[01:41:47.974 --> 01:41:54.058]  They want us taken off the air because they're going to contest the election and they're worried that we'll expose it.
[01:41:54.058 --> 01:41:54.479]  Wow!
[01:41:54.479 --> 01:41:58.081]  Roger Stone, I know that you're on the road, very busy person.
[01:41:58.081 --> 01:42:00.143]  Thanks for joining us with your analysis.
[01:42:00.143 --> 01:42:02.425]  Total vindication of you, my friend.
[01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:03.946]  You're the person that exposed Mattis.
[01:42:04.466 --> 01:42:11.590]  And Fiona Hill and McMaster, actually two and a half years ago, my friend, and they tried to put you in prison because of it.
[01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:20.875]  Well, in total exoneration for InfoWars, because we are the clarion call to keep the people up to date on what's really going on.
[01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:32.602]  As Fox has been co-opted, as obstacles are put in the way through internet censorship to the truth, InfoWars continues to break through.
[01:42:33.106 --> 01:42:35.987]  And we're not going to quit, so they can forget that.
[01:42:35.987 --> 01:42:38.008]  Alex, this is Armageddon.
[01:42:38.008 --> 01:42:39.289]  We're there.
[01:42:39.289 --> 01:42:43.871]  This is the place you predicted for three years we were headed.
[01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:46.432]  They will pull out all stops.
[01:42:46.432 --> 01:42:58.657]  There is no act illegal, immoral, or outrageous that the deep state will not utilize in an attempt to steal back the American government, which to their shock they lost control of in 2016.
[01:43:00.938 --> 01:43:22.551]  It is absolutely true that Generals Mattis and former General McMaster canvassed a number of the Trump Cabinet members, recognizing they needed a majority of the Cabinet and the approval of Mike Pence, the Vice President, to remove the President.
[01:43:24.432 --> 01:43:33.778]  Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was actively involved in trying to line up cabinet members who would sign on.
[01:43:33.778 --> 01:43:43.765]  The entire coup attempt collapsed when Nikki Haley blew the whistle, refused to join the coup, and told the President.
[01:43:44.927 --> 01:43:55.289]  Not because she's a hero, but because she's a neocon looking down the road and understands the popularity of Trumpism within the Republican Party.
[01:43:55.289 --> 01:43:58.390]  Well, yeah, she knows what happened to the people that stabbed Julius Caesar to death.
[01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:59.950]  It didn't end well.
[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:00.950]  Exactly.
[01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:07.552]  So we are now in a situation in which they're telegraphing their punches.
[01:44:07.552 --> 01:44:10.512]  Trump is going to lose the election.
[01:44:10.512 --> 01:44:12.553]  He's going to refuse to leave the White House.
[01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:14.593]  The military is going to replace him.
[01:44:16.132 --> 01:44:23.617]  Pelosi has said it, Schumer has said it, Nadler has said it, Schiff has said it, Biden has said it, Kamala has said it.
[01:44:23.617 --> 01:44:26.698]  Let me translate it for you.
[01:44:26.698 --> 01:44:35.543]  You are going to try to steal the election, and if you think that Trump and his supporters are going to stand down and let that happen, you're dreaming.
[01:44:35.543 --> 01:44:36.884]  Dreaming.
[01:44:36.884 --> 01:44:39.806]  What's needed now, Alex, is not a plan for election day.
[01:44:40.543 --> 01:44:54.513]  Because these new stories from the New York Times about how the Trump campaign has squandered millions and millions and millions of dollars, and is going to be financially short in the closing weeks, blow my mind.
[01:44:54.513 --> 01:44:56.594]  Just blow my mind.
[01:44:56.594 --> 01:45:07.542]  We also know that super PACs supporting Joe Biden have raised over $800 million, where super PACs supporting President Trump have raised only $200 million.
[01:45:09.361 --> 01:45:24.274]  So we will be outgunned in the close, but I still honestly believe in my heart that if only voters who are entitled to legally vote because they are citizens vote, and they vote once, Donald Trump will be elected president.
[01:45:25.586 --> 01:45:32.608]  The ballots in Nevada on election night should be seized by federal marshals and taken from the state.
[01:45:32.608 --> 01:45:34.788]  They are completely corrupted.
[01:45:34.788 --> 01:45:40.730]  No vote should be counted from the state of Nevada if that turns out to be the provable case.
[01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:45.131]  We can prove voter fraud in the absentee right now.
[01:45:45.131 --> 01:45:51.633]  Send federal marshals to the Clark County Board of Elections, Mr. President.
[01:45:51.633 --> 01:45:52.513]  It's all there.
[01:45:54.144 --> 01:45:56.366]  Roger Stone, that was my next question.
[01:45:56.366 --> 01:45:58.207]  What does Trump need to do with 33 Days Out?
[01:45:58.207 --> 01:46:00.729]  Because it's clear they think they can steal it.
[01:46:00.729 --> 01:46:02.730]  They've said they're going to oppose it.
[01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:06.113]  Big Tech Zuckerberg says they're going to launch it for weeks or months.
[01:46:06.113 --> 01:46:06.733]  Hold it up.
[01:46:06.733 --> 01:46:08.435]  I mean, that's their plan.
[01:46:08.435 --> 01:46:10.536]  How do we counter this?
[01:46:10.536 --> 01:46:14.699]  The President should call former Congressman Bob Barr.
[01:46:14.699 --> 01:46:18.142]  And he should ask him, he should appoint him a special counsel.
[01:46:18.142 --> 01:46:22.405]  He should order his appointment as a special counsel with the specific task
[01:46:23.058 --> 01:46:23.418]  Thank you.
[01:46:41.167 --> 01:46:53.375]  Exactly, and the whole Democrat strategy is if federal officers or locals enforce election law, that's criminal and that's blocking votes when they have bombed the country with 80 million basically fake ballots to gum things up on purpose.
[01:46:53.375 --> 01:47:02.101]  And the Clintons are now, as you said, chortling, admitting that they have a military plan once the election is in question to remove Trump.
[01:47:02.101 --> 01:47:03.722]  Is that wishful thinking?
[01:47:03.722 --> 01:47:06.944]  Or if they have a small cadre and they're trying to act powerful, what's the plan?
[01:47:07.853 --> 01:47:31.651]  I don't want to overplay the facts here, but if someone will study the President's authority in the Insurrection Act and in his ability to impose martial law, if there's widespread screening, he will have the authority to arrest Zuckerberg, to arrest Tim Cook, to arrest the Clintons, to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity.
[01:47:31.651 --> 01:47:36.395]  I do not advocate preventive detention, but people who commit crimes,
[01:47:37.115 --> 01:47:42.558]  I think they can continue to get away with it because we have two-tiered justice are just wrong.
[01:47:42.558 --> 01:47:43.179]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:47:43.179 --> 01:47:52.644]  When we have a Chai Combat, big tech running slave camps in China, belligerently trying to steal the election, and they've pressed the attack and they won't stop, they believe in a game of chicken.
[01:47:52.644 --> 01:47:53.705]  They're about to win.
[01:47:53.705 --> 01:47:57.607]  I've never heard you, and I've seen you back 40 years ago on TV, talk like this.
[01:47:57.607 --> 01:47:58.808]  You're not an alarmist.
[01:47:58.808 --> 01:47:59.508]  You're a realist.
[01:47:59.508 --> 01:48:01.770]  This is the wheelhouse they've taken us to.
[01:48:02.793 --> 01:48:11.356]  Well, the Republican structure in the states and nationally is not prepared for the aftermath of this election, legally or politically.
[01:48:11.356 --> 01:48:12.797]  They're not prepared.
[01:48:12.797 --> 01:48:18.759]  There's going to be widespread, obvious, blatant, flagrant illegality.
[01:48:18.759 --> 01:48:21.380]  The authority exists to stop that.
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:23.401]  It will have to be used if necessary.
[01:48:24.342 --> 01:48:31.744]  I'm not jumping the gun, but I can just tell you right now, the votes from Nevada should not be counted.
[01:48:31.744 --> 01:48:34.765]  They are already flooded with illegals.
[01:48:34.765 --> 01:48:40.646]  If Harry Reid is involved, take Harry Reid into custody and charge him.
[01:48:40.646 --> 01:48:45.227]  This is not complicated and it is 100% legal.
[01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:48.348]  Governor Seselak is a punk.
[01:48:48.348 --> 01:48:50.909]  He should not face down the President of the United States.
[01:48:51.624 --> 01:48:53.265]  Governor, this is the President.
[01:48:53.265 --> 01:48:56.007]  I've just nationalized your state police.
[01:48:56.007 --> 01:48:57.448]  You follow me?
[01:48:57.448 --> 01:49:01.211]  Well, and they've got groups marching everywhere saying, death to America and burning down police stations.
[01:49:01.211 --> 01:49:04.132]  I mean, they're really making their move, Roger.
[01:49:04.132 --> 01:49:05.774]  Why do you think, um...
[01:49:06.789 --> 01:49:21.353]  The big Democrat websites, Daily Beast, all of them have come out and said they're particularly worried about Infowars challenging their electors, the ones for Biden, because they say they're going to, just like last time, try to target Trump electors with threats, and they're claiming that we're going to be threatening them.
[01:49:21.353 --> 01:49:25.654]  We know Pelosi's daughter tried to get me arrested four years ago, claiming I harassed electors.
[01:49:25.654 --> 01:49:26.374]  I didn't know such a thing.
[01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:27.654]  I said what she was doing was criminal.
[01:49:27.654 --> 01:49:32.556]  You know, again, it's always with these groups, projection.
[01:49:32.556 --> 01:49:33.296]  It's projection.
[01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:43.635]  But if the Daily Beast is involved in provably seditious and illegal activities, their entire staff can be taken into custody and their office can be shut down.
[01:49:43.635 --> 01:49:44.775]  They want to play war?
[01:49:44.775 --> 01:49:46.236]  This is war.
[01:49:46.236 --> 01:49:48.117]  I'm for a legal election.
[01:49:48.117 --> 01:49:55.499]  Everything I'm going to be involved with in terms of helping Donald Trump get elected will be perfectly transparent and legal.
[01:49:55.499 --> 01:49:56.640]  They cannot say that.
[01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:03.754]  The average age of the person who writes to the Daily Beast is, the average IQ, pardon me, is probably 75.
[01:50:03.754 --> 01:50:07.197]  They don't know what they're talking about.
[01:50:07.197 --> 01:50:07.957]  Well, you said it.
[01:50:07.957 --> 01:50:26.051]  They're playing war, saying they're going to kill everybody and overthrow everything and end the country, which is completely psychotic, while saying we're the traitors in bed with the Russians, and they've rebooted the whole Russia canard again, as you know, with Coats running around putting that out, saying, well, he felt like Trump might, that Trump might be under Putin's control.
[01:50:27.336 --> 01:50:29.777]  Uh, but Dan Coats is a moron.
[01:50:29.777 --> 01:50:35.719]  Dan Coats, I challenge him publicly to take an IQ test and publish the results.
[01:50:35.719 --> 01:50:41.401]  I'd like to go back to the personnel files and see who it is that recommended his appointment to the president.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.161]  Nothing the man says can be believed.
[01:50:44.161 --> 01:50:47.664]  He is a deep state stooge with an IQ of 70.
[01:50:47.664 --> 01:51:00.892]  How big is it though that the coup plot that you and I first reported on has now been confirmed by them so Woodward can promote it as the solution as if Mad Dog Mattis is a good guy?
[01:51:00.892 --> 01:51:04.254]  You know, I actually think they hurt the chances of pulling this off.
[01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:08.423]  I mean, force will be met with force.
[01:51:08.423 --> 01:51:10.685]  That's the way this is going to have to work.
[01:51:10.685 --> 01:51:11.946]  It's really unfortunate.
[01:51:11.946 --> 01:51:13.607]  I'm not an advocate of that.
[01:51:13.607 --> 01:51:15.369]  I'd like to have an honest election.
[01:51:16.162 --> 01:51:28.613]  StoneDefenseFund.com, Stone Cold Truth.
[01:51:28.613 --> 01:51:30.714]  I know you're going into a meeting and you've got to go.
[01:51:30.714 --> 01:51:31.996]  I'll talk to you and say bye during the break.
[01:51:31.996 --> 01:51:32.936]  If you can do five more minutes, you can.
[01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:33.597]  If you can't, I understand.
[01:51:33.597 --> 01:51:37.060]  But I want to ask you then about what you expect in this election and what Trump can do.
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:37.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:38.241]  Stay with us.
[01:51:40.799 --> 01:51:54.642]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[01:51:54.642 --> 01:51:59.983]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[01:51:59.983 --> 01:52:00.683]  But it's true.
[01:52:00.683 --> 01:52:04.084]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[01:52:04.824 --> 01:52:07.306]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[01:52:07.306 --> 01:52:09.388]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[01:52:09.388 --> 01:52:11.150]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[01:52:11.150 --> 01:52:12.011]  And we're still here.
[01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:16.435]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[01:52:16.435 --> 01:52:18.056]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[01:52:18.056 --> 01:52:20.198]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[01:52:20.198 --> 01:52:24.002]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[01:52:24.582 --> 01:52:25.682]  You can't have InfoWars.
[01:52:25.682 --> 01:52:29.724]  It's been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[01:52:29.724 --> 01:52:31.804]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[01:52:31.804 --> 01:52:34.485]  So thank you all and get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:52:34.485 --> 01:52:37.946]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[01:52:37.946 --> 01:52:39.707]  They're wonderful products and they support the InfoWars.
[01:52:39.707 --> 01:52:39.947]  Thank you.
[01:52:42.415 --> 01:52:53.708]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you'd think it was magic.
[01:52:53.708 --> 01:52:57.353]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[01:52:57.353 --> 01:53:00.957]  So for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[01:53:01.978 --> 01:53:10.226]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[01:53:10.226 --> 01:53:12.168]  They're following magnetic lines.
[01:53:12.168 --> 01:53:14.611]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[01:53:14.611 --> 01:53:17.213]  We now know scientifically what's going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[01:53:17.213 --> 01:53:21.318]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[01:53:21.318 --> 01:53:23.300]  We're talking about all the things we don't understand, but we know it's there.
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:44.295]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people, and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it, because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space-time continuum.
[01:53:44.295 --> 01:53:46.896]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:09.768 --> 01:54:18.614]  Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen, is here to respond to the public coup plot now being reported by the Associated Press Reuters by the deep state against President Trump.
[01:54:18.614 --> 01:54:20.575]  We are living in incredible times.
[01:54:20.575 --> 01:54:24.298]  Roger Stone, how would you define where we are right now?
[01:54:24.298 --> 01:54:29.962]  Well, the mainstream media, the corporate owned media, has now confirmed, absolutely,
[01:54:30.450 --> 01:54:37.274]  What we reported here on InfoWars almost two years ago, there was a coup plot.
[01:54:37.274 --> 01:54:45.500]  The coup plot involved General James Mattis, involved Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, it involved H.R.
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.500]  McMaster.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:49.702]  These are open acts of sedition.
[01:54:49.702 --> 01:54:56.026]  Attorney General Bill Barr should order the arrest of these traitors today.
[01:54:56.026 --> 01:54:58.888]  That is an active act of sedition.
[01:54:58.888 --> 01:54:59.889]  You have witnesses.
[01:55:00.765 --> 01:55:03.706]  Nikki Haley among them.
[01:55:03.706 --> 01:55:12.650]  I understand that there were other cabinet members approached who declined and were appalled at this act of disloyalty.
[01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:24.355]  The second attempt here is going to run a fraudulent election and then use their advantage in the fake news media megaphone to drown out objections.
[01:55:24.355 --> 01:55:28.197]  They are lighting the fuse to a powder keg.
[01:55:28.197 --> 01:55:30.218]  The American people will not stand
[01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:32.873]  for a stolen election.
[01:55:32.873 --> 01:55:34.813]  They simply won't.
[01:55:34.813 --> 01:55:38.875]  So I think we're headed to very difficult times.
[01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:45.497]  The reason InfoWars is so important is they want to cut our ability to communicate with each other.
[01:55:45.497 --> 01:55:50.958]  That's what sets the secondary purpose of all this internet censorship.
[01:55:50.958 --> 01:55:55.019]  Now, Alex, I was supposed to give a speech in New York earlier in the week.
[01:55:55.019 --> 01:56:00.221]  I had to cancel because Mrs. Stone has been diagnosed with a very
[01:56:00.874 --> 01:56:06.076]  severe case of rheumatoid arthritis.
[01:56:06.076 --> 01:56:12.638]  Because the most effective medications for that, Maladie, lower your immunity.
[01:56:12.638 --> 01:56:21.242]  Lowering her immunity at this juncture during a pandemic is not a great idea, so she is in a great deal of pain.
[01:56:21.242 --> 01:56:27.124]  This is contributing to our continued financial problems, which are caused by the Mueller witch hunt.
[01:56:27.679 --> 01:56:34.287]  People who want to help us, we need the help now at StoneFamilyFund.com.
[01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:36.930]  Absolutely, let me say this, Stone, say it again.
[01:56:37.944 --> 01:56:40.786]  StoneFamilyFund.com.
[01:56:40.786 --> 01:56:47.292]  People don't know what they've done to us, what they've done to you, and how close we are, both you and I, to not being able to operate.
[01:56:47.292 --> 01:56:48.713]  But we're not going to back down regardless.
[01:56:48.713 --> 01:56:52.956]  But listeners, prayer and support and financial support has been incredible.
[01:56:52.956 --> 01:56:58.561]  I see you get tears in your eyes, Roger, when you talk about supporters or somebody walks up and shakes your hand on the street and pats your back.
[01:56:58.561 --> 01:56:59.282]  You've been through a lot.
[01:56:59.282 --> 01:57:00.583]  I see you get tears in your eyes.
[01:57:00.583 --> 01:57:02.484]  When I first met you years ago, you weren't like that.
[01:57:02.484 --> 01:57:04.166]  I mean, you've been through a lot.
[01:57:04.166 --> 01:57:05.647]  But I think you're stronger now, Roger.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.942]  Well, look, we are struggling to get back on our feet.
[01:57:09.942 --> 01:57:12.504]  We certainly aren't living a lavish lifestyle.
[01:57:12.504 --> 01:57:25.892]  I'm very optimistic about the future, but in the meantime, between rent, and having lost our insurance, and prescription medicines, and medical care, mostly for Mrs. Stone, we're fighting for our lives.
[01:57:25.892 --> 01:57:27.113]  I know you are, I know you're not.
[01:57:29.269 --> 01:57:35.472]  You were not like your partner 30 years ago who did have a lot of money, Manafort, who also was a patriot and didn't lie about the president.
[01:57:35.472 --> 01:57:36.173]  Incredible times.
[01:57:36.173 --> 01:57:38.394]  Roger, I know you're on your way out to Los Angeles.
[01:57:38.394 --> 01:57:39.274]  You'll be back soon.
[01:57:39.274 --> 01:57:43.657]  On your way back, you ought to stop in Austin and host with us here, my friend.
[01:57:43.657 --> 01:57:43.957]  All right.
[01:57:43.957 --> 01:57:44.858]  I'll give that some thought.
[01:57:44.858 --> 01:57:45.818]  All right, Roger.
[01:57:45.818 --> 01:57:46.999]  Thank you.
[01:57:46.999 --> 01:57:47.379]  Godspeed.
[01:57:47.379 --> 01:57:49.620]  All right, folks.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.282]  About two weeks ago, I started telling you Infowars is under a lot of attack.
[01:57:53.237 --> 01:57:58.323]  The personal stuff, the dirty tricks, but not just some deep state thing.
[01:57:58.323 --> 01:58:02.788]  It's like fire ants climbing on your legs, they release a pheromone, they all sting at once.
[01:58:02.788 --> 01:58:09.075]  Leftists attacking me in the street, attacking my family, lying about us, calling regulators on us, calling CPS on us.
[01:58:10.305 --> 01:58:11.867]  I'm just a bellwether.
[01:58:11.867 --> 01:58:12.847]  I'm just carrying the coal mine.
[01:58:12.847 --> 01:58:15.870]  This is happening to everybody, including Roger, the Trumps, everybody.
[01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:18.172]  And the left has gone into psycho mode.
[01:58:18.172 --> 01:58:24.338]  And now the communist Chinese, because I've got Cloudfair and big tech companies that don't lie to us about where something's coming from.
[01:58:24.338 --> 01:58:26.280]  Users are like, we don't know where it's coming from, or this or that.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.162]  They're like, no, it's communist China, probably state-run.
[01:58:29.162 --> 01:58:33.426]  Five, six days of them hitting fan.video, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[01:58:34.327 --> 01:58:44.154]  Uh, just absolutely going after InfoWarsTore.com and just continue 24-7 attacks, attacks, attacks ahead of the election and Soros Wargaming with the Democrats.
[01:58:44.154 --> 01:58:46.836]  They want us off-air so we don't challenge their fraud.
[01:58:49.858 --> 01:59:09.088]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, The Washington Post, or Howard Stern, you name it, they come out and they attack him full force saying, Jones claims civil war is coming, and financial collapse, and planetary lockdowns using viruses, and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storable food if they can.
[01:59:09.688 --> 01:59:16.853]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep.
[01:59:16.853 --> 01:59:20.016]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[01:59:20.016 --> 01:59:26.300]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last week more than ever.
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:29.623]  Get your high quality storable foods at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:59:29.623 --> 01:59:33.786]  That's one of the key check marks of the check boxes you've got to have checked off.

[01:59:51.931 --> 01:59:53.051]  Big Brother.
[01:59:53.051 --> 01:59:54.852]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:54.852 --> 01:59:56.732]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.732 --> 01:59:58.433]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:59:58.433 --> 02:00:00.093]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.093 --> 02:00:04.774]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.463 --> 02:00:15.713]  So, a couple weeks ago I got on there and I said, you better support us, you better spread the articles, the videos, the links, because the attacks are ten times what they've ever been before.
[02:00:15.713 --> 02:00:17.895]  This is a bellwether of what's going into this election.
[02:00:17.895 --> 02:00:19.217]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:00:19.217 --> 02:00:27.025]  I'm just saying the enemy wants us off air because we're effective telling the truth and countering their Chai Com, globalist, America sucks, capitalism sucks.
[02:00:27.886 --> 02:00:31.549]  Because they just want to bankrupt us and collapse us and kill the dollar.
[02:00:31.549 --> 02:00:37.734]  I mean, when you see all these fake right-wing hosts and all the liberal hosts and people saying, oh, the dollar's dead, America's over.
[02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:43.793]  Our fiat currency is not halfway as devalued as the Chai Com currency, the EU.
[02:00:43.793 --> 02:00:46.574]  They just want us out of the picture so they can take over.
[02:00:46.574 --> 02:00:49.035]  And obviously we inflate money too much.
[02:00:49.035 --> 02:00:50.396]  Obviously we have problems.
[02:00:50.396 --> 02:00:58.760]  But if we end up not being the dominant currency, when the musical chairs end, we will be in a collapse scenario the likes of which no one can even imagine.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:04.822]  I mean, it'll make the 1920s and the Great Depression, 1929, look like a cakewalk in all experts' views.
[02:01:04.822 --> 02:01:07.824]  So anyone promoting that is your mortal enemy.
[02:01:08.737 --> 02:01:27.908]  And now here we are with Antifa marching saying, death to America, and the left, and there's self-destructive stuff that psychiatrists, Dr. Steve Pachetnik talks about, best-selling author, co-author with Tom Clancy, ran a lot of psychological operations at the State Department and for other agencies, Camp David Accords, but has done a lot of work.
[02:01:27.908 --> 02:01:32.051]  He's predicted a lot of this, and he's confident, but I see the death throes.
[02:01:32.791 --> 02:01:38.752]  Of the leftist state and the blue cities dying and Hollywood dying as really black holes trying to take us with them.
[02:01:38.752 --> 02:01:42.653]  It's kind of like Captain, you know, Ahab goes down with Moby Dick.
[02:01:42.653 --> 02:01:45.034]  I'm concerned we're going to go down with the whale.
[02:01:45.034 --> 02:01:51.155]  Or kind of like 20,000 leagues or whatever is under the sea, like, you know, the captain goes down with a giant squid or whatever.
[02:01:51.155 --> 02:01:53.936]  I just, they just, they just don't give up.
[02:01:53.936 --> 02:01:59.457]  They just keep chomping and biting and snapping and spewing and just everything.
[02:02:01.775 --> 02:02:03.476]  He's on the show today.
[02:02:03.476 --> 02:02:04.276]  We appreciate him.
[02:02:04.276 --> 02:02:10.257]  We've got what Roger broke on the show that a couple years ago they were shopping a coup around with General Mattis.
[02:02:10.257 --> 02:02:12.698]  And boy did all hell break loose when we exposed that, my God.
[02:02:12.698 --> 02:02:14.259]  Because they kept wondering how we knew.
[02:02:14.259 --> 02:02:15.559]  We could just see them telegraphing.
[02:02:15.559 --> 02:02:16.159]  It's not hard.
[02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:17.580]  They think we're dumb.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:20.961]  I don't get that psychology where they do it out in the open and think we don't see it.
[02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:25.242]  And then you've got the new head of Amazon board,
[02:02:25.942 --> 02:02:26.322]  I think so.
[02:02:49.318 --> 02:02:55.786]  Mattis and the coup in this and echoing the Democrats and Pelosi and them hoping for a military coup.
[02:02:55.786 --> 02:03:03.715]  Is that a ghost stance that they're hoping for or or do they really have some teeth to this public coup they're shopping around?
[02:03:03.715 --> 02:03:05.277]  There's no teeth to it.
[02:03:05.277 --> 02:03:07.820]  Bottom line is that Nancy Pelosi
[02:03:08.539 --> 02:03:10.961]  He's self-destructed already.
[02:03:10.961 --> 02:03:19.066]  Basically, the Democrats, you've got an investigation going into Dianne Feinstein for irregular trading of her husband.
[02:03:19.066 --> 02:03:20.888]  Same thing with Nancy Pelosi.
[02:03:20.888 --> 02:03:21.848]  You've got Schumer.
[02:03:21.848 --> 02:03:28.193]  You've got a whole bunch of problems in California, and they have no viability right now.
[02:03:28.193 --> 02:03:32.716]  An attempted coup is really not a very serious problem.
[02:03:32.716 --> 02:03:35.298]  The reason why I say that, number one,
[02:03:36.095 --> 02:03:44.159]  The Alex Jones Show, sui generis, with you there, without you there, is a powerful instrument of veracity.
[02:03:44.159 --> 02:03:47.520]  In other words, whether you like it or not, it's there.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.181]  It's been there for 20 odd years.
[02:03:50.181 --> 02:04:02.047]  The attempt for anything that General Mattis might want to do, it resides in the fact that he was an ineffective general.
[02:04:02.717 --> 02:04:09.699]  Contrary to what he wanted to say and what he presented himself as an intellectual monk, he was a disaster in Iraq.
[02:04:09.699 --> 02:04:11.560]  He killed our own people.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:15.101]  He was a disaster in Afghanistan, killed our own people.
[02:04:15.101 --> 02:04:21.623]  He was a disaster in terms of the invasion into Afghanistan, which was ridiculous.
[02:04:21.623 --> 02:04:26.885]  He was on Theranos, which was a bankrupt company.
[02:04:26.885 --> 02:04:29.706]  So matters is nothing more than a
[02:04:30.774 --> 02:04:36.582]  Sherry Marine who goes around and self aggrandizes, but it's not valid.
[02:04:36.582 --> 02:04:41.128]  For the most part, what has happened now, and I'm going to say it very simply.
[02:04:41.747 --> 02:04:44.969]  What's happened is our military is not viable.
[02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:49.332]  We got 2.2 million men in uniform.
[02:04:49.332 --> 02:04:51.233]  There's no value to it.
[02:04:51.233 --> 02:04:52.714]  Trump understands it.
[02:04:52.714 --> 02:04:54.375]  Trump took us out of Syria.
[02:04:54.375 --> 02:04:57.037]  He took us out of Iraq, Afghanistan.
[02:04:57.037 --> 02:04:58.338]  Why did he do that?
[02:04:58.338 --> 02:05:00.620]  For number one, he is very smart.
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:02.901]  He knows we do not win wars.
[02:05:02.901 --> 02:05:04.062]  They're not effective.
[02:05:04.062 --> 02:05:05.283]  We do not make money.
[02:05:05.763 --> 02:05:14.448]  And the bottom line is that we have a far more serious problem in terms of the economy and in terms of getting our growth back.
[02:05:14.448 --> 02:05:21.693]  I was about to say, for people that were actually there, they said Woodward and others are lying, and these other people, the Atlantic, are lying.
[02:05:21.693 --> 02:05:25.996]  Trump was like, these wars are dumb to chew up our good people.
[02:05:25.996 --> 02:05:28.717]  We can use economic power to make a better deal than this.
[02:05:28.717 --> 02:05:29.938]  Why are we doing this for China?
[02:05:29.938 --> 02:05:31.399]  He wasn't putting our military down.
[02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:33.720]  He was saying it's stupid just to kill our troops for no reason.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:34.621]  He says that publicly.
[02:05:35.566 --> 02:05:37.208]  Yeah, he said that repeatedly.
[02:05:37.208 --> 02:05:41.812]  And one of the reasons I've always supported him is he's always been against war.
[02:05:41.812 --> 02:05:43.894]  He is not deprecating anybody.
[02:05:43.894 --> 02:05:45.535]  He's not an anti-Semite.
[02:05:45.535 --> 02:05:46.896]  He's not a racist.
[02:05:46.896 --> 02:05:51.781]  What happens is the left or anybody wants to pick up a few words.
[02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:59.147]  Now here's the very clever dynamic of Trump and also of an Alex Jones, but more of Trump right now.
[02:05:59.147 --> 02:06:00.068]  And I'm going to explain it.
[02:06:00.979 --> 02:06:18.581]  Why would Trump allow Bob Woodward to have 18 interviews with him when Trump knew very well from Woodward's history that he's going to get a hit piece, it's going to be a disaster about him, and there's no upside.
[02:06:18.581 --> 02:06:19.402]  Yet he spent
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:27.130]  A whole hours in the beginning at the White House and then every night for 18 nights he would call Woodward.
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:30.114]  Now why would a man who's so smart do that?
[02:06:30.114 --> 02:06:32.277]  Is he self-destructive?
[02:06:32.277 --> 02:06:33.840]  Not really.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.422]  Is he stupid?
[02:06:35.422 --> 02:06:36.063]  Not really.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.943]  Is he in any way sorry that he did it?
[02:06:40.943 --> 02:06:43.224]  Not at all, when you interview him.
[02:06:43.224 --> 02:06:51.649]  So what was the basic point in having a guy who, and I happen to know Woodward, I thought he was a phony to begin with.
[02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:52.670]  He and I started at
[02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:54.151]  Sure, so why did Trump do it?
[02:06:54.151 --> 02:06:56.173]  So he'd know what his enemies were up to?
[02:07:21.621 --> 02:07:28.344]  That's one thing, but Trump, like yourself and possibly like me, we like the game.
[02:07:28.344 --> 02:07:33.966]  The game to us is far more important than anything anyone else can see.
[02:07:33.966 --> 02:07:35.787]  Now, what do I mean?
[02:07:35.787 --> 02:07:40.188]  Trump, look how many books came out now about him, negatively.
[02:07:40.188 --> 02:07:41.449]  Mary Trump.
[02:07:42.066 --> 02:07:44.189]  Says that he is a terrible man.
[02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:47.292]  His sister says he's worse than terrible.
[02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:51.517]  Michael Cohen, his Jewish corrupt lawyer, says he's corrupt.
[02:07:51.517 --> 02:07:55.941]  And then you have other books coming out, says that he's a disaster, John Bolton.
[02:07:55.941 --> 02:07:57.984]  Why does he do that?
[02:07:57.984 --> 02:07:59.686]  One word only.
[02:07:59.686 --> 02:08:00.807]  It's called Trump.
[02:08:01.644 --> 02:08:02.805]  You can knock it.
[02:08:02.805 --> 02:08:03.905]  You can praise it.
[02:08:03.905 --> 02:08:10.470]  He doesn't give a damn either way, as long as you use the word T-R-U-M-P.
[02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:25.099]  And every one of these people who goes negatively against them, including the stupid publishers, are doing nothing more than to help Trump self-aggrandize, because he understood something a long time ago that you and I understood.
[02:08:25.826 --> 02:08:27.688]  Every knock is a boost.
[02:08:27.688 --> 02:08:28.769]  You don't like this?
[02:08:28.769 --> 02:08:29.210]  Fine.
[02:08:29.210 --> 02:08:29.931]  Just pronounce my last name.
[02:08:29.931 --> 02:08:30.431]  So it's like P.J.
[02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:32.273]  Barnum said, just get my name right.
[02:08:32.273 --> 02:08:35.997]  And Trump understands that that gives him the name recognition.
[02:08:35.997 --> 02:08:39.101]  And then there's also so much disinfo that none of it matters.
[02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:44.427]  And the more he survives disinfo, the more he almost becomes invincible to anything they might have that's real.
[02:08:45.307 --> 02:08:53.612]  You've got it, and that's true of Alex Jones.
[02:08:53.612 --> 02:09:03.077]  You've started off, you've been there 20 some odd years, and the testimony to your strength and viability is that you're getting hit right and left.
[02:09:03.077 --> 02:09:04.638]  I get hit every morning.
[02:09:05.098 --> 02:09:07.239]  My internet is hit.
[02:09:07.239 --> 02:09:08.579]  AOL is down.
[02:09:08.579 --> 02:09:14.440]  These guys play games with me until, you know, I work a couple hours later and they're off.
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:17.561]  But the point is we will continue to be attacked.
[02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:20.002]  However, Trump has made the art.
[02:09:20.002 --> 02:09:22.302]  He is the grand manipulator.
[02:09:22.302 --> 02:09:25.383]  Well, let's talk about what you predicted for the election and so much more.
[02:09:25.383 --> 02:09:29.584]  I mean, when I go on at 11 a.m., the hack attacks start and it's right out of China.
[02:09:29.584 --> 02:09:31.744]  And I wonder, it's probably the left funding that.
[02:09:31.744 --> 02:09:33.965]  What do you expect them to do when they try to challenge the election?
[02:09:35.014 --> 02:09:36.495]  They've set up this group to do it.
[02:09:36.495 --> 02:09:39.278]  Dr. Steve McKinnick, SteveMcKinnick.com is our guest.
[02:09:39.278 --> 02:09:40.399]  An incredible time to be alive.
[02:09:40.399 --> 02:09:42.601]  Please stay with us and spread the live link.
[02:09:42.601 --> 02:09:47.345]  We've got some of the video themes up at InfoWars.com on the whole General Mattis situation.
[02:09:47.345 --> 02:09:47.766]  Share those.
[02:09:49.082 --> 02:09:51.503]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person.
[02:09:51.503 --> 02:09:52.824]  I am a humble person overall.
[02:09:52.824 --> 02:09:55.926]  I've not come off as aggressive and things because I'm under threat.
[02:09:55.926 --> 02:10:09.374]  You're under threat and I'm fighting as hard as I possibly can and I appreciate your support and your prayers but I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes and I wish I did a better job so that's why when you call in thanking me all the time it just kind of makes you feel pathetic because
[02:10:10.194 --> 02:10:11.135]  I guess call it pride?
[02:10:11.135 --> 02:10:16.538]  I don't like begging you all the time to try our products or to donate or to spread the word or to pray for us.
[02:10:16.538 --> 02:10:18.339]  I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[02:10:18.339 --> 02:10:20.020]  And so I want to thank you.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:23.982]  It's put the cart before the horse to call it and thank me.
[02:10:23.982 --> 02:10:26.223]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[02:10:26.223 --> 02:10:28.504]  So understand you're my equal 110%.
[02:10:28.504 --> 02:10:30.706]  And I just want to thank you all.
[02:10:30.706 --> 02:10:33.967]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody else, man.
[02:10:33.967 --> 02:10:35.168]  I just want to stay in this fight.
[02:10:35.168 --> 02:10:36.169]  And it's so serious now.
[02:10:36.889 --> 02:10:41.331]  Things are getting so clear now, that's why they want us off air, because all of our credibility is so high.
[02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:48.355]  Let's just stay together, fight hard, spread the word, pray to God, take us through this, we're gonna make it.
[02:10:48.355 --> 02:10:51.536]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[02:10:51.536 --> 02:11:02.522]  That's because it was completely scripted, and we even know the names of the United Nations, Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates, and John Hopkins documents.
[02:11:02.522 --> 02:11:05.123]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[02:11:06.152 --> 02:11:21.397]  And it's designed to freeze civilization and have a post-Renaissance stagnation or new dark age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[02:11:21.397 --> 02:11:23.538]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[02:11:23.538 --> 02:11:27.619]  As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[02:11:27.619 --> 02:11:29.520]  Every I dotted, every T crossed.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.621]  A total societal vertical integration takeover.
[02:11:33.001 --> 02:11:34.822]  Medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[02:11:34.822 --> 02:11:38.744]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cut by 35% in the last eight months.
[02:11:38.744 --> 02:11:41.985]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[02:11:41.985 --> 02:11:45.487]  Everyone is being forced onto their system, the post-human robot takeover.
[02:11:45.487 --> 02:11:50.930]  You're being made obsolete.
[02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:53.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:07.632 --> 02:12:09.253]  Alright, Dr. Pachinick's our guest.
[02:12:09.253 --> 02:12:10.133]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:12:10.133 --> 02:12:10.773]  He just joined us.
[02:12:10.773 --> 02:12:13.754]  His website is StevePachinick.com.
[02:12:13.754 --> 02:12:16.475]  Our sites are Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:12:16.475 --> 02:12:20.456]  They're under massive denial of service and a bunch of other attacks.
[02:12:20.456 --> 02:12:21.956]  The shopping cart's under attack, everything.
[02:12:21.956 --> 02:12:26.318]  But we do have a lot of the feeds up at Infowars.com.
[02:12:26.318 --> 02:12:28.118]  So be sure and share those.
[02:12:28.118 --> 02:12:29.619]  And we also have record traffic coming in.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:41.404]  I want to get into a few topics of whatever you want to cover, but I want to just ask you, going back to the bogey dick thing and we're like Ahab and they're the whale or vice versa.
[02:12:41.404 --> 02:12:43.204]  I get they're self-destructing, you're absolutely right.
[02:12:43.204 --> 02:12:46.245]  It's crazy, Biden can't even talk now.
[02:12:46.245 --> 02:12:49.346]  This is like unbelievable it's so bizarre.
[02:12:49.346 --> 02:12:54.828]  But still, they could get a blow in, somebody could kill Trump.
[02:12:56.018 --> 02:13:00.240]  They're saying they're going to hold up the election and make people think Trump stole it.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.161]  That's a very terroristic thing to do.
[02:13:03.161 --> 02:13:04.381]  What do you expect to come out of that?
[02:13:04.381 --> 02:13:10.723]  Because their official policy is now, as you know, to contest the election, try to hold it off for months and have a bunch of riots.
[02:13:10.723 --> 02:13:11.524]  What does Trump do?
[02:13:11.524 --> 02:13:14.145]  What do you expect to come out of that?
[02:13:14.145 --> 02:13:20.047]  Well, number one, I always go back to what Trump is.
[02:13:20.047 --> 02:13:22.988]  Trump is not about words, he's about action.
[02:13:23.812 --> 02:13:35.276]  So Trump just made a major treaty, thanks to Jared Kushner, O'Brien, and a bunch of others that allowed Israel and UAE to get together.
[02:13:35.276 --> 02:13:39.217]  He's going to continue this with Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain.
[02:13:40.034 --> 02:13:43.675]  What he's going to do and why I think he's going to get reelected.
[02:13:43.675 --> 02:13:54.198]  Americans know in their heart of hearts, when they have to put down a ballot, that there's only one person, only one, who can bring back our economy.
[02:13:54.198 --> 02:13:55.378]  That's not Biden.
[02:13:55.378 --> 02:14:01.660]  Because they know for 47 years, I would dare anybody to tell me what he has accomplished
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:13.284]  Other than killing 5,000 of our men in the Iraq war, which he initiated, 2,500 soldiers, 2,500 contractees.
[02:14:13.284 --> 02:14:15.225]  Trump does not want a war.
[02:14:15.225 --> 02:14:19.206]  That already negates the entire military industrial complex.
[02:14:19.206 --> 02:14:20.207]  So what does he do?
[02:14:20.207 --> 02:14:21.347]  He transfers.
[02:14:22.057 --> 02:14:27.939]  All the capability to the startup that he needs again to bring back the economy.
[02:14:27.939 --> 02:14:32.501]  As we said on your show, Fauci made a major, major mistake.
[02:14:32.501 --> 02:14:33.701]  He should have been fired.
[02:14:33.701 --> 02:14:34.741]  He's not.
[02:14:34.741 --> 02:14:39.763]  And I've said Trump is still not strong enough to get rid of the people in the administration.
[02:14:40.163 --> 02:14:41.524]  Why do the markets love Trump so much?
[02:15:03.311 --> 02:15:04.853]  Because he's a businessman.
[02:15:04.853 --> 02:15:07.155]  He knows exactly what he had to do.
[02:15:07.155 --> 02:15:09.016]  We had the highest GDP.
[02:15:09.016 --> 02:15:11.599]  He understands how to work a business.
[02:15:11.599 --> 02:15:14.442]  He understands how to do discounted cash.
[02:15:14.442 --> 02:15:16.263]  He's built assets.
[02:15:16.263 --> 02:15:18.946]  We've never had a president who's built assets.
[02:15:19.366 --> 02:15:25.328]  In the past 50 years, I don't know of one president, I've served five of them, who knew anything about business.
[02:15:25.328 --> 02:15:30.790]  You had Bush Jr., a retard of the highest order, creates 9-11.
[02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:37.952]  Bush Sr., his own father goes into a war in the Middle East, which he didn't need, also a disaster.
[02:15:37.952 --> 02:15:41.773]  You got Reagan, whom they laud, but he was a disaster.
[02:15:41.773 --> 02:15:43.054]  And you got Jimmy Carter.
[02:15:43.054 --> 02:15:44.274]  So what are we talking about?
[02:15:44.884 --> 02:15:47.686]  We're not talking about the best and the brightest.
[02:15:47.686 --> 02:15:52.810]  We're talking about simple competency, which Biden does not have.
[02:15:52.810 --> 02:16:09.884]  In 48 years, I want somebody to tell me other than the Iraq war and killing people, being completely corrupt, garnering a huge amount of assets, allowing his son Hunter to be corrupt as well as he, what has Biden done?
[02:16:09.884 --> 02:16:10.244]  Nothing.
[02:16:11.201 --> 02:16:17.483]  To do nothing in 48 years as a politician means you're basically a welfare case.
[02:16:17.483 --> 02:16:20.824]  And that's what the Democratic Party has created.
[02:16:20.824 --> 02:16:23.144]  Their own welfare leader.
[02:16:23.144 --> 02:16:33.747]  And on top of that, they got Kamala Harris, an attorney general who has a questionable background in history, who really doesn't know anything about power on the federal level.
[02:16:33.747 --> 02:16:34.707]  So that's my next question.
[02:16:34.707 --> 02:16:36.228]  Who is it they're planning to shoehorn in?
[02:16:37.828 --> 02:16:40.934]  If Biden and Kamala were able to get in, who is it behind them?
[02:16:40.934 --> 02:16:42.397]  Who's that constellation of power?
[02:16:42.397 --> 02:16:46.243]  And again, why are they self-destructing so bad?
[02:16:47.267 --> 02:16:48.749]  They're self-destructing.
[02:16:48.749 --> 02:16:53.734]  In theory, if I were to suggest anybody, it would be Michelle Obama.
[02:16:53.734 --> 02:17:05.987]  Because she's going on the air all the time talking about nonsensical issues, how they had trouble in their marriage, how she loves her kids, all of it which is desultory.
[02:17:05.987 --> 02:17:09.711]  She's trying to build up a credibility background with people like Trump did with his TV shows.
[02:17:10.646 --> 02:17:11.707]  Correct.
[02:17:11.707 --> 02:17:15.290]  But Trump doesn't say a word about his family.
[02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:16.851]  He doesn't have to.
[02:17:16.851 --> 02:17:19.854]  Melania, smart as a whip.
[02:17:19.854 --> 02:17:33.726]  Eric and Ivanka and all the other kids that he has, they're highly competent, they're taken care of, they know exactly— Sure, you used to be a little bit down on Kushner, and I've been neutral on him, but you seem to like him more.
[02:17:33.726 --> 02:17:34.546]  Have you gotten more info?
[02:17:35.757 --> 02:17:37.358]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:17:37.358 --> 02:17:39.920]  I'm always an individual willing to learn.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:42.342]  I'm not perfect.
[02:17:42.342 --> 02:17:50.649]  I read Kushner in a certain way as an Orthodox Jew who came out of New Jersey, whose father I knew about had been in prison.
[02:17:51.249 --> 02:18:06.739]  However, Jared came to the forefront over the past couple of years, and I had to change my opinion on the simple notion that Jared understood a dynamic which we, we've been in the Middle East, strategies never used.
[02:18:06.739 --> 02:18:07.739]  And I can say that.
[02:18:07.739 --> 02:18:09.440]  I mean, I've been involved in Camp David.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:10.761]  You, you're the only other person.
[02:18:10.761 --> 02:18:12.022]  I should have said this at the start of the interview.
[02:18:12.222 --> 02:18:14.623]  You were credited as the head of Psychological Operations at the State Department.
[02:18:14.623 --> 02:18:18.526]  They're getting the Camp David Accords down, the only successful peace deal ever.
[02:18:18.526 --> 02:18:25.410]  And now you see Trump getting it with the UAE and Israel, with Serbia and Bosnia, with all these big deals.
[02:18:25.410 --> 02:18:26.830]  Bahrain and Oman.
[02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:39.558]  And I give credit to Trump and Kushner and O'Brien because Kushner came up with a concept, a sophisticated concept, where he said three years ago, we're going to use the economy.
[02:18:39.918 --> 02:18:40.538]  Stupid.
[02:18:40.538 --> 02:18:45.461]  And basically, he said one other thing that we at the time could not do.
[02:18:45.461 --> 02:18:49.683]  And he said, really, I'm not interested in what the Palestinians have to say.
[02:18:49.683 --> 02:18:53.205]  If they don't understand this business deal, too bad for them.
[02:18:53.205 --> 02:19:02.530]  And you said that last time, and now the Arab League has come out and said, tell the Palestinians, stop trying to control everybody as the little victims, instead of just making deals with actual powers that'll help everybody.
[02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.890]  Correct.
[02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:08.353]  And ironically, the Palestinians are known as the Jews of the Middle East.
[02:19:08.353 --> 02:19:13.235]  So, eventually, I predict they will go back to deal with Kushner.
[02:19:13.235 --> 02:19:16.877]  Kushner will be successful with Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[02:19:16.877 --> 02:19:19.999]  An amazing treaty, because they're already there.
[02:19:19.999 --> 02:19:24.201]  And simply average liberal, like, love Trump, getting us out of all these wars and all these peace deals?
[02:19:24.201 --> 02:19:24.902]  This is ridiculous.
[02:19:25.874 --> 02:19:36.323]  No, because when you have an ideology, remember this Alex, if you're liberal, it allows you by definition to be open minded.
[02:19:36.323 --> 02:19:41.027]  It says liberal, you're caring about people, you're good hearted.
[02:19:41.027 --> 02:19:44.430]  You know, when you say conservative, it has a harsh
[02:19:45.331 --> 02:19:46.151]  Tone to it.
[02:19:46.151 --> 02:19:48.872]  It means, oh, well, we're conservative.
[02:19:48.872 --> 02:19:52.273]  That doesn't mean in any sense that we're more liberal than they are.
[02:19:52.273 --> 02:19:53.353]  We're more advanced.
[02:19:53.353 --> 02:19:54.614]  We take risks.
[02:19:54.614 --> 02:19:58.395]  Liberal means we really are compassionate, understanding.
[02:19:58.395 --> 02:19:59.735]  You should love us.
[02:19:59.735 --> 02:20:02.396]  In reality, it's the reverse.
[02:20:02.396 --> 02:20:03.736]  We don't want to be loved.
[02:20:03.736 --> 02:20:05.376]  Trump doesn't need to be loved.
[02:20:05.376 --> 02:20:07.937]  All he needs to do is to affect change.
[02:20:07.937 --> 02:20:11.358]  And that's what he's been doing and will continue to do.
[02:20:11.358 --> 02:20:13.039]  The mistake he made, he learned.
[02:20:13.039 --> 02:20:14.539]  You don't shut down the government.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:21.965]  But everybody will come back quickly because they have millions of people, which he understands is a small business.
[02:20:21.965 --> 02:20:23.106]  Let's talk about that next.
[02:20:23.106 --> 02:20:23.986]  Let's talk about that next.
[02:20:23.986 --> 02:20:26.768]  The lockdown, the vaccines, the U.N.
[02:20:26.768 --> 02:20:31.771]  trying to step forward through communalized cities they control to establish U.N.
[02:20:31.771 --> 02:20:32.172]  power.
[02:20:32.172 --> 02:20:34.033]  And Trump's trying to pull us out of the U.N.
[02:20:34.033 --> 02:20:35.554]  How we should get back, control the U.N.
[02:20:35.554 --> 02:20:39.837]  or get out of it, create a new international organization where communities can come together.
[02:20:39.837 --> 02:20:41.238]  We'll be right back with Dr. Steve Pachenek.
[02:20:41.238 --> 02:20:43.159]  Please stay with us and please tell folks to tune in.
[02:20:43.159 --> 02:20:44.120]  That's how we get around the censors.
[02:20:47.509 --> 02:20:48.409]  Attention, gardeners!
[02:20:48.409 --> 02:20:52.350]  If you need to grow nutritionally dense vegetables or medicinal herbs this year, listen!
[02:20:52.350 --> 02:20:55.511]  Because a bioactive superfood for plants is now available!
[02:20:55.511 --> 02:21:05.133]  This all-natural superfood for plants is so effective at producing maximum plant growth in minimum time that it almost forces plants to grow, even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:21:05.133 --> 02:21:07.874]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's truly remarkable.
[02:21:07.874 --> 02:21:11.834]  Vegetables grow faster and contain more bioavailable vitamins and trace minerals.
[02:21:11.834 --> 02:21:14.055]  Plants that rarely bloom will flower constantly.
[02:21:14.355 --> 02:21:16.417]  Sickly plants become vibrantly alive.
[02:21:16.417 --> 02:21:18.619]  Medicinal herbs become super potent.
[02:21:18.619 --> 02:21:21.562]  Flowers become more vivid right before your very eyes.
[02:21:21.562 --> 02:21:25.005]  Proto-Gro also improves the taste quality of all your garden vegetables.
[02:21:25.005 --> 02:21:28.068]  That's because it's more than just an all-natural superfood for plants.
[02:21:28.068 --> 02:21:33.354]  It's a proprietary blend of bioactive sea nutrients that contain the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:21:33.354 --> 02:21:37.778]  Which is why Proto-Gro even renews your garden by increasing the microorganisms in the soil.

[02:22:01.798 --> 02:22:04.180]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:10.026]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago, and actually openly announcing it everywhere.
[02:22:10.506 --> 02:22:12.967]  They're going from beta to operational.
[02:22:12.967 --> 02:22:14.668]  And think about all these major corporations.
[02:22:14.668 --> 02:22:16.029]  They tell you humans are harmful.
[02:22:16.029 --> 02:22:17.730]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[02:22:17.730 --> 02:22:19.471]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of.
[02:22:19.471 --> 02:22:24.554]  And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[02:22:24.554 --> 02:22:28.256]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations.
[02:22:28.256 --> 02:22:35.681]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[02:22:36.121 --> 02:22:43.269]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics that are absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[02:22:43.269 --> 02:22:46.052]  This is all absolute information control.
[02:22:46.052 --> 02:22:46.793]  This is beyond 1984.
[02:22:48.823 --> 02:22:57.206]  As of 54 days out, the globalist, child-molesting, devil-worshippers know they're in trouble and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[02:22:57.206 --> 02:23:00.827]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil war.
[02:23:00.827 --> 02:23:05.848]  And they're throwing hack attacks at InfoWars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[02:23:05.848 --> 02:23:07.189]  It's incredible.
[02:23:07.189 --> 02:23:11.970]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at InfoWarshore.com is critical.
[02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:13.370]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:14.531]  We've only got a few months
[02:23:15.271 --> 02:23:16.151]  Of backup.
[02:23:16.151 --> 02:23:19.633]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down, and that's not good.
[02:23:19.633 --> 02:23:25.615]  We need to have extra money in our coffers to be able to expand in this home stretch, not just contract.
[02:23:25.615 --> 02:23:30.076]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[02:23:30.076 --> 02:23:31.457]  So I know you're going to step up.
[02:23:31.457 --> 02:23:37.018]  At InfoWarsTore.com, we've got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock.
[02:23:37.018 --> 02:23:43.020]  We've got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts, and so much more.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:44.501]  Get prepared and fund the InfoWar.
[02:23:44.801 --> 02:23:48.024]  At Infowarsstore.com, God bless you all.
[02:23:48.024 --> 02:23:50.786]  Humanity is being domesticated.
[02:23:50.786 --> 02:23:56.510]  And we're not being domesticated to end war, as the Carnegie Endowment and the UN say.
[02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:58.552]  That's for proletariat consumption.
[02:23:58.552 --> 02:24:06.518]  When you read deeper into the transhumanist plan, it is the most megalomaniacal, psychotic thing you could ever imagine.
[02:24:06.518 --> 02:24:12.783]  Not even in, again, a science fiction horror movie could you come close to what this is actually going to look like.
[02:24:13.343 --> 02:24:20.808]  So remember, compliance with the mask, compliance with social distancing, compliance at the airports, all of this is training you for the post-human world.
[02:24:20.808 --> 02:24:22.729]  We're all being taught that we're not essential.
[02:24:22.729 --> 02:24:27.692]  We must get people like the governor of Texas to wake up and say no and reverse himself.
[02:24:27.692 --> 02:24:33.496]  We've got to get Trump to go more on the offense, exposing COVID-19 as an overblown hoax.
[02:24:33.496 --> 02:24:34.376]  Yes, it's a virus.
[02:24:34.376 --> 02:24:35.877]  Yes, it kills people.
[02:24:35.877 --> 02:24:38.399]  Maybe 1% as bad as the flu.
[02:24:38.399 --> 02:24:38.539]  Not
[02:24:39.319 --> 02:24:40.321]  10% is bad.
[02:24:40.321 --> 02:24:51.015]  It's totally overblown, ladies and gentlemen, because it is the shoehorn to bring in the end of liberty and freedom as we know it.
[02:24:51.015 --> 02:24:53.659]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:07.069 --> 02:25:08.390]  Alright, Dr. Steve McShinnick's our guest.
[02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:09.950]  I've got a lot of questions for him.
[02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:12.891]  Smart guy, psychiatrist, best-selling author, researcher.
[02:25:12.891 --> 02:25:15.412]  Worked in and out of the State Department and other government agencies.
[02:25:15.412 --> 02:25:18.513]  Been involved in regime change, you name it.
[02:25:18.513 --> 02:25:21.094]  I just don't ever want to be overconfident.
[02:25:21.094 --> 02:25:24.435]  And I get you live in a nice area around more conservatives.
[02:25:24.435 --> 02:25:26.776]  In Florida, and I was just in a panhandle with great people.
[02:25:26.776 --> 02:25:28.436]  That's one of the best places in the country.
[02:25:28.436 --> 02:25:31.617]  I know you're a little bit closer to that, but not quite there.
[02:25:31.617 --> 02:25:32.478]  But I live in Austin.
[02:25:32.478 --> 02:25:35.659]  I've seen it go from a good, nice, kind of libertarian place to a leftist
[02:25:36.656 --> 02:25:37.737]  Toilet of L.A.
[02:25:37.737 --> 02:25:40.798]  I mean, you know, the people that have moved in are horrible, on average.
[02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.239]  They just are mindless.
[02:25:42.239 --> 02:25:42.999]  They're vapid.
[02:25:42.999 --> 02:25:43.940]  They're rude.
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:45.161]  They're hateful.
[02:25:45.161 --> 02:25:45.921]  They honk at you.
[02:25:45.921 --> 02:25:47.022]  They cut in line in front of you.
[02:25:47.022 --> 02:25:48.603]  They're just stupid.
[02:25:48.603 --> 02:25:51.624]  And I don't see leftists learning from what they've left.
[02:25:51.624 --> 02:25:56.187]  And then I see them, when Biden couldn't talk when you were on two years ago, you said, clearly he's out of the stroke.
[02:25:56.187 --> 02:25:58.248]  Yeah, made a big national story out of it.
[02:25:58.248 --> 02:26:00.309]  Now, it's not they're not cherry picking.
[02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:01.550]  I watch any speech he makes.
[02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:03.731]  Clearly, he's out of stroke.
[02:26:03.731 --> 02:26:06.472]  Clearly, he doesn't... Oh, there's my wife!
[02:26:06.472 --> 02:26:07.713]  Max, my wife!
[02:26:07.713 --> 02:26:12.916]  It's like he's literally in the top 30 percent, the most senile in a nursing home.
[02:26:12.916 --> 02:26:23.802]  That scares me more that the leftist, globalist, chi-com establishment with the People's Daily endorsing him, saying he's in sync, simpatico with Xi Jinping, and he's our man.
[02:26:23.802 --> 02:26:29.625]  And to see Pelosi going, yeah, China's helping get Biden elected, while they say Trump's in league with the Russians.
[02:26:29.625 --> 02:26:29.966]  It's just...
[02:26:30.746 --> 02:26:35.890]  The attacks on truth, the attacks on logic.
[02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:46.198]  I look at it and it actually makes me feel weak that things this weak and evil and twisted and stupid and lazy are actually having a chance to defeat us and defeat their own self-interest.
[02:26:46.198 --> 02:26:49.420]  Like, how the hell did we get this?
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:50.942]  And to me, it's even more dangerous.
[02:26:50.942 --> 02:26:52.623]  They don't even care about their own self-interest.
[02:26:52.623 --> 02:26:57.707]  They have taken on the hatred of the host that they have been destroying.
[02:26:57.707 --> 02:27:00.169]  And I just wonder what they're going to do next because you say, oh, they won't
[02:27:01.377 --> 02:27:04.739]  They won't have the nerve to pull off a coup.
[02:27:04.739 --> 02:27:06.780]  They're so stupid, they might try it!
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:12.264]  You know, I mean, you know, a monkey with a flamethrower inside a fireworks factory is pretty damn dangerous, even if it's a monkey.
[02:27:12.264 --> 02:27:20.369]  So I'm just really... I mean, I agree with what you said years ago, they're self-destructing, they're gonna self-destruct, you've been proven right, but... Okay, but they're trying to take us... I go back to the Moby Dick thing.
[02:27:21.849 --> 02:27:24.770]  Okay, let me start with coups.
[02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:29.272]  There are what we call the soft coup that I've been involved in, and the hard coup that I've been involved in.
[02:27:29.272 --> 02:27:36.956]  The hard coup was overseas, Soviet Union, Panama, where we used military financial assets.
[02:27:36.956 --> 02:27:41.158]  I've been involved in two soft coups directly here in the United States.
[02:27:41.158 --> 02:27:47.100]  One was in the Nixon transition of power, where I was brought in and it was done quietly.
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:50.422]  It was done with the help of the CIA and other agencies.
[02:27:50.842 --> 02:27:53.464]  And we transferred power to Ford.
[02:27:53.464 --> 02:28:10.298]  The other soft coup, I won't get into the details, was involved when I was warned by Robert Gates and I was dealing with our military to say, okay, Cheney and our Secretary of Defense are going to have to go, Rumsfeld.
[02:28:10.298 --> 02:28:12.039]  And Gates was brought in.
[02:28:12.039 --> 02:28:16.503]  Now I happen to know Gates and Gates has been
[02:28:18.844 --> 02:28:19.765]  Let me put it this way.
[02:28:19.765 --> 02:28:28.807]  He's associated with many different people, but when he was put in as director of the CIA, he was not exactly the most intelligent director.
[02:28:28.807 --> 02:28:36.430]  So it was not hard to initiate a soft coup and bring in someone else into the position that we needed.
[02:28:36.430 --> 02:28:37.990]  The military understood it.
[02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:39.651]  We kept quiet.
[02:28:39.651 --> 02:28:40.991]  Let me put this again.
[02:28:40.991 --> 02:28:46.853]  I've said it a couple of years ago on your show that the Clintons would never come back.
[02:28:47.558 --> 02:28:50.119]  And I said that there was a coup at the time.
[02:28:50.119 --> 02:28:52.279]  Let me put it again.
[02:28:52.279 --> 02:29:01.362]  If there's any attempt by the Democrats to come in legally or illegally, I can assure you and your audience that's not going to happen.
[02:29:01.362 --> 02:29:09.864]  I'm not going to pronounce what I have to say because I'll have the FBI right at my door as I had last time when I criticized Obama.
[02:29:09.864 --> 02:29:11.765]  But the bottom line is that
[02:29:12.345 --> 02:29:16.788]  There are many ways to make sure that the Democrats don't come to power.
[02:29:16.788 --> 02:29:19.390]  The legal way and there are other ways.
[02:29:19.390 --> 02:29:22.493]  Trump understands pretty much what has to be done.
[02:29:22.493 --> 02:29:23.593]  No, I agree.
[02:29:23.593 --> 02:29:28.877]  When they're running around saying death to America and burning cities and this, I'm getting, I mean, I'm not looking for bull.
[02:29:28.877 --> 02:29:29.858]  I just want him to stop it.
[02:29:29.858 --> 02:29:33.340]  I mean, I feel guilty watching them do this.
[02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:35.222]  You shouldn't feel guilty.
[02:29:35.222 --> 02:29:39.285]  I understand what you're talking about in terms of what happened to the cities.
[02:29:40.015 --> 02:29:46.900]  It's shameful, but the reality is coronavirus hit on a very interesting dynamic.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:49.943]  And that was, do we need cities?
[02:29:49.943 --> 02:29:56.808]  And do we need cities that were really in effect... Obviously the cities are obsolete and corrupt and a big problem.
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:03.702]  Well, but you see, when you say, obviously, had it not been for coronavirus, we wouldn't have seen that.
[02:30:03.702 --> 02:30:06.103]  So you've got Los Angeles in trouble.
[02:30:06.103 --> 02:30:07.823]  You've got Chicago in trouble.
[02:30:07.823 --> 02:30:12.005]  Yeah, but you said 15 years ago that they would collapse along with the EU.
[02:30:12.005 --> 02:30:13.565]  And that's what I predicted.
[02:30:13.565 --> 02:30:24.649]  So what happens is the rural areas, the areas around the West and Southwest, when I said to you, the East Coast and the West Coast are finished.
[02:30:24.649 --> 02:30:25.549]  You said that actually more than
[02:30:25.929 --> 02:30:34.574]  Exactly, and that's exactly what happened.
[02:30:34.574 --> 02:30:36.815]  Did we initiate the coronavirus?
[02:30:36.815 --> 02:30:37.595]  No.
[02:30:37.595 --> 02:30:39.736]  Is the coronavirus that lethal?
[02:30:39.736 --> 02:30:41.277]  Absolutely not.
[02:30:41.277 --> 02:30:42.598]  What happened in effect?
[02:30:42.598 --> 02:30:47.020]  Instead of getting rid of some of the politicians, we should get rid of Fauci, NIH,
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:56.064]  And one of the things that I wanted Trump to do is to decrease the size of this humongous federal government that's useless.
[02:30:56.064 --> 02:30:59.466]  Two million people with more agencies that you can think of.
[02:30:59.466 --> 02:31:00.947]  We don't need that.
[02:31:00.947 --> 02:31:03.888]  I don't need 16 intelligence units.
[02:31:03.888 --> 02:31:07.790]  I don't need a 2.2 million military army.
[02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:08.531]  So let me ask you this.
[02:31:08.531 --> 02:31:10.111]  What do the Democrats do?
[02:31:10.111 --> 02:31:12.673]  Final segment, we'll get into 9-11 because the anniversary is tomorrow.
[02:31:13.553 --> 02:31:15.416]  What do the Democrats in the deep state do?
[02:31:15.416 --> 02:31:20.282]  I don't see them adopting CHICOM anti-American policy, being a viable second party.
[02:31:20.282 --> 02:31:22.164]  We need a second party, obviously.
[02:31:22.164 --> 02:31:23.546]  So what happens to the Democrats?
[02:31:23.546 --> 02:31:26.270]  I just don't see leaving them there.
[02:31:27.615 --> 02:31:32.439]  Well, it's not an issue about you or me, it's an issue that they're fading away.
[02:31:32.439 --> 02:31:46.529]  In other words, those people who were really active in the Democratic Party, they're older, they're about my age, they no longer have the enthusiasm for the progressive issues that they were involved in in the 60s and 70s when we had a war.
[02:31:47.310 --> 02:31:58.803]  Now, the young kids who went into the progressive movements are beginning to realize, wait a minute, I'm listening to podcasts where I have to learn how to make a living, but I don't want to go to the universities.
[02:31:58.803 --> 02:32:05.270]  One of the great benefits of this coronavirus, despite the fact that I went to all the elite universities,
[02:32:05.650 --> 02:32:12.817]  It's to make sure that Cornell University understands it is not essential to have Cornell University.
[02:32:12.817 --> 02:32:15.640]  What I said when I went there was a waste of time.
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.802]  I was on a New York State scholarship.
[02:32:17.802 --> 02:32:23.568]  When I went to Cornell University Medical College, as Fauci did, I said that was a waste of time.
[02:32:23.568 --> 02:32:24.969]  I didn't need four years.
[02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.731]  You need two years and a year and a half.
[02:32:27.231 --> 02:32:32.417]  When I went to Harvard in psychiatry, I said that was a complete waste of time.
[02:32:32.417 --> 02:32:34.580]  And by the way, they went under five years.
[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:42.529]  So what I'm getting at is there's selective entropy that is occurring with the virus that's taking out universities.
[02:32:42.529 --> 02:32:43.050]  In other words,
[02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:48.413]  We're getting into a whole new landscape that you and I predicted years ago.
[02:32:48.413 --> 02:32:55.098]  There won't be those expensive universities for $65,000 or $50,000 a year in education.
[02:32:55.098 --> 02:32:59.201]  I see young people, particularly young women, going to colleges.
[02:33:00.001 --> 02:33:03.604]  Community college to study nursing, para-nursing.
[02:33:03.604 --> 02:33:05.766]  You're not going to have the medical doctors.
[02:33:05.766 --> 02:33:09.729]  You're not going to have the big hospitals that really don't need to be around.
[02:33:09.729 --> 02:33:14.914]  You're not going to have the multi-million dollar bills that come in from the medical department.
[02:33:14.914 --> 02:33:18.637]  You're going to see a whole transformation of society.
[02:33:18.637 --> 02:33:22.160]  Do we need academicians and retain them on a union?
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:22.280]  No.
[02:33:23.055 --> 02:33:26.876]  Do I need all these military men?
[02:33:26.876 --> 02:33:27.236]  No.
[02:33:27.236 --> 02:33:30.637]  Do I need generals who never fought a war, never won a war?
[02:33:30.637 --> 02:33:31.457]  No.
[02:33:31.457 --> 02:33:34.978]  Do I need the bankers where the banks really are no longer effective?
[02:33:34.978 --> 02:33:42.820]  So you're saying the vestigial bureaucracy, that wasn't even vestigial, it was never actually anything real, it was the imitation of the vestigial, that's going to fall away.
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:44.481]  My concern is, we'll come back and talk about this,
[02:33:45.782 --> 02:33:46.002]  Yes.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:12.121]  Trigger the exact scenario to destroy themselves.
[02:34:12.121 --> 02:34:13.641]  That makes me ask what you said.
[02:34:13.641 --> 02:34:14.601]  Oh, the U.S.
[02:34:14.601 --> 02:34:16.501]  government or any intelligence agencies, we're not behind this.
[02:34:16.501 --> 02:34:17.562]  I agree with you.
[02:34:17.562 --> 02:34:24.863]  It's the magic of their own craziness has dug their own pit and thrown themselves into it.
[02:34:24.863 --> 02:34:27.083]  And so I just wonder when you say, well, they're fading away.
[02:34:27.083 --> 02:34:29.484]  Yeah, but how do they fade away?
[02:34:29.484 --> 02:34:32.184]  We'll come back and then talk about what is it, 20 years later?
[02:34:32.184 --> 02:34:32.944]  Yeah.
[02:34:32.944 --> 02:34:34.465]  19 years later, the 9-11 anniversary.
[02:34:36.363 --> 02:34:37.424]  Was it an inside job?
[02:34:37.424 --> 02:34:38.784]  Obviously, but what is an inside job?
[02:34:38.784 --> 02:34:48.068]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:34:48.068 --> 02:34:54.852]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and it's free will.
[02:34:54.852 --> 02:35:04.016]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists, the anti-humans, openly tell you what they're doing.
[02:35:04.716 --> 02:35:09.777]  And openly tell you that you're worthless and crap and you need to die because that will save the Earth.
[02:35:09.777 --> 02:35:17.799]  They do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[02:35:17.799 --> 02:35:19.440]  They are making you hate yourself.
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:21.340]  They are making you be depressed.
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:26.321]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[02:35:26.321 --> 02:35:28.222]  And that's what all this is about, you know.
[02:35:28.222 --> 02:35:32.103]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[02:35:32.703 --> 02:35:42.299]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies, the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[02:35:42.299 --> 02:35:45.184]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[02:35:45.184 --> 02:35:45.805]  It's time to say no.
[02:35:47.907 --> 02:36:11.254]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[02:36:11.254 --> 02:36:17.076]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[02:36:17.856 --> 02:36:20.157]  This is a power grab.
[02:36:20.157 --> 02:36:23.538]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[02:36:23.538 --> 02:36:26.900]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:31.082]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S.
[02:36:31.082 --> 02:36:37.504]  for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[02:36:37.504 --> 02:36:42.766]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them.
[02:36:42.766 --> 02:36:44.587]  It's a very simple equation.
[02:36:44.587 --> 02:36:45.167]  It's illegal.
[02:36:45.167 --> 02:36:46.008]  We must resist it.
[02:36:48.789 --> 02:36:55.413]  You've always had a pledge from me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human, temporal truth can get.
[02:36:55.413 --> 02:37:05.820]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored, darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive, so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:08.882]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[02:37:08.882 --> 02:37:13.985]  So, when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[02:37:13.985 --> 02:37:15.126]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[02:37:16.254 --> 02:37:22.839]  And when I tell you that this country and the world is under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that.
[02:37:22.839 --> 02:37:27.022]  You can look out the window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news, you can see
[02:37:28.319 --> 02:37:29.940]  But you've got this commitment.
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.781]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[02:37:31.781 --> 02:37:33.702]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[02:37:33.702 --> 02:37:39.965]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and that only happens when you support what you've been doing.
[02:37:39.965 --> 02:37:40.925]  So again, I thank you.
[02:37:40.925 --> 02:37:46.548]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[02:37:46.548 --> 02:37:47.769]  Again, I thank you all.
[02:37:47.769 --> 02:37:50.650]  Ignorance does not equal bliss.
[02:37:50.650 --> 02:37:53.212]  Ignorance equals slavery.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:38:01.729]  If you're ignorant, walking through a field at night, that there's a six-foot hole up ahead, you're gonna step in it and probably break your ankle.
[02:38:01.729 --> 02:38:02.991]  Or maybe worse.
[02:38:02.991 --> 02:38:05.394]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization.
[02:38:06.294 --> 02:38:14.819]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very, very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate.
[02:38:14.819 --> 02:38:19.121]  And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[02:38:19.121 --> 02:38:30.527]  Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries, what the Club of Rome say.
[02:38:30.527 --> 02:38:32.829]  So I know exactly what's going on.
[02:38:33.789 --> 02:38:41.237]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person, but I actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff.
[02:38:41.237 --> 02:38:43.379]  I know that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:38:43.379 --> 02:38:44.521]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[02:38:44.521 --> 02:38:50.487]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[02:38:50.487 --> 02:38:53.090]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:10.561 --> 02:39:19.023]  Since Steve McShinnick earlier mentioned this, I thought we'd actually play the clip where he talks about how Biden has dedicated his whole career to de-industrializing this country.
[02:39:19.023 --> 02:39:24.304]  Here's what the president had to say.
[02:39:24.304 --> 02:39:27.245]  But the other is a basic disaster for our country.
[02:39:27.245 --> 02:39:37.967]  Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends.
[02:39:39.434 --> 02:39:41.995]  Now, in the time we have left, we're going to have a little bit of 9-11.
[02:39:41.995 --> 02:39:44.276]  Dr. Pacino, he's welcome back tomorrow if he wants you to get into 9-11.
[02:39:44.276 --> 02:39:47.058]  It's important to talk about what happened there and what went on.
[02:39:47.058 --> 02:39:52.221]  Now that we've moved on past that group, I don't talk about it a lot because I don't want to demoralize people, but, you know, we've covered it at nauseam.
[02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:58.644]  It's important to remember what happened so it doesn't happen again and to know that Trump called in the day after it happened and said, you know, they had bombs in the buildings, they blew it up.
[02:39:58.644 --> 02:39:59.984]  I mean, he can see what happens.
[02:39:59.984 --> 02:40:01.205]  He's a good guy at the end of the day.
[02:40:01.205 --> 02:40:02.286]  We're blessed to have him.
[02:40:02.286 --> 02:40:03.546]  He deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:40:03.546 --> 02:40:05.407]  That would bring credit back to that prize.
[02:40:05.407 --> 02:40:06.148]  It's become a joke.
[02:40:07.068 --> 02:40:08.810]  With Obama getting one.
[02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:10.552]  But what about big tech?
[02:40:10.552 --> 02:40:22.263]  We know the Crypt Keeper left and all their behavior is a joke and is in trouble and Herman Von Ruppe dancing around two years ago saying GG Ping will crush America and the Washington Post running the headline.
[02:40:22.263 --> 02:40:24.526]  I mean, that's delusional craziness.
[02:40:24.526 --> 02:40:30.311]  But what about the big corporations, the Jeff Bezos's of the world and all the rest of them that
[02:40:31.365 --> 02:40:35.847]  That, you know, say they're not against America, but at the end of the day, I don't see them strengthening America.
[02:40:35.847 --> 02:40:37.428]  What do we do about big tech censorship?
[02:40:37.428 --> 02:40:39.549]  Because most people couldn't hold on.
[02:40:39.549 --> 02:40:41.770]  We've held on thanks to our listeners.
[02:40:41.770 --> 02:40:42.831]  And we can say we're winning.
[02:40:42.831 --> 02:40:44.472]  I guess, culturally, Trump gets back in.
[02:40:44.472 --> 02:40:45.392]  We should see some action.
[02:40:45.392 --> 02:40:53.516]  But what should be done about big tech and the incredible censorship and the oppression and Twitter blocking Trump's tweets?
[02:40:53.516 --> 02:40:57.198]  I mean, these big corporations still think they're in charge.
[02:40:57.198 --> 02:41:00.080]  And I don't want a big, powerful government like you.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:06.522]  These corporations are already operating like... I mean, if the NSA did the stuff that Google did, they'd all be arrested and they should.
[02:41:06.522 --> 02:41:08.883]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:41:08.883 --> 02:41:10.583]  I think you hit it on the head.
[02:41:10.583 --> 02:41:13.004]  The real problem is what we've been talking about.
[02:41:13.004 --> 02:41:21.186]  The major corporations, as I said last time, many of them were funded by the CIA, what we call In-Q-Tel.
[02:41:21.186 --> 02:41:23.747]  And we have a vested interest in it.
[02:41:23.747 --> 02:41:26.068]  But Trump was starting to take down
[02:41:27.506 --> 02:41:30.627]  Amazon, he was already threatening Google.
[02:41:30.627 --> 02:41:38.951]  He understood more than anybody else that these are not viable economic entities in terms of American business.
[02:41:38.951 --> 02:41:42.592]  No, they're out-of-control imperiums that are cozying up to China.
[02:41:42.592 --> 02:41:43.292]  Correct.
[02:41:43.292 --> 02:41:46.814]  Well, let me put the China issue in context.
[02:41:46.814 --> 02:41:50.495]  Number one, we've confronted China in the South China Sea.
[02:41:50.495 --> 02:41:52.076]  I wrote about that years ago.
[02:41:52.076 --> 02:41:53.136]  Sure, you said it was coming in your book.
[02:41:54.187 --> 02:41:56.069]  Right, in Pax Pacifica.
[02:41:56.069 --> 02:42:06.698]  I'm not worried about China right now, because China has a bigger problem in the United States, and that is Trump's personal friend, Modi of India.
[02:42:06.698 --> 02:42:12.042]  Because Modi of India will not tolerate Xi's incursions into the Himalayas.
[02:42:12.042 --> 02:42:14.684]  That's right, we put them in check with Modi, absolutely.
[02:42:14.684 --> 02:42:19.728]  I agree, economically we can defeat them, but what about the left's hatred of themselves and the country?
[02:42:19.728 --> 02:42:20.249]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:42:21.462 --> 02:42:25.404]  The hatred that they have is going to exhaust themselves out.
[02:42:25.404 --> 02:42:29.266]  The left will no longer be a viable entity.
[02:42:29.266 --> 02:42:31.327]  The students really don't care.
[02:42:31.327 --> 02:42:37.650]  I mean, much of what you're seeing in terms of demonstrations and all that, it's not ideological.
[02:42:37.650 --> 02:42:38.951]  It's boredom.
[02:42:38.951 --> 02:42:48.235]  It's what happened when we put in six months of coronavirus sit-down or shut-down and lockdown, and so they went out and started to protest.
[02:42:48.235 --> 02:42:48.875]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:48.875 --> 02:42:49.876]  That was all done by design.
[02:42:50.865 --> 02:42:51.466]  Correct.
[02:42:51.466 --> 02:42:52.848]  There are no wars.
[02:42:52.848 --> 02:42:53.590]  There's nothing.
[02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:55.072]  They can really come in.
[02:42:55.072 --> 02:42:57.716]  So it's like a coming-of-age thing for a bunch of methods.
[02:42:58.666 --> 02:43:00.567]  Correct, and that's exactly it.
[02:43:00.567 --> 02:43:05.571]  Those who will want to get ahead are going to understand one thing better than anybody else.
[02:43:05.571 --> 02:43:09.194]  You better understand how to get an education for the new world.
[02:43:09.194 --> 02:43:14.358]  You're not going to four years of Harvard, MIT, to be cyber communication.
[02:43:14.358 --> 02:43:17.780]  You're going to have to go to a community college if that.
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:19.622]  If not, you're going to go on YouTube.
[02:43:19.622 --> 02:43:20.602]  So it's a no-no.
[02:43:20.602 --> 02:43:22.564]  Everything is about what you can do in the real world now.
[02:43:22.564 --> 02:43:25.206]  It's going to be absolutely back to what you can do.
[02:43:26.221 --> 02:43:26.841]  Right.
[02:43:26.841 --> 02:43:29.883]  And why is Alex Jones important?
[02:43:29.883 --> 02:43:31.024]  I'm not glorifying you.
[02:43:31.024 --> 02:43:42.692]  I'm just saying the validity and the reality of Alex Jones was you maintained a certain entity and integrity for 25 odd years.
[02:43:42.692 --> 02:43:44.393]  Washington Post couldn't do that.
[02:43:44.393 --> 02:43:46.314]  New York Times couldn't do that.
[02:43:46.314 --> 02:43:48.215]  None of our media could do that.
[02:43:48.215 --> 02:43:49.936]  TV is gone.
[02:43:49.936 --> 02:43:52.058]  Newspapers are gone.
[02:43:52.058 --> 02:43:53.178]  Radio is gone.
[02:43:53.178 --> 02:43:55.480]  They've all got to be propped up because they don't give people what they want.
[02:43:56.716 --> 02:43:57.637]  That's the point.
[02:43:57.637 --> 02:43:58.938]  They're antiquated.
[02:43:58.938 --> 02:44:01.680]  So you can say whatever you want in the New York Times.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:03.662]  Nobody's going to look at it seriously.
[02:44:03.662 --> 02:44:05.743]  But they're going to listen to a podcast.
[02:44:05.743 --> 02:44:10.887]  They're going to call what we call the alternative media became the mainstream media.
[02:44:10.887 --> 02:44:13.209]  You and I talked about it for decades.
[02:44:13.209 --> 02:44:15.411]  This would become the mainstream media.
[02:44:15.751 --> 02:44:16.192]  No, I agree.
[02:44:16.192 --> 02:44:17.314]  You called it all, Dr. Petchenik.
[02:44:17.314 --> 02:44:17.794]  StevePetchenik.com.
[02:44:17.794 --> 02:44:19.076]  You've been a true visionary.
[02:44:19.076 --> 02:44:24.325]  So, in the few minutes we have left, what do you predict their due sex or their ace in the hole could be?
[02:44:24.325 --> 02:44:25.226]  A false flag?
[02:44:25.226 --> 02:44:26.969]  I mean, I don't want to be overconfident.
[02:44:26.969 --> 02:44:29.413]  What could this corrupt establishment do to make sure Trump doesn't get in?
[02:44:31.721 --> 02:44:42.092]  They're not going to do anything, because what happens when you're incompetent and self-destructive, you're trying to maintain the last vestiges of your own entity.
[02:44:42.092 --> 02:44:44.755]  In other words, there's nothing they can do right now.
[02:44:44.755 --> 02:44:48.639]  So all they can do is destroy what they already have control of, which destroys them, but that's the only power they have.
[02:44:49.468 --> 02:44:50.289]  That's about it.
[02:44:50.289 --> 02:45:00.443]  I mean, basically, if I were Kamala Harris, I'd get out of that and wait for another five to six years to have an independent race.
[02:45:00.443 --> 02:45:02.526]  But I wouldn't want to be next to Biden.
[02:45:02.526 --> 02:45:05.229]  I wouldn't want the Democratic Party next to Biden.
[02:45:05.229 --> 02:45:06.972]  Is there going to be a Democratic Party?
[02:45:06.972 --> 02:45:07.072]  No.
[02:45:07.745 --> 02:45:13.448]  I think what's going to happen are those individuals, the youth of this country, should start coming in.
[02:45:13.448 --> 02:45:17.530]  They will develop their own organization, whatever it's called.
[02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:18.731]  It can be progressive.
[02:45:18.731 --> 02:45:20.272]  It can be called independent.
[02:45:20.272 --> 02:45:25.595]  But I predict that independent movements will arise from these young individuals.
[02:45:25.595 --> 02:45:28.556]  Some will come into the Republican and Conservative parties.
[02:45:28.556 --> 02:45:33.539]  Some will try to become more centrist on the left wing.
[02:45:33.539 --> 02:45:36.981]  But I think the old notion of Republican Party, that's gone.
[02:45:37.461 --> 02:45:39.063]  It's called the Trump Party.
[02:45:39.063 --> 02:45:42.146]  I was about to say, the Republicans already had their renaissance.
[02:45:42.146 --> 02:45:42.667]  It's called Trump.
[02:45:43.612 --> 02:45:44.373]  Correct.
[02:45:44.373 --> 02:45:47.255]  And Trump is an entity unto himself.
[02:45:47.255 --> 02:45:48.616]  It's sui generis.
[02:45:48.616 --> 02:45:50.357]  Alex Jones, sui generis.
[02:45:50.357 --> 02:45:52.639]  Steve Pagenic, sui generis.
[02:45:52.639 --> 02:45:54.980]  Maybe Tom Clancy, along with that.
[02:45:54.980 --> 02:46:00.544]  But my point is, we each created our own viability without self-destructing.
[02:46:00.544 --> 02:46:09.611]  And as you said, that's the American system, is the individual developing something others like, then they adopt and expands, which brings real diversity to the market.
[02:46:10.392 --> 02:46:11.814]  Now hit it on the head.
[02:46:11.814 --> 02:46:13.356]  We're about individualists.
[02:46:13.356 --> 02:46:14.798]  We're about risk-taking.
[02:46:14.798 --> 02:46:16.301]  We're about consistency.
[02:46:16.301 --> 02:46:24.033]  We're about constant risk-taking, constant bombardment, but we're the only system that's viable in this world.
[02:46:24.033 --> 02:46:24.914]  You go to Europe,
[02:46:25.655 --> 02:46:26.576]  Totally.
[02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:27.337]  Stagnant.
[02:46:27.337 --> 02:46:28.318]  Stagnant.
[02:46:28.318 --> 02:46:31.261]  No, I mean, I'm blessed to be under attack, and I know you are as well.
[02:46:31.261 --> 02:46:33.883]  It's just crazy, and it's a wild time to be alive.
[02:46:33.883 --> 02:46:39.129]  We didn't get into 9-11, but... We'll talk about it tomorrow, but we don't have to get into that right now.
[02:46:39.129 --> 02:46:39.789]  Yeah, come on tomorrow about 9-11.
[02:46:39.789 --> 02:46:40.870]  You want to come on tomorrow?
[02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:41.151]  What hour?
[02:46:41.869 --> 02:46:43.310]  Of course, I'm always happy to go on.
[02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:47.492]  But basically, you're there and you will continue to be there.
[02:46:47.492 --> 02:46:50.373]  As long as you're there, Trump continues.
[02:46:50.373 --> 02:46:55.475]  As long as Trump continues, we're going to make all kinds of treaties and economic recovery.
[02:46:55.475 --> 02:46:57.016]  The country knows it.
[02:46:57.016 --> 02:47:01.238]  What you don't see in the cities are the flags and the cars.
[02:47:02.066 --> 02:47:08.114]  You're not going to go in New York and fly a huge Trump sign.
[02:47:08.114 --> 02:47:13.521]  You go here in Central Florida in a Baptist area, you're going to see Trump signs everywhere.
[02:47:13.521 --> 02:47:16.125]  You go into a local restaurant, there's Trump.
[02:47:17.417 --> 02:47:18.758]  On the one side, the other.
[02:47:18.758 --> 02:47:24.202]  You don't even have to say a word because you know you belong with the people you belong to.
[02:47:24.202 --> 02:47:26.564]  And that's what's going to happen to you and me.
[02:47:26.564 --> 02:47:30.268]  You're going to accrue more people on the alternative media.
[02:47:30.268 --> 02:47:32.129]  We're going to accrue more problems.
[02:47:32.129 --> 02:47:33.730]  That's the nature of what we do.
[02:47:33.730 --> 02:47:36.152]  And Trump will eventually come back.
[02:47:36.152 --> 02:47:37.654]  Will they attempt a coup?
[02:47:37.654 --> 02:47:38.454]  Not really.
[02:47:38.454 --> 02:47:40.636]  There's no one there who knows really how to do it.
[02:47:40.636 --> 02:47:43.719]  I was about to say, they're all a bunch of talkers that try to get somebody else to do it.
[02:47:44.741 --> 02:47:48.845]  Yeah, but you know, it's like saying, you know, do something that you don't know how to do.
[02:47:48.845 --> 02:47:52.088]  I mean, it's very nice to say to people, go do a coup.
[02:47:52.088 --> 02:47:57.593]  You might as well tell them to go cook a bake, bake a cake, because they don't know what a coup is.
[02:47:57.593 --> 02:47:58.614]  It sounds nice.
[02:47:58.614 --> 02:47:59.515]  It sounds easy.
[02:47:59.515 --> 02:48:01.076]  No, those of us.
[02:48:01.076 --> 02:48:02.037]  Madison never do that.
[02:48:02.037 --> 02:48:03.698]  All he did was be a cherry Marine.
[02:48:03.698 --> 02:48:04.499]  All right.
[02:48:04.499 --> 02:48:06.881]  Dr. Pachinik, we'll talk to you tomorrow about 9-11, once you're an expert on.
[02:48:06.881 --> 02:48:07.502]  Thank you so much.
[02:48:07.502 --> 02:48:08.423]  Take care.
[02:48:08.423 --> 02:48:09.384]  Thank you.
[02:48:09.384 --> 02:48:09.924]  Thank you.
[02:48:09.924 --> 02:48:10.104]  All right.
[02:48:12.113 --> 02:48:15.496]  Former Navy SEAL, Patriot, Ryder, coming up.
[02:48:15.496 --> 02:48:18.178]  Matt Bracken, I look forward to him hosting.
[02:48:18.178 --> 02:48:23.223]  I need to put this out or we won't be here, because, I mean, I love the confidence of Pachinic, but it's all you keeping us on air.
[02:48:23.223 --> 02:48:25.284]  We're under massive attack constantly.
[02:48:25.284 --> 02:48:26.725]  I didn't get into this today like I meant to.
[02:48:26.725 --> 02:48:28.387]  I got a big stack of news on this.
[02:48:28.387 --> 02:48:30.729]  The supply chain is having problems with this globalist lockdown.
[02:48:30.729 --> 02:48:32.430]  You need to get storable food now.
[02:48:32.430 --> 02:48:33.772]  You are self-sufficient.
[02:48:33.772 --> 02:48:36.194]  And we've got great supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:36.194 --> 02:48:38.596]  We've got the Save InfoWars, Save the Republic.
[02:48:39.818 --> 02:48:44.147]  Save yourself up to 60% off DNA Force Plus.
[02:48:44.147 --> 02:48:45.671]  All t-shirts 1776.
[02:48:45.671 --> 02:48:46.793]  All the free shipping.
[02:48:46.793 --> 02:48:49.118]  APEC Power Stack about to sell out 60% off free shipping.
[02:48:50.268 --> 02:48:52.789]  X2 back in stock, 50% off free shipping.
[02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:56.130]  Heart and Body Combo, Vasovage, Centella, 50% off free shipping.
[02:48:56.130 --> 02:48:58.930]  We have the high quality Ultimate Fish Oil.
[02:48:58.930 --> 02:49:00.171]  That's discounted free shipping.
[02:49:00.171 --> 02:49:02.631]  Prostacard with the high dosages of zinc.
[02:49:02.631 --> 02:49:06.732]  Another key component for your glands, like Saw Palmetto, back in stock free shipping.
[02:49:06.732 --> 02:49:10.614]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 4-stage ion filter, $149 plus free shipping.
[02:49:10.614 --> 02:49:11.894]  And it goes on and on from there.
[02:49:11.894 --> 02:49:13.954]  I would take advantage of this right now.
[02:49:13.954 --> 02:49:15.615]  And we just need to sell out the stock we've got.
[02:49:16.618 --> 02:49:19.200]  Because Botanics Confident, that's great.
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.362]  But I just know I've been doing this 26 years and what we've built up, what we've gotten.
[02:49:22.362 --> 02:49:24.244]  We need your support now more than ever.
[02:49:24.244 --> 02:49:26.826]  So I salute you and I thank you for that support.
[02:49:26.826 --> 02:49:28.187]  You know, I said I'd do this.
[02:49:28.187 --> 02:49:30.769]  I'll do five more minutes and then he'll take over.
[02:49:30.769 --> 02:49:32.670]  And then I should probably just start the show with this tomorrow.
[02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:35.733]  It's the whole DNA vaccine, RNA vaccine situation.
[02:49:37.813 --> 02:49:40.854]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:49:40.854 --> 02:49:42.395]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:49:42.395 --> 02:49:43.936]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:49:43.936 --> 02:49:45.616]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:49:45.616 --> 02:49:46.697]  I want them shut down.
[02:49:46.697 --> 02:49:47.657]  I want them silenced.
[02:49:47.657 --> 02:49:48.478]  I want them muted.
[02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:50.298]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:49:50.298 --> 02:49:51.359]  You kept us on air.
[02:49:51.359 --> 02:49:52.940]  We did the analysis first.
[02:49:52.940 --> 02:49:54.000]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.081]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:49:56.081 --> 02:50:02.204]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:50:02.204 --> 02:50:03.744]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:50:03.744 --> 02:50:04.945]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:50:04.945 --> 02:50:07.266]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:50:07.606 --> 02:50:10.627]  This is not going to happen, so they are moving now to destroy them.
[02:50:10.627 --> 02:50:13.148]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:50:13.148 --> 02:50:15.108]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:50:15.108 --> 02:50:16.049]  We're in this together.
[02:50:16.049 --> 02:50:24.291]  Because let me tell you something, communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting, and you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:50:24.291 --> 02:50:26.552]  My children are right here!
[02:50:26.552 --> 02:50:28.512]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:50:28.512 --> 02:50:29.773]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:50:29.773 --> 02:50:30.853]  And I need prayer!
[02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:32.174]  And I need action!
[02:50:32.174 --> 02:50:34.454]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[02:50:34.454 --> 02:50:36.415]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:50:40.043 --> 02:50:50.306]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[02:50:50.306 --> 02:50:51.607]  It's amazing.
[02:50:51.607 --> 02:50:55.808]  Well, we set out a few years ago to go out and develop with Tom
[02:50:56.248 --> 02:50:57.429]  We're good to go.
[02:51:14.776 --> 02:51:16.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:51:55.837 --> 02:52:09.606]  Alright folks, we are back live, and I should have just led the show with this, but there's all this attempted coup news, Main Street news against Trump, and just all the insanity that I went off down that area, and I think it's been a powerful three hours Matt Bracken's about to take over.
[02:52:09.606 --> 02:52:13.829]  But let's go over some of these headlines, some of the recent ones and the new ones today.
[02:52:13.829 --> 02:52:21.715]  UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccines, and the actual reports from the UN admit that most polio worldwide is the vaccine.
[02:52:22.765 --> 02:52:24.746]  Oh, and there's a cancer virus they give them on top of it.
[02:52:24.746 --> 02:52:27.227]  I mean, come on, man.
[02:52:27.227 --> 02:52:30.649]  And then they starve the Africans and the UN helps fund all that.
[02:52:30.649 --> 02:52:34.050]  So they've got lower IQs because they're not getting any protein.
[02:52:34.050 --> 02:52:37.052]  And then they ship them here.
[02:52:37.052 --> 02:52:39.493]  You take white people and not give them food and do the same damn thing.
[02:52:39.493 --> 02:52:42.134]  I mean, it's dangerous as hell.
[02:52:42.134 --> 02:52:43.995]  Let's continue.
[02:52:43.995 --> 02:52:48.497]  UN forced to admit Gates funded vaccine is causing polio outbreak in Africa.
[02:52:50.711 --> 02:52:52.712]  And that leads us to this.
[02:52:52.712 --> 02:52:53.813]  Okay.
[02:52:53.813 --> 02:52:59.036]  I've been studying these vaccines they're creating.
[02:52:59.036 --> 02:53:02.638]  These new ones that go in and change the DNA.
[02:53:02.638 --> 02:53:05.619]  These mRNA vaccines.
[02:53:05.619 --> 02:53:15.825]  And so I spent a couple hours this morning going and just reading just random scientific reports and peer reviewed studies by prestigious universities and medical centers.
[02:53:15.825 --> 02:53:17.286]  And I found stuff five years ago
[02:53:18.263 --> 02:53:35.367]  They were first getting funding, and the first studies were, well, the problem is if you randomly change the nuclei of a cell, it can release proteins that actually flip off the switches in the cells and make them start dying.
[02:53:35.367 --> 02:53:37.327]  When your cells start dying, you start dying.
[02:53:37.327 --> 02:53:39.287]  And it causes cancer, mutations, you name it.
[02:53:39.287 --> 02:53:42.408]  So, just randomly searching this today.
[02:53:47.301 --> 02:53:48.041]  It blew me away.
[02:53:48.041 --> 02:53:52.985]  So what normally goes on is they inject you with tetanus or they inject you with something else.
[02:53:52.985 --> 02:53:55.046]  Your white blood cells go and learn how to kill it.
[02:53:55.046 --> 02:54:02.911]  They weaken the smallpox or whatever they put in you so your body learns how to defeat it and creates an autoimmunity.
[02:54:02.911 --> 02:54:11.156]  This goes into the cell nucleus and reprograms the cell to create a protein that they claim then will block
[02:54:12.250 --> 02:54:14.132]  The virus getting into the cell.
[02:54:14.132 --> 02:54:16.113]  And they admit they don't even know if it works.
[02:54:16.113 --> 02:54:20.797]  What they're really doing is a mass experimentation.
[02:54:20.797 --> 02:54:22.798]  So let me just show you some of these reports.
[02:54:22.798 --> 02:54:26.681]  Genetic alterations of chromosome 8 gene in oral cancer.
[02:54:26.681 --> 02:54:29.203]  So this is what I came up with.
[02:54:29.203 --> 02:54:32.946]  And it turned out that when I searched it, others had already figured it out.
[02:54:32.946 --> 02:54:35.008]  And I'm not even a scientist.
[02:54:35.008 --> 02:54:41.273]  That when you alter protein in the cells with one of these new so-called vaccines,
[02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:48.513]  That when you do that, it can turn off chromosome 8.
[02:54:48.513 --> 02:54:50.854]  And when you do that, the whole body falls apart.
[02:54:50.854 --> 02:54:54.975]  It's basically a kill switch.
[02:54:54.975 --> 02:54:59.177]  And that's ncbi.nlmnih.gov.
[02:54:59.177 --> 02:55:01.859]  I mean, this is what they say.
[02:55:01.859 --> 02:55:07.101]  Creating a path of treatment for chromosome 8p disorders through research community and intelligent information.
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:12.745]  The promise of mRNA vaccines, a biotech and industrial perspective.
[02:55:12.745 --> 02:55:16.108]  These are the ones that change your whole body.
[02:55:16.108 --> 02:55:18.291]  And it goes in.
[02:55:18.291 --> 02:55:18.892]  It changes.
[02:55:20.993 --> 02:55:25.454]  The DNA of the cell with the RNA and then has the cell.
[02:55:25.454 --> 02:55:26.415]  That's what a virus does.
[02:55:26.415 --> 02:55:28.055]  It goes in and reprograms the cell.
[02:55:28.055 --> 02:55:30.816]  They're not trying to teach your white blood cells how to stop this.
[02:55:30.816 --> 02:55:38.718]  They create a virus that reprograms your cell to then become immune to something, but they admit it's pure testing on the public.
[02:55:38.718 --> 02:55:40.638]  They skipped the animal testing.
[02:55:40.638 --> 02:55:41.339]  They didn't really do that.
[02:55:41.339 --> 02:55:44.279]  They actually did the animal testing and it killed a bunch of the animals.
[02:55:44.279 --> 02:55:45.860]  We looked all that up too.
[02:55:45.860 --> 02:55:49.581]  RNA vaccine is a novel technology to prevent and treat disease.
[02:55:51.237 --> 02:55:53.760]  HMS, Harvard.
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:58.525]  Glitches in DNA replication have important implications for treating cancer.
[02:55:58.525 --> 02:56:05.953]  And it all goes into, when you start taking these new vaccines, these mRNA vaccines, it can actually give you cancer.
[02:56:05.953 --> 02:56:07.135]  And again, I'm no rocket scientist.
[02:56:07.135 --> 02:56:07.835]  I said that from the start.
[02:56:07.835 --> 02:56:11.500]  I said, you're randomly going in to reprogram a cell to start replicating?
[02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:12.521]  That sounds like cancer to me.
[02:56:13.817 --> 02:56:21.968]  That's what cancer viruses do, is they go in, most cancers viral, and cause your body to do that.
[02:56:21.968 --> 02:56:28.236]  So we'll cover this more tomorrow, but mitochondrial analysis of 8p3, 1 deletion in new patients, atypical.
[02:56:29.526 --> 02:56:30.547]  RNA vaccine.
[02:56:30.547 --> 02:56:35.053]  I mean, it's just all Pfizer's latest stealthy move to help it win the coronavirus vaccine race.
[02:56:35.053 --> 02:56:35.553]  On and on and on.
[02:56:35.553 --> 02:56:37.275]  And we're all just guinea pigs.
[02:56:37.275 --> 02:56:40.499]  The psychotic person, Bill Gates, who says he wants us dead.
[02:56:40.499 --> 02:56:43.482]  I mean, this is real simple what's going on here, folks.
[02:56:43.482 --> 02:56:44.464]  These people are out of their minds.
[02:56:46.277 --> 02:56:52.384]  The mask is more than just a symbol of subservience, being a blind follower, not knowing facts and science.
[02:56:52.384 --> 02:56:55.588]  It's a symbol that you have been turned into a subhuman.
[02:56:55.588 --> 02:56:57.530]  And they tell you, you are not essential.
[02:56:57.530 --> 02:57:03.277]  Remember, first they said no more industry, you'll be a service economy, and now they tell you service is not essential.
[02:57:03.277 --> 02:57:05.559]  This has been the post-industrial world plan the whole time?
[02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:25.346]  The Rockefeller Foundation admits that this is how they're going to slowly teach you to be totally poor and under their control so you can finally be starved to death of nutrients and then killed with very, very weak bio-weapons that won't affect anyone that actually gets their RDA of vitamins and minerals.
[02:57:25.346 --> 02:57:27.767]  And so that's the plan for you and your family.
[02:57:27.767 --> 02:57:32.949]  Now I know you're tuned into this broadcast, you've checked this out for yourself, you know it's true, so let's start warning the sheep.
[02:57:33.769 --> 02:57:35.691]  Let's start educating them now.
[02:57:35.691 --> 02:57:41.036]  I just went and swam at the lake and I walked around for 20 minutes educating people after I got out of the water.
[02:57:41.036 --> 02:57:41.777]  It's that simple.
[02:57:41.777 --> 02:57:44.099]  We must take action now or be slaves forever.
[02:57:44.099 --> 02:57:44.660]  This is life and death.
[02:57:55.934 --> 02:58:02.758]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:58:02.758 --> 02:58:10.602]  And now your host, Matt Bracken.
[02:58:10.602 --> 02:58:16.685]  OK, it's going to be a little bit different today because I wrote a piece for American Partisan.
[02:58:16.685 --> 02:58:20.147]  I actually wrote it over like the last two days, but it went up this morning.
[02:58:20.979 --> 02:58:27.422]  It's called armed citizens must defend their communities from rioting mobs.
[02:58:27.422 --> 02:58:34.544]  If the politicized police will not, I kind of put my thoughts about all of this, uh, down on paper.
[02:58:34.544 --> 02:58:44.008]  And I think it's a good starting point for crystallizing the view that if the police aren't going to defend us, we're seriously going to have to defend ourselves.
[02:58:44.008 --> 02:58:45.108]  So here it goes.
[02:58:45.108 --> 02:58:46.769]  It's going to take probably this whole block.
[02:58:48.271 --> 02:59:09.158]  In societies living under the rule of law, sworn law enforcement officers have always been considered fully justified in applying lethal force against violent mobs during arson riots, such as those which we have been seeing with regularity in American cities during the summer of 2020.
[02:59:09.158 --> 02:59:16.401]  This was the intent and meaning of police officials publicly reading the Riot Act.
[02:59:17.026 --> 02:59:23.411]  Announcing over a loudspeaker that a violent mob had been declared to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:59:23.411 --> 02:59:25.813]  That is to say, a riot.
[02:59:25.813 --> 02:59:38.924]  Rioters who lingered on the street after that final warning could be engaged by law enforcement at any level, up to and including the use of deadly force, with no further announcement.
[02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:49.926]  This was, in more prior, civilized times, a basic understanding of all citizens living under the rule of law.
[02:59:49.926 --> 03:00:03.573]  This is why a police officer's standard-issue pump shotgun was traditionally referred to as a riot gun, long before the development of modern, less-than-lethal munitions.
[03:00:03.573 --> 03:00:08.256]  This is also why arson riots were uncommon and short-lived.
[03:00:09.128 --> 03:00:12.249]  Everyone understood the ground rules.
[03:00:12.249 --> 03:00:17.610]  There was no right to burn, loot, or murder.
[03:00:17.610 --> 03:00:28.272]  Thomas Sowell put it this way, if you are not prepared to use force to defend civilization, then be prepared to accept barbarism.
[03:00:28.272 --> 03:00:33.153]  Note that he did not say the government or the police department.
[03:00:33.153 --> 03:00:37.934]  He said you must be prepared to defend civilization.
[03:00:39.574 --> 03:01:05.045]  ABR, which is my own acronym for the Current Working Coalition of Antifa, BLM, and the Revolutionary Communist Party of the United States, known as REVCOM, they are now routinely using Molotov cocktails, which are gasoline bombs, and other incendiary and explosive devices as offensive weapons
[03:01:05.652 --> 03:01:11.913]  In both an anti-personnel and an anti-property role, that's arson.
[03:01:11.913 --> 03:01:19.835]  As far as the BATFE is concerned, a Molotov cocktail is an illegal explosive device.
[03:01:19.835 --> 03:01:32.738]  And so are powerful high-altitude fireworks, when they are deployed at ground level, as anti-personnel and anti-property explosive and incendiary grenades.
[03:01:34.176 --> 03:02:01.290]  ABR deliberately uses the anonymity of their black-clad and face-masked mobs to conceal the identity of their individual bomb throwers in exactly the same way that the 19th century Ku Klux Klan Knight Riders carrying torches on arson missions concealed their identities with white robes and hoods.
[03:02:02.475 --> 03:02:26.020]  There is no moral or ethical requirement for either police or ordinary citizens protecting their communities from violent mobs to identify and ferret out the individual bomb throwers when the rest of the mob is intentionally surrounding and protecting them in order to shield them from that identification.
[03:02:27.105 --> 03:02:46.252]  Because of the deliberately created synergy of bomb throwers utilizing the anonymity of the mob, the entire ABR mob becomes a legitimate target for police arrest or for armed community self-defense.
[03:02:46.252 --> 03:02:46.792]  Furthermore,
[03:02:47.483 --> 03:03:15.059]  At this writing, in September of 2020, there is no moral or ethical requirement for a law-abiding American citizen to wait for a lit Molotov cocktail to crash through the window of their home or business, while ABR mobs are rampaging through the streets conducting arson attacks, as we have seen in Kenosha, Portland, Minneapolis, and elsewhere.
[03:03:16.224 --> 03:03:33.532]  Once the fires begin, morally and ethically, the same rules for the use of force should apply that would attach to a lynch mob or to Ku Klux Klan Knight Riders on their way to burn homes or businesses.
[03:03:33.532 --> 03:03:43.116]  Both KKK Knight Riders bearing torches in olden times and violent mobs of ABR terrorists with Molotov cocktails
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:56.893]  Can and should be engaged by armed citizens with any necessary level of force required to halt their terroristic depredations.
[03:03:56.893 --> 03:03:58.495]  In numerous recent cases.
[03:03:59.145 --> 03:04:15.835]  Law enforcement under leftist political control has repeatedly abdicated its traditional and expected role in breaking up violent riots and preventing arson and other terror attacks.
[03:04:15.835 --> 03:04:25.621]  Week by week, the level of ABR violence has been steadily escalating, and it's logical to assume that this will only worsen
[03:04:26.335 --> 03:04:30.779]  As the hotly contested presidential election draws near.
[03:04:30.779 --> 03:04:32.801]  We know this is a fact.
[03:04:32.801 --> 03:04:36.004]  So let me be very clear.
[03:04:36.004 --> 03:04:51.998]  If Democrat Party governors, mayors, and DAs have hamstrung their police for political reasons and won't allow them to protect the lives and property of their local citizens using all required force,
[03:04:53.226 --> 03:05:07.256]  Abandoning their primary role in order to bow to the ABR mob, then it is time for their undefended citizens to apply the clear intent of the Second Amendment.
[03:05:07.256 --> 03:05:15.781]  There should be deep regret about the abandonment of the rule of law by the Democrat Party political ruling class.
[03:05:15.781 --> 03:05:21.065]  But there should be no moral quibbles or hesitation by American citizens
[03:05:21.573 --> 03:05:31.975]  concerning the legitimacy of armed community self-defense in the absence of expected law enforcement protection.
[03:05:31.975 --> 03:05:49.078]  Therefore, it is my carefully considered opinion that black clad and masked ABR mobs rampaging and terrorizing innocent citizens under the cover of darkness in the style of the KKK of old
[03:05:50.350 --> 03:06:12.676]  May morally and ethically be taken under preemptive fire by armed citizens at any level to drive them out of their peaceful neighborhoods and away from their businesses before the ABR terrorists can reach their targets and throw their Molotov cocktails.
[03:06:12.676 --> 03:06:13.976]  As an historical note,
[03:06:14.648 --> 03:06:42.897]  It should be understood that the National Rifle Association, yes, the NRA, was founded after the last American Civil War by former Union Army officers and Republicans at that, in order to empower freed African American former slaves to defend themselves with firearms against KKK night raids.
[03:06:42.897 --> 03:06:43.537]  In the 19th century,
[03:06:44.867 --> 03:07:06.166]  The Democrat Party, then allied with the Klan, as the Democrats of today are aligned with Antifa and BLM, had favored strict gun control in the form of narrowly written laws restricting the legal ownership of firearms by black citizens.
[03:07:06.166 --> 03:07:09.789]  The more things change, the more things stay the same.
[03:07:10.985 --> 03:07:13.926]  Only the color of the robes have really changed.
[03:07:13.926 --> 03:07:16.006]  It's the same Democrat Party.
[03:07:16.006 --> 03:07:25.428]  They've just switched teams in terms of who they're using as their brown shirts, their red guard, their KKK.
[03:07:25.428 --> 03:07:30.029]  But make no mistake, this is a modern Klan.
[03:07:30.029 --> 03:07:34.670]  Antifa and BLM are no more than the Democrat Party's modern Klan.
[03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:37.971]  And we'll talk more about this on the other side of the break.
[03:07:37.971 --> 03:07:38.531]  Be right back.
[03:07:48.044 --> 03:07:54.348]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic carbine?
[03:07:54.348 --> 03:07:56.550]  It only takes about 30 seconds.
[03:07:56.550 --> 03:08:04.715]  The MECH-TECH carbine upper is classified as an accessory and can be delivered right to your doorstep with no FFL or background check required.
[03:08:04.715 --> 03:08:07.497]  It's the world's most versatile pistol accessory.
[03:08:07.497 --> 03:08:09.458]  Build your custom upper today.

[03:08:15.327 --> 03:08:24.910]  Attention radio listeners, have you ever wanted to be independent of the utility companies and actually generate your own supply of off-grid electrical power?
[03:08:24.910 --> 03:08:29.031]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[03:08:29.031 --> 03:08:29.991]  Here's why.
[03:08:29.991 --> 03:08:35.152]  A limited number of solar-powered backup generators are back in stock and now available.
[03:08:35.152 --> 03:08:40.174]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:08:40.914 --> 03:08:50.359]  And unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[03:08:50.359 --> 03:08:55.661]  It's like having an electric power plant running silently, secretly, in your own home.
[03:08:55.661 --> 03:09:00.224]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, even keep food from spoiling.

[03:09:14.244 --> 03:09:15.464]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:09:15.464 --> 03:09:19.386]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:09:19.386 --> 03:09:20.906]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:09:20.906 --> 03:09:23.867]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:09:23.867 --> 03:09:29.429]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:30.629]  I can help you, too.
[03:09:30.629 --> 03:09:33.570]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:09:33.570 --> 03:09:35.791]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:09:35.791 --> 03:09:40.232]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:09:40.232 --> 03:09:42.533]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:09:45.942 --> 03:09:50.483]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[03:09:50.483 --> 03:09:53.023]  This is taken under the tongue.
[03:09:53.023 --> 03:09:55.224]  It is pure turmeric.
[03:09:55.224 --> 03:10:04.425]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[03:10:04.425 --> 03:10:10.267]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[03:10:10.267 --> 03:10:12.407]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[03:10:12.887 --> 03:10:15.769]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[03:10:15.769 --> 03:10:17.950]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[03:10:17.950 --> 03:10:20.072]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[03:10:20.072 --> 03:10:22.253]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[03:10:22.253 --> 03:10:23.614]  Some like bodies better.
[03:10:23.614 --> 03:10:27.757]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[03:10:27.757 --> 03:10:28.938]  And they fund the InfoWars.
[03:10:28.938 --> 03:10:33.561]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:10:33.561 --> 03:10:34.221]  Get an additional 25% off.
[03:10:34.221 --> 03:10:34.642]  This is a 360 win.
[03:10:39.125 --> 03:11:00.018]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this Operation Red Mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night.
[03:11:00.018 --> 03:11:01.159]  Now he's come out with a statement
[03:11:01.659 --> 03:11:10.723]  And told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically lost, that they're not going to let Trump declare victory, even though it's overwhelming.
[03:11:10.723 --> 03:11:13.824]  They'll have 95% of the vote done on election night.
[03:11:13.824 --> 03:11:17.265]  And even if you added all the other votes in against him, he'd be the winner.
[03:11:17.265 --> 03:11:19.226]  They are going to steal this election.
[03:11:19.226 --> 03:11:20.327]  They're preparing everyone.
[03:11:20.327 --> 03:11:22.688]  You've seen all the scams they've already run.
[03:11:22.688 --> 03:11:25.729]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the people.
[03:11:26.109 --> 03:11:27.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:08.907 --> 03:12:13.950]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:12:13.950 --> 03:12:16.511]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:12:16.511 --> 03:12:23.774]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:23.774 --> 03:12:32.319]  I'm really glad I was able to get that piece on armed community self-defense out in one block.
[03:12:32.319 --> 03:12:34.760]  I feel very passionately about this.
[03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:45.977]  The legal establishment, both Republicans and Democrats, politicians in general, they're never going to empower you, give you permission.
[03:12:45.977 --> 03:12:49.940]  They're never going to come out and say, look, the police aren't going to defend you.
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:52.201]  You'll just have to do it yourself.
[03:12:52.201 --> 03:12:55.864]  At most, they'll say, well, you know, you can defend your home.
[03:12:55.864 --> 03:13:00.707]  I mean, if they get right to your house, then you can defend your own house.
[03:13:01.522 --> 03:13:11.208]  But if you look at the way that this escalation is proceeding, we're going to see Molotov cocktails used against Holmes.
[03:13:11.208 --> 03:13:13.290]  That's how this is going to go.
[03:13:13.290 --> 03:13:18.273]  Everybody by now should be familiar with this Operation Red Mirage.
[03:13:18.273 --> 03:13:23.476]  That's where they expect that Trump will win on election night.
[03:13:23.476 --> 03:13:29.200]  But over the next couple weeks after that, they're going to just keep finding those mail-in ballots.
[03:13:29.793 --> 03:13:38.635]  So what election night really is, is the count for the Democrats of how many ballots they need in which key swing states.
[03:13:38.635 --> 03:13:41.875]  They're going to pull an Al Franken in four or five states.
[03:13:41.875 --> 03:13:43.996]  That is their plan.
[03:13:43.996 --> 03:13:48.277]  And during this chaos, they are going to go for the street fight.
[03:13:48.277 --> 03:13:52.457]  They are not, they are not going to do this just in court.
[03:13:52.457 --> 03:13:55.298]  They are, they are lifting this to the crisis stage.
[03:13:56.141 --> 03:14:02.103]  And they are assuming that Americans are just eventually going to cry uncle.
[03:14:02.103 --> 03:14:11.105]  Everybody by now that's watching this show should be fully familiar with the ex-KGB officer Yuri Bezmenov.
[03:14:11.105 --> 03:14:21.568]  And I don't need to, you know, go into it, but he has explained in brilliant lectures that were taped by E. Edward Griffin, you know, 30 years ago, how the KGB
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:34.405]  First promotes demoralization, which may take decades, 15, 20 years, then a destabilization period, then a crisis leading to a change of government.
[03:14:34.405 --> 03:14:39.688]  And we are now in the end of the destabilization and the beginning of the crisis phase.
[03:14:39.688 --> 03:14:44.890]  So when your friends and relatives tell you, I just have no idea how this is happening.
[03:14:44.890 --> 03:14:45.911]  It's so unexpected.
[03:14:45.911 --> 03:14:48.392]  I never thought anything like this could happen in America.
[03:14:48.999 --> 03:15:01.570]  You need to teach them about color revolutions and how this is a plan that's often used by our CIA, their KGB against, you know, third world countries to flip their governments.
[03:15:01.570 --> 03:15:04.252]  Now it's being used in our own country.
[03:15:04.252 --> 03:15:10.918]  We even have former generals like Stanley McChrystal working on disinformation campaigns.
[03:15:11.673 --> 03:15:17.618]  Which I guarantee you is how that Trump called the dead soldiers losers and suckers.
[03:15:17.618 --> 03:15:20.321]  Classic disinformation campaign.
[03:15:20.321 --> 03:15:27.888]  And they always camouflage these as we're just defending against Trump's disinformation.
[03:15:27.888 --> 03:15:30.030]  We have to put out the truth.
[03:15:30.030 --> 03:15:35.915]  That's always the camouflage when they set up their own active measures division.
[03:15:36.474 --> 03:15:45.917]  They just say it's self-defense, but it's actually pure active measures now being used at home against Americans.
[03:15:45.917 --> 03:15:48.398]  And to me, it's pure treason.
[03:15:48.398 --> 03:15:56.600]  Now, as we come closer to the election, expect this violence to ramp up and escalate.
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:01.201]  And people are constantly asking, what's the trigger?
[03:16:01.201 --> 03:16:02.162]  What's the go?
[03:16:02.162 --> 03:16:03.502]  What's the signal?
[03:16:03.502 --> 03:16:05.003]  When do we charge back?
[03:16:05.003 --> 03:16:06.223]  When do we counterattack?
[03:16:06.718 --> 03:16:18.924]  Well, I've got to tell you, it's actually counterproductive to meet Antifa and BLM, which is the Democrats' new KKK, or brown shirts, or red guards.
[03:16:18.924 --> 03:16:25.587]  It's counterproductive to meet them on the public square with your own shields and batons.
[03:16:25.587 --> 03:16:30.849]  That is actually what Antifa is attempting to get the right to do.
[03:16:33.413 --> 03:16:39.695]  Putting the heat up under the pot to bring the destabilization to the crisis phase.
[03:16:39.695 --> 03:17:00.742]  Then, at the end of the crisis, you get antithesis, then synthesis, and a new government which will be predicated upon, there will be no peace until Antifa, or whatever they're calling it later, the progressives, are put on the police department, are included in the police department.
[03:17:00.742 --> 03:17:02.923]  So when they talk about defunding the police,
[03:17:03.621 --> 03:17:06.262]  They're not talking about getting rid of police.
[03:17:06.262 --> 03:17:10.183]  They're talking about Antifa becoming the police.
[03:17:10.183 --> 03:17:24.308]  And there will be a synthesis phase where they'll say, look, the only way we can get peace back in this country is to have Antifa, a former Antifa boss, be on the police department commission.
[03:17:24.308 --> 03:17:25.689]  This is coming.
[03:17:25.689 --> 03:17:31.171]  But in order to get that pot really boiling, they're going to increase the night attacks.
[03:17:31.676 --> 03:17:38.539]  Like we saw in Kenosha, like we saw in Minneapolis, Portland every night for a hundred nights.
[03:17:38.539 --> 03:17:46.483]  But instead of just attacking the government structures as they were in Portland night after night, they're now taking it to the suburbs.
[03:17:46.483 --> 03:17:56.427]  The way that we saw BLM do it in Rochester, New York, attacking a restaurant, then fanning into the neighborhoods saying, you know, no justice, no sleep.
[03:17:57.165 --> 03:18:11.374]  Well, the Kenosha-style arson riots against businesses and automobiles, that's going to gradually move to targeted attacks against residential dwellings.
[03:18:11.374 --> 03:18:22.641]  And if you can roll that security tape of a guy bringing in a Molotov cocktail, the first one, the black and white one, imagine you're in your house.
[03:18:23.354 --> 03:18:32.577]  And you've been somebody, you know, who's active on social media, and this is what comes through your front door, okay?
[03:18:32.577 --> 03:18:35.158]  This is through your front window.
[03:18:35.158 --> 03:18:42.040]  Not lasers, not fireworks on your front lawn, the Molotov right through your window at 3 a.m.
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:43.260]  That's coming.
[03:18:43.260 --> 03:18:46.381]  So why am I talking about all this Molotov cocktail business?
[03:18:47.645 --> 03:18:52.746]  When our side is looking for somebody to say, what's the signal?
[03:18:52.746 --> 03:18:54.207]  Where do we counterattack?
[03:18:54.207 --> 03:18:55.767]  We want to do something.
[03:18:55.767 --> 03:19:00.588]  Let's get a hundred trucks with Trump flags and drive into Antifa land.
[03:19:00.588 --> 03:19:07.710]  Let's meet Antifa with the Proud Boys and smash our shields together.
[03:19:07.710 --> 03:19:10.811]  They would love to see that erupt in gunfire.
[03:19:10.811 --> 03:19:11.831]  The communists would.
[03:19:13.067 --> 03:19:17.471]  That will be portrayed as the right-wing attacking peaceful demonstrators.
[03:19:17.471 --> 03:19:19.693]  But there's one target out there.
[03:19:19.693 --> 03:19:21.534]  This is the low-hanging fruit.
[03:19:21.534 --> 03:19:25.498]  There's one target that nobody will defend.
[03:19:25.498 --> 03:19:30.222]  And that is an arsonist who is in the commission of arson.
[03:19:30.222 --> 03:19:40.591]  When a guy is holding the Molotov cocktail, when the store next door has been lit on fire and they're moving from the furniture store to the liquor store to the pharmacy with Molotovs,
[03:19:41.408 --> 03:19:45.650]  Those guys can and should be shot.
[03:19:45.650 --> 03:19:47.231]  The police used to do that.
[03:19:47.231 --> 03:19:49.292]  That used to be the police job.
[03:19:49.292 --> 03:19:53.354]  Nobody had a right to go around burning cars and businesses.
[03:19:53.354 --> 03:19:55.675]  The police would shoot them.
[03:19:55.675 --> 03:20:00.457]  That was how civilization was defended throughout all of history.
[03:20:00.457 --> 03:20:01.157]  Period.
[03:20:01.157 --> 03:20:04.779]  That's why a shotgun was called a riot gun.
[03:20:04.779 --> 03:20:09.081]  Okay, now the police, for political reasons, are told they can't do that.
[03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:13.433]  They've got to just send social workers as buildings are being burned.
[03:20:13.433 --> 03:20:20.498]  Well, let me tell you, if it doesn't stop, it's going to move from businesses and cars to homes.
[03:20:20.498 --> 03:20:22.239]  This is going to happen.
[03:20:22.239 --> 03:20:29.204]  And not only Molotovs, but the high altitude fireworks that, you know, explode thousands of feet in the air.
[03:20:29.204 --> 03:20:30.545]  You throw that into a building,
[03:20:31.340 --> 03:20:33.662]  It's an incendiary explosive device.
[03:20:33.662 --> 03:20:39.045]  And we're going to talk about this on the other side and the way that we're going to fight back against this thing.
[03:20:39.045 --> 03:20:40.386]  Starting with the arsonists.
[03:20:45.256 --> 03:20:49.619]  Big Tech is the global straitjacket of the New World Order.
[03:20:49.619 --> 03:20:52.801]  It is the enforcement system, the surveillance system.
[03:20:52.801 --> 03:21:01.226]  It's going to track everything you do, everywhere you go, everything you say, everything you basically think, and then reward or punish you for those behaviors.
[03:21:01.226 --> 03:21:02.626]  And they're not liberals.
[03:21:02.626 --> 03:21:04.948]  That's a complete and total cover.
[03:21:04.948 --> 03:21:09.831]  They are monsters that love authoritarianism and are building towards a post-human world.
[03:21:10.251 --> 03:21:22.055]  Their mission is to destroy indigenous communities, annihilate small towns, annihilate all human culture, and consolidate us all, isolate us all, and then carry out our orderly extermination.
[03:21:22.055 --> 03:21:24.955]  This is their public master plan.
[03:21:24.955 --> 03:21:30.417]  COVID-19 is the cover for the rollout of this digital control system.
[03:21:30.417 --> 03:21:33.258]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only going to get worse from here.
[03:21:33.258 --> 03:21:39.740]  When you see officials from Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than Hitler.
[03:21:40.081 --> 03:21:42.598]  They want to murder you and your family.
[03:21:42.598 --> 03:21:43.303]  You have been warned.
[03:21:44.642 --> 03:21:52.946]  As of 54 days out, the globalist, child-molesting, devil-worshippers know they're in trouble and they know Trump's going to win the landslide.
[03:21:52.946 --> 03:21:56.668]  So they're saying they're going to contest the election and pledge the country to civil war.
[03:21:56.668 --> 03:22:01.671]  And they are throwing hack attacks at InfoWars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[03:22:01.671 --> 03:22:03.012]  It's incredible.
[03:22:03.012 --> 03:22:07.794]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at InfoWars4.com is critical.
[03:22:07.794 --> 03:22:08.995]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[03:22:08.995 --> 03:22:10.376]  We've only got a few months
[03:22:11.096 --> 03:22:11.977]  A backup.
[03:22:11.977 --> 03:22:15.461]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[03:22:15.461 --> 03:22:17.944]  We need to have extra money in our coffers.
[03:22:17.944 --> 03:22:21.448]  To be able to expand in this homestretch, not just contract.
[03:22:21.448 --> 03:22:25.613]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[03:22:25.913 --> 03:22:28.535]  So I know you're going to step up at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:28.535 --> 03:22:32.858]  We've got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock.
[03:22:32.858 --> 03:22:38.843]  We've got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts, and so much more.
[03:22:38.843 --> 03:22:41.945]  Get prepared and fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:41.945 --> 03:22:42.686]  God bless you all.
[03:22:44.116 --> 03:22:50.020]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[03:22:50.020 --> 03:22:51.821]  I don't say it to scare you.
[03:22:51.821 --> 03:22:54.343]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[03:22:54.343 --> 03:22:58.045]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[03:22:58.045 --> 03:23:05.831]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[03:23:05.831 --> 03:23:08.512]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant.
[03:23:08.512 --> 03:23:11.875]  They've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[03:23:11.875 --> 03:23:13.916]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[03:23:14.657 --> 03:23:21.322]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[03:23:21.322 --> 03:23:24.264]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[03:23:24.264 --> 03:23:26.086]  And it's coming out in the open.
[03:23:26.086 --> 03:23:31.450]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[03:23:31.450 --> 03:23:33.412]  But others are going to fight.
[03:23:33.412 --> 03:23:38.376]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[03:23:38.376 --> 03:23:38.897]  No.
[03:23:38.897 --> 03:23:41.899]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[03:23:41.899 --> 03:23:42.740]  Research what that is.
[03:23:46.934 --> 03:24:05.818]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:05.818 --> 03:24:12.219]  Okay, when we left off, we were talking about the perfect low-hanging fruit.
[03:24:12.219 --> 03:24:14.900]  The communist revolutionary target
[03:24:15.788 --> 03:24:18.930]  That nobody is going to mourn or grieve.
[03:24:18.930 --> 03:24:28.075]  This is not even a George Floyd or a Jacob Blake or anybody like that.
[03:24:28.075 --> 03:24:38.160]  Somebody who is engaged in the act of preparing and throwing Molotov cocktails can and should be shot.
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:44.424]  Go to YouTube or Bitshoot, probably YouTube has more, and just do a search for
[03:24:45.666 --> 03:24:51.449]  Police officer or policeman, you know, set on fire by Molotov cocktail.
[03:24:51.449 --> 03:24:55.690]  And you will see some really horrible stuff.
[03:24:55.690 --> 03:25:03.694]  When police have to be, you know, 20 feet from these these guys, they are in Molotov range.
[03:25:03.694 --> 03:25:14.219]  And a Molotov cocktail can change your life because that stuff burning on your back, you know, it's kind of funny because the guy had it coming.
[03:25:14.219 --> 03:25:15.119]  He was in Antifa.
[03:25:15.808 --> 03:25:18.350]  In Portland, and it was his legs.
[03:25:18.350 --> 03:25:36.124]  But when you see police officers getting third degree burns, you know, they are on fire until they can be put out for enough time to, if not kill them, put them in pain and change their lives dramatically and horribly.
[03:25:36.124 --> 03:25:40.167]  Not to mention just using Molotovs against property.
[03:25:40.762 --> 03:25:49.207]  You know, furniture stores, the clock store in Kenosha, the hundred-year-old camera store.
[03:25:49.207 --> 03:25:54.850]  That is destroying people's lives, things that they have built for their entire life.
[03:25:54.850 --> 03:25:58.853]  So nobody is going to mourn if they're shot.
[03:25:58.853 --> 03:26:07.738]  When we used to be civilized, and there used to be ground rules for civilized behavior, arsonists in the act were shot.
[03:26:08.849 --> 03:26:20.432]  So what happens if you're in a Democrat city, Democrat governor, Democrat Marxist DA, and they just let these guys out night after night to escalate their operations?
[03:26:20.432 --> 03:26:25.253]  You know, throwing the high-altitude fireworks as grenades, for example.
[03:26:25.253 --> 03:26:28.093]  Which is like a, almost like a white phosphorus grenade.
[03:26:28.093 --> 03:26:34.595]  You know, you've got magnesium and other burning metals that are stuck into your skin, burning.
[03:26:34.595 --> 03:26:36.475]  Well, these guys that are doing this,
[03:26:37.515 --> 03:26:43.920]  If the police aren't around because the police have been told, just let that Antifa mob go.
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:47.882]  You go back to Rochester the night that they were attacking the restaurants.
[03:26:47.882 --> 03:26:55.728]  They had to park, you know, maybe 50 to 100 cars at some nearby parking lot and assemble and march down there.
[03:26:55.728 --> 03:26:59.350]  Do you think that the police didn't know what was happening?
[03:26:59.350 --> 03:27:01.732]  The police were told to avoid the area.
[03:27:03.035 --> 03:27:05.557]  So this is a two-way street.
[03:27:05.557 --> 03:27:24.273]  When the police are told to avoid an Antifa riot, to just let them go into a neighborhood, because confronting them will lead to a bigger crisis, and they're just crossing their fingers and hoping that these Antifas will just march through, make some noise, and leave.
[03:27:24.273 --> 03:27:25.434]  But what if they don't?
[03:27:25.434 --> 03:27:26.615]  There's no police around.
[03:27:27.481 --> 03:27:45.335]  At the first sign of anything being lit, one car, one abandoned business, as far as I'm concerned, the rule for the use of force, the rules of engagement, should be nobody gets to light Molotov cocktails in my city, in my county.
[03:27:45.335 --> 03:27:49.279]  And if the police aren't around to stop it, then we'll stop it.
[03:27:49.279 --> 03:27:52.061]  Now, how do you stop this?
[03:27:52.061 --> 03:27:53.862]  Matt, you're just going to get arrested.
[03:27:53.862 --> 03:27:55.804]  Remember, the police aren't around.
[03:27:56.932 --> 03:28:04.556]  And I'm not saying stand on your front porch, under your front porch light, holding your AR, like the McCloskeys in St.
[03:28:04.556 --> 03:28:05.816]  Louis.
[03:28:05.816 --> 03:28:16.761]  I'm talking about hearing something blocks away, banging drums, you know, bullhorns at 3 o'clock in the morning, coming into the neighborhood.
[03:28:16.761 --> 03:28:25.005]  As soon as the first molotov is lit, as far as I'm concerned, the entire mob is a legitimate target.
[03:28:25.563 --> 03:28:36.734]  You know, the Antifa themselves have diagrams of how to work this, where the bomb throwers are shielded by the outer ring of human shields.
[03:28:36.734 --> 03:28:45.482]  So the guys with, the fakers with the press and the medic all over their helmets, they're on the outer ring against the police.
[03:28:45.482 --> 03:28:49.006]  The Molotov throwers are ten people back behind them.
[03:28:49.961 --> 03:28:52.342]  Using them as human shields.
[03:28:52.342 --> 03:29:06.425]  Well, if you're part of a team and your role is to be a human shield for a Molotov cocktail thrower, then you have no right to expect that you will be treated any better than the Molotov cocktail thrower.
[03:29:06.425 --> 03:29:11.066]  You can see the diagram that is up shows how they do this.
[03:29:11.066 --> 03:29:13.227]  You know, they've got their umbrella people, their medics.
[03:29:13.227 --> 03:29:15.167]  This is carefully calculated.
[03:29:15.167 --> 03:29:19.248]  They have people driving along, passing out the high-power fireworks.
[03:29:20.098 --> 03:29:24.482]  And they use cutouts so the guy that throws the firework doesn't even know what it is.
[03:29:24.482 --> 03:29:26.184]  He's just going to light it and throw it.
[03:29:26.184 --> 03:29:27.965]  And he can't point.
[03:29:27.965 --> 03:29:33.210]  Even if he has stopped and questioned, all he can say is, some guy in a van handed it to us.
[03:29:34.235 --> 03:29:35.575]  That's all he can say.
[03:29:35.575 --> 03:29:37.376]  It's very carefully thought out.
[03:29:37.376 --> 03:29:42.897]  We are up against an evil communist national militia.
[03:29:42.897 --> 03:29:49.999]  Some of the same characters from Portland have been traveling to Kenosha, to Chicago, to Washington D.C.
[03:29:49.999 --> 03:29:52.020]  during the convention.
[03:29:52.020 --> 03:29:53.641]  It's the same characters.
[03:29:53.641 --> 03:29:58.982]  I don't know if and when the Department of Justice is ever going to actually arrest the leadership.
[03:29:58.982 --> 03:30:01.423]  They should before the election.
[03:30:01.423 --> 03:30:02.363]  But if they don't,
[03:30:03.543 --> 03:30:25.477]  The Go Code, as far as I'm concerned, in your neighborhood, I'm not saying travel out of state pursuing Antifa, but in your zip code, in your barrio, when you hear the Antifa is coming and the first item is lit on fire, it can be a car, it can be an abandoned gas station, it doesn't matter.
[03:30:26.252 --> 03:30:33.284]  There is nothing separating the mob, then, from throwing a Molotov cocktail through your front bedroom window.
[03:30:33.284 --> 03:30:34.226]  Nothing.
[03:30:34.226 --> 03:30:35.989]  This is like saying, well, you know...
[03:30:36.417 --> 03:30:43.303]  The sniper is only shooting over there, so I don't have any justification in shooting the sniper.
[03:30:43.303 --> 03:30:45.165]  He hasn't shot in my direction yet.
[03:30:45.165 --> 03:30:52.112]  Yes, when a sniper is up on a building shooting over toward the freeway, you do have the right to shoot the sniper.
[03:30:52.112 --> 03:30:57.537]  When people are lighting Molotov cocktails, they have given up their civil rights.
[03:30:57.537 --> 03:31:01.781]  There's no civil right to burn, loot, and murder.
[03:31:01.781 --> 03:31:02.061]  None.
[03:31:03.506 --> 03:31:07.308]  And in all previous eras, this was completely understood.
[03:31:07.308 --> 03:31:17.413]  This has been a negative consequence of phenomenon like the less-than-lethal munitions, tasers, rubber bullets.
[03:31:17.413 --> 03:31:23.376]  It used to be, say, up through the 50s and 60s, police actually had a height limit.
[03:31:23.376 --> 03:31:27.798]  In city police, you had to be a big dude, 5'10 or taller in general.
[03:31:28.996 --> 03:31:32.177]  You had a six-shooter, no personal radio, right?
[03:31:32.177 --> 03:31:35.159]  You had to like go down a block and call on a police box.
[03:31:35.159 --> 03:31:39.280]  You had a six-shooter and you had a hickory baton.
[03:31:39.280 --> 03:31:39.981]  That was it.
[03:31:39.981 --> 03:31:50.285]  You were expected to go into a barroom brawl and if they didn't obey you as a police officer, you were justified in just busting heads.
[03:31:50.285 --> 03:31:50.765]  Period.
[03:31:51.243 --> 03:31:53.625]  The sixth shooter was the last thought.
[03:31:53.625 --> 03:31:57.228]  That would be like a bank robber running out of a bank.
[03:31:57.228 --> 03:32:03.453]  Otherwise, you were expected to cause mayhem with that truncheon, and you were justified in doing it.
[03:32:03.453 --> 03:32:05.615]  Now, you need social workers.
[03:32:05.615 --> 03:32:19.746]  You need to try to wrestle a guy down with five cops that aren't gonna actually hurt him, and then you see what happened, like, in Atlanta, you know, where there's a brawl, the guy's been tasered, he's running, the adrenaline is flowing, then there's gunshots.
[03:32:20.430 --> 03:32:31.139]  Or in Kenosha, where the suspect is resisting arrest, fighting actively, may or may not have had a knife, brawling with the cops.
[03:32:31.139 --> 03:32:37.144]  In previous eras, there wasn't this multi-step escalation process.
[03:32:37.144 --> 03:32:38.105]  Therefore, people knew.
[03:32:38.846 --> 03:32:45.012]  If the cops say stop and you don't stop, you're going to get a hickory club to the head or a bullet.
[03:32:45.012 --> 03:32:45.633]  That's it.
[03:32:45.633 --> 03:32:47.154]  We don't mess around.
[03:32:47.154 --> 03:32:51.778]  Now it's got to be social workers and the 10-step process with body cameras.
[03:32:51.778 --> 03:32:53.800]  It'll be reviewed by everybody.
[03:32:53.800 --> 03:32:56.643]  The police may end up going to jail for it.
[03:32:56.643 --> 03:32:58.425]  And what is the result?
[03:32:58.425 --> 03:32:59.866]  The police say, forget it.
[03:32:59.866 --> 03:33:00.867]  I won't get involved.
[03:33:01.834 --> 03:33:06.457]  If Antifa is marching through your neighborhood, I just don't want to be there.
[03:33:06.457 --> 03:33:12.281]  I'm just going to park around the back of the donut shop and wait till the noise dies down.
[03:33:12.281 --> 03:33:17.144]  What that means, people, is it's up to us.
[03:33:17.144 --> 03:33:27.530]  If the police can't do their job, or won't do their job, as men, as honorable people, then it's up to us to defend our neighborhoods.
[03:33:27.530 --> 03:33:30.292]  There was a Second Amendment before there were police.
[03:33:31.115 --> 03:33:43.460]  And there is still a Second Amendment after the police run away or are defunded and abandoned.
[03:33:43.460 --> 03:33:50.443]  Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human?
[03:33:50.443 --> 03:33:55.705]  Love to censor people, love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.
[03:33:55.705 --> 03:33:56.845]  Well, it's very simple.
[03:33:56.845 --> 03:33:59.206]  The first computers ever created were created by the
[03:33:59.246 --> 03:34:03.229]  Thomas Watson, the founder and owner of IBM, to carry out eugenics.
[03:34:03.229 --> 03:34:05.351]  And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany.
[03:34:05.351 --> 03:34:08.033]  That's what the tattoos were on the slaves' arms.
[03:34:08.033 --> 03:34:09.634]  It would decide who lived and who died.
[03:34:09.634 --> 03:34:15.739]  So from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making humans obsolete.
[03:34:15.959 --> 03:34:21.142]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein and fat in it to make your child's brain small.
[03:34:21.142 --> 03:34:24.764]  The same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers.
[03:34:24.764 --> 03:34:27.065]  The lowest IQ is about 20 points on average as well.
[03:34:27.065 --> 03:34:29.267]  These are hardcore eugenicists.
[03:34:29.267 --> 03:34:30.527]  Survival of the fittest.
[03:34:30.527 --> 03:34:31.668]  Social Darwinists.
[03:34:31.668 --> 03:34:32.689]  Grow up world.
[03:34:32.689 --> 03:34:33.669]  Admit the truth.
[03:34:33.669 --> 03:34:37.451]  Quit being soft smucks and letting these loveless run your lives.
[03:34:37.451 --> 03:34:38.932]  They are your mortal enemy.
[03:34:38.932 --> 03:34:40.613]  They want you dead.
[03:34:40.613 --> 03:34:41.574]  Do you understand that?
[03:34:43.126 --> 03:34:45.770]  The clock is ticking on the once free world.
[03:34:46.874 --> 03:34:50.096]  And the free press is under attack more than ever.
[03:34:50.096 --> 03:35:00.624]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day, without even trying to find them, of press being arrested in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[03:35:00.624 --> 03:35:05.368]  And it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech, doing it.
[03:35:05.368 --> 03:35:12.413]  They are the authoritarians, they work for the Chai Com Globalist Combine, and they are working around the clock
[03:35:13.354 --> 03:35:15.156]  to silence InfoWars.
[03:35:15.156 --> 03:35:22.902]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us, and a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[03:35:22.902 --> 03:35:32.510]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential, and I thank you all for it.
[03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:39.856]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the InfoWars and make your life healthier and better at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:39.856 --> 03:35:41.398]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:35:45.217 --> 03:35:47.501]  I know I say it all the time, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[03:35:47.501 --> 03:35:56.839]  I want to thank you, the listeners and viewers of this broadcast, and all the stations, and all the affiliates, and sponsors, and my family, and the crew, and just everybody out there.
[03:35:58.050 --> 03:36:03.593]  The listeners and viewers have just said, this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on.
[03:36:03.593 --> 03:36:06.055]  We've been proven we're right because we're being led by God.
[03:36:06.055 --> 03:36:08.196]  We have a spirit and we're very humble about that.
[03:36:08.196 --> 03:36:09.097]  This is not us.
[03:36:09.097 --> 03:36:10.177]  This is God working through us.
[03:36:10.177 --> 03:36:13.739]  But man, now it's so precious to stay on air.
[03:36:13.739 --> 03:36:17.722]  I used to think, you know, maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of recede into the
[03:36:18.602 --> 03:36:41.813]  background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but now with evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true but I I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out well now we know they're gonna carry it out and then some so we got a fight and I just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise God and pass the ammunition the info war again take action folks this is it
[03:36:44.628 --> 03:36:47.050]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person.
[03:36:47.050 --> 03:36:48.371]  I am a humble person overall.
[03:36:48.371 --> 03:36:51.473]  I've not come off as aggressive in things because I'm under threat.
[03:36:51.473 --> 03:36:52.193]  You're under threat.
[03:36:52.193 --> 03:36:54.115]  And I'm fighting as hard as I possibly can.
[03:36:54.115 --> 03:36:56.196]  And I appreciate your support and your prayers.
[03:36:56.196 --> 03:36:58.598]  But I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes.
[03:36:58.598 --> 03:36:59.999]  And I wish I did a better job.
[03:36:59.999 --> 03:37:04.923]  So that's why when you call in thanking me all the time, it just kind of makes me feel pathetic because
[03:37:05.743 --> 03:37:07.104]  I guess call it pride?
[03:37:07.104 --> 03:37:12.087]  I don't like begging you all the time to try our products, or to donate, or to spread the word, or to pray for us.
[03:37:12.087 --> 03:37:13.869]  I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[03:37:13.869 --> 03:37:15.550]  And so I want to thank you.
[03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:19.512]  It's put the cart before the horse to call it and thank me.
[03:37:19.512 --> 03:37:21.774]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[03:37:21.774 --> 03:37:23.915]  So understand, you're my equal 110%.
[03:37:23.915 --> 03:37:26.237]  And I just want to thank you all.
[03:37:26.237 --> 03:37:29.519]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody else, man.
[03:37:29.519 --> 03:37:30.720]  I just want to stay in this fight.
[03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:31.701]  And it's so serious now.
[03:37:32.421 --> 03:37:33.662]  Things are getting so clear now.
[03:37:33.662 --> 03:37:34.763]  That's why they want us off air.
[03:37:34.763 --> 03:37:36.785]  Because all of our credibility is so high.
[03:37:36.785 --> 03:37:40.708]  So let's just stay together, fight hard, spread the word, and pray to God to take us through this.
[03:37:40.708 --> 03:37:46.913]  We're gonna make it.
[03:37:46.913 --> 03:37:49.535]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:06.358 --> 03:38:08.719]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:38:08.719 --> 03:38:18.121]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:38:18.121 --> 03:38:23.123]  I have a little bit more to say about defending your own neighborhood.
[03:38:23.123 --> 03:38:31.985]  Not only your immediate subdivision, but you know, your larger neighborhood from these communist revolutionaries, because that's what they are.
[03:38:32.867 --> 03:38:43.289]  You know, BLM, and I rarely name them because naming them is actually cooperating with their propaganda, their agitprop.
[03:38:43.289 --> 03:38:50.470]  They name themselves Black Lives Matter as camouflage and as a psychological shield.
[03:38:50.470 --> 03:38:53.191]  Same thing with anti-fascist.
[03:38:53.191 --> 03:38:56.911]  These are fascist communist organizations.
[03:38:56.911 --> 03:38:59.692]  They name themselves that purely as a shield.
[03:39:00.524 --> 03:39:05.605]  I just call them ABR Antifa BLM Rev Com.
[03:39:05.605 --> 03:39:07.226]  That's who they are.
[03:39:07.226 --> 03:39:08.686]  Everybody should understand this.
[03:39:08.686 --> 03:39:10.987]  This didn't come out of nowhere.
[03:39:10.987 --> 03:39:15.728]  This is a very carefully and deliberately set plan.
[03:39:15.728 --> 03:39:17.768]  We're now coming to the culmination.
[03:39:17.768 --> 03:39:20.609]  It's like we've been cranking up the roller coaster.
[03:39:20.609 --> 03:39:22.410]  Click, click, click, click, click.
[03:39:22.410 --> 03:39:23.330]  Now we're at the top.
[03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:25.670]  You think it's been crazy so far?
[03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:28.051]  We're just at the top of the roller coaster now, folks.
[03:39:28.843 --> 03:39:31.484]  This is the end of destabilization.
[03:39:31.484 --> 03:39:34.406]  That's the catapult being wound up.
[03:39:34.406 --> 03:39:37.707]  Crisis is the catapult released.
[03:39:37.707 --> 03:39:47.191]  And that's what's going to happen between now and the election, and between the election and January 20th, Inauguration Day.
[03:39:47.191 --> 03:39:50.333]  The Democrats are very upfront talking about this.
[03:39:50.333 --> 03:39:53.094]  I call it Operation Red Mirage.
[03:39:53.094 --> 03:39:56.896]  Again, they couch their own active measures
[03:39:57.705 --> 03:40:01.529]  In self-defense, like a mirror image as camouflage.
[03:40:01.529 --> 03:40:03.290]  Don't be fooled by it.
[03:40:03.290 --> 03:40:13.460]  The plan is Trump will probably win the Electoral College on election night because, you know, the old conservatives, they like to go to the actual poll.
[03:40:13.460 --> 03:40:18.084]  The modern hip kids, they want to mail it in, which is just BS.
[03:40:18.084 --> 03:40:19.986]  They just need to know after November 3rd
[03:40:24.031 --> 03:40:31.640]  How many fake mail-in ballots do they need to Al Franken four or five swing states?
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:34.483]  If they need 50,000 in Florida, they'll find 60,000.
[03:40:34.483 --> 03:40:36.125]  If they need 20,000 in Pennsylvania, they'll find 30,000.
[03:40:36.125 --> 03:40:36.846]  That is the plan.
[03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:46.712]  Republicans will be saying, forget it, and losing their minds.
[03:40:46.712 --> 03:40:51.794]  But part of the plan is also literally taking it to the streets.
[03:40:51.794 --> 03:41:05.179]  They're going to, with full cooperation by the mainstream media, they're going to say Trump and the evil Republicans are trying to disenfranchise good progressive Americans.
[03:41:05.179 --> 03:41:09.621]  He refuses to count those mail-in ballots that we just printed yesterday.
[03:41:10.225 --> 03:41:11.166]  Thank you.
[03:41:28.636 --> 03:41:40.419]  We're going to see the tactics escalated, you know, to the war wagon, kind of like the Somali troop carrier with people fanning out with Molotov cocktails.
[03:41:40.419 --> 03:41:48.321]  We are going to see that level of violence, you know, immediately before the election and between the election and inauguration.
[03:41:48.321 --> 03:41:57.864]  The plan by the Democrats, who are fully synthesized at this point with Antifa and BLM, the plan is to deny Trump
[03:41:58.425 --> 03:42:18.412]  Any chance of staying in office after January 20th, even if they have to burn this country to the ground, as long as they can do it with the media blaming it on conservatives, you know, for not counting those bogus mailed in votes, they are going to do anything required.
[03:42:18.412 --> 03:42:25.835]  This is why they're even talking about these disloyal generals like Madison Kelly being part of a coup plan.
[03:42:27.051 --> 03:42:45.058]  Or Stanley McChrystal working for an active measures CIA-style disinformation campaign where they make up a story like, oh, Trump called the war dead of World War I losers and suckers.
[03:42:45.058 --> 03:42:46.399]  You make up the story.
[03:42:46.399 --> 03:42:48.540]  This is like CIA 101.
[03:42:48.540 --> 03:42:54.422]  This is like, you know, being run in a banana republic against some El Presidente we want out.
[03:42:55.333 --> 03:43:04.861]  And now these disloyal, treasonous generals are doing it in their own country against their own duly elected president.
[03:43:04.861 --> 03:43:12.927]  So they roll out a fake story, plant it in all of their media, and then say, oh, it's confirmed.
[03:43:12.927 --> 03:43:13.928]  It's just confirmed.
[03:43:13.928 --> 03:43:14.989]  Well, they're still anonymous.
[03:43:14.989 --> 03:43:16.730]  Yeah, but it's confirmed.
[03:43:16.730 --> 03:43:18.992]  And then you start making ads about it.
[03:43:18.992 --> 03:43:21.854]  The lie just repeats and repeats and repeats in a loop.
[03:43:22.617 --> 03:43:27.541]  And we're going to see this again and again up until Election Day.
[03:43:27.541 --> 03:43:46.054]  That's just Stanley McChrystal and other disloyal, traitorous former officers working against the duly elected president now, after the election, when the Democrats say, oh, those Republicans, Trump, they're refusing to count the mailed-in ballots that we're mass-producing in the back room.
[03:43:46.954 --> 03:43:59.463]  They think that they're going to get the military to then step in to quell these street fights between the conservatives and the progressives.
[03:43:59.463 --> 03:44:03.366]  Because this is the plan, to take it to a street fight.
[03:44:03.366 --> 03:44:12.352]  You need to go from demoralization, that was from the 60s through recently, destabilization, that's 2020, to crisis.
[03:44:15.438 --> 03:44:18.140]  That's the roller coaster, crisis.
[03:44:18.140 --> 03:44:29.107]  Now, crisis, street fighting that's so bad that the power grid is threatened, people can't get to work, and then the plan is, who can stop that?
[03:44:29.107 --> 03:44:30.848]  Only the military.
[03:44:30.848 --> 03:44:34.671]  But the military will not answer to Donald Trump.
[03:44:34.671 --> 03:44:41.916]  We've already seen that with the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and Secretary of Defense.
[03:44:42.708 --> 03:44:49.890]  Being extremely disloyal to the President and saying, no, if you try to send the 82nd Airborne to Portland, we'll just deny it.
[03:44:49.890 --> 03:44:51.750]  We just won't permit it.
[03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:55.832]  They wouldn't even allow National Guard to guard the White House with weapons.
[03:44:55.832 --> 03:45:02.113]  They kept them miles away useless, you know, while the White House is being pelted with bricks.
[03:45:02.113 --> 03:45:04.214]  These disloyal generals.
[03:45:04.901 --> 03:45:07.162]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[03:45:07.162 --> 03:45:20.886]  So we need to be prepared for this because going into something with your eyes wide open is always better than being blindsided when you think that it can't get worse and suddenly it goes up in order of magnitude.
[03:45:20.886 --> 03:45:22.586]  It's better to know it.
[03:45:22.586 --> 03:45:27.167]  That's why I use the catapult and the roller coaster analogy.
[03:45:27.167 --> 03:45:29.348]  I hear all the time, what next?
[03:45:29.755 --> 03:45:31.796]  There's never been a year like this.
[03:45:31.796 --> 03:45:33.076]  I can't take it anymore.
[03:45:33.076 --> 03:45:35.678]  Yeah, you're just, you haven't seen anything.
[03:45:35.678 --> 03:45:37.598]  You're just on top of the roller coaster.
[03:45:37.598 --> 03:45:42.520]  It's about to go, you know, ballistic gravitational out of your control.
[03:45:42.520 --> 03:45:47.443]  And you've got to be able to hang on and hang tight because it's going to get nuts.
[03:45:47.443 --> 03:45:53.565]  And like I said before, you can't just wait to defend your house.
[03:45:53.565 --> 03:45:57.667]  Your little stick built house in the subdivision is not defensible.
[03:45:58.462 --> 03:46:02.484]  And it's not enough to say, I'll wait till they're on my lawn.
[03:46:02.484 --> 03:46:04.644]  Would you let them burn your local pharmacy?
[03:46:04.644 --> 03:46:08.226]  You know, would you let them burn your supermarket?
[03:46:08.226 --> 03:46:11.907]  You're going to wait for them to come down your actual street before you stop them?
[03:46:11.907 --> 03:46:16.228]  You say, okay, Matt, well, you're, you're talking about vigilantism.
[03:46:16.228 --> 03:46:19.710]  You're talking about, uh, things that'll get you arrested.
[03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:25.972]  Look, nobody will have pity for an arsonist who is shot.
[03:46:26.980 --> 03:46:32.843]  This is where I'm saying there is a piece of low-hanging fruit that you can grab.
[03:46:32.843 --> 03:46:43.387]  Just like the Portland murderer, and everybody here should have seen that analysis already of that hit team following the Jay Danielson in Portland.
[03:46:43.387 --> 03:46:44.128]  It was a hit team.
[03:46:44.128 --> 03:46:48.509]  It was at least a 10-man hit team following him and assassinating him.
[03:46:48.509 --> 03:46:51.751]  When the trigger man was killed, did anybody weep for him?
[03:46:52.748 --> 03:46:55.389]  Did anybody have a protest in his honor?
[03:46:55.389 --> 03:47:00.730]  Maybe some Antifa radicals saying, you know, rest in peace, you good old killer.
[03:47:00.730 --> 03:47:04.371]  But did any Americans have a riot for that guy awake?
[03:47:04.371 --> 03:47:05.311]  No.
[03:47:05.311 --> 03:47:06.852]  Will anybody care?
[03:47:06.852 --> 03:47:10.433]  How about the guy in Portland, the Hotfoot, Mr. Burning Man?
[03:47:10.433 --> 03:47:11.753]  He was made fun of.
[03:47:11.753 --> 03:47:13.513]  Nobody had any sympathies for him.
[03:47:13.513 --> 03:47:16.174]  And he didn't even throw the Molotov cocktail.
[03:47:16.174 --> 03:47:19.535]  He was just out in front of the human shields
[03:47:20.254 --> 03:47:23.676]  He was, his position was cop taunter.
[03:47:23.676 --> 03:47:35.161]  So he was actually ahead of the shield line and the weak lame arm bomb thrower couldn't get to the police to light a cop on fire, which was his goal.
[03:47:35.161 --> 03:47:38.502]  Instead, he had an own goal and lit his own guy on fire.
[03:47:38.502 --> 03:47:39.883]  Did anybody care about him?
[03:47:39.883 --> 03:47:44.365]  Has anybody been, you know, sending him flowers at the hospital?
[03:47:44.365 --> 03:47:45.645]  Hell no.
[03:47:45.645 --> 03:47:49.667]  So once a riot escalates to fire,
[03:47:50.498 --> 03:48:00.584]  As far as I'm concerned, the Molotov cocktail, the incendiary thrower, and anybody around him is a legitimate target.
[03:48:00.584 --> 03:48:07.208]  And if I was just thinking of a good weapon, I would probably say, just like days of old, the riot shotgun.
[03:48:07.208 --> 03:48:18.555]  There's a beautiful thing about a shotgun is, you can use dove shot, which is tiny little pellets, up to turkey shot, which are like BBs, up to buckshot.
[03:48:19.824 --> 03:48:26.657]  And fired at the ground, turkey shot is like a scythe at knee level.
[03:48:26.657 --> 03:48:32.388]  If you want to deter Molotov cocktail throwers, nobody is going to have any pity for them.
