[00:47.640 --> 00:55.000]  every pension fund every stock every bond every system it is a mad collectivist race
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.240]  to the bottom run by kleptocrats who are above it who were exempt exempt from
[01:02.240 --> 01:08.920]  their own regulations and control systems ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.360]  12th day of August 2013 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.640]  investigative journalist Heidi Stevenson is gonna be popping in at the bottom of
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.160]  the next hour talk about that story we got into last week some on Gardasil and
[01:24.160 --> 01:29.320]  attacking women's ovaries and their fertility not not just causing auto
[01:29.320 --> 01:34.760]  immune diseases and killing people and I mean I know Governor Perry said it was
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.400]  the law to take it there was no law it was a giant hoax but now in the
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.720]  aftermath it's been banned in India they're banning it in Japan and scores
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.520]  of other nations but here no here they say now in more and more states it's the
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.520]  law for your boys to take it there is no law but they're an organized giant crime
[01:56.520 --> 02:02.780]  syndicate and Americans love to do what they're told land of the subservient
[02:02.780 --> 02:08.920]  home of the coward more and more and so people don't get mad when they
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.320]  publicly get lied to by criminals when they get lied to they they begged to be
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.120]  enslaved even more at least some of them do and they call those of us that
[02:19.120 --> 02:26.280]  don't want to be slaves scary or extremist or conspiracy theorist or they
[02:26.280 --> 02:31.040]  make jokes about what we say or they they build straw men about what we have
[02:31.040 --> 02:39.120]  to say and and take it out of context so that's the that's the type of issue
[02:39.120 --> 02:46.200]  that we're dealing with here ladies and gentlemen well where to start here today
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.520]  obviously if you go to drudge report calm up on the right hand side the top
[02:51.520 --> 03:00.160]  story there on the right hand column is a story by Paul Joseph Watson it's in
[03:00.160 --> 03:04.640]  the foreign press but he brings it to us here in North America and Europe
[03:04.640 --> 03:10.640]  official embassy attack threat had no basis in fact funny we broke last
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.520]  Thursday that they said there was going to be terror attacks with al Qaeda on
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.600]  specific targets on Friday Saturday and Sunday and of course we then said that
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.720]  this is a real threat memo but the threat itself is fake and then by Friday
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.080]  they had to admit oh actually that that Pentagon memo memo is wrong meant to
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.440]  fear monger to police there isn't a real terror threat and so now it's the same
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.480]  thing with this story up on info wars calm and prison planet calm official
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.160]  embassy attack threat had no basis in fact Paul Watson's going to be joining
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.960]  us he broke that story at the bottom of the hour and it dovetails with Curt
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.360]  Nemo and the story I worked on with Curt Nemo last Thursday night well I tell
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.000]  you the trolls went crazy on this one too claiming that I put out a fake memo
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.520]  saying that there would be a terror attack thinking people are really stupid
[04:07.520 --> 04:12.600]  on info wars in the comments and really stupid on YouTube when when clearly we
[04:12.600 --> 04:17.040]  say that this is a real memo which it was confirmed later the next day to be
[04:17.040 --> 04:23.360]  and on local TV because they talked to the military and the police but they
[04:23.360 --> 04:28.320]  now say the threat wasn't real they put out a false memo but then the fact that
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.520]  we break a big story isn't to our credit it's to our discredit it just shows how
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.800]  bad we are that we're right again we told you all these embassy threats have
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.800]  been on their face fake and had experts on about that and now that's coming out
[04:42.800 --> 04:50.920]  but are we good no no that makes us bad bad man so we're gonna come back and
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.800]  get into some really big news on that front on the amnesty situation on NSA
[04:55.800 --> 05:02.560]  spying and a lot more big broadcast today is hurricane and wildfire season

[08:17.760 --> 08:31.080]  ladies and gentlemen it is the 12th day of August 2013 I am your host Alex Jones
[08:31.080 --> 08:37.240]  and we have Paul Watson joining us with huge breaking news at the bottom of the
[08:37.240 --> 08:43.920]  hour this news is online at info wars dot-com president planet dot-com we
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.200]  sent it on the Twitter at real Alex Jones and the other info or Twitters and
[08:48.200 --> 08:54.200]  it is the top story in the right hand column of drudge report dot-com right
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.560]  under the headline that record number of Americans flee the United States yeah
[09:00.560 --> 09:06.360]  people fled Nazi Germany as well they were smart then you ask why am I staying
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.680]  here I think we can beat this folks but official embassy attack threat had no
[09:11.680 --> 09:17.400]  basis in fact terror plot manufactured to dampen opposition to drone strikes
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.680]  yeah even the New York Times said that a lot of analysts were telling them that
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.040]  by the way Watson should probably add that to his article he did a great job
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.800]  doing this story it's just that we should probably add even more backup a
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.840]  high-ranking Yemeni security official has told McClatchy man McClatchy's just so
[09:34.840 --> 09:40.960]  good that the Obama administration recently announced a terror threat which
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.400]  supposedly targeted US embassies had no basis in fact and was manufactured
[09:46.400 --> 09:51.880]  merely to dampen opposition to drone strikes I want to say this I see more
[09:51.880 --> 09:58.000]  breaking news that turns out to be hardcore and accurate in McClatchy
[09:58.000 --> 10:05.160]  then I see in all other mainstream corporate media probably combined in
[10:05.160 --> 10:10.280]  McClatchy like a private trust or something for journalism and I think
[10:10.280 --> 10:13.920]  it owns some big newspapers as well look that up I see if my memory serves the
[10:13.920 --> 10:20.000]  point is is that I mean government drug dealing government kidnapping rings
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.520]  foreign banks stealing tens of trillions IRS spying on Tea Party I mean and
[10:25.520 --> 10:30.720]  it's kind of a liberal group too and at least in the but like real liberals like
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.560]  like liberal and we need more freedom not liberal like I've got red carpets and
[10:36.560 --> 10:43.280]  black so I can enslave everybody where it's all just the surface McClatchy
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.240]  company is the third largest newspaper company in the United States and a
[10:46.240 --> 10:49.320]  leading digital publisher declaring values of quality journalism free
[10:49.320 --> 10:55.000]  expression and community service print it off for me just see if I'm right or
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.080]  I'm going for memory but they may have some of their newspapers or tax exempt I
[10:58.080 --> 11:03.160]  don't remember the point is I didn't mean to segue off it's just that it's so
[11:03.160 --> 11:11.480]  rare to see any journalistic integrity in anything big and I'm telling you it
[11:11.480 --> 11:17.000]  continues to be McClatchy Forbes does a lot of good stuff Drudge of course carries
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.560]  it all drudge report calm that's why it's so important is that these things
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.400]  wouldn't even be seen I guarantee it even if it was in McClatchy if Drudge
[11:25.400 --> 11:28.000]  didn't pick it up no one would know about it unless they happen to be reading
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.240]  their local paper that carries McClatchy I mean this is a big deal but we'll get
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.480]  into the issue of the fake terror alerts and how criminal that is with Paul
[11:41.480 --> 11:51.600]  Watson my issue is thank God there's a few spotlights of truth out there there's a
[11:51.600 --> 11:56.080]  few little few little spotlights of truth out there that in the deepening
[11:56.080 --> 12:05.080]  darkness in the dusk of our age on the edge of our time if this evil is able to
[12:05.080 --> 12:10.840]  take over that there is still lights in the darkness and and again another light
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.040]  in the darkness and fall wars dot com and I've asked Paul to add this to the
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.480]  bottom of the story because it's it's it's it's interconnected the official
[12:20.480 --> 12:27.680]  limousine attack had no basis in fact the fact that last Thursday it comes in
[12:27.680 --> 12:31.840]  from one of our police sources I then talked to my military source and my
[12:31.840 --> 12:37.760]  state police force they go yeah everybody's getting that I said well why
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.200]  didn't you call me you have in the past and one of them said well Alex this we
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.280]  get this bull every day it's just that now we've been told to send this out and
[12:46.280 --> 12:54.120]  it was that Austin 6th Street 8th Street a church it listed the places in Austin
[12:54.120 --> 12:58.880]  and also listed the places in Pasadena California that were going to be hit by
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.400]  well-trained Al Qaeda forces the eighth ninth or two weeks out but they say the
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.120]  eighth and ninth of the prime times those have not passed it's now the 12th and we
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.440]  wrote an article saying it's a real terror alert but the terror itself isn't real
[13:14.440 --> 13:20.880]  an alert's been put out but it itself is fake and the trolls tried to operate on
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.840]  dumb down people and said look Alex has put out a fake terror alert the alert
[13:25.840 --> 13:31.200]  itself isn't real no the alert was real it's fake I mean come on folks you're
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.800]  really you're really not that stupid are you out there trolls I mean I know a lot
[13:35.800 --> 13:38.200]  of you are paid on record and they're what they call sock puppets and
[13:38.200 --> 13:44.360]  megaphones but you can call the phone number on the J3 protection unit of the
[13:44.360 --> 13:55.360]  army out at Camp Swift and it also at Camp Mayberry here in Austin Texas I mean
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.760]  that just shows the info war that's going on against us because the next day it
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.920]  was in national news and local news that okay there was a terror threat but
[14:03.920 --> 14:12.240]  first it was just going to be a drill and then we discover oh no they're telling
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.120]  the cops it's a real terror threat but then I point out that it's fake it's a
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.280]  real terror alert but the alert itself is fake there is no real terror threat
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.800]  it's meant to be a domestic political diversion to test federal control
[14:25.800 --> 14:31.600]  through the federal central nervous system down to the appendages down to
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.200]  the digits down to the federalized local bureaus and then the next day it comes
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.920]  out in KVUE and KXAN and national newspapers as well that okay there was
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.320]  an alert that was saying there was gonna be an al-qaeda attack but but that's not
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.920]  a credible threat now when really all it is is fear mongering along with the
[14:50.920 --> 14:54.680]  fake threats on the 20-something embassies that have been shut down for
[14:54.680 --> 15:00.720]  the last week and a half and now that's come out in mclatchy newspapers and does
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.160]  the mainstream media pick me up on their shoulders and carry me around saying
[15:04.160 --> 15:09.440]  what a great guy no no they don't they have a big
[15:09.440 --> 15:15.160]  Esquire I think it's a hit piece coming out on Friday John Richardson you know
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.520]  he's done a lot hundreds of big profiles of everybody you can imagine and
[15:19.520 --> 15:25.160]  generally does pretty fair profiles and he told me point blank he said no they
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.120]  wanted it to be a lot nastier and I fought with the editors a lot on this
[15:29.120 --> 15:32.440]  this is not records I'm just saying that he's gonna be on the show later in the
[15:32.440 --> 15:36.920]  week about a book he wrote about his dad it was the CIA section chief in southeast
[15:36.920 --> 15:41.680]  Asia when viet den got killed and he and maybe he's on record that his dad you
[15:41.680 --> 15:44.880]  know had viet den taken out but the whole point is kind of the people they
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.440]  have writing stories on me the point is is that I said okay I know this is
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.320]  probably a hit piece you'll say it's not a hit piece but it will be so we'll see
[15:54.320 --> 15:58.720]  what comes out in that piece on Fridays when it's set to hit newsstands the
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.800]  September issue of Esquire but the reason I really think it may be a big
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.480]  hit piece now is he calls me up this morning we called me yesterday and then
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.960]  I got a hold of him this morning and he goes he goes yeah they want me to a fun
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.240]  little piece to just another little fun piece it's gonna be on the internet yeah
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.280]  for the TV stations to pick up and it's a fun piece about some of the things you
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.120]  believe and don't believe you know like I know what this piece is gonna be you
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.360]  believe in Bigfoot you believe in flying saucers do you believe in the
[16:29.360 --> 16:33.080]  USS Liberty was staged you know stuff like that to just make it sound all
[16:33.080 --> 16:36.600]  whacked out and I said okay I'll call you it too when I get off the air he's
[16:36.600 --> 16:40.400]  probably listening right now but I'm not worried about whatever this piece comes
[16:40.400 --> 16:46.120]  out with and digging around in my past and everything because I have nothing
[16:46.120 --> 16:51.640]  I'm really ashamed of and and no dirt out there on me that's real and people
[16:51.640 --> 16:55.040]  could find a speck of dirt and try to magnify it till it looks like the rock
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.160]  you know the rock of the rock of Gibraltar or something but or Plymouth
[17:00.160 --> 17:06.480]  rock but this is what I expect as we have more and more of an effect is I
[17:06.480 --> 17:13.320]  expect to get more and more of this heat more and more of these attacks so I'm
[17:13.320 --> 17:19.080]  just glad that they're politically assassinating me and intellectually
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.120]  trying to assassinate me that's better than getting a you know a bullet in my
[17:23.120 --> 17:29.840]  head or a SWAT team at my house you know planting mushrooms on me like they did
[17:29.840 --> 17:36.240]  Adam Kokesh so but I mean the fact that they would use this big profile
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.240]  writer I mean he's like one of the biggest profile writers there's like
[17:40.240 --> 17:43.640]  he's in the top three you can debate whether he's number one number two or
[17:43.640 --> 17:48.000]  number three of of profile writers when I looked if they wanted to interview me
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.280]  six months ago when he first contacted me and it's just everybody I mean you
[17:52.280 --> 17:58.880]  name it presidents top directors Charlton Eston rock stars the whole nine
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.640]  yards 20 plus years of it and I said okay you don't usually do hit pieces
[18:03.640 --> 18:08.360]  because you want access to everybody but I said they're not gonna let you
[18:08.360 --> 18:15.360]  publish this if it's not a hit piece so I just did it as an experiment because I
[18:15.360 --> 18:19.880]  turned down most these interviews but I I did it and so we'll see what comes out
[18:19.880 --> 18:27.120]  of it it's actually kind of exciting a hit piece is more enjoyable than a
[18:27.120 --> 18:30.000]  positive piece I mean people keep coming up on the street when I saw it on a
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  Discovery Channel so I I saw it on a History Channel show and like did you
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.680]  did you like that show and I'm like I haven't watched them I have not watched
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.320]  myself because a couple years ago I guess even about a year ago I decided to
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.400]  do three or four of these interviews and I've said no since then just because
[18:47.400 --> 18:55.600]  I've been too busy and I haven't even gone and watched now the stuff that has
[18:55.600 --> 19:01.200]  come out and I guess it's useful to some degree because then it makes AM and FM
[19:01.200 --> 19:06.320]  stations pick up the show more if if you're in the news and you're on TV shows
[19:06.320 --> 19:10.520]  and you're on different programs about the Masons or about Bohemian Grove or
[19:10.520 --> 19:15.880]  about about the New World Order or about GMO or about human Z's or about
[19:15.880 --> 19:21.080]  off-world colonies they're trying to set up with Google or you know shows
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.600]  about fluoride in the water I mean whatever the case is I mean I guess in
[19:26.600 --> 19:30.480]  a way that's positive and I didn't want to digress off into myself it's just that
[19:30.480 --> 19:35.320]  more and more analyzing the media landscape we're way out ahead here and
[19:35.320 --> 19:41.120]  taking heavy fire so be aware of that by the way Sergeant Staff Sergeant Joe

[24:33.040 --> 24:38.600]  all of our major liberties and freedoms in this country. Paul Wansons coming up
[24:38.600 --> 24:48.240]  and we'll get into the latest on the NSA news that's coming out and the fact of
[24:48.240 --> 24:51.840]  the government has issued domestic and foreign terror alerts on record now it's
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.680]  coming out as a pretext to say see we need to take your rights to keep you
[24:57.680 --> 25:04.520]  safe because remember their propaganda is targeted at about a nine-year-old grade
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.760]  level and the average adult I talked to does behave and talk and act like a
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.720]  small child I know you noticed that as well it's it's horrifying but the
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.400]  parasites the globalist love the fact that the general public is as dumb as a
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.960]  box of rocks I mean a rat has more instincts and common sense than general
[25:25.960 --> 25:32.840]  public raised on television raised on GMO raised on archetypes to psychologically
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.880]  basically give them psychological viruses like a computer so they
[25:36.880 --> 25:43.080]  malfunction and fall apart and so the globalists swim in this sea of ignorance
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.640]  we got to drain the swamp ladies and gentlemen but but here's how my brain
[25:47.640 --> 25:54.600]  works okay in the short segment here's an article out of CBS news suspicious
[25:54.600 --> 26:00.240]  substance at JFK turns out to be beauty supplies every day a bag gets left on
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.960]  the ground or people drop a box on the side of the rows they call it the bomb
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.760]  squad statistically honeybees killed double what terrorists do every year in
[26:08.760 --> 26:14.200]  this country but they don't care the wicked flea when none pursue and there
[26:14.200 --> 26:21.680]  it is right there and they had they opened a package and had a psychosomatic
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.200]  response just because there was a smell to the beauty products and fell down on
[26:27.200 --> 26:30.760]  the ground and had to be taken to the hospital they thought it was a nerve gas
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.440]  haha no no see when our troops really breathe nerve gas because our own
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.640]  government orders had all blown up in 1991 and hundreds of thousands get
[26:39.640 --> 26:45.800]  exposed and the and the the detectors go off then they tell them there's not a
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.080]  problem but then when you fall down because you smell beauty products well
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.000]  then they go along with the hysteria I've seen this many times in Austin Texas
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.200]  where they had the police go to the hospital and whole area shut down because
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.200]  they think they're being nerve-gassed they go around just all paranoid that
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.840]  they're being nerve-gassed by al-qaeda all day your bosses run al-qaeda dummies
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.440]  okay okay there's no real terror threat get that through your brain I want you
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.480]  to get the terror threat is the New World Order now that's how my brain works I
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.120]  see this BS article and I get upset now let's move along let's talk about the
[27:18.120 --> 27:26.960]  real threat this is out of the Herald the Herald Business Journal scientist FDA
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.040]  don't worry about radioactive fish does it matter that they knew three months
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.280]  after Fukushima now two years ago that they had massive hundreds of times safe
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.000]  radiation levels bio-accumulating in a large tuna they have fed that to the
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.560]  American people and covered it up now this broke about a year ago but now it's
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.280]  back on the news are saying look don't worry radiation is not bad for you pre
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.280]  1990 they said radiation was deadly in DU now they say it's not see now they
[27:53.280 --> 27:58.840]  just wave a magic trendy wand and I have another article here nuclear regulatory
[27:58.840 --> 28:03.560]  Commission is using obviously faulty models to pretend crumbling nuclear
[28:03.560 --> 28:08.680]  reactors are safe yeah why even update them 91% of the 400 plus reactors are
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.960]  all leaking most of them in Europe in the United States in Japan and their
[28:13.960 --> 28:19.640]  answer is don't worry about it see the elite themselves have become delusional
[28:19.640 --> 28:23.760]  folks let's move on to the next story this is how I think you know I think of
[28:23.760 --> 28:29.080]  one story connects to the next toxic water levels rise and sight near Fukushima
[28:29.080 --> 28:34.960]  reactor number one the news of India's reporting and the government there says
[28:34.960 --> 28:39.240]  that it is a melting down even worse than ever and coming right towards the
[28:39.240 --> 28:43.040]  United States and then here's another one that dovetails with us World Health
[28:43.040 --> 28:47.280]  Organization knowingly pushed deadly vaccines in India that killed thousands
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.960]  of children and that's a natural news.com story up on info wars.com and
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.280]  that's just some of the news I have on those topics and okay and here's the
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.080]  issue do they tell you you should be taking nascent iodine that's in high
[29:01.080 --> 29:07.000]  quality stuff like Modifylon southern hemisphere seaweed do they tell you that
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.680]  if you don't the different radioactive isotopes and fluoride will fill your
[29:10.680 --> 29:16.640]  thyroid instead do they tell you any of that no they don't tell you any of that
[29:16.640 --> 29:20.680]  because they don't want you to know the establishments all taking stuff like
[29:20.680 --> 29:26.520]  this by the way win-win get Modifylon pure brown seaweed extract at the best

[33:33.480 --> 33:37.720]  which side I'm on and I think it's time for everybody out there who hasn't
[33:37.720 --> 33:44.360]  committed to a side to choose a side we are back live we're gonna go to Paul
[33:44.360 --> 33:47.240]  Watson here in a moment I want to mention some of the other news we're gonna
[33:47.240 --> 33:50.880]  get to after he leaves us here today because it's all incredibly important
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.560]  I've got to get to it but you see that's how we fund ourselves we I don't come
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.880]  on air and you know push an establishment agenda and then get
[33:59.880 --> 34:04.520]  establishment advertisers or I don't get banker bailout money or stimulus money
[34:04.520 --> 34:12.720]  like MSNBC and CNN I am funded by the viewers and listeners of this radio
[34:12.720 --> 34:18.240]  transmission and the viewers of info wars nightly news you out there you're
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.240]  not standing behind us you're standing beside us and in front of us and I
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.440]  couldn't do it without you but when I read about how they get us obsessed
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.760]  about imaginary bag at the airport or somebody they don't swipe somebody's
[34:32.760 --> 34:39.360]  travel pass boarding pass properly and so they shut down the whole terminal and
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.320]  and run around drama cleaning meanwhile we've got reactors 91% of them look that
[34:45.320 --> 34:51.280]  up leaking worldwide and they just say oh that's safe now oh it's safe for the
[34:51.280 --> 34:58.360]  troops to use DU it's safe I saw an army veteran at a restaurant a walk-in
[34:58.360 --> 35:05.240]  barbecue place this weekend and I could look at him look like he was about 50 I
[35:05.240 --> 35:09.220]  could tell he had some type of neurological disorder he was in a wheel
[35:09.220 --> 35:13.960]  chair and he was there with his wife and he barely had enough money to get
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.880]  barbecue so he was getting like him and his wife are getting like a half order
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.360]  of barbecue and I wanted to go over and buy the guy this barbecue I was in line
[35:21.360 --> 35:27.120]  waiting but then I'm sick of always being a grandstander and and and like
[35:27.120 --> 35:31.200]  Mr. Goodie two shoes so I didn't do it but then later I went over and talked to
[35:31.200 --> 35:35.920]  him and I said let me guess were you in the Gulf War one he goes yeah I was in
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.360]  Kuwait how do you know that I know you're wearing an army shirt look like
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.960]  you're about 50 and I said remember when the when the detectors went off and he
[35:45.960 --> 35:50.040]  goes I'm not gonna imitate the guy because it was come off mean but he was
[35:50.040 --> 35:54.480]  like well I mean I will it's describing what the medial spin I'm making fun of
[35:54.480 --> 35:57.760]  somebody I'm not I'm showing how he talked he's like that's what I think
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.680]  happened to me and of course a lot of those guys are already dead and I
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.640]  physically had to go out and cry in the car as I drove home bringing barbecue
[36:06.640 --> 36:10.000]  to my to my kids
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.960]  I mean they knew the nerve gas was being released when they blew up Kamasee and
[36:16.960 --> 36:20.120]  other bunkers because they wanted to just get rid of the evidence that our
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.720]  government sold Saddam all that stuff so they just told the troops never mind
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.000]  it's a false alarm so they wouldn't create a news story that they got nerve
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.560]  gassed they made the conscious decision ran corporation style to play out all
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.160]  the scenarios to know what would happen to detonate it and so what if it blew
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.760]  into our troops and so what if it killed a bunch of them within months and
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.620]  debilitated many others tens of thousands have died from it congressional
[36:45.620 --> 36:50.240]  hearings but this is not my opinion and I'm looking at a guy who's got a
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.840]  neurological disorder clearly from the nerve gas who was there and doesn't even
[36:55.840 --> 37:04.160]  have enough money to buy barbecue I hate watching the country become poor I
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.480]  hate it I just I just can't even hardly go out anymore I just everywhere I see
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.960]  the victims of the New World Order the autistic kids the kids with cancer the
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.800]  the neurological disorders off the charts and I just get angrier and
[37:17.800 --> 37:24.640]  angrier and angrier and angrier and angrier and angrier to the point of I
[37:24.640 --> 37:27.320]  can hardly even come in here and do this show I mean I'm gonna be honest with
[37:27.320 --> 37:32.560]  you because I want to do the best job I can I want to be focused I want to be
[37:32.560 --> 37:41.040]  strong but just the information I have to look at is torturing because I know
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.000]  how evil the globalist are I know I'm right and I have to sit here and watch
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.040]  everybody go about their business or even worse people come up to me and make
[37:49.040 --> 37:55.160]  fun of me sometimes in public and make jokes I was walking in to Barton
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.840]  Springs last week there were two guys out there playing frisbee one goes oh
[38:00.840 --> 38:05.360]  it's mr. black helicopter and I didn't turn around angry at first around I went
[38:05.360 --> 38:10.400]  what there aren't black helicopters I'm just joking Alex you know what you say
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.160]  is pretty funny we think it's funny that somebody come up to me yesterday and say
[38:14.160 --> 38:19.160]  that and I when I sure wish it was funny and the guys come over and we're like
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.840]  kind of like peer-pressuring like they were laughing at me and I wasn't upset
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.440]  because they were making fun of me I was upset because of what big giant piles
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.160]  of steam and crap they were excuse me I'm not trying to talk like that folks I
[38:31.160 --> 38:37.520]  just get angry I have trouble all right I'm a family show I apologize because
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.880]  let me tell you something this stuff isn't a joke okay and I wish every day
[38:41.880 --> 38:48.000]  it was a joke I told them I said I'm glad you think it's funny because this
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.440]  stuff isn't funny they're like no as soon as they couldn't make me feel bad
[38:51.440 --> 38:54.560]  this is how these childlike minds work they went no actually we know a lot of
[38:54.560 --> 39:01.240]  stuff's going on I mean have a good swim they're on the other back parking lot
[39:01.240 --> 39:05.400]  area there's a big football field slash soccer field I mean it is and I had some
[39:05.400 --> 39:08.920]  guy about a month before at the very same spot make a comment to me it's like
[39:08.920 --> 39:13.120]  oh there goes Alex Jones let me make a comment about and again and again I
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.400]  always turn around to see if it's just a fun joke because if it's a joke I'll
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.520]  laugh and go yeah yeah black helicopters but no it's not like that it's to make
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.560]  fun of me when all I'm trying to do is have a future for my family you may not
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.080]  notice in your own little narcissistic world people in wheelchairs from
[39:32.080 --> 39:37.880]  nerve gas I do and I see the casualties all around me and I don't think it's
[39:37.880 --> 39:46.800]  funny I see giant unconstitutional power being amassed against me and it gets you
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.600]  and I see the evil growing and I'm threatened by it and I'm doing everything
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.160]  I can try to turn this around and I need your help I don't need you to be in
[39:55.160 --> 40:01.200]  denial anymore now side issue I mentioned that the northern hemisphere before
[40:01.200 --> 40:04.360]  Fukushima had roughly we've had nuclear physicists on and given the numbers on
[40:04.360 --> 40:08.440]  this double the background radiation of the southern hemisphere there's all the
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.440]  nuclear testing in the northern hemisphere there's been some in the
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.360]  southern mainly the French in the US and the Bikini Islands and other areas
[40:18.920 --> 40:26.560]  hydrogen bombs you name it and I actually discussed with my wife leaving and
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.160]  and I made the decision I said well Texas had me and hit as bad as the west
[40:31.160 --> 40:34.720]  coast and most of the plume goes across the Midwest that makes it past that but
[40:34.720 --> 40:40.240]  I said we're just making kind of the sick immoral decision like humans are
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.640]  designed to do to muddle through this we're gonna stay here chances are our
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.640]  kids won't get a hot particle that's what really gets you the background
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.560]  radiation is bad but nothing compared to if you actually get a particle that gets
[40:51.560 --> 40:57.360]  up in the higher atmosphere on a piece of generally it gets picked up by
[40:57.360 --> 41:01.920]  things like spider's web and things like that and you get that in your lung
[41:01.920 --> 41:05.760]  you know you die when you're 20 of a giant tumor no one ever tells you why
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.480]  they don't know why and I think it had countless nuclear physicists engineers
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.200]  atomic hydrogen weapon designers you name it on the show to break down the
[41:15.200 --> 41:22.480]  threats of the mocks reactor and the rest of it and we made the immoral
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.640]  decision just I guess out of convenience or whatever I not even that I got to
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.040]  stay here and run this operation and I don't think I would operate very well
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.240]  with my kids in the southern hemisphere but I mean I we've looked at the southern
[41:34.240 --> 41:40.080]  hemisphere this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen they said oh you're tough don't
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.040]  worry about the nerve gas these people are dead or in wheelchairs now and you
[41:45.040 --> 41:48.360]  think your wife changing your diapers every day is fun and don't listen to me
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.600]  so so that's why I take this stuff real personal ladies and gentlemen I
[41:52.600 --> 41:57.320]  realized how serious all this is and the government should be telling people get

[43:14.200 --> 43:17.480]  medical from doctors we've interviewed I was even talking to a doctor medical
[43:17.480 --> 43:20.640]  doctor this morning about this looking at moving to the southern hemisphere at
[43:20.640 --> 43:23.960]  least of act away my family this isn't a joke Fukushima's melt them down even
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.680]  more and I hate to have to come on air and talk about stuff like this but it is
[43:29.680 --> 43:35.480]  what it is ladies and gentlemen let me just stop right there all right I want
[43:35.480 --> 43:40.040]  to bring Paul Watson up on air with breaking news it's official embassy
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.720]  attack threat had no basis in fact terror plot manufacturer to dampen
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.840]  opposition to drone strikes now I know I told you this over and over again the
[43:48.840 --> 43:52.040]  last two weeks and even the New York Times had to admit well we've talked to
[43:52.040 --> 43:55.760]  senior analysts that say this is for political purposes but this is
[43:55.760 --> 44:00.400]  specifically high-ranking Yemeni security official saying the West told
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.000]  them it was not real and was for political purposes and that's even in
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.160]  a clatchy and then of course we had them saying there'll be a terror attack in
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.240]  Austin in the next you know starting last week to the next two weeks we broke
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.800]  that they confirm the document was real but what we said beforehand or not to be
[44:16.800 --> 44:22.120]  true but it was a fake terror alert a real alert they put out but it but the
[44:22.120 --> 44:25.640]  alert itself was fake again we broke it told you exactly what it was I'm not
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.360]  bragging so what do we get we get attacked just remember folks when we're
[44:30.360 --> 44:33.760]  going up the hill here against the enemy and placements we need your support
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.200]  this is not a game I've got their entire playbook it isn't hard to know they
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.160]  think you're so stupid they bragged about it publicly but we're the ones
[44:41.160 --> 44:47.760]  willing to say it out in the open all right so and we need you to spread this
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.360]  information out to everybody I salute McClatchy breaking this I salute Watson
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.400]  giving a wide spectrum analysis of it info wars.com and I salute drudgerport.com
[44:56.400 --> 44:59.920]  for carrying the story as well as I'll now be a national news story let's go to
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.320]  Paul Joseph Watson for the next two segments to break this down Paul we
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.640]  there's a long history of this but it's becoming so naked people aren't buying
[45:08.640 --> 45:15.680]  into it anymore. Well exactly Alex I mean under the Bosch administration Tom
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.240]  Ridge basically came out and admitted that most of the major terror alerts
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.480]  were faked for political purposes of course 10 days ago we had the
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.160]  announcement that they were closing 20 embassies and consulates in the Middle
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.280]  East and North Africa because of quote the most serious threat against
[45:32.280 --> 45:37.720]  American and other Western interests since 9-11 then people like Lindsay Gray
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.800]  and went on the Sunday shows and said quote the NSA program is proving it's
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.400]  worth yet again along with the representative Roppersberger who said
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.160]  the good news is that we picked up the intelligence and that's what we do
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.160]  that's what the NSA does because of course they use this embassy closure
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.160]  threat this supposed attack that was primarily centered on Yemen as a reason
[46:01.160 --> 46:05.040]  to justify the NSA snooping because they've been losing the debate on that
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.560]  for weeks so they immediately came out and said this is the threat Al Qaeda is
[46:10.560 --> 46:14.280]  going to attack even though we're actually arming Al Qaeda in Syria which
[46:14.280 --> 46:19.920]  came out of course out of the Benghazi attack but this justifies the NSA what
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.600]  it has to do because we've intercepted this conference call between the top
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.360]  Al Qaeda members and it said they were going to attack so the NSA is good it's
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.800]  saving your lives well of course at the time we said this was completely fake
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.720]  based on history based on motive came out today as he said in McClatchy a top
[46:38.720 --> 46:46.120]  Yemeni security official said that the whole plot had no basis in fact and he
[46:46.120 --> 46:51.600]  was completely bemused he attributed it to a single official a Yemeni officials
[46:51.600 --> 46:57.200]  comments about imminent terror strikes basically he said the agenda and it was
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.680]  one of the three that I've identified is quote misguided attempt at shifting
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.080]  public opinion in the face of increasing an unpopular American drone
[47:06.080 --> 47:12.040]  strikes because if you recall this terror alert threat coincided with the US
[47:12.040 --> 47:18.240]  bombing Yemen eight drone strikes over the past two weeks dozens of people
[47:18.240 --> 47:24.080]  killed which also coincides with this group which was actually set up with
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.320]  the aid of the US government when Yemen had its faux Arab spring who met on
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.360]  August 2nd or the day before which was the day before this terror alert was
[47:33.360 --> 47:37.480]  announced and they decided and this is the National Dialogue Conference group
[47:37.480 --> 47:43.000]  in Yemen which is a civil society organization that's building up a lot
[47:43.000 --> 47:49.120]  of power they voted to decode to criminalize drone strikes in Yemen so
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.320]  then we had the sudden invention of this major threat primarily targeting
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.960]  Yemen and then of course we had the drone strikes so we had the drone strikes
[47:57.960 --> 48:01.480]  that they needed to justify the NSA surveillance program they needed to
[48:01.480 --> 48:07.720]  justify and of course this also coincided on the same day August 2nd with
[48:07.720 --> 48:13.200]  CNN's announcement of course we'd reported it months before that a CIA team
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.400]  was smuggling arms out of Benghazi in an annex to the consulate that was
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.440]  attacked last September to send them to rebels and al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.880]  that came out August 2nd it was immediately followed with this now
[48:27.880 --> 48:32.720]  apparently fake terror alert and this Benghazi scandal about smuggling the
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.720]  weapons to al-Qaeda nobody's heard anything about it it's been completely
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.840]  buried so on three different scores very convenient that they had this terror
[48:40.840 --> 48:46.440]  alert it served to justify it served to distract from all these different issues
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.960]  excellent breakdown Watson I want to shift gears into the NSA here briefly
[48:51.960 --> 48:59.600]  and play some of the disgusting clips of Obama making the rounds on the campaign
[48:59.600 --> 49:05.600]  trail for his agenda still campaigning making a light and jokes of the greatest
[49:05.600 --> 49:09.680]  surveillance grid the world's ever seen that is completely illegal on record
[49:09.680 --> 49:16.240]  here he is comparing it to washing the dishes the question is how do I make the
[49:16.240 --> 49:27.720]  American people more comfortable right if I tell Michelle that he's gonna use
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.920]  astro glide granted in the White House I don't do the dishes that much but back
[49:32.920 --> 49:40.360]  in the day and and she's a little skeptical well I'd like her to trust me
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.760]  but maybe I need to bring her back and show her the dishes and not just have
[49:45.760 --> 49:53.320]  her take my word for it and so so he he likens raping our liberties to washing
[49:53.320 --> 49:57.360]  the dishes he wants to make you comfortable so I guess he wants to put
[49:57.360 --> 50:01.720]  us to sleep before he drinks our blood like Count Dracula let's go to one more
[50:01.720 --> 50:06.640]  of the clips as we got a break this is Obama he'd say he'd be worried about it
[50:06.640 --> 50:11.240]  if if he wasn't in the government so trust me famous last words here it is
[50:11.240 --> 50:17.840]  having said that though if you are outside of the intelligence community if
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.360]  you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying
[50:22.360 --> 50:30.040]  US big brother looking down on you collecting telephone records etc well
[50:30.040 --> 50:38.120]  understandably people would be concerned I would be too if I wasn't inside the
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.440]  government and again that was from the White House press room he's also been
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.200]  on the trail making similar statements we have more clips of that but I mean
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.600]  this is famous last words you know just trust me yeah you've lied to us on every
[50:52.600 --> 50:58.960]  front and stabbed us in the back so so so let's believe you now we'll be back
[50:58.960 --> 51:03.280]  with Watson's take there's a false sense of security that the greatest economic
[51:03.280 --> 51:07.240]  crash since the Great Depression is over but unemployment is still at a 20 year
[51:07.240 --> 51:11.360]  high and until Americans are working again the economy has not recovered what

[54:57.200 --> 55:03.040]  the internet into a total surveillance system I saw that headline on Drudge
[55:03.040 --> 55:08.520]  Saturday and I went and search engine that with info wars com at the end of
[55:08.520 --> 55:13.880]  it and found hundreds of links with similar headlines in the last 15 years
[55:13.880 --> 55:18.920]  with us saying exactly that not not again tooting my horn but we didn't just
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.200]  say the whole internet's designed by DARPA to be a total control grid to
[55:23.200 --> 55:27.960]  create the mind of God to predict the future because I have media call me and
[55:27.960 --> 55:31.400]  go you think they want to be God you say they want to predict the future you
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.560]  know I don't say that they say that I'm just all the stuff that they were saying
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.440]  in white papers is now public that's the point I don't know if that's all gonna
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.560]  happen I don't know if they're gonna get a lesium level life extension but
[55:45.560 --> 55:51.520]  that's the goal they're shooting for they've got one of the heads of Google
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.640]  and others openly saying they're gonna build space colonies for the elite
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.240]  people ask well how will the atmosphere work that that that spacecraft in
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.720]  a lesium is a 1940s 50s design of a spinning space station that would hold
[56:05.720 --> 56:13.400]  the atmosphere in if it was big enough for a ring world type plan the problem
[56:13.400 --> 56:17.920]  is it have to be contained unless it was ultra massive the spinning would give
[56:17.920 --> 56:21.880]  you gravity not hold the atmosphere in it would have to be I don't know some
[56:21.880 --> 56:25.640]  estimates are like a thousand miles around and spinning fast enough to hold
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.800]  the atmosphere in but this side issue the point is the this is the type of
[56:29.800 --> 56:33.120]  stuff they're developing this isn't science fiction we're living in the
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.760]  21st century Buck Rogers baby briefly American drug war to cannabis destiny we
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.720]  are the exclusive distributor of this exposing how deadly the real drug war
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.920]  is and how the CPS is drugging kids it gets into pharmaceuticals all of it

[56:52.880 --> 56:57.280]  Watson Watson know three four minutes we've got left comments on the outrageous
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.600]  statements of Obama coming out said and see you know we're spying on you it's
[57:01.600 --> 57:05.720]  like washing dishes and you know I'd be concerned too but I'm in there I know
[57:05.720 --> 57:11.240]  it's for your own good I mean man this is bone chilling when you know he's
[57:11.240 --> 57:17.120]  doing everything you can to shut this country down. Well I mean a primary portion
[57:17.120 --> 57:21.560]  of that program is the insider threat program which is all about preventing
[57:21.560 --> 57:27.280]  insiders whistleblowers from revealing government malfeasance so it's not just
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.720]  about spying on the American people it's about spying on those that would reveal
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.840]  wrongdoing on behalf of the US government but now the new dimension to it
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.220]  which has been developing over the past few days is the former NSA chief Michael
[57:41.220 --> 57:47.000]  Hayden's comments a few days ago he basically came out and said the people
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.480]  who oppose NSA mass surveillance people who support Edward Snowden are either
[57:52.480 --> 57:58.560]  cyber terrorists or Al Qaeda sympathizers he said that if they can't create
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.200]  great harm to dot mill who are they going to go after who for them are the
[58:03.200 --> 58:08.120]  World Trade Centers the World Trade Centers as they were for Al Qaeda so he's
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.240]  basically saying those who oppose NSA mass surveillance those who support
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.000]  Edward Snowden are akin to Al Qaeda and they're gonna carry out attacks like
[58:17.000 --> 58:23.000]  Al Qaeda and then he's on CVS faced the nation yesterday saying not if but when
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.120]  the next terror attack happens that's when it's the NSA is gonna be justified
[58:28.120 --> 58:31.880]  that's when they're gonna aggressively put into stay there do five more minutes
[58:31.880 --> 58:34.760]  with us stay there I want you to finish up that thought because two plus two
[58:34.760 --> 58:40.400]  equals four they get more terror they get more power who's behind the terror

[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.160]  our top story so far today up on info wars dot com official embassy attack
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:44.960]  threat had no basis in fact McClatchy newspaper is reporting that as well in
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.120]  fact they broke it and then drugs picked up our story that carries it with the
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.880]  further analysis but going back to Paul Watson you were getting into Hayden we
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:01:00.800]  have that clip actually that we should queue that up Michael Hayden says that
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.720]  if there's any more events they will expand more power they've already got
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.840]  the total grid in place they've already got the total grid in place and then
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.960]  now they're just going to roll it out to you each event saying see it's for your
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.520]  own good and oh we stopped this attack oh we stopped that attack and they've been
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.360]  caught staging events or spitting out fake terror alerts this is elementary we
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.160]  take your rights when bad things happen so bad things are going to happen G who
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.600]  do you think's behind it who has the motive who has the history who's done
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  it before who has the capacity to do it I mean this isn't even two plus two
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.440]  equals four and it's just so outrageous and then we sent Lee and Mac adieu out
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.120]  one of our info wars nightly news reporters twice in Austin and the
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.520]  majority of people said I want to be spot on I want to be watched now it's
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  always in trendy areas you go to working-class areas or even wealthy areas
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.160]  people are smart but if it's trendies it's over folks they believe because it's
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:07.000]  Obama they say it just like Obama said hey trust me it's me unbelievable and he
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.880]  has such a history of lying plus he's a puppet I mean Watson this is amazing
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.800]  what do these people think I think like you said they're rolling it out in the
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.320]  open to justify it remember they've had it since the early 90s they've had
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:26.200]  echelon you were talking about it back in the 90s there's a BBC article from
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.600]  1999 which says every international telephone call fax email or radio
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.120]  transmission can be listened to by powerful computers capable of voice
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.200]  recognition they home in on a long list of keywords or patterns of messages and
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:45.840]  that was echelon spy network revealed November 1999 so it's everything that
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.680]  they say they've got now it was revealed you know 14 15 years ago and the only
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.480]  reason Snowden's in trouble is because he has moral authority because he's in
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.400]  the government according to the sheeple he's in trouble for saying it's bad not
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.120]  for breaking any secrets exactly and now Hayden as I said before the break is I
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.280]  mean this this was his quote from this bipartisan policy center speech he said
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.120]  that Snowden's followers were nihilists anarchists activists lulsec
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.000]  anonymous 20-somethings who haven't talked to the opposite sex in five or six
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.320]  years so polls show that about half of Americans actually opposed this NSA
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.760]  surveillance yet Hayden is characterizing them all as basement
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.160]  dwelling losers who are just messing around on the internet so he denigrates
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.760]  them in that sense but then he goes on to equate them to terrorists in another
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.480]  sense so now we've got the whole process about anyone who opposes NSA
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.480]  surveillance is with al-qaeda even as they send the weapons to al-qaeda in
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:56.200]  Syria and now Hayden as he said he's all over CBS saying there's gonna be an
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.800]  attack and when it happens all you complained about the NSA are gonna be
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.880]  shot up because we're gonna watch and watch and let's be honest you neither
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.080]  you nor I we don't have wives or girlfriends come on I mean we're
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.520]  basement dwellers well yeah I mean Jimmy caught a Glenn Greenwald Daniel Ellsberg
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.360]  they're all just you know 16 year old basement dwelling kids on the internet I
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.600]  guess all right great job Watson we'll get more from you as it unfolds and
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.280]  breaks and infowars.com we're gonna go out to break here with Hayden this is
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.000]  the former head of the NSA making some of his sniveling degenerate comments I
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.200]  think he's the one that can't pick up any women let's go to that clip it may be
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.640]  useful for transparency. You think women would touch that guy? For confidence but
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.480]  but let me tell you all right looking through your windscreen when you lay
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.800]  this on it just looks like more thorough oversight okay when you're looking in
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:55.240]  your rearview mirror after the next successful attack this runs the danger of
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:02.640]  looking like bureaucratic layering if I saw him I'd run. With over 3,000 years of

[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.800]  moved through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of

[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.960]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.680]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead

[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.040]  want to get into some of the news I haven't gotten to yet that's extremely
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.520]  important and we've got investigative journalist Heidi Stephenson on the
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.880]  dreaded Gardasil vaccine being banned in different countries all over the world
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.560]  right now and well guess what it reduces your fertility in a new study.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:28.000]  Oh man who would have thought that. Come on what do you think they're doing that's
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.720]  how dumb they think you are or not in Kansas anymore and the only thing this
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.560]  criminal conspiracy against humanity needs to succeed is for people to be
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:43.160]  naive so that's coming up and we're gonna have open phones open phones I'm
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.280]  serious I think you guys ought to mount like a taser gun I mean not a full
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.040]  power but like a hot shot cattle prod in the seat in here be the first radio
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.560]  show to ever do it or when I take calls I don't get to at least 20 in an hour I
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.440]  get shocked that'd be a good gimmick I could be waterboarded we could come in
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.160]  with a waterboard because it's not torture and then you guys could
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.640]  waterboard me I want to do that it's a nice gimmick as well we got it we can
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.760]  pull more stunts out there again ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.120]  on this Monday Worldwide live transmission let's let's first get into
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:27.280]  Elysium and how it segues into sudden flood of asylum seekers request at the
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:34.120]  US Mexico border according to KSAZ Fox Phoenix and Breitbart this is up on
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:42.680]  drudgereport.com now before I go there I got home from the funeral about 7
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.360]  o'clock my great-uncle died went to his military funeral in East Texas got on
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.240]  about seven o'clock last night was dropping my parents off and they said
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.240]  oh go ahead and come on in and they leave Turner classic movies on for their
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:01.200]  French Bulldog it likes television so we go in there and the grapes of wrath is
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.920]  on when I walk in to their foyer and the dog is sitting there watching
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.760]  television I'm not joking but you know a lot of you probably have pets that watch
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.880]  television as well French Bulldogs do it particularly we had TV on a few days
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:23.000]  ago my French Bulldog was watching it and to make a long story short it's a
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.720]  movie about the depression and it's openly communist it's got an FDR
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.440]  character the workers committee they're gonna take over and it shows
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.640]  okies going out to California it's historically true by the hundreds of
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:44.160]  thousands and overflowing and people getting mad about being overrun some of
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.560]  it was crime as well not a lot of the okies weren't criminals but you had
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.840]  hundreds of thousands people coming in there's gonna be some crime especially
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:57.360]  when folks are desperate so it builds the police and all the locals as
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.320]  exploitive demons who are ripping everybody off but the unions get
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.040]  together and they defeat it and it makes you want to become a communist
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:13.040]  watching it that's why Elysium made me so mad is because I like a lot of the
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.440]  messages in it a lot of it's true it's powerful I want to help people in the
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.520]  third world more than anybody I mean I get upset when I've been in Mexico and
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.880]  watch police mainly shake down the locals and not the gringos and the
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.240]  folks visiting from the north El Norte so I have empathy with everybody
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.200]  ladies and gentlemen but I also get that people tend to always organize in
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.120]  groups that is people that are dumbed down whether they be white Hispanic black
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:44.920]  it doesn't matter that's something that works at an animal level at a mob rule
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.560]  level and even the smartest person 10 days without food will turn into a
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.640]  murderer within 15 days 97% according to Pentagon studies of people turn into
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:04.520]  cannibals 15 days folks 15 days people will put your baby on a spit and they
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:12.320]  will suck the meat right off the bones okay okay so so let's get real here
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.960]  you've got seven and a half billion people worldwide you've got the United
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.920]  States because it had basic liberty and private property rights became the most
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:28.120]  wealthy country in the world and was exploitive as well every other country
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:34.160]  was every other tribe every other group this is the bad part of humanity the
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.240]  West just did it better than everybody else but also had a weird vein of free
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.320]  market in it that's what made the colonialism more powerful than other
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.240]  people's exploitation because it was supercharged with free market and
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.880]  limited rights to limited groups but still the first it was only royalty had
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.000]  power and rights then it was nobility under them then it was sub nobility then
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.140]  it was Magna Carta expanded in to the entire population in England then the
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:07.640]  colonies didn't have power they were treated like slaves they said hey we're
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.560]  gonna get the same rights as an Englishman I don't care if you're Dutch
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.320]  German Italian and then Native American or black it just went down that I mean
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.080]  some of the German city-states didn't free their slaves till the 1880s white
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:28.360]  slaves folks white slaves you'll never see that on the news or in a movie
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.560]  because they want blacks to have an inferiority complex and think of
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:37.680]  everything as racial I mean if you want to get down to brass tax but North
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.560]  Africa one of the richest people in the world history like they say he was the
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.280]  richest was the king of central and northern Africa I forget his name that's
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.120]  Google richest man in the world history was an African you could see you know
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.920]  paintings of the guy in the Byzantine Empire that did paintings of him and
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.940]  mosaics I mean he was the richest guy in history because he ran the global
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:02.440]  slave trade but side issue the point is is that you go see a movie like a
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.200]  lesion and it basically says the white people are the exploitive they're the
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.440]  racist they're gonna get the free health care of the life extension if you just
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.440]  flip a switch you'll all get free health care and you know the borders will come
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.040]  down and we'll all be one big global happy family it's just you flip one
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.840]  switch you can all have something free that is not how this works ladies and
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:30.600]  gentlemen and the communist in the 20s promised that yet meet Monsa Mousa the
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.640]  first of Molly the richest human in all of history there he is let's scroll down
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.240]  to that mosaic of him there he is
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.280]  so looks like looks like
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:55.600]  well Chamberlain the point here is my friends is that real history will give
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.880]  you the reality of what's happening you're not going to get it from one
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.560]  history book you're gonna get it from hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.520]  they're addicting and you should read them and learn about it because then
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.960]  everything will make sense to you not all the fake culture that they spew
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.480]  directly at us and grapes of wrath is the 1930s version of a lesion because
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.240]  let me tell you something the communist Chinese killed between 60 and 80 plus
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.400]  million people in forced labor camps the the Soviets killed probably more than
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.080]  40 million from linen on the Stalin and then on through cruise chef and brash
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.120]  nef and and all of them I mean you want to talk about guys with clubs like
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.840]  greats of greats of wrath making you work and and raping your wife and and
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.920]  torturing you to death and we're lining up and shooting you that's what
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.880]  commies do and I love how they always point and and exaggerate what went on
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.040]  out in California about okies being persecuted when they're just trying to
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.400]  get across the border into California by people knowing they were about to lose
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.280]  their standard of living and it's the same thing when you've got seven plus
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:10.880]  billion people that want to come here and here's the deal you could build
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.920]  incredible technological systems and use robotics or we can all work about two
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.280]  days a week but the globalists are on record admitting they're setting up a
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.600]  system where the robots are going to leverage out even the poorest people in
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:30.240]  China so that it makes us all dependent and all poor for political
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.880]  assimilation into neo technocratic feudalism neo feudalistic serfdom and
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.400]  so they make it about white people is why the third world's doing bad no the
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.280]  third world's doing bad because it never got out from under total corruption
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.760]  and never even had the few degrees of colonialist liberty that America had
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:58.080]  that's the fact and you know can I go to Mexico and have a baby free like they
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.960]  can do here no can I go to Poland have a baby free like a Polish immigrant come
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.160]  here and do get everything free no no no they would laugh at me beat me up and
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.760]  go throw me on an airplane after all my money been sucked out of me in a dirt
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:18.640]  floor jail so the globalists use all of our heart strings as Americans
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.040]  regardless of what color we are so let's just help the people that want to
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.240]  come in let's you but they're not doing they're not going to bring these people
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:32.080]  in to raise our standards and then raise theirs the big sick lie of globalism is
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.000]  that it's going to do that it's designed to implode everything to a post
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.280]  industrial society with only high-tech industrial reservations under globalist
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.400]  corporate control operating their exempt from all the taxes and regulations
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.960]  they put on us without the city gates without the fortress gates so they're
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:20:01.440]  trying to create a lesion by imploding the few middle-class habitats it's

[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.560]  dot com or present planet dot tv all right the point I'm getting at is this
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.680]  the globalist are mega bankers who control most of the world by creating
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.880]  fiat currency that they control that governments have to borrow from them and
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.040]  they get governments that they've paid off to sign these one-sided deals any
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.760]  other third-world country they can't control they go start a revolution in
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.600]  or a military coup or they overthrow it that's the State Department of random
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.560]  200 that the official u.s. government which is the globalist policy remember
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.160]  we're occupied and captured as well is to deindustrialize the third world not
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.520]  let them develop and only allow industrial sectors to operate controlled
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.160]  by the globalist that don't aid the third world but are used to leverage out
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:21.320]  competition in the West so they use selected energy laws construction laws
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.320]  manufacturing laws and shipping laws under so-called free trade deals that
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.040]  are thousands of pages long to shut down all their competition so it is a total
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.800]  consolidation see here's what's frustrating I've read all the memos I
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.240]  know the plan this is not my opinion it is a nightmare for all the third world
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:46.200]  Copenhagen four years ago they had the meeting they told the third world we're
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.240]  going to double taxes on the West and pay you carbon money they got the treaty
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:55.360]  it was almost double the taxes on the third world not the West it was the
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.920]  West trying to screw the third world and that's what these movies like a
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.960]  lesium are and I don't think Matt Damon is sophisticated enough to know it and
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.880]  that's why I don't like having to attack the film but the globalist want to
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.560]  overrun the West with hundreds of millions of people that will work for
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:16.120]  nothing they can politically use them to vote as blocks to take liberties away
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.760]  the guns to bring in socialist health care that brings government control
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.560]  over care they can bring in the groups to collectivize and bring in
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.720]  collectivized education but most importantly to drive down wages and then
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:36.800]  compete for real estate to then drive up rent prices as Max Kaiser will tell
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.120]  you the globalists are rent seekers they don't want you to be able to own your
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.000]  own property that's why the mega rich always push higher property taxes
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:52.080]  because they all get exemptions all the richest people folks have tax-free
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.360]  houses they live in and by the way if you try to do that they come and say
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.160]  you're not allowed to in the IRS arrest you and you're like what the law says my
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.000]  lawyer said you're not a billionaire believe me folks I know billionaires
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.680]  okay and I know take Lake Austin where Michael Dell's got houses and stuff he
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.800]  doesn't pay taxes on them their tax exempt part of foundations he's got same
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:23.200]  thing with Bill and Melinda Gates folks I mean by the way a two bedroom house on
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.560]  Lake Austin's like two million dollars where I live in Texas that's the kind of
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.840]  stuff that's going on in Austin that's all the rich moving here are driving up
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.920]  stuff where a farmhouse is a is a million dollars out in the middle of
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:46.200]  nowhere this is the type of it does that hurt poor people that's globalism
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.680]  ladies and gentlemen that's what this is okay because they picked the winners
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:57.440]  and losers that's what Elysium is and so the reality is complex we need to jack
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.040]  up our standard of living demanding higher quality demanding lower taxes
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:06.080]  demanding a free market that will create such a giant middle class that it
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.040]  will lift people out of poverty to create islands or like political and
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.840]  economic coral reefs to create an ecosystem for more people to be able
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.840]  to come in but the way borders are being open the way globalism is working the
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.080]  way they bring in third world populations give them government subsidy of
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:30.560]  welfare dad goes and works hard all day mama has a bunch of kids and gets on
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.640]  welfare that then competes with all the other wage earners in the country and
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.480]  causes a giant sucking sound by driving down to the wages so that's why I get
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.560]  mad at grapes of wrath oh my gosh they showed you know fictional sheriff's
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.840]  deputies beating people with clubs who tried to strike break that's wrong it's
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.800]  terrible but actually stopped that stuff with people shooting them back but it's
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:02.560]  one one millionth literally of what the Soviets did and this was their
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.720]  propaganda grapes of wrath and other films they made like this was a whole
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:13.600]  string of them to sell communism in America as the solution when it's
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.520]  literally a nightmare system created by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers on
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.960]  record the the Bolsheviks worldwide revolutionary communism was created by
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:31.280]  the robber barons to go take over countries and then have contracts from
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.840]  without the country globally with the communist dictators this is all on
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.240]  record our government put Mao Zedong in power the greatest mass murderer in
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:45.360]  history so that's why I get so upset by movies like Elysium where Matt Damon
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:50.080]  thinks he's really helping poor people he's helping bring everybody down we're
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:58.560]  on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:33.440]  and the words they say which we won't understand the third world populations
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.680]  exploited by the globalists on record are now going to be exploited by the
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:44.600]  very same technocrats to overrun the first world nations and be used to
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:51.600]  further bankrupt us to the private banking cartels and I I've racked my
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.840]  brain studying economics studying geopolitical systems studying other
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.960]  systems that have existed on ways to try to develop a plan to try to empower
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.360]  humanity the problem is the globalists have already deployed their cold-blooded
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.600]  operation it's easy to take over when you're already centralized via ruthless
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.320]  activities over hundreds of years and you're willing to do anything and you've
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.800]  already been able to dumb down the population to a great extent it's a very
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:25.040]  dark future for humanity we're facing a dystopian nightmare but within
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:31.120]  rediscovering our humanity I believe we can turn the tide and if we can just get
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.160]  people to look at the mainstream confirmation that in the polio program
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.400]  worldwide they're actually giving people polio and then just calling it
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.880]  something else oh the vaccine paralyzes people but we don't call it polio and that
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.680]  the Gardasil shots they knew in the trials were killing people and
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.000]  sterilizing them there's a new study out on that we're gonna talk to an
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.280]  investigative journalist in a moment on that subject but it really comes down
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:35:01.840]  to just facing how hardcore the global technocrats are and how they really are
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.060]  different than the general public and I guess to a certain extent folks I'm
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.920]  kind of like a throwback caveman you know good old boy type but I've had a
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.240]  lot of really intelligent smart ancestors and I do have a high IQ and I've
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:22.960]  studied history to a certain extent and I'm pretty much somebody who has figured
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:28.280]  this stuff out and not made the decision to join the establishment because most
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.480]  people figure this stuff out or get told this stuff when they're young growing
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.240]  up in the establishment I didn't grow up in the establishment on the edge of it
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:42.400]  and decide to just be part of it but I've studied the establishment itself and
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.880]  they are in their own compartmentalized system and stagnant and drifting
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:53.000]  towards destruction humanities in deep trouble folks and we're not gonna do
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.720]  things to the third world and the unborn and the rest of it and not have it
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.160]  come back on us and people say what are you saying you're part of it yeah I'm
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.160]  part of this so are you so we're gonna talk about that in one moment and get
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.800]  into Gardasil and really important public service if they call it public
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.560]  service announcement does your neighbor have guns call the police on them as if

[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.600]  way speaking of that I've got Steve Watson working on an article where
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.560]  they're blocking info wars dot com more and more calling it racist one of our
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.400]  listeners was at a transportation kiosk you know where you pay a dollar can use
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.680]  the internet and they and they went to info wars dot com and I've seen this
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:49.480]  myself we've confirmed this report and you you go to the site and it just pops
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.440]  up and says racist it just goes racist just like something out of us it wouldn't
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.440]  even talk about unity and human freedom and empowerment and not letting the
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.000]  elite divide and conquer us and you know videos of where I'm bullhorning and
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.400]  protesting the Klan but they don't care they just put thousands and thousands
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:16.160]  of blogs and sites in a database I know somebody had to pay a bunch of money to
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:23.920]  a McCaffey a few months ago to take them off a list of saying they were
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.320]  dangerous site and it wasn't even true you see these stories every month about
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.480]  drugs as viruses on a site it's links to other people's news articles and it
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.840]  comes out later there are no viruses it's a lie they do that to us more and
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.760]  more this is the type of crap that's going on excuse my French so that you
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.400]  can't discover what's happening now why are they censoring us because they
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.400]  don't want us to read mainline studies and show you local news stories as well
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.520]  where people die taking the Gardasil vaccine that eight years ago killed
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.200]  people in trials and seven years ago and then Rick Perry came out and said it's
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.680]  the law to take it in Texas and ran a hoax an authoritarian hoax there was no
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.160]  law he told the health department listed as recommended which they then lie and
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.840]  say is mandatory there is no law they are trying to move to make it mandatory
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.320]  by the way India tried that they've said they've they've done that said don't do
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:24.600]  it anymore Japan is moving to ban it and Heidi Stevenson is a very interesting
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:31.600]  researcher and I'll let her get into her bio gaya-health.com but she's been
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.000]  doing the stories that and has been quoted in a Jonathan Benson's natural
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.320]  news.com story young women's ovaries destroyed by Gardasil merc forgot to
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:45.600]  research effects a vaccine on female reproduction so again I've been talking
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:49.480]  about this from natural news.com and info wars.com posting it since last week
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.560]  it is so important that you get this out to people but all the other reports of
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.000]  the deaths other governments banning it to understand that this is so evil and
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.640]  now in Mexico they're trying to make it mandatory actually the law for all girls
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.840]  under 13 it is definitely an anti fertility deal now you're not going to
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.560]  see Matt Damon out with a movie saying don't take the Gardasil you know my
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.400]  little Chiquitas you know like they call the little Hispanic girl in you're so
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.640]  cute and sweet and innocent in in movies like Elysium no no no no they're
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.320]  gonna say you take this shot and you get sterilized now or you have an auto
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.960]  immune disorder you die or you are you develop epilepsy or narcolepsy I know
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.520]  women personally that took that vaccine and have narcolepsy you can't drive
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.240]  themselves to work now I know women that have taken it now that have permanent
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.640]  Guillain beret and can't feel their hands and feet this is all on record but oh
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:50.720]  they say it's for the women so I want to go to her to talk about this Heidi
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.280]  Stevenson thank you for joining us tell us a little about yourself you're
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:58.800]  awakening the articles you write and then this new study that's out dealing
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:04.440]  with publishing the peer review British Medical Journal of what this stuff is
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.400]  doing to people because we need to get this out to people obviously before more
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.520]  victims take this shot well thanks for having me on I appreciate it an awful
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.880]  lot I don't think I'm all that interesting and so I don't know if we
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.880]  need to know spend time going into my history here but basically I've been
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.000]  writing about vaccines in general and a lot of other related issues in terms
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.800]  because this whole medical system is crazy it's insane and vaccines are like
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:42.200]  the symbol of what's going on because we're just not getting the truth how
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:50.200]  could a Vioxx happen it did so we now have Gardasil and Gardasil is it's an
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.880]  extremely dangerous vaccine it has well-known well documented adverse
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.360]  effects there's simply no way of getting around it and we this this particular
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:08.800]  case of one girl whose ovaries basically they killed her ovaries she's not the
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:14.440]  only one there are others and I've written about that recently it's not
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:21.160]  common but then again do you want to take the risk because that's your future
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:26.920]  that's your womanhood it's just down the tubes just like that so anyway this
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.400]  particular article is called Gardasil destroys girls ovaries it should have
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.640]  been predicted and basically all I do is tell about what the researchers
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:45.760]  actually found and go on and discuss it in you know more human terms and I I
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.560]  talk about some of the the things that they found and also I discuss in a
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:57.160]  separately a little more about potentially risky ingredients including
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:05.120]  two in particular that are in this vaccine and that are risky that are
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:11.200]  known to be have potential risks polysorbate 80 is known to cause damage
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.040]  to female rats for reproductive systems it's it's a fact it's been studied
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:24.320]  there's no way around it and yet it's in this vaccine so nobody cared
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:30.160]  apparently the fact is that nobody studied this the effects of this vaccine
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:37.320]  on ovaries they studied it on male rats testes but they didn't bother to study
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.840]  it on ovaries and they were pushing this on girls without ever even checking it
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:49.200]  out it's insane I don't understand so I'm not sure where you want me to go from
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.720]  here on this well no it's just that you know you're quoted in the article we've
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.520]  got this new study out British Medical Journal but there's so many other studies
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:00.240]  in the eight years of it's almost nine years since the studies first started
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.440]  all over the world and I differ with you on this because I can tell you're a
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.880]  smart intelligent you know advocate for people's health and you're out there
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:12.520]  warning people but folks come out and say well they must not have known what
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.840]  they're doing or they didn't properly study it they studied it in the trials it
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.240]  killed people it sterilized people it gave people a lot of immune disorders and
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:28.040]  they said let's testing if we can dump something like this on the market and see
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:34.960]  if we can PR wise handle this this soft kill weapon and it's precisely because
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.760]  it does this they know if they add that polysorbate 40 and other things to it
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.680]  along with the virus the body will develop an autoimmune response to that
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.040]  and actually accelerate it and then actually attack any organs that it
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.480]  basically goes into just like the UN got caught with over 50 different
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.560]  manufacturers over 20 years adding female hormones that are in second
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.360]  trimester estrus to then cause autoimmune disorders and and miscarriages
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:10.000]  at the second trimester three and a half month mark and it turned out that
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.120]  was a UN program so they know full well what they're doing for my educated
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.360]  analysis I mean they certainly know what's doing it now and are pushing it
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:22.520]  harder than ever well you might be interested in knowing that there is a
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:30.120]  coming push on the HPV vaccines Gardasil and serverics to not just give them to
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:39.440]  teenage girls or boys but to move the age range down and to give it to babies
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:46.280]  and they're using as the example of why they should do this the HPV vaccine
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:52.320]  which is in the U.S. nearly every baby born in a hospital is given this
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.520]  vaccine within the first 24 hours of birth and that's hailed as this great
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:02.200]  success even though the HPV vaccine doesn't protect an infant from anything
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.000]  that infant could possibly have yeah unless the infant is an intervening as
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.560]  drug user or having unprotected sex which is incredible and again if they
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.320]  can if they can give over a hundred million Americans SV 40 cancer viruses
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:21.440]  knowingly and get away with it in the polio vaccine on record if they can give
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.240]  kids for now 20 years deadly are 15 years or so deadly at birth on record
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.120]  dangerous hepatitis shots and then hepatitis levels only go up because
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.480]  duh and and and if they can give them live polio and cover that up and if
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:42.640]  they can do this of course they are and and clearly this is a criminal eugenics
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.480]  operation you know it just came out and I said estrus I meant gestation you know
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.320]  a second trimester you know going into the second trimester of gestation
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.920]  that's when these other hormones they've added according to medical doctors I've
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.280]  had on kick in and cause cause the woman to have a miscarriage I mean this is so
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.920]  diabolical I think people have trouble dealing with it Heidi so yeah let's get
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.440]  into babies now it's not enough to hurt these women with these shots and little
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.280]  boys now let's go after babies with the papilloma vaccine that as you know
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.920]  doesn't even cover most the papilloma viruses that's correct that's exactly
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:26.160]  correct and yet this is actually in a journal the the plan to do this or or
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.480]  the the the study that supposedly documents why we should do this why we
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:38.920]  should start giving this vaccine to babies and the interesting thing is even
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.400]  though this vaccine is known to have an extremely high rate of adverse effects
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:50.280]  including death and adverse effects that destroy lives utterly like narcolepsy
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:59.800]  and others and they did not even once in the entire paper even reference safety
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:06.600]  concerns not one mention of adverse effects nothing it's as if the there's
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:10.800]  there's no potential harm that that is actually the way they've approached this
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.160]  it's not an issue so it seems to me that if you want to hide the effects of a
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.080]  vaccine give it to a baby a brand new baby because they can't tell you what's
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.760]  going on you give it to a baby at birth and how do you know that baby was there
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:34.320]  what was healthy to begin with you don't you can't prove it all you know is
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:41.600]  you've been handed this is very very sick baby and what does it well who knows
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.760]  maybe it was a vaccine but no vaccines don't do things like that at least that's
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:53.680]  the attitude and people end up sick so we now have a world full of sick children
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:59.760]  that's literally the truth the average child now is ill and well that's why I
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.320]  wanted to get you on is because you point that out in the articles you you you
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.720]  put out on your excellent news site and and that's what's frustrating is they
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.280]  want to make us ill to make us part of the medical system it's another form of
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.600]  slavery and they've even written white papers on it and people just can't come
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:21.120]  to grips with how diabolical this is it is it's stunning it is it's hard to
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.480]  comprehend I mean I actually came into this from from any
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.640]  atrogenic injury that means a doctor induced and I'm supposed to be dead but
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:38.160]  I finally woke up a bit and I decided well they told me I'm going to die that
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:43.840]  there's no way to treat this so I went to an alternative practitioner Heidi
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:47.800]  Stevenson stay there I want to talk about this on the other side folks that
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.560]  there's no doubt this is a eugenics reclamation program just like they now
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:56.760]  admit in California they're still sterilizing women it's a huge secret
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:59.200]  program

[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.960]  Austin Texas where I live I know a lot of people that know him behind the scenes
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.640]  I mean he's basically like a Hispanic version of the Ku Klux Klan I wish he
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:34.400]  would come out and make a movie about how the UN has got a program in Mexico to
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:40.280]  make all the little girls in Mexico take Gardasil shots that on record are going
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:44.360]  to screw them up and reduce their fertility and sterilize them oh but
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.800]  he's not gonna do that he's just gonna make movies about how white people are
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:53.400]  all racist and have to be dealt with and and so is Matt Damon because that's
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.080]  what the establishment wants they want us all fighting with each other while the
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.400]  globalists are basically killing us it's unbelievable the reality of this
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:08.080]  Heidi Stevenson you were damaged by your doctor that's the number one cause of
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:13.200]  death now in this country unnatural death was over 300,000 a year doctors
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.280]  killing people one way or another and and the system just just just pushing
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:22.040]  this expand and tell folks your story of what happened to you and you know babies
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:27.360]  as my crew was pointing out as Nico was pointing out they you don't know if they
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.080]  were okay when they were born so you can mess them up and claim it was a
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.160]  problem throughout life they can't tell you when they're sick they can't tell you
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.080]  when it's hurting they're the perfect victim to pump full of Gardasil and
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.880]  hepatitis and all these other shots absolutely I'd like to take one step
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  back you said that it's the medical system is is the number one cause of
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.560]  death agreed completely and you said that it's about 300,000 well I I agree
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:59.160]  with that except that that's only the tip of the iceberg that's only what's
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.720]  recognized and acknowledged but what isn't recognized what's not accepted as
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:10.960]  as medically induced death are the people who end up with cancer because of
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.360]  antibiotics which do lead to cancer in many cases because they mess up the gut
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:25.320]  bacteria and all kinds of adverse effects that that end up causing horrific
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.120]  damage like all these these kids with diabetes who will who are going to die
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:35.080]  ultimately of diabetes because that is a deadly disease but they won't be
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:40.560]  counted as the atrogenic deaths so that the number of people who die that way
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.440]  are is massively understated by 300 that's right that's right there are so
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.280]  many studies that the vaccines are causing some type of autoimmune response
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.600]  in the pancreas and burning it out I mean they're just killing everybody well
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.400]  I can't argue with that at all I wouldn't even begin to try to argue with it
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.800]  yeah it's the autoimmune disorders and that's mostly what we're seeing in when
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:10.160]  in in these girls who who don't die immediately we're seeing autoimmune
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.800]  disorders and vaccines that's my big thing about vaccines because they cause
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:20.080]  autoimmune disorders and autoimmune disorder disorders are a heart lupus all
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.640]  of it is off the chart and here's the deal I think you've got all the studies
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.760]  up on your site we've got them this is not debatable they knew Gardasil was
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.640]  killing a bunch of people in the trials other governments are banning it but not
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:36.280]  America not Mexico because we're under the control of Goldman Sachs and other
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.600]  groups that have the actuary set up they want us out of the way and in the
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:46.320]  process of our dying they want to suck all the money out of us I'm not going
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:54.120]  to argue with you about that no I I mean I'm not good as I'm not going to go
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:58.280]  into the political end of it right now because that's not what I'm sure though
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:04.760]  what I know as much about I just know what's happening here and there's just
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:10.120]  no way of looking at it with with open eyes and not realize that something's
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:15.240]  going on absolutely something is going on yeah well they're gonna put shots in
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.360]  me or my family over my dead body but the problem is they're coming out with
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.520]  it in the food in the water vaccines in the pharmacological crops where you

[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.800]  Stevenson she's a journalist and researcher and I saw her quoted an
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.320]  article on natural news by Jonathan Benson that has the British Medical
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.000]  Journal and info young woman's ovaries destroyed by Gardasil but I wanted her
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.640]  to finish up her story of a doctor-induced or system-induced illness
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:06.680]  and other points she thinks are important to add for people out there and

[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:15.720]  ahead Heidi Stevenson make any other points that you think are important okay
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:22.600]  well basically I had it in the atrogenic disease it was killing me I was
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:29.480]  really literally close to death and I ended up going to a gasp a homeopath
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:33.600]  and I actually didn't even believe in homeopathy I thought it was pure
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.080]  nonsense that's actually even the first thing I said to the homeopath who said
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:48.440]  well I don't care and that was over 10 years ago and I'm here and I've taken
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.960]  what I've learned and gotten into it and found that what happened to me is not
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:02:01.720]  rare it's common it's actually very very common and it's easy to do because the
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.280]  medical systems the doctors they all circle the wagons and they won't none of
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.320]  them speak out if one does well you know they they ruin their careers and
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.680]  apparently careers are more important to people's lives at least that seems to be
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:21.920]  the impression that we get when we're on the opposite side of that system and in
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:28.160]  the process of my learning I found out more and more and more and discovered
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.960]  that vaccines these wonderful miracle things that I always believed in cuz
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:39.840]  well doesn't everybody discovered the truth and that that everything we've
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.120]  been told is about them has been a lie that they're not harmless they're
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:48.600]  extremely dangerous that they kill people that they destroy lives and they
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.240]  don't even do what they claim they're going to do they they don't that's what
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.920]  amazing almost all of the inserts say doesn't even protect you from hepatitis
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.080]  doesn't protect you from papilloma doesn't and you're like but they're
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.680]  saying it does on the news it's so incredible absolutely true I mean you
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:14.120]  there is some truth to it there's some limited truth but it's limited and that's
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:19.760]  right there's some limit there's evidence that the 500 year old technology
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:23.640]  of immunization does have some validity the problem is these companies are so
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.160]  corrupt and have such a hidden agenda and such a horrible history that you
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.640]  can't trust them amen amen to that I have to agree come 100% and the fact is
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:40.520]  you have to consider and be honest about the harm and you have to be honest
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:45.040]  about what they have accomplished and what they haven't and the fact of the
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:49.360]  matter is that the claims that that vaccines have made us safe from small
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:54.640] pox safe from polio and all of these others so-called horrible childhood
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:04:00.520]  illnesses most of which I remember I had them and frankly they're not fun but
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:07.600]  guess what autism is a whole lot worse and give me a choice I'll I think I'll
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:11.200]  take chickenpox you know I might get a scar out of it but I think I could live
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:17.160]  my children have all had it and by the grace of God is a good nutrition
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.280]  everything they just got some little red bumps on them and it was gone and gone
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:25.240]  in two days in fact you know you hear about the groups where the neighbor
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.400]  kid has it so you bring the kids over to get it from them so that it's all over
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.320]  with and you control the situation absolutely my mother was very very
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.720]  upset because she tried to have me get the months and unfortunately I just
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:43.200]  plain didn't get it absolutely you don't want to get it when parties really
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.920]  happened yeah really did do it because it was a safest thing everybody knew
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.040]  that well mom mom always knew best until the government became our mommy Heidi

[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:47.000]  it's a sycophantic ladies and gentlemen you're a radio listener I had Fox news

[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:09.120]  average cop down the beat didn't do in that but I mean I'm just so sick of the
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:13.400]  naïveté of the population every time I see all the special units and all the
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:18.320]  stuff I just go there's the guys and everybody just sycophantically drools
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:24.200]  all over that makes me want to throw up at how naive the population is I guess
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:26.800]  you're not naive most people are just desperate and don't know what they're
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:35.200]  gonna do as our economy converts over to a pure mafia insider crony picking the
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:45.680]  winners and losers let me hit this article out of news to Houston woman
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:53.720]  opens fire on a group of robbers at Denny's police say the group of suspects
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:11:05.280]  fled the scene with stolen jewelry and then it goes on to show how the a man
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:08.760]  who does not want to be identified said his brother was robbed by six men with
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.800]  guns at the Denny's restaurant off the Gulf freeway in southeast Houston I
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:18.520]  don't know if it was random or someone set him up because he got his own label
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:23.120]  said the victim's brother whatever that means his brother's wife was in the
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.120]  restroom at the time but when she got out she saw the group of robbers police
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.560]  said that when she pulled out her handgun or her gun and shot at them she
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.040]  said she came out of the restroom and saw my brother on the floor that's when
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:41.400]  she started doing what she got to do absolutely she got a license and she'll
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:47.040]  do anything to protect her kids and her brother love it and then I even sure if
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.560]  she shot any of them because they ran off but let me tell you I come out of a
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:57.440]  restroom and I'm packing and I see that you're gonna get hit so easy I'm shooting
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.560]  fishing a barrel and I don't look I don't want to kill people but it's like a
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:05.160]  healthy thing it's like catching a rattlesnake under your kid's
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:12.040]  playscape in the backyard I've actually done that don't tell my wife she only
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:17.160]  knows about water moccasins copperheads and a coral snake which I felt bad
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.720]  killing that coral snake my dad didn't believe they could get over three feet
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:24.040]  because the Wikipedia said only three feet and this thing was over three feet
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:28.960]  long it was again in the backyard and even though it's a nice snake in the
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.720]  cobra family and they're not really aggressive like a rattlesnake or a
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.840]  water moccasin water moccasins are really aggressive compared even a
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:39.400]  rattler I had to kill it and he came over and even though it was blood out and
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:42.920]  shrunk a little bit we put it together it was three and a half feet that'll be
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.560]  a record coral snake I hacked up with a hoe I don't want to upset my wife to do
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:53.560]  a shotgun but point is I've already digressed off ladies and gentlemen got
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:58.840]  to do what you got to do let's give some facts great article by Michael Snyder
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:02.600]  an American dream blog it's up on info wars.com I think everybody should get
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:10.000]  this out to everybody they know it's also up on prisonplanet.com 18
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.680]  little known gun facts that prove that guns make us safer and then he goes over
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:20.960]  a breakdown of it links to the Harvard crime studies all the rest of it I love
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.000]  these articles he writes like we do where it just gives absolute you know
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.040]  backing up of everything we say over the past 20 years gun sales have
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:34.760]  absolutely exploded but homicides with firearms are down 39% during that time
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:41.040]  and other crimes with firearms are down 69% that's right they study published in
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:45.840]  the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy discovered that nations that have
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.520]  more guns tend to have less crime number three the nine European nations with a
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.840]  lowest rate of gun ownership rate have they combined murder rate that is three
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.400]  times greater than that of nine European nations with the highest rate of gun
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:03.280]  ownership yeah and it's cultural that like Japan doesn't have guns that doesn't
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.720]  have hardly any crime because the average Japanese person you know won't
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:10.960]  steal from you in fact they've done studies of the only group that if their
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.320]  kids are starving they will not rob you on average they will sit there and
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:18.880]  starve to death before they rob you that's why they had Fukushima and all
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:24.640]  that stuff and millions evacuating and almost no crime all the crimes committed
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:29.680]  by the government by the way almost every mass shooting that has occurred in
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:35.640]  the United States since 1950 has taken place in a state with strict gun control
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:42.400]  laws we link to those statistics with just one exception every public mass
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.800]  shooting in the USA since the 1950s has taken place where citizens are banned
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.440]  from carrying guns despite strict gun regulations Europe has had three of the
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.640]  six were school shootings number five the United States is number one in the
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:01.560]  world in gun ownership yet is only 28 in the world in gun murders per 100,000
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.520]  people that's Department of Justice on numbers number six the violent crime rate
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:17.160]  the United States actually fell 757.7 per 100,092 to 386,000 per hundred
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.240]  thousand in 2011 except in the black community because that's because they
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:26.280]  took all their guns the only areas where total gunmans are black cities that's
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.800]  racist the liberals are there to euthanize you suck money out of you and
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:33.280]  kill you you're not gonna have guns while they kill your ass excuse me I'm sorry
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.480]  I'm just out of control folks being myself here I'm gonna stop I apologize
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:42.840]  God exercise the demons continuing here the violent crime rate in the United
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.880]  States actually fell and it goes on approximately 200,000 women in the
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.120]  United States use guns to protect themselves against sexual crime every
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.760]  year number eight overall guns the United States are used 80 times more often
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:59.280]  to prevent crime than they are to take lives number nine the number of
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:04.280]  unintentional fatalities due to firearms declined 58 percent between 91 and
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:11.920]  2011 number 10 despite the very strict ban on guns in the UK the overall rate of
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.560]  violent crime in the UK is about four times higher than it was the United
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:23.160]  States in one recent year there were 200 2,034 violent crimes per hundred
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.160]  thousand people in the UK the United States that were 466 violent crimes per
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.680]  hundred thousand people in that same year do we really want to be more like
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.680]  the UK yeah they have they have less gun crime there but they have more overall
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:43.920]  crime what is that like eight nine times let's continue here now that'd be five
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:49.360]  times the UK was approximately 125 percent more rape victims per hundred
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.280]  thousand people each year the United States does the UK has approximately
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.000]  133 percent more assault victims per hundred thousand people every year than
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.240]  the United States does the UK has the fourth largest burglary rate in the EU
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.000]  the UK has the second highest overall crime rate in the EU number 15 down
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.480]  under an Australia gun murders increased 19% and armed robberies increased
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.480]  69% after the gun ban was instituted I'm not gonna read the rest of these they

[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:16.800]  world whey.com yeah I want to explain something to people about Gardasil and I
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:22.920]  had medical doctors on for eight years I covered every few months it killed a
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:27.240]  bunch of people on the trials they got cancer very quickly or they died in a
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:31.320]  day with blood coming out of every orifice or they would get like lupus
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.200]  like diseases or they would be paralyzed and there's been no exaggeration I've
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:43.240]  probably seen 20 different newscast of it's always a cheerleader who gets the
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:48.280]  shot and then is dead two weeks later on a ventilator and a lot of times the
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:53.000]  medical doctors go no we you know she got the the second round or the third round
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.400]  of the shot it's usually the second or third and then it kills them but for
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:03.160]  most women that's when it just over effects in in in my research for you
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:09.240]  kind of an over over roasting of your ovaries and other other sexual organs
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:15.840]  like your uterus it's just meant to reduce fertility and all these globalist
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.040]  programs they've been caught doing it before with hepatitis vaccines they've
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.240]  been caught doing it for women in tetanus shots you in programs only for
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:27.960]  women and then they add a hormone to it I want to go to other collars but
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:31.880]  finishing up with Sarah Sarah so you heard about this locally in your town
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:36.880]  all I'm saying is if you see young women or you see people with young girls
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.400]  and now they're trying to do it to boys they're trying to make it mandatory you
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:43.560]  got to go up and warn them hey by the way Gardasil's killing people read the
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:50.160]  insert because most people go my doctor said we should all be picketing outside
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.000]  doctors offices if we find out they give Gardasil shots I mean they're
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.200]  murdering everybody and of course the average doctor doesn't know they're
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.160]  compartmentalized because if you admit this is going on then you that's how
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.400]  the Nazis get did it is once you once you go all they're okay and then even
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.120]  though bad things start happening you've got to go along with it because you
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:13.600]  don't want to admit you're part of something evil and this is a life or
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:17.160]  death situation they're trying to pass laws worldwide they're doing in some
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:21.840]  cases to actually make it mandatory and then when you don't they will send the
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:25.360]  police and if you barricade yourself in that house an armored vehicle pulls up
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:29.760]  with train killers and there's been cases where they take the kid give them
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:33.400]  the shot and they have convulsions a lot of times mothers their kid already get
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:38.040]  sick from shots says no no no I've seen the cases in Detroit you name it they
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:43.040]  SWAT team and put the mother in prison they might as well line your family up
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.440]  and shoot them right there but see they're smart people fought when the
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:50.440]  Nazis lined you up and shot you if they give you a soft kill we're here to help
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:54.840]  you the doctor didn't even know he oh whatever the persons having convulsions
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:58.600]  that's not me the SWAT team doesn't know it's just some mother won't give her
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:03.920]  kids up and it's all compartmentalized you're living folks in a sci-fi Nazi
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:09.800]  Germany I'm sorry Sarah for ranting go ahead and finish up with what happened
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:15.560]  after she took the Gardasil shot well like I said she ended up being diagnosed
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:20.840]  with an advanced stage of ovarian cancer and died and I know that people hear you
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:26.240]  say this about vaccines and think you're exaggerating but I was a public
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:31.960]  health nurse until last December and if you you're supposed to push these
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:39.200]  vaccines on anybody and and we were giving boys the Gardasil shot or some
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:45.200]  nurses were I didn't and a lot of times I would refuse to give it when I knew
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:49.600]  that the parents hadn't read anything about it oh wow you're a nurse on top of
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:54.880]  it I didn't know that wow yeah how many of the nurses how many of the nurses know
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:00.800]  this you talked to I talked to any nurse and anybody in health care that I can
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:07.040]  reach about it you know and I quit my job there I stay at home with my kids
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.400]  now and but basically I knew that it was only a matter of time before I ended up
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:19.280]  in trouble at work for actually giving informed consent we would get in trouble
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:25.320]  for giving informed consent we were supposed to just hand them a sheet of
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:29.960]  paper from the CDC trust that they were going to read it and understand what
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:33.320]  they were getting or what their child was getting and just give the
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.800]  vaccination and I wouldn't do it you know I said you know I would encourage
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:41.920]  people if you really want to make another appointment and come back but
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:46.520]  read about it first I don't know how much trouble I got into for doing those
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:52.200]  little things right there and I would just tell my supervisor look it's I for
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:58.040]  an oath to the patient not to you or not to Merck or the pharmaceutical
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:02.200]  company that was to the patient and I really feel like if the parent has
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:07.720]  never heard of this before I shouldn't push it on on that day and by the way
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.960]  that's the bare minimum morally you could do instead the nurses all need to
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:17.840]  band together and start handing out literature and news articles I mean I
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.520]  would go to the head of the hospital and say here are 15 news articles about
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.240]  Gardasil killing people and foreign governments banning it and then there'll
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.360]  be an uproar and then it'll get reversed like India and Japan where they've
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:35.080]  outlawed it but see we just won't do it it's like oh you're wearing a blue
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:38.880]  uniform I'll do what you say no matter if it's illegal oh you're wearing a white

[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:39.080]  important news I haven't gotten to after we take more calls but I want to
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:45.760]  encourage people to be citizen journalist but also citizen satirist
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:53.040]  citizen town criers rabble rousers there's a war going on I'm completely
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:57.320]  freaked out that big pharma is on record being eugenics based since it was
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:02.720]  founded and that they're carrying out debilitating soft kill operations
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:08.040]  against everyone and that's a fact and again is compartmentalized the average
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:12.400]  doctor the average hospital they just follow the orders of the bioethics
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:17.800]  boards that are you genesis it's illegal to take a teenage girl and cut her
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:21.640]  ovaries out they're like well why don't they just tire tubes they want to do
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.600]  whatever's the most brutal and can't be reversed out in California but they'd
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.960]  been caught doing it by the tens of thousands a year again no one will get
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:35.760]  in trouble because it was sanctioned well you know there are too many poor
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:39.680]  people folks they've dumbed everybody down we all look poisoned and you know
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:45.600]  quasi debilitated because we've been under soft kill they've got to dumb us
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:50.400]  down cut off our resources make us dependent get us on the grid before
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:54.680]  they roll out with the next phase of their eugenics operation and again I've
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:35:00.200]  not just reverse engineered their program I know all this because they're on
[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:07.960]  record saying it's the plant and that's why I'm here warning you well we did
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:13.880]  this first a few months ago and then the life site people did it and the student
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:17.360]  activist groups did it and now mark dice has done it and he always seems to do it
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.880]  best because he's a smart guy but also because he's out in LA where they have
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:28.840]  got some of the dumbest most evil government loving people I've ever
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:35.080]  seen in my life and Obama supporters signed petition calling for killing of
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:41.120]  newborn babies under Obamacare and mark wisely blurred their faces out of these
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.560]  people not that he has any liability they did it as news gathering you know
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:47.880]  you do it you're on you only got to get permission if you're in a public place
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:51.400]  if it's for entertainment purposes but if people you're in a public place and
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:55.640]  you know that's it no no no perception of privacy that's how the cops can
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:59.720]  videotape you and that's how you know that's why they're on the wrong when
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:02.840]  they come up to you and say you can't videotape them as long as you're not
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.960]  interfering with what they're doing getting in the middle of lawful duties
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:10.720]  it's official oppression and criminal when they try to stop you but the point
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:16.960]  is is that Obama supporters that so this has been done on the East Coast Austin
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:22.520]  and in California and here in Austin more than half the people said yeah kill
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:26.600]  babies after they're born for Obama and if they'll get some more welfare you'll

[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:52.400]  wars.com the guy's got a kid on his shoulders as he signs a petition to kill
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:57.320]  babies after they're born and this all started last year when Paul Watson dug
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:02.760]  up the Journal of Bioethics calling for killing babies up to age three even
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:06.440]  healthy ones and now they're saying yeah old people you don't really have a good
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:12.720]  life your knees are bad you can't see good we're not we're gonna deny care and
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:17.840]  they get you into a socialist system so they can deny you the care and make the
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:20.720]  will we're gonna give it to the young people and the young people are like

[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.000]  that evil laugh and I said well it's painful these things are painful to me
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.360]  and so I you know basically note it as this is the spirit of what they're
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:53.200]  doing it's like a sick laugh back at the devil it's like yeah I know what you are
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:58.000]  and I'm laughing at everybody out there so they get the factor being laughed at

[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.800]  some pride somebody's got some dignity somebody's got some survival instincts
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:13.720]  out there I mean I look at these so I can even see somebody who's into
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.760]  themselves the walk they'll have is this little satisfied lot walking the
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:23.720]  satisfied look and they'll go so what they're not killing me so what if Obama
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:31.040]  spying on me I like him I'm in the winning club yeah it's disgusting so that
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:36.480]  stories up on info works comm I'm gonna tweak that out I guess Watson just did
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.040]  actually just unbelievable let me show you the articles of your TV viewer not

[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.160]  should take all the vaccines and get ready to have their hands and feet go
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.600]  numb and have health problems and have their kidneys fell and get diabetes and

[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:26.840]  and what's wrong with killing babies up to age three now it's trendy good
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:32.400]  afternoon brother eight I attended a ruche pack satellite meeting a few days
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:37.440]  ago and they want to reinstitute the glass steel firewall it's a good idea
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:40.800]  but it's a bad idea we should let foreign banks run everything and money
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:44.400]  launderer do whatever they want how dare you scum you even know how to even
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:47.640]  know the name of laws you must be a terrorist
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:54.440]  terrorist for freedom and liberty and the pursuit of happiness go ahead terrorist
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:58.360]  what else is on your mind oh well you know I looked at I said you know that's
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:01.040]  that's wonderful but you guys are not looking at the total big picture on a
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:05.320]  global scale I mean look at this I mean it's like take for example it's like a
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:08.360]  figure of speech it's like a one-legged mountain climber trying to climb Mount
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:12.640]  Everest in a snowstorm and at night for good measure I mean it's it's a
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:16.800]  difficult yeah but if you get listen if you got glass stiggle back in where the
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:21.120]  investment banks couldn't infect everything else with what they're doing
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:29.520]  it would really put the kibosh on their system yeah I'm all for it but it's
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.440]  gonna be tough you know trying to limp along I know that's why I recommend we
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:37.840]  just drink more fluoride there won't be any pain those coffins are mighty warm
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:44.000]  down there yeah I hear you I appreciate your call truth raider yeah no I mean I
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.560]  don't agree with some of the stuff the LaRouche pack people are into and all
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:52.800]  that but in the final equation getting the last eagle back in is really a good
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:58.080]  solution but the big solution is realizing we have a predatory occupied
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:01.400]  government and that isn't just rhetoric and they're trying to mop up what's
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:05.080]  left and they're announcing yeah there'll be army checkpoints yeah we're
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:10.040]  gonna disappear bloggers now yeah we're spying on you what's the picture we run
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:16.720]  al-Qaeda of course we do the TSA is gonna be at the mall and I saw footage in
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:19.840]  San Antonio everybody's like what's wrong with him searching everybody at the
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:27.840]  mall I like it how dare you not like it you've got a bunch of dumb down people
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.080]  who want to be destroyed and they will be let's go ahead and talk to how we in
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:36.280]  Washington I guess FEMA region 10 again how we how are you doing up there with
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:43.880]  Bill Gates all right have you had your shots hmm I don't take shots well Bill

[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.800]  food to make sure you're a good boy and go to sleep forever well I understand
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:57.800]  that sir but my questions are what's with this fetal baby parts in my pepsi

[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.640]  a shareholder meeting where the shareholders said get it out and
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:12.840]  Obama signed an order saying no they're allowed to keep it in and so you
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:19.760]  will drink baby essence I'm telling you it's all cuckoo land man it's like the
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:23.200]  golden child or something and they want us to all be defiled or something I
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.320]  mean I don't know I mean I mean I go in stores now and I see a pepsi deal and I
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:32.440]  get freaked out by it that I live in a country in a world where there's

[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:14.120]  airplane but you can't drop napalm on villages I want that guy off the air how
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:20.320]  dare you be upset by the over the chart hellraiser level nightmare science
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:24.640]  fiction of baby bodies being used for flavoring and vaccines grown on dead
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:31.000]  fetal tissue how dare you how dare you I apologize to the listeners that we had
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:34.720]  an extremist call in who thinks it's bad to kill babies and use them as
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:39.480]  flavoring and drinks by the way I want to send my crew out doing that going out
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.440]  with Pepsi saying you know they use feel flavoring but you but you got to add
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.760]  Obama supports it you know Pepsi did get behind him that's all part of the sick
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:52.200]  joke to it they had a Pepsi's a big boulder Burke person and so you got
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:55.960]  you know hey you know they're just recycling the field tissue you know
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:00.480]  people suit over it but Obama blocked it you know they have a ride and it's for
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.840]  Obama and they will I guarantee you you can probably give them a dead baby and
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:08.960]  they would get for Obama they just go raw start eating it I mean it's like so

[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:58.440]  beneficial to the public by dr. Swift and this is the famous modest proposal
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:05.600]  put out by Jonathan Swift a modest proposal is a satirical essay written
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:10.600]  and published anonymously by Jonathan Swift and 1729 Swift suggests that the
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.080]  impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:19.160]  children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies the satirical hyperbole mocks
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:23.160]  heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as the Irish policy in general and
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.440]  English writing the phrase and modest proposal is now can ventional as an
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:33.640]  illusion of the style of straight-faced satire but it's not satire that we eat

[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:03.760]  years ago I thought it was a joke and then when callers call up and I thought
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:10.240]  well surely the shareholders are suing over this surely this will stop and it
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.960]  didn't yeah there it is Obama agency rules Pepsi's use of aborted fetal cells
