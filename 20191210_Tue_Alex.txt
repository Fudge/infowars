[00:00.000 --> 00:00.580]  Action.
[00:13.500 --> 00:17.200] ija Is the President of the United States above the law.
[00:19.200 --> 00:21.200]  Noynthol is above the law.
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.760]  No hambrionis above the law.
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.900]  Noon is above the law.
[00:23.900 --> 00:25.460]  NoONn is above the law.
[00:25.700 --> 00:27.720]  Noon is above the law.
[00:27.740 --> 00:29.260]  Noon is above the law.
[00:29.260 --> 00:30.540]  He is certainly not above the law.
[00:30.540 --> 00:31.500]  Nobody's above the law.
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.660]  No one is above the law.
[00:32.660 --> 00:38.080]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:38.080 --> 00:41.300]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:41.300 --> 00:42.880]  This President believes he is above the law.
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.600]  And, no one, not even the President, should be above the law.
[00:46.600 --> 00:50.240]  No one is above the law, and certainly not the President.
[00:50.240 --> 00:51.240]  Oh my god.
[00:51.240 --> 00:54.980]  Again, I repeat, no one, not even the President, is above the law.
[00:54.980 --> 00:55.980]  Oh my god.
[00:55.980 --> 00:56.980]  Do you know what this means?
[00:56.980 --> 00:57.980]  We finally got him.
[00:57.980 --> 01:00.780]  We have a president who believes he is above the law.
[01:00.780 --> 01:03.480]  The president is not above the law.
[01:03.480 --> 01:05.980]  The president who believes he is above the law.
[01:05.980 --> 01:08.980]  He is not, as some people have tried to suggest, above the law.
[01:08.980 --> 01:10.980]  The president is declaring himself above the law.
[01:10.980 --> 01:15.980]  No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law.
[01:15.980 --> 01:19.480]  Donald Trump has tried to put himself above the law.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.980]  And that's not how it works.
[01:20.980 --> 01:22.980]  That's not how any of this works.
[01:22.980 --> 01:24.480]  You are above the law.
[01:24.480 --> 01:30.980]  In my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law.
[01:30.980 --> 01:37.980]  The American people do not want a president who believes that he is above the law.
[01:37.980 --> 01:38.980]  No one is above the law.
[01:38.980 --> 01:40.480]  Nobody is above the law.
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.980]  We must ensure that no one is above the law.
[01:42.980 --> 01:47.980]  I mean, dear God, this guy cannot in any way be allowed to be above the law.
[01:47.980 --> 01:49.980]  This is the United States of America.
[01:49.980 --> 01:52.980]  No one is above the law.
[01:52.980 --> 01:56.980]  No one, no one, no one is above the law.
[01:56.980 --> 01:58.980]  No one is above the law.
[01:58.980 --> 02:01.980]  President Trump and his administration are not above the law.
[02:01.980 --> 02:03.980]  There is big news that just came out.
[02:03.980 --> 02:06.980]  Looks like Donald Trump may have broken the law.
[02:06.980 --> 02:08.980]  No one is above the law.
[02:08.980 --> 02:12.980]  No one, not even the president is above the law.
[02:12.980 --> 02:14.980]  Son of a bitch.
[02:14.980 --> 02:24.980]  He is a journalist.
[02:24.980 --> 02:35.980]  There are some healing phone records of journalists.
[02:35.980 --> 02:36.980]  We don't know how many.
[02:36.980 --> 02:41.980]  I asked anywhere at the colloquy last week, can you tell me how many journalists Adam Schiff was spying on?
[02:41.980 --> 02:42.980]  He couldn't answer that.
[02:42.980 --> 02:44.980]  How many members of Congress is he spying on?
[02:44.980 --> 02:46.980]  Or other citizens across this country?
[02:46.980 --> 02:49.980]  And they can't even answer a basic question like that.
[02:49.980 --> 02:54.980]  We all should be alarmed at how they've abused their power with this majority in Congress.
[02:54.980 --> 03:01.980]  And it's a shame because there's a lot more we should be doing that families across this country are counting on us to do like lower drug prices.
[03:01.980 --> 03:09.980]  At least as House Republicans, we're going to stay focused on fighting hard for those families across America who are counting on us
[03:09.980 --> 03:14.980]  and working with President Trump to go deliver more wins for American workers in the American economy.
[03:14.980 --> 03:19.980]  And with that, I'll turn it over to our Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy.
[03:19.980 --> 03:24.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December 10th, 2019.
[03:24.980 --> 03:31.980]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we've got four big guests lined up today that will pop in quickly.
[03:31.980 --> 03:36.980]  But I do intend to mainly take your phone calls.
[03:36.980 --> 03:40.980]  This is a time for the citizens of the nation to be able to respond.
[03:40.980 --> 03:48.980]  It's official Democrats released text of articles of impeachment, and I have it right here in front of me.
[03:48.980 --> 03:50.980]  Two different articles of impeachment.
[03:50.980 --> 03:54.980]  They were looking at four of them, but they realized there's no evidence of anything.
[03:54.980 --> 04:08.980]  So these have to be these nebulous, nebulous resolutions that absolutely still cannot even be proven.
[04:08.980 --> 04:17.980]  So we're going to be walking through all of that here today.
[04:17.980 --> 04:25.980]  And again, we will be taking your phone calls throughout the four hours of the broadcast today.
[04:25.980 --> 04:30.980]  I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour as well ahead of the war room while Owen Schreuer and the crew are on the East Coast and in D.C.
[04:30.980 --> 04:35.980]  We've got Savannah Hernandez and some of the other great crew hosting the war room.
[04:35.980 --> 04:48.980]  And then I'll be back tonight with live coverage from six to about ten this evening of the Trump slash Pence rally,
[04:48.980 --> 04:51.980]  supposing one of the biggest ever in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[04:51.980 --> 04:53.980]  Working around the clock fighting hard for our republic.
[04:53.980 --> 04:54.980]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:54.980 --> 04:58.980]  This is the InfoWars.
[04:58.980 --> 05:06.980]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping store wide and double Patriot points.

[06:23.980 --> 06:35.980]  Well, two articles of impeachment have been introduced against the president of the United States and they're the two nebulous ones.
[06:35.980 --> 06:41.980]  Abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
[06:41.980 --> 06:48.980]  Abuse of power and obstructing Congress because they can't prove the Russia gate.
[06:48.980 --> 06:58.980]  They can't prove real obstruction of justice. They can't prove any quid pro quo with Ukraine, even though that's legal as long as the president is doing in the interest of the U.S.
[06:58.980 --> 07:00.980]  and not for his own interest.
[07:00.980 --> 07:07.980]  And they are just in full complete rampage mode for a reason.
[07:07.980 --> 07:09.980]  There's a reason, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:09.980 --> 07:27.980]  They have a plan once the Senate trial kicks off to bring forward a bunch of other fake, faux, synthetic crises and scandals coupled with civil unrest to push the president out.
[07:27.980 --> 07:31.980]  Now, so far we've been dead on predicting what they're going to do.
[07:31.980 --> 07:52.980]  Just a few months ago, oh, Alex is wrong. Pelosi doesn't have the nerve. She will never, ever, ever, ever be able to get the articles of impeachment through.
[07:52.980 --> 08:05.980]  They'll never actually have the vote because it's unpopular. Everything they're doing is unpopular.
[08:05.980 --> 08:17.980]  And they're saying they're going to have their full House vote next week, which of course will indict the president and go to the Senate.
[08:17.980 --> 08:24.980]  So we'll lay it all out today. I'm going to give the number out. I'm going to take your phone calls on this key issue.
[08:24.980 --> 08:30.980]  And what are we, as citizens, going to do to stop their plan tomorrow's news today?
[08:30.980 --> 08:42.980]  Now, here is the Republican leader of the House McCarthy just minutes ago, making his statement in response to what the Democrats have done. Here it is.
[08:42.980 --> 08:44.980]  Good morning.
[08:44.980 --> 08:50.980]  So back in 2016, the Democrats called those who supported Donald Trump deplorables.
[08:50.980 --> 08:54.980]  And now they're trying to disqualify their votes.
[08:54.980 --> 09:00.980]  Democrats still cannot get over the fact that the president won the election and they lost.
[09:00.980 --> 09:12.980]  Just last week at this podium, Nancy Pelosi went to point out they created a timeline to impeach President Trump that she said started two and a half years ago.
[09:12.980 --> 09:18.980]  Many of you know of this timeline because once they took the majority, they had to decide who would become chairs of their committee.
[09:18.980 --> 09:22.980]  The impeachment committee, the judiciary, who could win?
[09:22.980 --> 09:30.980]  Gary Nadler campaigned on that he would be the very strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.
[09:30.980 --> 09:37.980]  On the day of swearing in these new freshmen that gave them the majority a mere few hours after being sworn in,
[09:37.980 --> 09:42.980]  Congresswoman Tulli proclaimed we are going to impeach the mother.
[09:42.980 --> 09:50.980]  You had Al Green admitting that the Democrats have true fears that they do not impeach President Trump that he would win reelection.
[09:50.980 --> 09:56.980]  And now and today, we watched them introduce two articles of impeachment.
[09:56.980 --> 10:02.980]  They changed the course of Congress to take away due process for any point of where we are.
[10:02.980 --> 10:08.980]  It is a fear that Alexander Hamilton had to came to fruition in this Congress.
[10:08.980 --> 10:13.980]  I just hope no Congress ever repeats what we're going through today.
[10:13.980 --> 10:21.980]  They have a lot of members on their side very concerned because from the moment they started impeachment and letting the American public see what they believed
[10:21.980 --> 10:27.980]  and keep changing the term of what they thought was out there, it has been falling in the polls.
[10:27.980 --> 10:35.980]  If you need any more evidence of how unpopular impeachment is, watch the two press conferences today.
[10:35.980 --> 10:43.980]  After announcing impeachment within less than an hour, the speaker finally relented and said she would bring USMCA up.
[10:43.980 --> 10:48.980]  She has held it for more than a year, making America weaker in our negotiations with China.
[10:48.980 --> 10:54.980]  Our number one and number two trader in Mexico and Canada was being held up within our own agreement.
[10:54.980 --> 11:01.980]  But those who are vulnerable in this vote for impeachment continuing to make the argument as the rest of America was too.
[11:01.980 --> 11:05.980]  At no time when she would bring this bill up would there's ever fear of it not passing.
[11:05.980 --> 11:15.980]  But the only reason she would finally relented is because the unpopularity of impeachment itself.
[11:15.980 --> 11:23.980]  We watched in a hearing a Democrat constitutional scholar that did not vote for President Trump.
[11:23.980 --> 11:30.980]  Say this was the weakest, the thinnest, the fastest impeachment in the history of America.
[11:30.980 --> 11:37.980]  He then went to say if there was an abuse, it'd be abuse on the Democrats to move forward.
[11:37.980 --> 11:41.980]  The speaker must not have listened to that hearing.
[11:41.980 --> 11:51.980]  If the speaker had only waited 48 hours to release of the transcript, America would not be put through the nightmare.
[11:51.980 --> 12:01.980]  But the speaker would pause and read the IG report, the Inspector General, to thank in a place of America
[12:01.980 --> 12:09.980]  that we would have a law enforcement agency spy on a presidential campaign in more than 51 instances.
[12:09.980 --> 12:18.980]  Not hold up to the rule of law or change all the information and evidence to be able to move forward on something
[12:18.980 --> 12:25.980]  they knew or should have known was not true is a sad day for America.
[12:25.980 --> 12:34.980]  But to compound that with the idea just because you created a timeline to impeach a president that you disliked,
[12:34.980 --> 12:36.980]  you ignored facts.
[12:36.980 --> 12:41.980]  We would never be here if they paid attention to the facts or the hearings.
[12:41.980 --> 12:49.980]  This is not a day that America will be proud about. It's not a day that history will write that anybody wants to repeat.
[12:49.980 --> 12:59.980]  Alexander Hamilton warned us that this day would come, that a majority would use their political power just for politics.
[12:59.980 --> 13:06.980]  Even though we all raise our hands to uphold the Constitution.
[13:06.980 --> 13:14.980]  I just hope no Congress, no regardless who's in the majority, will ever take us down this path again.
[13:14.980 --> 13:24.980]  We have such great potential in this nation, but to have wasted a majority on this is an embarrassment to this Congress.
[13:24.980 --> 13:27.980]  Questions? Yes ma'am.
[13:27.980 --> 13:36.980]  Does it make it harder to defend the president when his personal attorney is still traveling to Ukraine investigating his campaign rivals
[13:36.980 --> 13:41.980]  and claims he wants to give some sort of presentation about it to Congress?
[13:41.980 --> 13:46.980]  It does not, it is not hard to defend this president surely on the facts of what's out there.
[13:46.980 --> 13:53.980]  I think it's hard for the Democrats to move forward when they start with a quick pro quo to bribery, to every other element they go.
[13:53.980 --> 14:00.980]  It's hard for the Democrats to continue this when the people they bring forth in their hearings are pretty much donors.
[14:00.980 --> 14:07.980]  Their expert witnesses when it comes to their scholars were donors to presidential campaigns.
[14:07.980 --> 14:08.980]  That's right.
[14:08.980 --> 14:12.980]  The idea that they're going to change the course of history that staff is going to interview.
[14:12.980 --> 14:19.980]  Alright folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, December 10, 2019 worldwide transmission.
[14:19.980 --> 14:23.980]  I intend to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour. That's in about 15 minutes.
[14:23.980 --> 14:32.980]  I'm going to give a number out now on the whitewash IG report that we predicted with total precision.
[14:32.980 --> 14:40.980]  We're going to walk through that. We're taking calls on that subject, the impeachment, the votes they've got to pass it by next week,
[14:40.980 --> 14:44.980]  and then into the trial in the Senate just for Christmas.
[14:44.980 --> 14:56.980]  And what type of tricks you think they're going to play during that period? I'm going to lay out what they're going to do next week, next month's news today for my research.
[14:56.980 --> 15:03.980]  And also, I'll ensure the answer, the people rising up peacefully and civil disobedience and shutting down these corrupt globalists.
[15:03.980 --> 15:05.980]  You better do it or we're going to lose everything we've got.
[15:05.980 --> 15:12.980]  It's all coming up. 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex.
[15:12.980 --> 15:16.980]  I want to give first-time callers, again, a chance in the first hour to get on board.
[15:16.980 --> 15:24.980]  It'll be open phones for everybody after that, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[15:24.980 --> 15:28.980]  And we'll be going right to your phone calls at the bottom of the hour.
[15:28.980 --> 15:36.980]  When we come back, we're going to look at the two articles, Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress.
[15:36.980 --> 15:41.980]  They said when he tweeted and called witnesses liars, which was true, that's illegal.
[15:41.980 --> 15:45.980]  Having his lawyer go around and find corruption is the Democrats. That's not allowed.
[15:45.980 --> 15:49.980]  Going after corruption is a crime and upside down world.
[15:49.980 --> 16:18.980]  I'm Alex Jones, Band.Video. They hate it when you share that link. Live feeds at Band.Video.
[16:20.980 --> 16:23.980]  Right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:23.980 --> 16:29.980]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:29.980 --> 16:35.980]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.

[17:59.980 --> 18:06.980]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech, actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago,
[18:06.980 --> 18:11.980]  and I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemfullwars.com.
[18:11.980 --> 18:16.980]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II the fact that there have been times in history
[18:16.980 --> 18:20.980]  where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[18:20.980 --> 18:26.980]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[18:26.980 --> 18:34.980]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[18:34.980 --> 18:41.980]  That's a paraphrase. But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit,
[18:41.980 --> 18:49.980]  find our focus, and don't give up and take action. But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[18:49.980 --> 18:58.980]  That's a fact. They fear infowars because we are alive. It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[18:58.980 --> 19:00.980]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[19:00.980 --> 19:07.980]  Hey, Alex, I love you, man. We love you. Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[19:07.980 --> 19:13.980]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[19:13.980 --> 19:20.980]  I used to have a problem with Adderall. I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[19:20.980 --> 19:24.980]  I kind of got a little out of hand and I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.980]  So I tried your TurboForce and really it's a cliche, this product changed my life, but TurboForce really changed my life.
[19:30.980 --> 19:37.980]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your TurboForce.
[19:37.980 --> 19:44.980]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[19:44.980 --> 19:50.980]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great TurboForce is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[19:50.980 --> 19:54.980]  We're really proud of TurboForce. So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[19:54.980 --> 20:21.980]  Then help us spread the word and let's just get busy at m4store.com.
[20:25.980 --> 20:37.980]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[20:37.980 --> 20:41.980]  Remember what Congress from McCarthy said, we're going to play the next segment.
[20:41.980 --> 20:50.980]  What law professor, liberal Obama voter Jonathan Turley said, the abuse of power, the illegal activity is by Congress.
[20:50.980 --> 20:58.980]  And he said, if you specifically take up the article that you're saying you are, he's a really smart guy.
[20:58.980 --> 21:09.980]  You could tell by their questioning of obstruction of Congress for Trump criticizing witnesses and Trump going to courts and trying to block your action.
[21:09.980 --> 21:15.980]  Congress and the executive, the legislative and the executive battle each other through the courts.
[21:15.980 --> 21:19.980]  They can also battle each other through legislation, executive orders.
[21:19.980 --> 21:22.980]  But that's what the president does.
[21:22.980 --> 21:28.980]  Other presidents have arrested members of Congress and, you know, spied on them.
[21:28.980 --> 21:33.980]  Imagine if Trump did that.
[21:33.980 --> 21:46.980]  Imagine if Trump got caught illegally spying on Congress, but that's what the Democrats did to Trump.
[21:46.980 --> 21:49.980]  And now that's what shifts done.
[21:49.980 --> 21:51.980]  They've been surveilling all these people.
[21:51.980 --> 21:56.980]  They just go get warrants later and parallel construct what they're doing.
[21:56.980 --> 22:01.980]  In live time, shifts spying on hundreds of members of the press, Congress, everybody.
[22:01.980 --> 22:03.980]  It's an incredible scandal.
[22:03.980 --> 22:10.980]  Now, remember, they opened up these espionage investigations of Trump and they opened criminal investigations up during the campaign.
[22:10.980 --> 22:20.980]  That's all admitted two years ago, the inspector general of the courts put out a report saying we were given false information for these warrants in hindsight.
[22:20.980 --> 22:23.980]  That got zero coverage except here on air, zero.
[22:23.980 --> 22:29.980]  William Benny got contacted by the White House and said, hey, you and others directed us at this.
[22:29.980 --> 22:31.980]  They can get the press to cover it.
[22:31.980 --> 22:38.980]  And Benny called up a bunch of people, including me and said, hey, certain people want this to get out there.
[22:38.980 --> 22:40.980]  And zero coverage.
[22:40.980 --> 22:42.980]  That's how control the corporate presses.
[22:42.980 --> 22:48.980]  They are in lockstep like North Korea when it comes to hoaxes and lies.
[22:48.980 --> 22:50.980]  And that's the biggest whopper out of all this.
[22:50.980 --> 22:54.980]  The IG report coming out beyond Nothing Burger.
[22:54.980 --> 22:57.980]  His Comey comes out and says, this exonerates me.
[22:57.980 --> 23:00.980]  No spying on the president happened.
[23:00.980 --> 23:01.980]  No spying on his campaign.
[23:01.980 --> 23:04.980]  He goes, no wiretaps.
[23:04.980 --> 23:07.980]  That's because they haven't called him that in court filings in 30 years.
[23:07.980 --> 23:09.980]  They don't put a wire on the phone line.
[23:09.980 --> 23:10.980]  It's data collection.
[23:10.980 --> 23:12.980]  They scoop it up digitally.
[23:12.980 --> 23:15.980]  But I've got his tweets and his quotes in the news.
[23:15.980 --> 23:17.980]  Boy, Trump was delusional.
[23:17.980 --> 23:20.980]  Nobody ever spied on him.
[23:20.980 --> 23:30.980]  That's like saying Clydesdales aren't horses or Budweiser in the beer or Tom Brady doesn't play with the Patriots.
[23:30.980 --> 23:40.980]  I mean, it's just a lie of a magnitude in your face that is beyond gaslighting.
[23:40.980 --> 23:42.980]  It's like saying, I'm not wearing a light blue shirt.
[23:42.980 --> 23:43.980]  It's a red shirt.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.980]  You're like, that's a light blue shirt.
[23:45.980 --> 23:47.980]  You're like, I'm not wearing a shirt, actually.
[23:47.980 --> 23:51.980]  You're crazy.
[23:51.980 --> 23:56.980]  Vanity Fair and more than 20 publications, I stayed up late last night reading all this,
[23:56.980 --> 24:07.980]  said that Owen Schreuer said that Trump said that Obama should be hung at the impeachment hearing.
[24:07.980 --> 24:11.980]  He never said any such thing.
[24:11.980 --> 24:16.980]  They then said he wore a tailored suit because he likes Nazis.
[24:16.980 --> 24:18.980]  I'm not kidding.
[24:18.980 --> 24:24.980]  In news publications with no link, this is next level.
[24:24.980 --> 24:30.980]  There it is, the impeachment protester was a wolf in a wool blend suit.
[24:30.980 --> 24:33.980]  But it wasn't just that.
[24:33.980 --> 24:41.980]  There were these headlines with man shouts hang President Obama in racist rant at impeachment hearing.
[24:41.980 --> 24:43.980]  He said no such thing.
[24:43.980 --> 24:46.980]  He didn't say anything about Obama.
[24:46.980 --> 24:48.980]  They don't care.
[24:48.980 --> 24:54.980]  And when you've got the media and everybody so willing to be criminal,
[24:54.980 --> 24:58.980]  it means that we have crossed the Rubicon and it means they're only going to get worse.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.980]  And the question is, how much are we going to put up with?
[25:00.980 --> 25:05.980]  Because it's just going to get more crazy.
[25:05.980 --> 25:11.980]  And there it is, M4's host called for Obama to be lynched, interrupts impeachment hearings.
[25:11.980 --> 25:13.980]  What the hell?
[25:13.980 --> 25:15.980]  That's salon.
[25:15.980 --> 25:18.980]  And you read it and they write it like he actually said it.
[25:18.980 --> 25:23.980]  Years ago out of context, he said, people say you get hung for treason.
[25:23.980 --> 25:25.980]  I'm not saying you hang Obama.
[25:25.980 --> 25:28.980]  That turns into, oh, he's a black guy, hang a black guy.
[25:28.980 --> 25:32.980]  Oh, you mean like the KKK.
[25:32.980 --> 25:34.980]  Again, it's just incredible.
[25:34.980 --> 25:40.980]  So lies based on lies, based on lies, and it just gets crazier and crazier.
[25:40.980 --> 25:45.980]  But the big one here is shift threatens press freedom, that's the Wall Street Journal,
[25:45.980 --> 25:50.980]  controversy of the spying on members of the press and Republicans that are on the committee.
[25:50.980 --> 25:52.980]  That's a conflict of interest.
[25:52.980 --> 25:55.980]  You can't do that.
[25:55.980 --> 25:58.980]  But shift won't even be called as a witness.
[25:58.980 --> 26:01.980]  He says, oh, and not in the House or the Senate, just I'm above the law.
[26:01.980 --> 26:06.980]  I'm God, you can't call me, but I'm spying on everyone illegally.
[26:06.980 --> 26:12.980]  Now a stack, Democrats unveil Trump impeachment charges.
[26:12.980 --> 26:18.980]  And then I've got all the stacks right here of Jonathan Turley was threatened and his dog was threatened.
[26:18.980 --> 26:23.980]  They threatened to kill his dog.
[26:23.980 --> 26:28.980]  And then now we've got proud of himself.
[26:28.980 --> 26:31.980]  Former FBI director.
[26:31.980 --> 26:37.980]  The lying giant, the leaker saying no one ever spot on the Trump campaign or Trump.
[26:37.980 --> 26:39.980]  The ID report doesn't even say that.
[26:39.980 --> 26:42.980]  It just says it was legitimate spying.
[26:42.980 --> 26:46.980]  Which of course it wasn't.
[26:46.980 --> 26:51.980]  He really got to pull back and ask yourself, what planet are these people from?
[26:51.980 --> 26:57.980]  Well, IG Horowitz sham report says FBI was biased in favor of Trump.
[26:57.980 --> 27:01.980]  This guy's definitely got some hood spa rights.
[27:01.980 --> 27:04.980]  Chris Minahan and information liberation.
[27:04.980 --> 27:09.980]  We're going to take your calls at 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539.
[27:09.980 --> 27:17.980]  We come back on the IG report on the ongoing impeachment on the tricks they're going to pull on what we're going to do to take action against it.
[27:17.980 --> 27:19.980]  What you're going to do, it's all coming up.
[27:19.980 --> 27:23.980]  Please don't forget that your purchases this Christmas season.
[27:23.980 --> 27:27.980]  M4warstore.com, get you great products, you don't have to fight the big lines, the traffic.
[27:27.980 --> 27:32.980]  You don't support these big box stores and big corporate outfits that almost to a company,
[27:32.980 --> 27:36.980]  literally have it out for you and your family, your children, your second amendment,
[27:36.980 --> 27:38.980]  and are totally globalist and occultic.
[27:38.980 --> 27:42.980]  Why in the hell would you spend money with the establishment when you go to M4warstore.com
[27:42.980 --> 27:48.980]  and keep this beacon of liberty and freedom and just game changing information warfare.
[27:48.980 --> 27:53.980]  It's scary being, you know, the most valuable operation in the fight against the new world order,
[27:53.980 --> 27:55.980]  but we got to stay in the game, folks.
[27:55.980 --> 27:59.980]  So we're offering the best deal ever on the real Red Pill Plus.
[27:59.980 --> 28:02.980]  It's got three different forms of natural, powerful energy in it,
[28:02.980 --> 28:08.980]  and regular Red Pill is what I take because I don't need the three forms of powerful energy that are in it.
[28:08.980 --> 28:13.980]  It has the preglonone that is the big game changer that they try to keep secret from you,
[28:13.980 --> 28:18.980]  and for a hundred years prescribing for people with things like arthritis and things.
[28:18.980 --> 28:20.980]  But it's over the counter.
[28:20.980 --> 28:22.980]  It's the base of all hormones in your body.
[28:22.980 --> 28:25.980]  As you get older, you have lower and lower levels of it.
[28:25.980 --> 28:30.980]  But whether you're playing football in high school or whether you're a 60-year-old, you know, janitor,
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.980]  or it doesn't matter, it's amazing.
[28:32.980 --> 28:35.980]  And with all the vitamins and minerals with it, it uploads even better.
[28:35.980 --> 28:41.980]  Real Red Pill Plus is 67% off at cost with a free bottle of bio tree selenium from the mustard seed
[28:41.980 --> 28:44.980]  that's critical for electrochemical activities in the body.
[28:44.980 --> 28:48.980]  These two products together are unbelievable at infowarstore.com.
[28:48.980 --> 28:50.980]  Did you hear what I just said?
[28:50.980 --> 28:54.980]  Pre-shipping, double-patriot points at cost with a free bottle of bio tree selenium.
[28:54.980 --> 29:23.980]  We're selling everything out.
[29:24.980 --> 29:50.980]  We're selling everything out.
[29:50.980 --> 30:01.980]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[30:01.980 --> 30:07.980]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us,
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.980]  poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[30:11.980 --> 30:18.980]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[30:18.980 --> 30:20.980]  We're being taken off the land.
[30:20.980 --> 30:26.980]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery
[30:26.980 --> 30:31.980]  until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[30:31.980 --> 30:35.980]  than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God,
[30:35.980 --> 30:39.980]  believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.980]  that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[30:44.980 --> 30:49.980]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[30:49.980 --> 30:51.980]  This is the post-human error.
[30:51.980 --> 30:53.980]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[30:53.980 --> 30:55.980]  This is the crossroads.
[30:55.980 --> 30:57.980]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[30:57.980 --> 31:02.980]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[31:02.980 --> 31:09.980]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[31:09.980 --> 31:14.980]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[31:14.980 --> 31:19.980]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[31:19.980 --> 31:23.980]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[31:23.980 --> 31:26.980]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[31:26.980 --> 31:29.980]  and they do what they do because they're slaves
[31:29.980 --> 31:35.980]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[31:35.980 --> 31:39.980]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[31:39.980 --> 31:45.980]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[31:45.980 --> 31:47.980]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[31:47.980 --> 31:50.980]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[31:50.980 --> 31:53.980]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[31:53.980 --> 31:57.980]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[31:57.980 --> 32:05.980]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to info wars with free shipping store-wide and double patria points.

[33:19.980 --> 33:21.980]  Well, so does he.
[33:21.980 --> 33:26.980]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.980 --> 33:41.980]  If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime in misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.
[33:41.980 --> 33:44.980]  It's your abuse of power.
[33:44.980 --> 33:48.980]  You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the president for doing.
[33:48.980 --> 33:58.980]  You're saying article one gives us complete authority that when we demand information from another branch, it must be turned over or will impeach you in record time.
[33:58.980 --> 34:03.980]  Now, making that worse is that you have such a short investigation.
[34:03.980 --> 34:05.980]  It's a perfect storm.
[34:05.980 --> 34:13.980]  You set an incredibly short period, demand a huge amount of information, and when the president goes to court, you then impeach him.
[34:13.980 --> 34:18.980]  Now, does that track with what you've heard about impeachment?
[34:18.980 --> 34:22.980]  Does that track with the rule of law that we talked about?
[34:22.980 --> 34:27.980]  So on obstruction, I would encourage you to think about this.
[34:27.980 --> 34:33.980]  In Nixon, it did go to the courts and Nixon lost.
[34:33.980 --> 34:36.980]  And that was the reason Nixon resigned.
[34:36.980 --> 34:41.980]  He resigned a few days after the Supreme Court ruled against.
[34:41.980 --> 34:44.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[34:44.980 --> 34:53.980]  This is the info or we are broadcasting worldwide on this December 10, 2019 worldwide broadcast.
[34:53.980 --> 34:55.980]  And I'm shaking the broadcast up.
[34:55.980 --> 35:04.980]  I'm going to your phone calls right here in the middle of the first hour, as promised, because when I listen to rebroadcast, I love it when I'm taking calls.
[35:04.980 --> 35:10.980]  I love it when I got a good guest on and I really just gauge the broadcast according to what I like to hear and what I like to tune into.
[35:10.980 --> 35:13.980]  So I want to get right into your calls coming up.
[35:13.980 --> 35:15.980]  Lou Dobbs calls it a whitewash.
[35:15.980 --> 35:17.980]  The IG report, I totally agree with him.
[35:17.980 --> 35:18.980]  It's beyond a whitewash.
[35:18.980 --> 35:20.980]  It's a travesty.
[35:20.980 --> 35:23.980]  And then I've got this little juicy piece of news.
[35:23.980 --> 35:29.980]  IG Horowitz, sham reports his FBI was biased in favor of Trump.
[35:29.980 --> 35:33.980]  That's what the Obama appointed official did, the so-called watchdog.
[35:33.980 --> 35:34.980]  What a joke.
[35:34.980 --> 35:35.980]  Everybody needs to wait.
[35:35.980 --> 35:37.980]  Horowitz is going to get him.
[35:37.980 --> 35:41.980]  And here's Comey tweeting, so it was all lies.
[35:41.980 --> 35:42.980]  No treason.
[35:42.980 --> 35:43.980]  No spying on the campaign.
[35:43.980 --> 35:44.980]  No tapping Trump.
[35:44.980 --> 35:45.980]  Wires.
[35:45.980 --> 35:47.980]  See, technically, there's no wires.
[35:47.980 --> 35:48.980]  Now it's digital.
[35:48.980 --> 35:51.980]  It was just good people trying to protect America.
[35:51.980 --> 35:56.980]  Well, even Horowitz admits they were spying on him and using digital collection.
[35:56.980 --> 35:59.980]  But there's no wires.
[35:59.980 --> 36:02.980]  See that legalese, how criminal that is?
[36:02.980 --> 36:04.980]  That he thinks you're so stupid.
[36:04.980 --> 36:06.980]  He says that to you.
[36:06.980 --> 36:09.980]  And they go on.
[36:09.980 --> 36:11.980]  James Comey, the truth is finally out.
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.980]  The FBI fulfilled its mission.
[36:13.980 --> 36:17.980]  There was no spying, even though it's admitted spying.
[36:17.980 --> 36:19.980]  The IG report says, oh, it was legitimate.
[36:19.980 --> 36:23.980]  Just a few people went too far and didn't follow all the rules.
[36:23.980 --> 36:25.980]  Wow.
[36:25.980 --> 36:35.980]  And the average person now will actually believe that watches mainstream media, that no one was ever spied on.
[36:35.980 --> 36:45.980]  Even though they've been spying on members of Congress during the impeachment who are on the committee and spying on the press.
[36:45.980 --> 36:48.980]  Think about that.
[36:48.980 --> 36:54.980]  So that they know the strategies of the Republicans with the press and what the Republicans are going to say before they say it.
[36:54.980 --> 36:56.980]  Because who are the Republicans going to talk to?
[36:56.980 --> 36:58.980]  They're going to talk to the press.
[36:58.980 --> 37:02.980]  We learned it's Sean Hannity.
[37:02.980 --> 37:03.980]  Who else are they spying on?
[37:03.980 --> 37:06.980]  You know, it's Tucker Carlson.
[37:06.980 --> 37:08.980]  People like Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[37:08.980 --> 37:12.980]  Everybody's getting spied on.
[37:12.980 --> 37:14.980]  And they know who do we talk to?
[37:14.980 --> 37:18.980]  Well, we talk to reporters off record.
[37:18.980 --> 37:28.980]  And so these criminals are doing this and they think we're all stupid and aren't aware of it.
[37:28.980 --> 37:37.980]  I don't come up here and say, hey, I told you the IG report would be a total beyond whitewash.
[37:37.980 --> 37:42.980]  A prophylactic for the deep state to cover up to demoralize you.
[37:42.980 --> 37:50.980]  I told you when I was right again, because we need to stop being delusional about what we're facing.
[37:50.980 --> 38:00.980]  If you think you can climb a 10,000 foot mountain when you can't even climb a set of stairs because you have an exercise in 20 years and you're 100 pounds overweight,
[38:00.980 --> 38:04.980]  you're not going to go sign up for a mountaineering event and scale the mountain.
[38:04.980 --> 38:09.980]  You need to be honest about it.
[38:09.980 --> 38:16.980]  That's my allegory or analogy or parable or parallel.
[38:16.980 --> 38:19.980]  I want to kick ass.
[38:19.980 --> 38:20.980]  I want to change the world.
[38:20.980 --> 38:23.980]  I want my children to live in a free world and I want yours too as well.
[38:23.980 --> 38:26.980]  I believe in you.
[38:26.980 --> 38:34.980]  And I've learned how these globalists rope a dope and how they manipulate us.
[38:34.980 --> 38:36.980]  And I don't want to lose.
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.980]  We can win very easily.
[38:38.980 --> 38:44.980]  But it's going to take the type of action you saw with Owen Troyer yesterday that was one of the biggest stories in the world and resonated with people.
[38:44.980 --> 38:45.980]  So they ridiculed him.
[38:45.980 --> 38:46.980]  They lied about him.
[38:46.980 --> 38:47.980]  They attacked him.
[38:47.980 --> 38:50.980]  And he platformed to hear everybody else's cowards.
[38:50.980 --> 38:54.980]  And if you see those attacks, you'll think, oh, I better not speak up.
[38:54.980 --> 38:55.980]  You want those attacks.
[38:55.980 --> 39:05.980]  Those are the red badge of courage to have these criminals and scumbags and liars at the New York Times attack you.
[39:05.980 --> 39:13.980]  Don't you know the Times of London attack George Washington in 1776?
[39:13.980 --> 39:31.980]  This is the blood of courage and what America is to not just charge machine gun nest, but the moral courage that historians have found is even more rare to stand against lies and demonization from the establishment to go against the headwind straight in.
[39:31.980 --> 39:33.980]  Because you know it's the right thing to do.
[39:33.980 --> 39:36.980]  That's the essence of leadership.
[39:36.980 --> 39:39.980]  And so many people are thinking, oh, I'm saying we really appreciate what you did.
[39:39.980 --> 39:41.980]  Great job.
[39:41.980 --> 39:45.980]  Well, all of you need to go to Congress.
[39:45.980 --> 39:48.980]  All of you need to protest outside.
[39:48.980 --> 39:50.980]  They have the mall like fly papers.
[39:50.980 --> 39:52.980]  So you go there and no one ever covers what you're doing.
[39:52.980 --> 40:06.980]  Go jump in front of the news cameras, go to the press scrums, go bullhorn outside, go to the rallies, go to the Democrat events, go to the sporting events and legally and lawfully take them over.
[40:06.980 --> 40:14.980]  It's just like we did in 2016, they wanted to soft the air so we couldn't be an inspiration, but we're still here.
[40:14.980 --> 40:24.980]  But I got to tell you, I'm not ready to reveal this at this point, but the dirty tricks and the criminality and the corruption and the sabotage behind the scenes.
[40:24.980 --> 40:34.980]  Is what you'd expect from this deep state, trying to take back America that they thought they had their foot on the neck of.
[40:34.980 --> 40:40.980]  Lauren and Bobby and Tyler and David and Bob and Andrea and Russell and Luke and Brandon, I'm going to go to all of you.
[40:40.980 --> 40:44.980]  I'm going to take a ton of calls today and we're going to look at every angle of this.
[40:44.980 --> 40:51.980]  But if you think Comey can get up there all over the news, he's all over TV and say we're exonerated.
[40:51.980 --> 40:54.980]  No crime, no spying, Trump made it up.
[40:54.980 --> 41:03.980]  He's saying there wasn't even an investigation when the IG report just says it was legitimate.
[41:03.980 --> 41:12.980]  That insult to you, if not met back with a response is literally pissing in your face.
[41:12.980 --> 41:20.980]  And they do it on purpose to teach you to sit there and to piss on you and to tell you it's raining.
[41:20.980 --> 41:22.980]  Are you angry about that?
[41:22.980 --> 41:24.980]  Are you upset about that?
[41:24.980 --> 41:29.980]  I'm going to say this and I'm not going to reveal some of the stuff going on for strategic reasons, but I'll just tell you this.
[41:29.980 --> 41:34.980]  You want to see this operation that is the number one game changer out there. Thanks for your support.
[41:34.980 --> 41:36.980]  Continue in the future.
[41:36.980 --> 41:42.980]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on and I'm working 18 hours a day because I don't want to lose.
[41:42.980 --> 41:46.980]  Because the innocents want us and demand that we stand up for them.
[41:46.980 --> 41:48.980]  God demands we stand up.
[41:48.980 --> 41:55.980]  God is going to stand up for all these children and other people that are being abused through men and women that stand up and take action.
[41:55.980 --> 42:02.980]  You have got to answer the prayers to God. God works through men and women.
[42:02.980 --> 42:18.980]  So I need your prayers and I need you to go, hey, I'm going to do my Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com with air filters and water filters and non-GMO heirloom seeds and t-shirts and books and films and every order gets tons of free bumper stickers to get the word out.
[42:18.980 --> 42:29.980]  And I'm going to get the krill oil that's back in stock and I'm going to try the protein bars and I'm going to get the brand force in and I'm going to get the biotrase selenium and I'm going to get the real red pill plus and experience it
[42:29.980 --> 42:39.980]  and fund us because I need a lot of money to launch new projects that they're not going to be able to shut down or stop and I'm going to leave it at that.
[42:39.980 --> 42:49.980]  Okay? In any war, ladies and gentlemen, what's the answer? Have more weapons systems in orbit and we are building new death stars.
[42:49.980 --> 42:56.980]  This one's under attack. We're building new death stars. Just know that. I need capital to complete their construction.
[42:56.980 --> 43:09.980]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot points. Don't shop with Amazon or other big tech companies that hate your guts.

[43:57.980 --> 44:18.980]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[44:18.980 --> 44:35.980]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[44:35.980 --> 44:50.980]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us. This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error.
[44:50.980 --> 44:57.980]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[44:57.980 --> 45:14.980]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually. There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[45:14.980 --> 45:32.980]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see,
[45:32.980 --> 45:48.980]  you see, we have to make the effort. 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists. And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[45:48.980 --> 45:58.980]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together. InfowarsStore.com.
[45:58.980 --> 46:17.980]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year. But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[46:17.980 --> 46:31.980]  There is no one formula that you're going to find out there that is more game-changing. It's 65% off right now. That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling Biotru Selenium for the mustard seed.
[46:31.980 --> 46:50.980]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy, your focus, your entire body. The globalists know about this, but have been suppressing it. Take advantage of it now, the Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus combo with Biotru Selenium at InfowarsStore.com and help yourself, your family and the Infowar.
[46:50.980 --> 47:00.980]  Again, do your Christmas shopping for yourself and your family. You need to try the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Biotru Selenium for yourselves.
[47:00.980 --> 47:09.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.980 --> 47:26.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:26.980 --> 47:31.980]  We're going to stay on the air. We're going to continue the transmission out.
[47:31.980 --> 47:42.980]  Too critical. As the total censorship increases, multimedia institutions that are left standing will be beyond critical.
[47:42.980 --> 47:49.980]  Unfortunately, the NRA has shut down their multimedia operation crippled by infiltrators.
[47:49.980 --> 48:00.980]  I can't tell you all of it because I was told in confidence, but it's bad. They're storming everything. You imagine being the president totally surrounded by criminals.
[48:00.980 --> 48:11.980]  We have some good members of Congress and that's it. Some good people in the military. But the lawyer governing class are the scum of the earth and true cowards.
[48:11.980 --> 48:20.980]  It is their dishonor itself that empowers them because they love being pieces of crap and backstabbing weasels and have no honor in them.
[48:20.980 --> 48:27.980]  So they attack those that do have honor because they understand it's an existential threat to their system.
[48:27.980 --> 48:33.980]  Trump surges in battleground states as Dems push impeachment. And it's true, even in the fake polls he's way up.
[48:33.980 --> 48:46.980]  But we're 328 days out and they're planning false flag events to blend the president. It'll be white supremacists attacking Jewish centers, black community areas.
[48:46.980 --> 48:52.980]  You know, they're gearing it all up. They've done it before. They'll do it again.
[48:52.980 --> 49:01.980]  They're preparing all sorts of economic collapse, all sorts of military crises, but they're going to bring forward women that say Trump raped them.
[49:01.980 --> 49:04.980]  They're going to replay every card they've done that's failed. They don't care.
[49:04.980 --> 49:13.980]  They're going to pile on during the Senate trial with all these giant scandals to have senators go, well, these are the articles we have.
[49:13.980 --> 49:18.980]  And I'm going to go ahead and vote for it because we just got to get him out of here.
[49:18.980 --> 49:26.980]  It's too big a crisis with the civil unrest that will then be triggered by the stay behind networks in the State Department and the CIA run by Soros and the Clintons.
[49:26.980 --> 49:39.980]  And I told you Hillary's waiting in the wings like a mentally retarded vampire bat and will swoop in with this weak field she put in to take over at the last minute.
[49:39.980 --> 49:45.980]  You notice she's number one in the polls now. Biden was never meant to be there. He's a placeholder.
[49:45.980 --> 49:51.980]  All the other candidates are stepping back for her when the big goblin comes into the room. They're like, oh, your lordship.
[49:51.980 --> 49:58.980]  And then she's waiting for them to wound Trump enough and then they'll have some placeholder Republicans she runs against.
[49:58.980 --> 50:01.980]  That's her dream. Doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[50:01.980 --> 50:06.980]  But if we aren't aware of their plans, they're going to win.
[50:06.980 --> 50:11.980]  And I'm not going to stand here and watch it.
[50:11.980 --> 50:18.980]  So we have to turn our will against the enemy.
[50:18.980 --> 50:27.980]  And if you'll simply stop believing delusions and tune into reality and ask God to give you guidance, believe me, you will be given it.
[50:27.980 --> 50:31.980]  I was driving to work this morning and my sight is so clear now.
[50:31.980 --> 50:37.980]  My consciousness is so on that it was just spectacularly beautiful in the rain.
[50:37.980 --> 50:39.980]  And we've all had those experiences in life.
[50:39.980 --> 50:46.980]  But I'm like that all the time now, ladies and gentlemen, because I'm challenging evil and I'm asking God to come into me even stronger.
[50:46.980 --> 50:50.980]  And it's incredible the empowerment and all the statistics show it.
[50:50.980 --> 50:57.980]  Christians are richer, stronger, better looking, live longer, are more empowered because Jesus is real.
[50:57.980 --> 51:01.980]  Our God is real. The life force is real.
[51:01.980 --> 51:05.980]  We want to empower children, not deform them and rape them.
[51:05.980 --> 51:08.980]  I said, I take your calls, I will.
[51:08.980 --> 51:14.980]  But God's spirit is coming into the world really strong right now because the enemy is coming into the world.
[51:14.980 --> 51:18.980]  And God always matches that.
[51:18.980 --> 51:25.980]  And when the devil starts cheating and really playing dirty tricks, God's going to remove the controls on his people.
[51:25.980 --> 51:32.980]  And we are going to have incredible power that has not been seen in thousands of years.
[51:32.980 --> 51:36.980]  It's going to be on, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:36.980 --> 51:41.980]  I don't know about you, but I just want to keep following the path I'm on with a relationship with God.
[51:41.980 --> 51:46.980]  It's unbelievable.
[51:46.980 --> 51:50.980]  Thank God I'm not a Satanist. Thank God I didn't get tricked into that crap.
[51:50.980 --> 51:55.980]  Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[51:55.980 --> 52:05.980]  I just pray to God to not give me strength and power that I can't handle because let me tell you, it's unbelievable to stare into the universe and begin to have discernment at this level.
[52:05.980 --> 52:11.980]  And that's why the enemy hates Christians and wants us wiped off the face of Europe because they can't carry out their plan till we're gone.
[52:11.980 --> 52:24.980]  They have to sabotage our genetics, sabotage our spirit, sabotage our code because you can't fix something that isn't broken.
[52:24.980 --> 52:27.980]  The only thing that's fallen is that we're able to interface with evil.
[52:27.980 --> 52:37.980]  It didn't mean that Adam and the archetype didn't know what evil was. It was that it wasn't infected with it.
[52:37.980 --> 52:44.980]  We were immune to it. We were that straight and strong. But once evil systems start, they train you to depend on it.
[52:44.980 --> 52:49.980]  And you become weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker. That's how evil works as a binary spiritual weapon.
[52:49.980 --> 52:54.980]  I'm going to stop now. I'm going to go to your calls.
[52:54.980 --> 53:01.980]  The innocents cry out to God as they're being tortured. Can you not hear them?
[53:01.980 --> 53:05.980]  How are they going to try to take Trump out because they're making their move? This is all a deep state coup. It's all admitted now.
[53:05.980 --> 53:10.980]  It's all out of the open, you see. What are you going to do? What are they going to do?
[53:10.980 --> 53:16.980]  Joe in Louisiana, thanks for holding. Thanks for calling. I really appreciate you. What do you think is coming next?
[53:16.980 --> 53:36.980]  I wouldn't be surprised if a false flag would be executed to distract and just like a circus magician, redirect your attention to this hand over here while something else is going on on the other.
[53:36.980 --> 53:42.980]  I totally agree with you. In fact, you were on the board before I brought up false flags. That's what you wanted to get into.
[53:42.980 --> 53:50.980]  We're entering the season of false flags to prop up the House of Cards.
[53:50.980 --> 54:00.980]  That's all they got. How many lives can you commit before it just blows up in your face?
[54:00.980 --> 54:06.980]  They've got to have something extraordinary for people to look at and say, oh my, let's do something. Let's do something.
[54:06.980 --> 54:14.980]  And the government be the savior of the world. How do we counter that? You're not supposed to question public events, but so many of them are states.
[54:14.980 --> 54:22.980]  Some of them are fake and they get caught constantly. How do we get out ahead of that?
[54:22.980 --> 54:36.980]  Well, it's called wisdom and wisdom comes from above. The wisdom of this world is foolishness. The only wisdom that is eternal comes from God.
[54:36.980 --> 54:44.980]  And I don't see that happening with them. Those that are wanting to take over this world with the prince of this world.
[54:44.980 --> 54:55.980]  I was about to say they've been given all the money and all the power and all the mechanisms, but notice how they're getting uglier and stupider and dumber and making more mistakes and just flopping around like fish out of water.
[54:55.980 --> 54:59.980]  Look at the wages of their master. Look at what they're turning into.
[54:59.980 --> 55:06.980]  Exactly. Tell my wife the other day, I read the last chapter of the book.
[55:06.980 --> 55:13.980]  Those that have their trust in the Lord, they know how the outcome is going to end up.
[55:13.980 --> 55:18.980]  And they're the ones that's scratching for every bit of ground that they can possibly get.
[55:18.980 --> 55:23.980]  And they're being deceived thinking that they're going to win.
[55:23.980 --> 55:30.980]  I agree. And the final part of the equation is we have to spread the word because the beast will make war against the saints and overcome us.
[55:30.980 --> 55:36.980]  But only in the first half, in the second half, we win and people have to be ready.
[55:36.980 --> 55:41.980]  The churches that tell folks, oh, it's going to be great. You'll get beamed out of here like Star Trek before all happens.
[55:41.980 --> 55:45.980]  That's not in the Bible. It's not going to happen. Don't be deceived. That's what Christ said.
[55:45.980 --> 55:53.980]  You know, be very careful and read the Bible and have discernment because even the elect, if it was possible, would be deceived.
[55:53.980 --> 55:58.980]  And, you know, you really can't get deceived on the big issues if you've got God in you. It's an absolute fact.
[55:58.980 --> 56:00.980]  God bless you, sir. I appreciate the call, Joe.
[56:00.980 --> 56:04.980]  Lauren in Massachusetts, you're on the air. Lauren, thanks for calling today.
[56:04.980 --> 56:08.980]  Oh, Alex, my captain, my captain. So good to hear from you finally.
[56:08.980 --> 56:12.980]  Thank you for calling. Thank you for having me.
[56:12.980 --> 56:17.980]  So, listen, the pendulum always swings back. They are exposed now.
[56:17.980 --> 56:23.980]  We see their Luciferian system for what it is, Natala, Pelosi, all these people.
[56:23.980 --> 56:26.980]  We know their names. We know they're the scum of the earth.
[56:26.980 --> 56:33.980]  And I know good names like Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan and the good people that are trying to help us.
[56:33.980 --> 56:40.980]  So who cares what they have planned? Who cares what they, their big, globalist operation to get us? Who cares?
[56:40.980 --> 56:48.980]  They're exposed to the light and sunlight is the best disinfectant. We have them, sir. We have them.
[56:48.980 --> 56:51.980]  Lauren, but why doesn't Communist China ever get out from under it?
[56:51.980 --> 56:56.980]  I agree that we've had providence and the West has had providence because of Christianity.
[56:56.980 --> 57:03.980]  The West was not doing anything, but literally mainly living in caves and stuff until we got Christ. Then we took off.
[57:03.980 --> 57:09.980]  IQ and all of it didn't do it. It took that final equation of Christianity and of God.
[57:09.980 --> 57:14.980]  But so, yes, yes, everything they do to up, but only because we still have Christians in this nation.
[57:14.980 --> 57:18.980]  That's why they're trying to eradicate it and lower that hedge of protection.
[57:18.980 --> 57:24.980]  You can't have communism without Satanism. It's an ism. It's an evil practice that will not prevail.
[57:24.980 --> 57:29.980]  And the only reason it survives in China is because China was an imperial nation.
[57:29.980 --> 57:32.980]  And I think imperialism got mixed up with China.
[57:32.980 --> 57:36.980]  Stay there, Lauren. Listen how smart our listeners are. I'm going to come right back and get more of your wisdom.
[57:36.980 --> 57:40.980]  And then we're going to everybody else. I'm taking a ton of calls next hour. I'm wound up and ready.

[1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:16.980]  Oh, there's definitely a war on for your mind, your body, your soul. We're talking to Lauren and Mass.
[1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:22.980]  I agree that this isn't going well for them in the house. They're going to pass it. It's going to go in the Senate.
[1:00:22.980 --> 1:00:25.980]  But the dirty tricks they're going to pull, we need to be aware of those.
[1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:30.980]  I mean, what are we going to do if say a black college gets attacked and 300 poor black people get killed?
[1:00:30.980 --> 1:00:35.980]  And it's some guy running around saying, I love Trump. I love Trump. I mean, you know, they've got that wound up.
[1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:40.980]  You know, the deep state's trying to pull that. So they've got some serious wall cards up their sleeves.
[1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:45.980]  I think that you are unaware that something is happening in the nation.
[1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:54.980]  I live in Riviera, Massachusetts, one of the most mixed places in the country, Muslims, Latinos, Chinese, very mixed.
[1:00:54.980 --> 1:01:00.980]  I mean, I walk around with my influence, Trump, Pence shirt. I don't care. I am who I am.
[1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:10.980]  And people know what's up, sir. People understand what's happening that they have pay indicted him on the most ridiculous.
[1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:17.980]  What was that? He didn't do what we told him to do. Are you kidding me? He's the president with unlimited power.
[1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:21.980]  Well, unlimited separation of powers unless he commits a crime against the people.
[1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:28.980]  And then they'd have a real reason. Exactly. But executing his office faithfully, he is allowed to keep whatever he wants away from Congress.
[1:01:28.980 --> 1:01:32.980]  And the idea that he doesn't submit to them is totally true. God bless you. And I appreciate your call.
[1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:37.980]  Yeah, I went down to the Christmas tree to shoot some videos. It was mainly Hispanic Americans, but a lot of folks didn't speak English.
[1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:40.980]  It looked like they weren't from here. They were all the ones going, Merry Christmas.
[1:01:40.980 --> 1:01:45.980]  And yeah, you're right. And broken English saying, yes, war on Christmas. We know about it. War on the family.
[1:01:45.980 --> 1:01:51.980]  So yeah, the globalists are losing, trying to turn all the minorities into racist idiots. It's not working. It's why they're panicking.
[1:01:51.980 --> 1:01:57.980]  Let's take another call here. Let's go ahead. Who's been holding the longest here?
[1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:03.980]  Let's take a call from Andre in New York. You're on the air. Andre, thanks for calling.
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:08.980]  Hi, Alex. Hi, welcome. Hi. Hi, Andrea.
[1:02:08.980 --> 1:02:11.980]  Andrea, I'm sorry. I read your name wrong. I'm a dummy.
[1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:12.980]  That's okay.
[1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:17.980]  That's a very pretty name. Sorry. Thanks. That's okay. First of all, I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[1:02:17.980 --> 1:02:23.980]  And I commend Owen Troyer for yesterday. I thought that he was very brave in what he did.
[1:02:23.980 --> 1:02:33.980]  I'm calling from New York. Okay. I live in a suburb outside of New York. I'm a woman. I'm a suburban woman.
[1:02:33.980 --> 1:02:40.980]  And I want to tell you that what you are promoting around the country is great, but there's a problem in New York.
[1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:46.980]  Now, we all grew up with Trump. We all know Trump's background before he became president.
[1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:54.980]  There are a lot of people that love him, including Jerry Nadler, that loved him before he became president, was asking him for money.
[1:02:54.980 --> 1:03:03.980]  We know the backstory of his life. However, my problem is, is I want to get involved in what you are telling the guests to do.
[1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:12.980]  But I have a problem. I work in New York City. There was one incident where I was walking to a client. I was in a building.
[1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:19.980]  There was this crazy lady screaming and yelling and carrying on about something that happened with the abortion or whatever.
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:29.980]  And she turned to me and she said to me, and what do you think? And I learned that I have to keep my mouth shut because if I don't, it will attack us.
[1:03:29.980 --> 1:03:36.980]  I know a bunch of people that have been attacked. No, no, you're right. The left, the governor, instead of Christians and conservatives and gun owners and pro-liberists should get out of the state.
[1:03:36.980 --> 1:03:45.980]  So you're saying if you speak out, you'll be fired, you'll be physically attacked. You're living in a Soviet nightmare and you're letting other Americans know that New York's not free right now?
[1:03:45.980 --> 1:03:55.980]  No, New York is not free. So I didn't say nothing. I couldn't. I didn't have any garbond or anything which I would love to wear.
[1:03:55.980 --> 1:04:00.980]  I love to wear your t-shirt. I love to wear everything with Trump by keychain, but that's about it.
[1:04:00.980 --> 1:04:10.980]  But you're living under such a Soviet tyranny that you can't do it. I mean, listen, I know in blue areas like of Austin, they will physically attack you if you're wearing a Trump shirt or an M4 shirt.
[1:04:10.980 --> 1:04:19.980]  And I understand and I go out as a man and do it as an exercise of free speech and as a stunt. And it shows us how far we've gotten, how far we've gone down.
[1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:28.980]  Right. And what I'm trying to say is that I wanted to finish the story. So she's yelling at me and I said, I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't know what you're talking about.
[1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:38.980]  I proceed to go in the elevator. It was totally packed. She turns around to me and she says to me, you're one of those. You listen to the guy with the tin hat.
[1:04:38.980 --> 1:04:45.980]  I swear. She said that. I said, I don't know what you're talking about. Screaming, yelling, trying. I said, get away from me.
[1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:51.980]  Hold on. Listen, Gerald Salante's popping in and we'll go back to calls, but don't hang up, Andrea. I want to hear this story.
[1:04:51.980 --> 1:04:56.980]  Oh, yeah. I'm the archetype of the devil now, these people with all these shows, homeland.
[1:04:56.980 --> 1:05:09.980]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival and we're war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence that's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families,
[1:05:09.980 --> 1:05:14.980]  trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:25.980]  Well, info wars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[1:05:25.980 --> 1:05:32.980]  That's why we're running giant cyber week specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:38.980]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:47.980]  Don't do your shopping with the new world order. Amazon, do it with info war store, get high quality supplements, get high quality air filtration, water filtration,
[1:05:47.980 --> 1:05:52.980]  Patriot apparel and so much more in every order. It's a whole bunch of free info wars.
[1:05:52.980 --> 1:05:55.980]  Bumper stickers to spread the word. Take action, folks.
[1:05:55.980 --> 1:06:15.980]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.980 --> 1:06:25.980]  Jim's charts trump with abuse of power obstruction of Congress not submitting to them.
[1:06:25.980 --> 1:06:31.980]  Gerald Salente trends forecasters got his list of trends for 2020 coming out today. We'll be talking to him in a moment.
[1:06:31.980 --> 1:06:43.980]  We'll continue on with phone calls. Dave, Tyler, Bobby, Dennis, Danny, Bart, Ryan, Tyler, Gordon calls from Hawaii to Washington from Arizona to Virginia from Oregon to Pennsylvania.
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:49.980]  I'll be taking your calls. I want to finish up with Andrea in New York.
[1:06:49.980 --> 1:06:54.980]  If you just joined us, she was talking about in New York, you get fired from your job.
[1:06:54.980 --> 1:07:02.980]  If you support Trump or Americana or the trade war against China that Pelosi's been trying to help China block Trump on.
[1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:08.980]  And she said that this woman was yelling and screaming about people that weren't for abortion.
[1:07:08.980 --> 1:07:15.980]  And then she wouldn't say anything to the woman. The woman got on the elevator with her and said, oh, you listen to that tinfoil hat guy on the Internet.
[1:07:15.980 --> 1:07:24.980]  That's what I'm called by these people. So she was finishing up the story about they're so looking for enemies now that they will target you.
[1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:31.980]  Devin Nunes was on Fox this morning. He talked about he was in New York yesterday before he flew back to DC to be on Fox News.
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:37.980]  He said in his hotel, a man with what looked like grandchildren came up and said, we're going to get you Russian agent.
[1:07:37.980 --> 1:07:41.980]  And that's what happens to me. They go, we're going to kill you. We're going to put you in prison.
[1:07:41.980 --> 1:07:47.980]  You're a Russian agent. You're a white supremacist. They do this. So finish up your story, ma'am, please.
[1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:56.980]  Yeah. So anyway, so I kept my mouth shut and she was trying to get in my face and it was very crowded and the people looked very nervous.
[1:07:56.980 --> 1:08:01.980]  Nobody was sticking up for me or even going with her.
[1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:10.980]  So I said, get out of my face. I said, I'm not going to get into an encounter with you. And she says, and she starts telling me, what are you doing?
[1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:16.980]  You're a body and, and, and, and you know what he is and all, you know, talking about you and talking about President Trump.
[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:24.980]  So as she gets out of the elevator and the doors halfway closed, I turned to her and I said, you're lucky I didn't take your hair and knock you out.
[1:08:24.980 --> 1:08:37.980]  But that's all I can do. I, I hear or I get from President Trump and, and Melania Trump and all through the mail asking me to represent my district.
[1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:43.980]  I'm afraid to do that. I'm afraid to speak up. So I feel like I'm living in.
[1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:55.980]  So I understand and Jonathan Turley, the liberal constitutional lawyer who voted for Obama and, and, and who voted for Hillary, he's now getting death threats and so is his dog.
[1:08:55.980 --> 1:09:04.980]  And then the national news station reset it, took the video offline. And I've got that article on info wars.com, but only the text because the video has been taken down.
[1:09:04.980 --> 1:09:11.980]  Jonathan Turley, then they threatened my dog for defending Trump and impeachment hearings when all he was doing was defending the rule of law.
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:20.980]  So God bless you, Andrea. You're calling into radio. You're speaking out. You can do things online. You can covertly put up info or stickers that are free in every order.
[1:09:20.980 --> 1:09:28.980]  But yes, I understand that's why I wanted to have you on and hold you over. So Gerald Salente, before he gets to these trends, he's just popping in briefly.
[1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:33.980]  I really appreciate him being on with us today, just giving us a boil down of what's coming out in his new trends journal for the year.
[1:09:33.980 --> 1:09:42.980]  His big one. And boy, he's even accurate. So we really appreciate him being with us. He's in Kingston, New York. And I wonder how popular populism is there.
[1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:51.980]  But yes, in many blue cities, being pro-gun, being pro-Trump, being pro-America, now the Democrats love war. They're against Trump trying to end these wars.
[1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:58.980]  How do you respond to that? How do you respond to the governor of New York saying, if you're pro-second amendment, get out of the state?
[1:09:58.980 --> 1:10:14.980]  I mean, this is real bullying, Gerald. Yeah, it is. It's only going to get worse as we see it. And I've never seen the country so divided and so sad because you mentioned about, you know, the Russian agent's stupidity.
[1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:25.980]  The whole thing went out one shred of evidence and they keep going back. How come Hillary Clinton lost because of the Russians? No, Hillary Clinton lost because people couldn't stand her.
[1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:35.980]  I mean, you know, both our end Trump, by the way, had very high negative poll ratings in terms of personality. It was like 63 percent of the people didn't care for her.
[1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:43.980]  But look at how we have been taught to hate the Russians. Look how we're being taught now to hate the Chinese and the Iranians and on and on.
[1:10:43.980 --> 1:10:57.980]  And the people pick up soundbites. Same thing with Trump. So now we're going to go into an election like I've never seen with such a split in the nation like the one going on now.
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:11:08.980]  So you're going to have, as we see it, the majority. And we're talking about New Yorkers. New York is California. That's a whole different world compared to the rest of the nation, the East Coast and West Coast.
[1:11:08.980 --> 1:11:21.980]  So you're going to have the popular voters. We see it go against Trump. But as I mentioned, one of our top trends is Trump 2020 by default.
[1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:32.980]  And it's default of the Democrats. They don't have anybody to run up against them. He's going to win the swing states with the candidates set up as they are now.
[1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:40.980]  I agree. But the Democrats are trying to set up civil unrest ahead of them. What are the wildcards that Trump should look out for in your view?
[1:11:40.980 --> 1:11:52.980]  Well, as far as them setting up civil unrest, the people that support Trump will get out stronger than those against him, depending on who's running against him.
[1:11:52.980 --> 1:12:03.980]  So if you've got a Joe Biden, you're not going to get young people. Young people are not going to go nuts over that Bernie Sanders had his day and Elizabeth Warren doesn't have it.
[1:12:03.980 --> 1:12:05.980]  So the wildcard.
[1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:09.980]  The Tulsi Gabbard to the establishment didn't try to block her beat Trump.
[1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:22.980]  I think Tulsi Gabbard to me is the best wildcard because, and again, that might be a sentiment that I try not to be put my heart into these things, but she is anti war.
[1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:38.980]  And as being a veteran and worked in the medical section of that, she saw the suffering, you know, of the soldiers coming in and being willing to talk about one of the roughest places is in the medical corps.
[1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:44.980]  And that's why she's so against it because the people have no clue of what war is.
[1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:47.980]  So I think she's the only wildcard.
[1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:52.980]  But as the Trump card that could play against him, you don't know what's going to happen with the economy.
[1:12:52.980 --> 1:12:57.980]  The markets are artificially propped up as we know with the repo markets.
[1:12:57.980 --> 1:13:00.980]  I mean, nobody's ever heard of a repo market before.
[1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:06.980]  And the feds have pumped in over over $3 trillion since.
[1:13:06.980 --> 1:13:12.980]  And that's my question. What is your what is your analysis for next year in the economy?
[1:13:12.980 --> 1:13:25.980]  The economy should do OK because I believe they're going to lower interest rates again, probably two times at least we may be down to zero to negative interest rate policy by next year.
[1:13:25.980 --> 1:13:30.980]  There's a global slowdown and you could look at these job numbers that came out.
[1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:32.980]  But when you look behind them, they're not great.
[1:13:32.980 --> 1:13:45.980]  The jobs that we've created, like ambulatory services, health care, working in restaurants, hospitality sector, they don't pay a lot.
[1:13:45.980 --> 1:13:48.980]  There's a global slowdown in the China.
[1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:53.980]  Again, the economy globally is going to slow down continually.
[1:13:53.980 --> 1:13:56.980]  They're going to have to prop up the American economy.
[1:13:56.980 --> 1:14:00.980]  So I think this year next time will be like we are today.
[1:14:00.980 --> 1:14:03.980]  It'll be more of the same, but a little worse.
[1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:07.980]  And the Democrats are not coming up with anything to give a better solution.
[1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:15.980]  All they're saying is we're going to increase your taxes, spend more money, and that's not going to work to improve the economy.
[1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.980]  What are your predictions on the impeachment?
[1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:18.980]  I think you said it.
[1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:19.980]  It's going to pass in the House.
[1:14:19.980 --> 1:14:21.980]  It makes no difference.
[1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:22.980]  It makes no difference.
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:25.980]  It's going to blow away by this time next year.
[1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:26.980]  It'll be forgotten.
[1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:27.980]  It's a waste of time.
[1:14:27.980 --> 1:14:40.980]  And as I said, it's going to be, it's going to be a negative for Biden because it's going to become more and more information coming out about the dirty deals that Big Joe did for his little boy, Hunter.
[1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:43.980]  What is he going to do when he finally is forced to come in the Senate?
[1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.980]  I mean, they're going to get a lot of trouble in the Senate once what they've done comes out.
[1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:51.980]  I mean, the illegal spying on the media, the chips doing that guy's a maniac.
[1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:52.980]  Exactly.
[1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:56.980]  And again, he's a warmonger besides, I mean, by their deeds, you shall know him.
[1:14:56.980 --> 1:15:09.980]  But again, how did his little boy, Hunter, get a job in Ukraine making 50 K plus a month and didn't know anything about the energy business who had been to Ukraine?
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:10.980]  What am I, six years old?
[1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:12.980]  I got to swallow this crap.
[1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:19.980]  And that's what the people are going to feel because they don't like Joe Biden already.
[1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:21.980]  He ain't that popular.
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:22.980]  All right, we're going to break.
[1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:27.980]  What are some of the other big trends coming out in your trends forecast for 2020?
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:29.980]  The New World Disorder.
[1:15:29.980 --> 1:15:37.980]  It's going on around the world from Ecuador to Chile to Sudan to Zimbabwe to Lebanon to France.
[1:15:37.980 --> 1:15:41.980]  This is going wild and add another one on to that.
[1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:42.980]  The homeless.
[1:15:42.980 --> 1:15:45.980]  We haven't seen the beginning of the homeless trend.
[1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:52.980]  All right, so break down the worldwide upsurge in rioting and homelessness and what's behind it. We'll be right back.
[1:16:16.980 --> 1:16:23.980]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note.

[1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:25.980]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:25.980 --> 1:17:29.980]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:30.980]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:33.980]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:33.980 --> 1:17:39.980]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:40.980]  I can help you too.
[1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:43.980]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[1:17:58.980 --> 1:18:02.980]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:07.980]  As you age, pregnant known levels in the body go down.
[1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:11.980]  Now in 60 seconds I don't have time to tell you what pregnant known does.
[1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:18.980]  But look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[1:18:18.980 --> 1:18:20.980]  And then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:26.980]  Medical science knows all about this but they suppress information about pregnant known.
[1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:33.980]  We've got the best form of pregnant known with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.

[1:20:39.980 --> 1:20:41.980]  Also guest host with us.
[1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:42.980]  We really appreciate it.
[1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:44.980]  We only hear a few more minutes.
[1:20:44.980 --> 1:20:51.980]  Plunging into global trends, you have been for a long time saying homelessness is going to increase.
[1:20:51.980 --> 1:20:57.980]  Civil unrest is going to get really bad and you've been tracking that very accurately.
[1:20:57.980 --> 1:21:03.980]  Tell us what's happening and then tell us why it's happening and then where you think it's going.
[1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:09.980]  What's happening on the New World Disorder, it's basically one issue, income inequality.
[1:21:09.980 --> 1:21:14.980]  You know what I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it and they're losing it.
[1:21:14.980 --> 1:21:18.980]  They're fighting for their lives.
[1:21:18.980 --> 1:21:20.980]  So now think about it.
[1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:22.980]  You think we have an immigration problem now?
[1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:26.980]  We haven't seen anything yet because the global economy is slowing down.
[1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:27.980]  That's a fact.
[1:21:27.980 --> 1:21:28.980]  It's there.
[1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:33.980]  You're seeing these revolutions in civil wars and demonstrations and unrest all over the globe.
[1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:45.980]  As I said, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Lebanon, Hong Kong, Algeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe.
[1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:47.980]  You go all over the world.
[1:21:47.980 --> 1:21:49.980]  Now the economy slows down.
[1:21:49.980 --> 1:21:51.980]  Go back to 1930.
[1:21:51.980 --> 1:21:54.980]  You had two billion people on the planet.
[1:21:54.980 --> 1:21:58.980]  In 90 years, we had 5.5 billion people.
[1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:00.980]  Now you've got to slow down an economy.
[1:22:00.980 --> 1:22:02.980]  You have civil unrest.
[1:22:02.980 --> 1:22:10.980]  You're going to try to leave where they are because of war, because of violence, because of corruption, because of poverty.
[1:22:10.980 --> 1:22:12.980]  So now where are they going to go?
[1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:15.980]  They're going to try to go to places where they're going to be safe.
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:17.980]  Are they going to find jobs?
[1:22:17.980 --> 1:22:18.980]  No.
[1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:25.980]  You're not going to find jobs in America because this economy is not creating those kind of jobs and we're seeing more and more homeless.
[1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:31.980]  There's going to be homeless problems all over the world in a city town village near you.
[1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:35.980]  There's going to increase and they're doing nothing to prepare for this.
[1:22:35.980 --> 1:22:39.980]  And I have some solutions because people say, you know, you say about what's going on.
[1:22:39.980 --> 1:22:41.980]  How are you going to fix it?
[1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:43.980]  Well, as you know, I'm up here in Kingston, New York.
[1:22:43.980 --> 1:22:45.980]  It's the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
[1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:47.980]  This would be a thing called the Borsch Belt.
[1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:51.980]  Back in the day, all the great entertainers came up to the Catskills.
[1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:53.980]  Those places are all gone.
[1:22:53.980 --> 1:22:55.980]  The beautiful Catskill Mountains.
[1:22:55.980 --> 1:23:05.980]  How about taking people out of these housing developments and all these people sleeping on the streets and putting them in these beautiful places and fix them up?
[1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:08.980]  And now they could farm, they could cook, they could make things.
[1:23:08.980 --> 1:23:11.980]  Instead, they never do that for citizens and veterans.
[1:23:11.980 --> 1:23:16.980]  They bring in unskilled people, mainly from the Middle East, put them on welfare and put them in areas like that.
[1:23:16.980 --> 1:23:18.980]  But you're absolutely right.
[1:23:18.980 --> 1:23:20.980]  We need a renaissance here.
[1:23:20.980 --> 1:23:28.980]  The U.N. and the globalists are weaponizing the Third World, making them hate the West and getting ready to bring them in during the collapse as a political weapon.
[1:23:28.980 --> 1:23:31.980]  Yeah, and again, even the ones we have here already.
[1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:34.980]  And it's terrible.
[1:23:34.980 --> 1:23:38.980]  So in other words, let's take some real money.
[1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:42.980]  And it isn't a lot considering the trillion dollars we spend on a defense budget.
[1:23:42.980 --> 1:23:51.980]  Just create economic development zones that are tax-free to move people into the rural, gorgeous areas and revitalize what's already waiting there.
[1:23:51.980 --> 1:23:53.980]  I mean, what, just 30, 40 years ago?
[1:23:53.980 --> 1:23:56.980]  Didn't Rodney Dangerfield have a club up at the Catskills?
[1:23:56.980 --> 1:23:58.980]  I mean, everybody went up there.
[1:23:58.980 --> 1:24:00.980]  Yeah, all the grades.
[1:24:00.980 --> 1:24:03.980]  So now you have this beautiful land and all the state land, federal land.
[1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:07.980]  We could work to do these, but people are not looking ahead.
[1:24:07.980 --> 1:24:09.980]  By the way, I've been in the Catskills.
[1:24:09.980 --> 1:24:11.980]  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
[1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:13.980]  You said it's a freaking ghost town.
[1:24:13.980 --> 1:24:15.980]  Yeah, a lot of them.
[1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.980]  And of course, a lot of them is coming back, but there's that.
[1:24:17.980 --> 1:24:24.980]  So now, you know, I was at a party and a guy worth, I'm saying in the 30, 40, 50 million dollar range.
[1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:27.980]  All he kept doing is talking about Trump.
[1:24:27.980 --> 1:24:29.980]  He can't stand Trump, can't stand Trump.
[1:24:29.980 --> 1:24:32.980]  And I said, are you looking at the things going on around the world?
[1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:36.980]  He knew nothing about what was going on in the places I'm talking about.
[1:24:36.980 --> 1:24:39.980]  Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Lebanon.
[1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:41.980]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[1:24:41.980 --> 1:24:45.980]  So what I'm saying is people are not preparing for what's coming down.
[1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:50.980]  And they don't even want to have any border while the third world is collapsing and been weaponized.
[1:24:50.980 --> 1:24:52.980]  Exactly.
[1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.980]  And what I'm saying is we have to deal with this now.
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:59.980]  It's going to get worse, but people are not looking to the future.
[1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:02.980]  The news is just telling you garbage.
[1:25:02.980 --> 1:25:04.980]  We tell you this is going on.
[1:25:04.980 --> 1:25:06.980]  This is what it means.
[1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:08.980]  This is where it's going.
[1:25:08.980 --> 1:25:10.980]  How could we address it?
[1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:11.980]  Well, I want to invite you down.
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:13.980]  I'll fly you down here, Gerald.
[1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:17.980]  In the next few weeks to come down here and co-host the shows with us and do a whole breakdown of this,
[1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:19.980]  because I totally agree with your analysis.
[1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:21.980]  You were about 10 years ahead on this, but it's all coming.
[1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:28.980]  And the globalists want to use this to flood us and totally control us and use the crisis to in nation states as they exist.
[1:25:28.980 --> 1:25:30.980]  And that's not going to even help the third world.
[1:25:30.980 --> 1:25:36.980]  I want to help them and help us, but we've got to really understand that globalism is what has helped engineer this
[1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:38.980]  help create it and we have to stop it.
[1:25:38.980 --> 1:25:40.980]  What are some of the other trends real quick?
[1:25:40.980 --> 1:25:42.980]  And then I'd love to have you back next week for a full hour.
[1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:43.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:48.980]  On some high notes, you know, elegance, you know, go back to the roaring 20s.
[1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:52.980]  I have a photo of my parents made of souls rest in the piece of their wedding, 1934.
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:54.980]  Height of the depression.
[1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:56.980]  Everybody's dressed in the nines.
[1:25:56.980 --> 1:26:00.980]  They worked in factories or they were construction workers.
[1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:03.980]  People didn't respect themselves again.
[1:26:03.980 --> 1:26:07.980]  Bring yourself to the highest level as things go down.
[1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:11.980]  So you don't go down with it because this thing's going down.
[1:26:11.980 --> 1:26:15.980]  So you just have the self-respect of who you are and who your ancestors are.
[1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:16.980]  Don't feel bad.
[1:26:16.980 --> 1:26:17.980]  Everything's hell around you.
[1:26:17.980 --> 1:26:19.980]  Don't let that take you over and depress you.
[1:26:19.980 --> 1:26:22.980]  Surviving and moving forward is victory.
[1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:23.980]  You got it.
[1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:24.980]  Perfectly said.
[1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:32.980]  Now an entrepreneur that sees these trends say, OK, how could I jump on that and make it happen?
[1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:40.980]  Again, swing time, the hottest, happiest music America ever knew at the height of the Great Depression.
[1:26:40.980 --> 1:26:42.980]  So that's what we're seeing.
[1:26:42.980 --> 1:26:43.980]  It's the roaring 20s.
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:47.980]  Hey, listen, Impro Wars is under attack on air before and it's causing us to innovate and do incredible things.
[1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:48.980]  Gerald, amazing.
[1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:51.980]  Please join us for a full hour next week to get more into this and take calls.
[1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:53.980]  And thank you so much.
[1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:56.980]  Again, how do people get a copy of this great magazine?
[1:26:56.980 --> 1:26:59.980]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.980]  The only magazine like it in the world, Money Back Guarantee.
[1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:05.980]  TrendsJournal.com and Trends Research takes the same place.
[1:27:05.980 --> 1:27:06.980]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[1:27:06.980 --> 1:27:07.980]  Thank you.
[1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:08.980]  All right.
[1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:12.980]  When we got several other guests popping up, and I'm going to get to all your calls today, and I appreciate everybody calling in.
[1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:14.980]  And I appreciate your point.
[1:27:14.980 --> 1:27:15.980]  So let's get one in here before we go to break it.
[1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:17.980]  A few more around and another guest pops in.
[1:27:17.980 --> 1:27:19.980]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[1:27:19.980 --> 1:27:22.980]  That would be Bart in Pennsylvania.
[1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:23.980]  Bart, thank you.
[1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:24.980]  Go ahead.
[1:27:24.980 --> 1:27:28.980]  Hey, Alex, it's great listening to you.
[1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:30.980]  I am like you.
[1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:33.980]  My savior and Lord is Jesus Christ.
[1:27:33.980 --> 1:27:35.980]  And I have all the faith in him.
[1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:37.980]  And I know he's going to pull us through this.
[1:27:37.980 --> 1:27:38.980]  Yes.
[1:27:38.980 --> 1:27:39.980]  Remember what Jesus said?
[1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:43.980]  It'll get worse than the days before Noah.
[1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:54.980]  If you were calling Genesis, early part of Genesis, why did God get upset when the fallen angels mixed into the human race?
[1:27:54.980 --> 1:27:56.980]  Genetic engineering.
[1:27:56.980 --> 1:27:57.980]  Exactly.
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:27:59.980]  They were destroying the human race.
[1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:02.980]  And do you think God is going to continue with that?
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:03.980]  No.
[1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:04.980]  There's going to be a record.
[1:28:04.980 --> 1:28:05.980]  No, God made us.
[1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:09.980]  That is the ultimate sin to God is manipulating the human genome.
[1:28:09.980 --> 1:28:11.980]  And he will not let that happen.
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:13.980]  And I have faith that all that will happen.
[1:28:13.980 --> 1:28:18.980]  But also Jesus said in revelations as throughout the gospel.
[1:28:18.980 --> 1:28:19.980]  Bart, don't hang up.
[1:28:19.980 --> 1:28:20.980]  Don't hang up.
[1:28:20.980 --> 1:28:21.980]  I've got one more guest popping in.
[1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:22.980]  I'm going to let you finish.
[1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:24.980]  I'm going to get to them quickly, but they're very important as well.
[1:28:24.980 --> 1:28:27.980]  We're going to go to calls, boom, boom, boom, to the very end of the show.
[1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:29.980]  No one's short of popping in, but I promise callers.
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:34.980]  There's going to be tons of calls, not just these calls, but everybody at 877-789-2539.
[1:28:34.980 --> 1:28:35.980]  The phones are full right now.
[1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.980]  But after I get to these, you can call in.
[1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:38.980]  Nobody hang up.
[1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:40.980]  Bart, finish up what you're saying right there.
[1:28:40.980 --> 1:28:45.980]  That's why I'm so urgent is that you can feel God's spirit with this evil.
[1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:47.980]  And what's happening, and you know it's dangerous.
[1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:49.980]  And that's why I want the evil to stop.
[1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:50.980]  You know what?
[1:28:50.980 --> 1:28:51.980]  It's not going to stop.
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:55.980]  It's not going to come in.

[1:30:59.980 --> 1:31:05.980]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us,
[1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:09.980]  poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:15.980]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species
[1:31:15.980 --> 1:31:19.980]  of the family. We're being taken off the land.
[1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:25.980]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery
[1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:29.980]  until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[1:31:29.980 --> 1:31:34.980]  than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[1:31:34.980 --> 1:31:39.980]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[1:31:39.980 --> 1:31:43.980]  beg for them to implement against us.
[1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:47.980]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:52.980]  This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:56.980]  This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[1:31:56.980 --> 1:32:01.980]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do.

[1:32:05.980 --> 1:32:08.980]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[1:32:08.980 --> 1:32:12.980]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season

[1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:43.980]  and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.

[1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:31.980]  His name is Peter DeBrosca. House candidate gives Tucker his case for an all-out immigration moratorium.
[1:33:31.980 --> 1:33:34.980]  Oh, absolutely. The Democrats are weaponizing the people coming in.
[1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:39.980]  We're going bankrupt. We're trying to break our borders. Absolutely. We need a moratorium.
[1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:46.980]  We need it now. The crime waves. All of it is just unbelievable. Here he is talking about it on Tucker.
[1:33:46.980 --> 1:33:49.980]  Peter DeBrosca is a congressional candidate from the state of North Carolina.
[1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:53.980]  He's called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration. He joins us tonight.
[1:33:53.980 --> 1:33:56.980]  Peter, thanks so much for coming on tonight. When you say all immigration,
[1:33:56.980 --> 1:33:58.980]  do you mean all immigration or is it all illegal immigration?
[1:33:58.980 --> 1:34:02.980]  Sure. So, Tucker, it's important that we define what an immigration moratorium is,
[1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:06.980]  and in this case, it means no net immigration to the United States.
[1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:10.980]  So, about 200,000 people leave the United States every year.
[1:34:10.980 --> 1:34:11.980]  Yes.
[1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:16.980]  Bringing in 200,000 legal aliens would be fine, but bottom line,
[1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:21.980]  we would like to have no population increase from legal immigration.
[1:34:21.980 --> 1:34:26.980]  And then it goes on from there, and he makes his case for that.
[1:34:26.980 --> 1:34:30.980]  Here's the deal. The Democrats, the globalists have weaponized the populations.
[1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:36.980]  You just heard Gerald Salente. He's a classical liberal. He travels all over the world a lot.
[1:34:36.980 --> 1:34:41.980]  He was the best-selling number one New York Times was selling author on something like this in 1982 and stuff like that.
[1:34:41.980 --> 1:34:46.980]  And he's saying that the third world's about to totally collapse,
[1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:50.980]  and the Democrats are collapsing cities into third world conditions by design
[1:34:50.980 --> 1:34:54.980]  to gain power and control and to make money off the crisis that they manage.
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:57.980]  Here are some of the headlines dealing with it.
[1:34:57.980 --> 1:35:04.980]  Sweden rape, most convicted attackers, foreign born, says government report, BBC.
[1:35:04.980 --> 1:35:11.980]  Italian government numbers show 42% of rapes are carried out by migrants alone, not even non-citizens.
[1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:15.980]  Swedish couple savagely tortured for hours by Hitler worshiping Islamist migrant.
[1:35:15.980 --> 1:35:17.980]  That's at Europewars.com.
[1:35:17.980 --> 1:35:21.980]  Mayors ask Trump to import more refugees to US for cultural diversity.
[1:35:21.980 --> 1:35:24.980]  Say America's too white, too Christian. These are quotes.
[1:35:24.980 --> 1:35:28.980]  And admit that they're on welfare, but say that's what we need.
[1:35:28.980 --> 1:35:31.980]  Record number of African migrants at US-Mexico border.
[1:35:31.980 --> 1:35:34.980]  One of them untested from the Congo where there is Ebola.
[1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:38.980]  Let's now reach the Caribbean.
[1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:42.980]  So Pete Dabrowski joins us, Pete4NC.com.
[1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:45.980]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:49.980]  Okay. And again, we're very, very excited about all of that.
[1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:51.980]  And we're very excited about him coming on.
[1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:53.980]  And I appreciate him coming on.
[1:35:53.980 --> 1:36:00.980]  Again, he was supposed to be on yesterday, but he's going to be actually coming on today.
[1:36:00.980 --> 1:36:02.980]  Now, before I go any further though,
[1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:06.980]  I want to go back to that Tucker piece with him and play some more of it.
[1:36:06.980 --> 1:36:09.980]  And then we're going to go back to Bart and then all the other collars.
[1:36:09.980 --> 1:36:13.980]  We're going to get to every single one of them here on the list.
[1:36:13.980 --> 1:36:20.980]  David, Tyler, Bobby, Dennis, Danny, Nick, Ryan, Tyler, Gordon and others here in just a moment.
[1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:25.980]  But first, I just wanted to get to that stack of news that I hadn't got to yet
[1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:30.980]  because it just illustrates everything that he is saying, that Pete's saying,
[1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:33.980]  and that's what Gerald Salente is saying, because it's the truth.
[1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:39.980]  And the UN says they are carrying this out.
[1:36:39.980 --> 1:36:42.980]  And they say it is their plan.
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:45.980]  So here's more of him on Tucker, then we'll go to your calls.
[1:36:45.980 --> 1:36:51.980]  But bottom line, we would like to have no population increase from legal immigration.
[1:36:51.980 --> 1:36:53.980]  You are not allowed to say that.
[1:36:53.980 --> 1:36:57.980]  So the left has decided because the left controls the terms that the right uses,
[1:36:57.980 --> 1:36:59.980]  as you know, and the right goes along with this.
[1:36:59.980 --> 1:37:03.980]  And you're allowed to say under duress that you're against illegal immigration,
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:07.980]  but you're never allowed to say that there should be some absolute cap.
[1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:09.980]  Why are you saying that?
[1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:11.980]  Well, those are the old party rules, Tucker.
[1:37:11.980 --> 1:37:13.980]  And I think that there's a new Republican party in town.
[1:37:13.980 --> 1:37:18.980]  It's people like myself who are younger and less controlled by,
[1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:24.980]  should we say, the conservative ink crowds or maybe the donor class in Washington, D.C.
[1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:26.980]  and the political elites.
[1:37:26.980 --> 1:37:28.980]  We understand the game.
[1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:32.980]  We understand that the Chamber of Commerce has bought and paid for our congresspeople.
[1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:37.980]  And we understand that it has bought and paid for organizations like Turning Point USA.
[1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:42.980]  We understand it has bought and paid for media outlets like the Daily Wire, for example,
[1:37:42.980 --> 1:37:45.980]  who are not meaningfully conservative in any way,
[1:37:45.980 --> 1:37:49.980]  who can never be trusted to conserve anything.
[1:37:49.980 --> 1:37:52.980]  So tell me what your rationale is, though.
[1:37:52.980 --> 1:37:58.980]  I mean, they're going to attack you probably on a bunch of different levels for saying this.
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:01.980]  Why should people agree with your idea?
[1:38:01.980 --> 1:38:07.980]  Well, Tucker, I mean, when you think about the situation that we have economically in America,
[1:38:07.980 --> 1:38:13.980]  where the working class continues to dwindle, legal immigration is not helping us in this scenario.
[1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:18.980]  So we're bringing in roughly a million legal immigrants a year in various visa programs
[1:38:18.980 --> 1:38:20.980]  and via green cards.
[1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:26.980]  And these folks are increasingly taking jobs, not just from working class Americans,
[1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:30.980]  like we do with the sort of farm visas, like you were just discussing,
[1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:34.980]  but increasingly from middle class Americans, too.
[1:38:34.980 --> 1:38:38.980]  So we're, I mean, Congress, even Republicans in Congress,
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:43.980]  I suppose, conservatives are lobbying right now to increase high-skilled tech views.
[1:38:43.980 --> 1:38:46.980]  That's right. And he's going to be, again, with us next hour.
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:49.980]  I'm going to your calls, but the reason I wanted to raise this is,
[1:38:49.980 --> 1:38:53.980]  I see the articles out of Europe every day and I don't cover them
[1:38:53.980 --> 1:38:56.980]  because I've already read them, I've already looked at them,
[1:38:56.980 --> 1:39:00.980]  and they make me so upset that I tend to not go back to them.
[1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:02.980]  It's not really a conscious thing.
[1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:07.980]  It's that it's so upsetting, it's so ridiculous, it's so crazy, you can't believe it.
[1:39:07.980 --> 1:39:11.980]  Like everybody's seeing this happen five years ago, four years ago,
[1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:15.980]  the footage of the old Italian man at his little family-owned hotel they'd owned for 200 years,
[1:39:15.980 --> 1:39:19.980]  only held 20 rooms, so 40, 50 people could stay there,
[1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:22.980]  little bit of a restaurant by the sea,
[1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:27.980]  and they bring in African migrants who illegally landed on the beach,
[1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:32.980]  and the federal police are laughing while the old man cries,
[1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:38.980]  and the tenants are thrown out and given their money back.
[1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:44.980]  There's hours this on Italian TV, and the illegal aliens move into his hotel.
[1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:48.980]  Well, I mean, I saw this week where in Sweden,
[1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:53.980]  they're kicking people out of their old folks' Section 8 housing, welfare housing,
[1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:58.980]  saying, oh, the toilets weren't green enough, they were a centimeter too small,
[1:39:58.980 --> 1:40:04.980]  and they just use that as the cover to move the Islamist military age men in.
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:10.980]  And I see these articles every day.
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:13.980]  And then articles about how we should praise and love the Islamist.
[1:40:13.980 --> 1:40:17.980]  When we go to their countries, they don't give us crap,
[1:40:17.980 --> 1:40:20.980]  except kill you if you don't convert. It's crazy.
[1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:23.980]  But this is the authoritarianism of these people.
[1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:27.980]  So I'm going to go to Bart, I'm going to go to everybody here in just a moment.
[1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:30.980]  But here's another article on this.
[1:40:30.980 --> 1:40:37.980]  CIS.org, 63% of non-citizen households access welfare programs in the United States.
[1:40:37.980 --> 1:40:42.980]  It's over 80% in Europe of these Islamic illegal aliens.
[1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:46.980]  And again, I'll tell you, people from Mexico and other places try to assimilate.
[1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:50.980]  Mexico's a war zone now, its population's exploded, there's big problems.
[1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:56.980]  But Islamists out of the Middle East are like cancer when you bring them in.
[1:40:56.980 --> 1:41:04.980]  And the third world, I mean, they don't let Islamists move into places in the third world because they're not stupid.
[1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:08.980]  They have some form of tribalism to protect themselves.
[1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:12.980]  So this is a UN plan. I know everybody knows it, but we need to make a big deal about it.
[1:41:12.980 --> 1:41:15.980]  Okay, I want to get back into impeachment. I want to get back into the articles.
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:17.980]  I want to get back into your calls. I want to do it all.
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.980]  I'm not going to plug next segment. I'm going to do it just a minute and a half left here.
[1:41:20.980 --> 1:41:26.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, our big sale, we got a lot of big sales going in free shipping and double-patriot points at M4store.com.
[1:41:26.980 --> 1:41:32.980]  And it is your Christmas shopping with us that helps us continue on and do a lot of amazing things like you saw with Owen in Congress.
[1:41:32.980 --> 1:41:35.980]  And we'll be at the Trump rally tonight. We're got reporters all over the U.S.
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:38.980]  And we're just so many times the outlet that breaks the big news.
[1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:40.980]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:43.980]  Well, we have the real Red Pill and the real Red Pill Plus.
[1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:47.980]  Real Red Pill Plus just has three forms of good, healthy added energy in it.
[1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:54.980]  And it has vitamins, minerals, but then preglenone, which again, the system tries to suppress.
[1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:58.980]  We have the good form of preglenone that's the basis of all the hormones in the body.
[1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:01.980]  It's over the counter, but they're moving to try to stop that.
[1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:04.980]  Been around for 100 years. They really suppress it.
[1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:09.980]  Get a bottle of this for $29.95. That is very close to cost.
[1:42:09.980 --> 1:42:11.980]  It's like 20 bucks a bottle for us.
[1:42:11.980 --> 1:42:20.980]  And then you will get a free bottle of bio-truse selenium from the mustard seed with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:25.980]  And that is a big, big, big deal.
[1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:28.980]  Selenium, if you don't have selenium, you die. It's electrochemical.
[1:42:28.980 --> 1:42:30.980]  It's what all the cells use to operate.
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:33.980]  So you add that with the preglenone, the vitamins, the minerals.
[1:42:33.980 --> 1:42:36.980]  It is an explosive combination. You want to go next level. This is it.
[1:42:36.980 --> 1:42:39.980]  Be careful. Consult your physician because this isn't a game.
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:42.980]  It's all hardcore real stuff. It's one of our big sales at InformerStore.com.

[1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:13.980]  for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.

[1:43:19.980 --> 1:43:27.980]  It's 65% off right now. That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling Biotru Selenium for the mustard seed.
[1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:33.980]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy, your focus, your entire body.
[1:43:33.980 --> 1:43:37.980]  The globalists know about this, but have been suppressing it.

[1:44:55.980 --> 1:45:02.980]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code,
[1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:08.980]  genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[1:45:08.980 --> 1:45:16.980]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:25.980]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery
[1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:34.980]  until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:42.980]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:49.980]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error.
[1:45:49.980 --> 1:45:55.980]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[1:45:55.980 --> 1:46:03.980]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot points.

[1:47:20.980 --> 1:47:24.980]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:29.980]  Alright, let's move quickly through your calls because I want to get to a lot of them.
[1:47:29.980 --> 1:47:33.980]  Bart was talking about God's Spirit, what can be done against the globalist.
[1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:36.980]  Finish up the points you were making Bart, I appreciate you holding.
[1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:43.980]  What I mean about the globalist is if you look back into Bible and read it and through all the Gospels,
[1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:52.980]  what Jesus keeps reminding us is ye of little faith. You've got to have faith in the Lord that he's going to be protecting us
[1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:57.980]  and taking us through. Yes, we're going to have some hard times, but just go back to the beginning
[1:47:57.980 --> 1:48:03.980]  at Genesis when the fallen angels tried to corrupt the human race and God interfered,
[1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:06.980]  and that's why the flood of Noah came.
[1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:14.980]  And then after Noah made his sacrifice, he told man to eat meat. Man was a vegetarian before that.
[1:48:14.980 --> 1:48:19.980]  What are we hearing now today? Oh, not to eat meat, not to do this.
[1:48:19.980 --> 1:48:32.980]  And all the corruption of the defiled sects going on in the days of Noah is coming back with these Drag Queen reading in the larger...
[1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:39.980]  Drag queens are the priesthood, their men in demonic clown outfits is what Satanists actually wear in their events.
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:44.980]  And then they are the priesthood and then our children are given to them and then they teach them perversion
[1:48:44.980 --> 1:48:46.980]  and it's all done out in the open. You're absolutely right.
[1:48:46.980 --> 1:48:51.980]  And if you read the Bible and then you go back and study what those civilizations were doing,
[1:48:51.980 --> 1:48:56.980]  the Bible says they were being taught this by fallen entities from space.
[1:48:56.980 --> 1:49:00.980]  And then now we see it all repeating. I appreciate your call, Bart. Great points.
[1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:07.980]  Make no mistake, we've never been in Kansas. This is planet, you know, the archetype Kansas is calm and nice.
[1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:13.980]  And then you go to the magic world and the Emerald Castle and all the rest of it.
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:17.980]  There's a lot of stuff going on and the establishment knows that and they bet on the wrong team.
[1:49:17.980 --> 1:49:23.980]  They bet on the wrong honcho. Let's go ahead and go to more calls here.
[1:49:23.980 --> 1:49:29.980]  Up next is David in Washington State. Thank you for calling. Go ahead.
[1:49:29.980 --> 1:49:35.980]  And with a quick comment, I've been using TurboForce and I'll tell you what, I got everybody around me hooked on it.
[1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:38.980]  Stuff is amazing. Truly amazing.
[1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:44.980]  Tell me what you think of TurboForce because I went to like four or five big top places.
[1:49:44.980 --> 1:49:49.980]  I got a famous nutrition developer, well-known person. If you're into that, he's a household name.
[1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:52.980]  And we paid him a lot of money. He didn't want his name on it because of how we get attacked.
[1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:55.980]  But I said, I really want, if companies would put more money into something,
[1:49:55.980 --> 1:50:00.980]  because most companies put almost nothing into it and still works really great, you know, similar things.
[1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:05.980]  This has more of the natural energy ingredients, more of the enzymes, however it all works.
[1:50:05.980 --> 1:50:11.980]  I mean, we put more into TurboForce than anybody else does. It's really 10-hour clean energy.
[1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:12.980]  What did TurboForce do for you?
[1:50:12.980 --> 1:50:18.980]  Okay. All right. So first off, Will Johnson was right. You've got to use orange juice and if not, pineapple juice.
[1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:21.980]  Two best things you can ever use. Okay.
[1:50:21.980 --> 1:50:25.980]  Second off, a lot of the products, to be honest, don't work for me.
[1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:32.980]  But this one was like, I gave it to a friend as a guinea pig because I was like, oh, I'm not sure if it's going to work.
[1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:39.980]  It worked. And, you know, I mean, you know, I run heavy equipment. It keeps you awake all day long.
[1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:42.980]  I have no problem. I don't feel tired. I could sit there and run the equipment.
[1:50:42.980 --> 1:50:46.980]  As a matter of fact, I'm doing that right now. But, you know, I mean, I love it.
[1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:51.980]  I mean, it's the one product, this one, and the new Brainforce Plus, which the first Brainforce Plus didn't work for me at all.
[1:50:51.980 --> 1:50:57.980]  This one works. And I'm actually kind of happy.
[1:50:57.980 --> 1:51:02.980]  Well, the reason sometimes knockout works better. Sometimes it doesn't.
[1:51:02.980 --> 1:51:06.980]  Sometimes Brainforce Plus works better. Sometimes it doesn't is.
[1:51:06.980 --> 1:51:10.980]  These are real organic, high quality sourcing and compounds.
[1:51:10.980 --> 1:51:14.980]  And sometimes the herbs aren't as strong as the next batch.
[1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:17.980]  It's kind of like sometimes you go get cherries at the store and it's the same company.
[1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:22.980]  Everything they taste really good. Sometimes they look good, but don't taste good, you know, or they look bad, but taste great.
[1:51:22.980 --> 1:51:27.980]  I mean, these are real formulas. So and they're natural and they're organic.
[1:51:27.980 --> 1:51:30.980]  And so that's why they're going to vary batch to batch.
[1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:35.980]  So God bless you. What's your point on the IG report I see you wanted to get into?
[1:51:35.980 --> 1:51:43.980]  Two things. First off, the IG report. Listen, everybody, you know, you'd have to be living in a hole in the wall if you didn't see this one coming.
[1:51:43.980 --> 1:51:48.980]  I mean, honestly, you know, the whole deck stacked against Trump, it doesn't really matter.
[1:51:48.980 --> 1:51:54.980]  You know, I mean, we as a citizen, you know, we could do something, but really I see all day.
[1:51:54.980 --> 1:51:59.980]  People, oh, I want to do this or oh, I want to do that, but no one stands up anymore.
[1:51:59.980 --> 1:52:02.980]  Everybody is afraid. Everybody's afraid.
[1:52:02.980 --> 1:52:07.980]  You know, I'm glad you raised this because I wanted to come in here on Friday and Monday and say this.
[1:52:07.980 --> 1:52:10.980]  And I was all ready to talk about it and really thought about it and was all hyped up.
[1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:17.980]  And then I forgot. So let me just briefly say something about this and then hopefully do a whole show on it and take calls on just this subject.
[1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:20.980]  Everyone's calling what Owen did, the most brave thing they ever saw.
[1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:27.980]  Come on, firefighters going in collapsing buildings, you know, rescue divers and the people that went into those caves in Malaysia to get all those kids out.
[1:52:27.980 --> 1:52:31.980]  I mean, that is scarier than hell and super dangerous and what three or four divers died.
[1:52:31.980 --> 1:52:35.980]  Now that's that's that's going into a situation where you got probably a 5% chance to die.
[1:52:35.980 --> 1:52:42.980]  Every dive you do 20, 30 missions. I mean, you know, B17 pilots, half of them were dying in World War Two over Germany.
[1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:46.980]  I mean, there are certain things where you know you're about to die and you still do it.
[1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:51.980]  But just going in and standing up to criminals and getting arrested and maybe paying a thousand dollar fine.
[1:52:51.980 --> 1:52:54.980]  That that's important and Owen did it and he's awesome.
[1:52:54.980 --> 1:52:59.980]  But exactly how have people gotten so cowed where they're afraid of what's going to happen to them?
[1:52:59.980 --> 1:53:04.980]  That's called living in tyranny and that's what you want to be scared of is the end product of laying down means you're afraid.
[1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:07.980]  Down means you're a slave. Keep going.
[1:53:07.980 --> 1:53:14.980]  I don't tell anybody that I voted because, you know, where I live, you know, you just don't say it, you know,
[1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:16.980]  they'll say who'd you vote for and then they'll attack you.
[1:53:16.980 --> 1:53:20.980]  And again, because we got to get in the habit of getting used to being attacked.
[1:53:20.980 --> 1:53:25.980]  I love it when leftists get in my face now because when I'm done, they got their tail between their legs, but keep going.
[1:53:25.980 --> 1:53:30.980]  Can I say one one really important thing that really upsets me and I'm going to be honest with you.
[1:53:30.980 --> 1:53:31.980]  I'll be completely frank.
[1:53:31.980 --> 1:53:34.980]  You know, aggravate me most about you and I'm sorry.
[1:53:34.980 --> 1:53:40.980]  I hate to break this to you, but when you sit there and tell people that I can't do this anymore, you know, that's like crushing us.
[1:53:40.980 --> 1:53:44.980]  When we hear you sit there and say, oh, well, you know, I just can't do this anymore.
[1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:49.980]  I got to give up, you know, believe it or not, you say that the audience is, you know, is the power.
[1:53:49.980 --> 1:53:53.980]  But the reality is you give the audience the word.
[1:53:53.980 --> 1:53:55.980]  You give you give us David, let me stop right there.
[1:53:55.980 --> 1:53:57.980]  Here's the problem.
[1:53:57.980 --> 1:54:02.980]  When I get super angry and when they have they literally hand me stacks of news.
[1:54:02.980 --> 1:54:05.980]  So many stories of them teaching pedophilia to children in schools.
[1:54:05.980 --> 1:54:13.980]  So many stories of them cutting three year olds balls off now that I will say I can't take it anymore because I'm about to turn the desk over a minute later.
[1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:14.980]  I'm OK.
[1:54:14.980 --> 1:54:15.980]  I'm not scripted what I'm saying.
[1:54:15.980 --> 1:54:21.980]  I really feel I wear my heart on my sleeve and I'm very, you know, extroverted when it comes to that.
[1:54:21.980 --> 1:54:23.980]  I don't mean it, but you're right.
[1:54:23.980 --> 1:54:31.980]  But I mean, sometimes like three, four hours into the show, what I'm really saying is, man, I want to start killing people.
[1:54:31.980 --> 1:54:38.980]  That's what that means is I can't do this anymore because I start thinking about being violent and I'm not going to be violent.
[1:54:38.980 --> 1:54:40.980]  I'm just saying that's what that really means.
[1:54:40.980 --> 1:54:42.980]  OK, is it a certain point?
[1:54:42.980 --> 1:54:44.980]  They got it all set up where we get violent.
[1:54:44.980 --> 1:54:52.980]  They're going to say we're the bad guys, even though they're the violent people with the vaccines and the GMOs and the hurting children and destroying their futures and all the corruption and all the things.
[1:54:52.980 --> 1:54:53.980]  They do.
[1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:57.980]  And so when I say that, it means as a man, I'm a red lining like a race car engine.
[1:54:57.980 --> 1:54:58.980]  So I apologize.
[1:54:58.980 --> 1:54:59.980]  You're absolutely right, David.
[1:54:59.980 --> 1:55:00.980]  I'm going to jump.
[1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:03.980]  I will not say I can't take it anymore.
[1:55:03.980 --> 1:55:04.980]  I'm going to quit.
[1:55:04.980 --> 1:55:05.980]  What I mean is I'm not giving up.
[1:55:05.980 --> 1:55:09.980]  It means I need a vacation.
[1:55:09.980 --> 1:55:11.980]  OK, and it's not in a bad way.
[1:55:11.980 --> 1:55:13.980]  It's like all I do is work now.
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:22.980]  And I just need to not be as aggressive as what I'm saying.
[1:55:22.980 --> 1:55:24.980]  OK, because that's what it comes down to.
[1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:28.980]  Let's go to Danny in Oregon and then Gordon in Hawaii.
[1:55:28.980 --> 1:55:29.980]  Danny, you're on the air.
[1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:30.980]  Thanks for holding.
[1:55:30.980 --> 1:55:32.980]  Hey, Alex.
[1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:39.980]  You know, I agree with you there as far as people calling in this area that it's brave what I would do.
[1:55:39.980 --> 1:55:45.980]  I mean, it's just what anybody and everybody should be doing at this point.
[1:55:45.980 --> 1:55:50.980]  I'm surprised it took that long for somebody to stand up and start yelling.
[1:55:50.980 --> 1:55:51.980]  Yeah.
[1:55:51.980 --> 1:55:52.980]  Why is it always him full wars?
[1:55:52.980 --> 1:55:53.980]  Literally.
[1:55:53.980 --> 1:55:57.980]  And again, I'm not taking away from Owen, but now this is a revolutionary act to tell a
[1:55:57.980 --> 1:56:01.980]  row group of criminals that have been caught lying us over and over again and trying to sabotage
[1:56:01.980 --> 1:56:06.980]  our country that say they hate America and tell us we suck to stand up and say, you're
[1:56:06.980 --> 1:56:07.980]  the trees in this trader.
[1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:12.980]  You're the one committing the crimes when law professors told them to their faces exact.
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:15.980]  That's what everyone should be doing.
[1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:16.980]  And that's what I keep saying.
[1:56:16.980 --> 1:56:23.980]  It's not extraordinary to say John Hopkins is now doing sex reassignments on three year olds.
[1:56:23.980 --> 1:56:26.980]  OK, that's a damn criminal action.
[1:56:26.980 --> 1:56:30.980]  And it's not normal to sit here and put up with it.
[1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:32.980]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:56:32.980 --> 1:56:34.980]  No, I agree with you.
[1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:37.980]  I'm extremely mad.
[1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:45.980]  And, you know, I feel that feeling in your spirit when you're just around so much people
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:50.980]  just kind of bubbling up and it just I got it directed somewhere.
[1:56:50.980 --> 1:56:51.980]  Well, that's it.
[1:56:51.980 --> 1:56:54.980]  And so we're not going to get violent and we don't support offensive violence because
[1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:56.980]  they're going to spend it against us.
[1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:59.980]  You know, these globalists are carrying out violence against us.
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.980]  We're going to expose what they're doing and we're going to stop laying down to them.
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:03.980]  And that's how we're going to do it.
[1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:05.980]  You agree with me?
[1:57:05.980 --> 1:57:06.980]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[1:57:06.980 --> 1:57:07.980]  Absolutely, Alex.
[1:57:07.980 --> 1:57:15.980]  And, you know, I just I hope that everybody and more people will take the inspiration
[1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:17.980]  and get up and do something about it.
[1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:22.980]  You know, I'm I'm doing what I can, you know, it's hard to understand.
[1:57:22.980 --> 1:57:24.980]  Everybody says the same thing.
[1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:28.980]  They say, oh, well, I you know, you guys can do it, but I have a full time job.
[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:30.980]  Well, everybody has a full time job.
[1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:33.980]  Well, that's it, Danny, and we all get frustrated because we know about the evil and it should
[1:57:33.980 --> 1:57:34.980]  be reversed.
[1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:36.980]  But the good news is at least we're talking about it.
[1:57:36.980 --> 1:57:38.980]  At least we're trying to censor us because we're effective.
[1:57:38.980 --> 1:57:39.980]  God bless you, Danny.
[1:57:39.980 --> 1:57:40.980]  Thank you.
[1:57:40.980 --> 1:57:41.980]  More calls straight ahead.
[1:57:41.980 --> 1:57:45.980]  Stay with us.
[1:57:45.980 --> 1:57:46.980]  Andy in Florida.
[1:57:46.980 --> 1:57:47.980]  Thank you, Andy.
[1:57:47.980 --> 1:57:48.980]  Go ahead.
[1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:49.980]  Hey, Alex, I love you, man.
[1:57:49.980 --> 1:57:50.980]  We love you.
[1:57:50.980 --> 1:57:53.980]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product.
[1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:54.980]  A little bit about me.
[1:57:54.980 --> 1:57:55.980]  I'm 245 pounds.
[1:57:55.980 --> 1:57:59.980]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[1:57:59.980 --> 1:58:01.980]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:06.980]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[1:58:06.980 --> 1:58:09.980]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously
[1:58:09.980 --> 1:58:10.980]  in my truck every day.
[1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:13.980]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[1:58:13.980 --> 1:58:16.980]  This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:17.980]  He was dead.
[1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:22.980]  No longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet
[1:58:22.980 --> 1:58:23.980]  of your turbo force.
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:28.980]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money
[1:58:28.980 --> 1:58:31.980]  versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:34.980]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[1:58:34.980 --> 1:58:36.980]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:37.980]  We're really proud of turbo force.
[1:58:37.980 --> 1:58:38.980]  So thank you, sir.
[1:58:38.980 --> 1:58:40.980]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:41.980]  Then help us spread the word.
[1:58:41.980 --> 1:58:44.980]  Let's just get busy at M4store.com.
[1:58:47.980 --> 1:58:49.980]  It's shocking, but true.
[1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:55.980]  2019 is almost a memory in the rear view mirror.
[1:58:55.980 --> 1:58:58.980]  And Cyber Week is here.
[1:58:58.980 --> 1:59:01.980]  The best deals of the year.

[1:59:02.980 --> 1:59:04.980]  Triple Patriot points for the first time ever.

[1:59:06.980 --> 1:59:09.980]  Many of these products are lost leaders.
[1:59:09.980 --> 1:59:15.980]  We are only 330 days out from the 2020 election.
[1:59:15.980 --> 1:59:17.980]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:59:17.980 --> 1:59:21.980]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air when almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:25.980]  Yes, we were the first to be censored because we're such a threat to the globalist.
[1:59:25.980 --> 1:59:29.980]  But now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support, we're still on air.
[1:59:29.980 --> 1:59:31.980]  But bigger attacks are already happening.
[1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:32.980]  More are coming.
[1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:37.980]  So please spread the word about the broadcast and fund our operation while getting great products at the same time.
[1:59:37.980 --> 1:59:38.980]  That's true.
[1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:39.980]  360 win.
[1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:40.980]  Cyber Week is here.
[1:59:40.980 --> 1:59:45.980]  Get those Christmas presents for you and your family today at M4store.com.
[1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:51.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:01.980 --> 2:00:04.980]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:00:04.980 --> 2:00:15.980]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:00:15.980 --> 2:00:17.980]  You're taking your phone calls.
[2:00:17.980 --> 2:00:20.980]  The two articles of impeachment are out there on the table.
[2:00:20.980 --> 2:00:23.980]  Not doing what Congress orders the president to do.
[2:00:23.980 --> 2:00:24.980]  It's not a crime.
[2:00:24.980 --> 2:00:26.980]  Abstracting Congress.
[2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:28.980]  And abuse of power.
[2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:31.980]  I've never seen such projection in my life.
[2:00:31.980 --> 2:00:33.980]  Gordon in the beautiful.
[2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:36.980]  Most isolated islands of the planet.
[2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:37.980]  Hawaii.
[2:00:37.980 --> 2:00:38.980]  Gordon here on the air.
[2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:39.980]  Welcome.
[2:00:39.980 --> 2:00:41.980]  Alex, how are you doing?
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:43.980]  Yeah, this is a paradise where I'm at.
[2:00:43.980 --> 2:00:45.980]  I've got some great news for you.
[2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:51.980]  I listen to Hawaii news now and they have their internet thing going and comments.
[2:00:51.980 --> 2:00:56.980]  And they did the no one's above the law headline today.
[2:00:56.980 --> 2:00:58.980]  And I'll tell you, nobody.
[2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:04.980]  And well, then they had a whole bunch of anti Trump garbage on there also.
[2:01:04.980 --> 2:01:13.980]  But nobody is buying this Democrat impeachment garbage because normally it's 90% anti Trump comments.
[2:01:13.980 --> 2:01:17.980]  And today it was 90 plus comments for Trump anti Democrat.
[2:01:17.980 --> 2:01:23.980]  Everybody is furious here in Hawaii with what the Democrats are doing.
[2:01:23.980 --> 2:01:28.980]  And I find that to be good news because we're so left out here.
[2:01:28.980 --> 2:01:33.980]  There were such leftists out here, they threw us out into the middle of the ocean.
[2:01:33.980 --> 2:01:38.980]  And well, that's what I'm seeing is that people fundamentally.
[2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:42.980]  Remember Trump being spied on remember all the crimes being committed.
[2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:47.980]  And now the Democrats are even denying that that happened and everything they're saying Trump's done.
[2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:50.980]  They've done and it's it's it's really backfiring.
[2:01:50.980 --> 2:01:53.980]  How do you expect them to pull out of this?
[2:01:53.980 --> 2:01:58.980]  I don't. There's only one way that we're going to be able to pull out of what's going on.
[2:01:58.980 --> 2:02:01.980]  And that's if Trump does something about this censorship.
[2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:04.980]  I am 100% banned.
[2:02:04.980 --> 2:02:06.980]  I guess shadow banned from the internet.
[2:02:06.980 --> 2:02:11.980]  Now my Facebook, I get absolutely no acknowledgments, no comments.
[2:02:11.980 --> 2:02:13.980]  And I was getting thousands.
[2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:18.980]  I use another IP address.
[2:02:18.980 --> 2:02:25.980]  Create something that's about surfing or and then build a profile on that and then use that for a while.
[2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:26.980]  You just have to keep doing it.
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:28.980]  You have to keep fooling the AI.
[2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:29.980]  It's a war.
[2:02:29.980 --> 2:02:32.980]  We need everyone to get back on there and hit the enemy hard.
[2:02:32.980 --> 2:02:38.980]  Well, you also have to get a new phone because they go by the phone number also.
[2:02:38.980 --> 2:02:40.980]  Yeah, I had my other.
[2:02:40.980 --> 2:02:41.980]  I'm saying it's worth it.
[2:02:41.980 --> 2:02:42.980]  Go get a burner phone.
[2:02:42.980 --> 2:02:43.980]  Use your landline.
[2:02:43.980 --> 2:02:44.980]  Do whatever you have to do.
[2:02:44.980 --> 2:02:46.980]  Just keep in the fight.
[2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:54.980]  That's exactly what I'm going to do is get a whole nother phone because my other Facebook page got taken down because I was on the
[2:02:54.980 --> 2:02:57.980]  Hawaii news now and they accused me of being a Russian bot.
[2:02:57.980 --> 2:02:58.980]  Of course.
[2:02:58.980 --> 2:03:00.980]  And which is everyone that loves freedom.
[2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:01.980]  Everyone that wants justice.
[2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:03.980]  Everyone that wants vaccine safety.
[2:03:03.980 --> 2:03:05.980]  Everyone that wants common sense.
[2:03:05.980 --> 2:03:06.980]  We're all Russians.
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:07.980]  You didn't know that.
[2:03:07.980 --> 2:03:08.980]  Oh, I know.
[2:03:08.980 --> 2:03:09.980]  Yeah.
[2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:10.980]  Thanks, Vlad.
[2:03:10.980 --> 2:03:12.980]  Thank you so much.
[2:03:12.980 --> 2:03:13.980]  Great points, Gordon.
[2:03:13.980 --> 2:03:14.980]  Very exciting.
[2:03:14.980 --> 2:03:19.980]  You see almost all the calls on local news are saying this is a fiasco.
[2:03:19.980 --> 2:03:20.980]  That's what we're seeing.
[2:03:20.980 --> 2:03:22.980]  Let's take another call before we go to break here.
[2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:23.980]  Let's jam in one more.
[2:03:23.980 --> 2:03:26.980]  Let's go to Nick in New Jersey.
[2:03:26.980 --> 2:03:27.980]  Go ahead.
[2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:28.980]  Hi, Alex.
[2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:29.980]  How you doing?
[2:03:29.980 --> 2:03:30.980]  Good brother.
[2:03:30.980 --> 2:03:31.980]  Thanks for calling.
[2:03:31.980 --> 2:03:32.980]  Yes, real quick.
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:37.980]  I just wanted to say I didn't know who you were or what info words was until you guys were banned last year.
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:41.980]  So I'm one of the examples of how it turned on the globalist.
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:42.980]  Beautiful.
[2:03:42.980 --> 2:03:46.980]  So the way we get out as you spread the word, brother, please release me from prison.
[2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:50.980]  Yes, I show my friends a lot of things and, you know, surprisingly, you know, I'm 23.
[2:03:50.980 --> 2:03:55.980]  So a lot of my friends, especially being from New Jersey, are a little liberal, but they
[2:03:55.980 --> 2:03:58.980]  don't disagree with things you say, which, you know, I think when people hear what you
[2:03:58.980 --> 2:04:04.980]  have to say, you know, if they're down to actually critically, I think they take that
[2:04:04.980 --> 2:04:08.980]  information and hopefully they think about what it is they're seeing.
[2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:13.980]  But really, the reason I called you today was one with the impeachment.
[2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:16.980]  I can't remember the man's name now.
[2:04:16.980 --> 2:04:22.980]  Kalani, the one of the four that was talking about how this impeachment is going to only
[2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:25.980]  hurt the Democrats when he was given the testimony.
[2:04:25.980 --> 2:04:29.980]  The funny thing is contributor for CNN and MSNBC.
[2:04:29.980 --> 2:04:34.980]  And after his testimony, I haven't seen him on either network in the last week.
[2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:41.980]  And just that, you know, real quick, you know, my cousin was sending me messages yesterday
[2:04:41.980 --> 2:04:45.980]  that New Jersey, here in New Jersey, as I like to call it, the People's Republic of New Jersey,
[2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:47.980]  they were talking about...
[2:04:47.980 --> 2:04:51.980]  Hold on, I got a guest popping in, but as soon as we come, if you can hold the pop back,
[2:04:51.980 --> 2:04:54.980]  you got to say, well, they're right back, stay with us.

[2:05:54.980 --> 2:06:19.980]  Music playing.
[2:06:19.980 --> 2:06:24.980]  We've taken in more than we ever have. The Democrats are turning them against America.
[2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:27.980]  We have a right to have borders. The Third World's collapsing.
[2:06:27.980 --> 2:06:33.980]  We've got to get control of the drug gangs, the Islamic invasions. Here's some of what he had to say.
[2:06:33.980 --> 2:06:36.980]  Pete Taborska is a congressional candidate from the state of North Carolina.
[2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:41.980]  He has called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration. He joins us tonight.
[2:06:41.980 --> 2:06:46.980]  Pete, thanks so much for coming on tonight. When you say all immigration, do you mean all immigration or is it all illegal immigration?
[2:06:46.980 --> 2:06:50.980]  Sure. So, Tucker, it's important that we define what an immigration moratorium is.
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:54.980]  In this case, it means no net immigration to the United States.
[2:06:54.980 --> 2:06:58.980]  So, about 200,000 people leave the United States every year.
[2:06:58.980 --> 2:06:59.980]  Yes.
[2:06:59.980 --> 2:07:09.980]  Bringing in 200,000 legal aliens would be fine, but bottom line, we would like to have no population increase from legal immigration.
[2:07:09.980 --> 2:07:16.980]  Sure. So, Pete Taborska joins us. Pete for NC.com. He's been on Owen's show, The War Room.
[2:07:16.980 --> 2:07:25.980]  He's been on some of the broadcasts like Firepower with Will Johnson, who's out on the road tonight with crew there in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:32.980]  I'm doing a live broadcast tonight from 6 p.m. until it ends with live feeds and more at band.video and infowars.com.
[2:07:32.980 --> 2:07:38.980]  We're also going to put it out on the radio and TV satellites for TV stations and radio stations that would like to pick that up.
[2:07:38.980 --> 2:07:43.980]  It's going to be pretty powerful, I think, and I think your listeners will be informed by it.
[2:07:43.980 --> 2:07:47.980]  But I want to just talk about the fact that people like this is a radical statement.
[2:07:47.980 --> 2:07:51.980]  You can't immigrate to Saudi Arabia. You can't teach Christianity in Saudi Arabia. You'll get executed.
[2:07:51.980 --> 2:07:56.980]  They didn't take one Islamic refugee, but we've taken millions.
[2:07:56.980 --> 2:07:59.980]  The UN ran our refugee program until two years ago.
[2:07:59.980 --> 2:08:01.980]  Trump took us out of that program.
[2:08:01.980 --> 2:08:06.980]  Now he signed executive orders, blocking even more of it because it's weaponization. Here's some headlines.
[2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:10.980]  Mayors asked Trump to import more refugees to U.S. for cultural diversity.
[2:08:10.980 --> 2:08:12.980]  It's a Breitbart article.
[2:08:12.980 --> 2:08:17.980]  And it goes on to have these mayors saying we need this diversity even if they just live on welfare.
[2:08:17.980 --> 2:08:23.980]  Here's a big government study. 63% of non-citizen households access welfare programs.
[2:08:23.980 --> 2:08:26.980]  In Europe, it's over 80%.
[2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:27.980]  So it goes on from there.
[2:08:27.980 --> 2:08:33.980]  House candidate in North Carolina, our guest, talks about an all-out moratorium,
[2:08:33.980 --> 2:08:37.980]  Sweden rape. Most convicted attackers are foreign-born.
[2:08:37.980 --> 2:08:39.980]  BBC News reports.
[2:08:39.980 --> 2:08:43.980]  In Italy, it's close to 50% of the actual migrants doing it.
[2:08:43.980 --> 2:08:45.980]  Same thing in Sweden.
[2:08:45.980 --> 2:08:50.980]  And we're just supposed to pay for it all and just unvetted, bring people in.
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:53.980]  They call it the Underground Railroad.
[2:08:53.980 --> 2:08:57.980]  Well, people were getting out of something bad going to something good, the Underground Railroad.
[2:08:57.980 --> 2:09:02.980]  But when people are brought here, they're saying America's bad, the left is, but they're bringing them here.
[2:09:02.980 --> 2:09:04.980]  The supposed Nazi command base.
[2:09:04.980 --> 2:09:06.980]  So it's been weaponized.
[2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:07.980]  The globalists are behind it.
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:08.980]  We have to shut it down.
[2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:14.980]  And instead of arguing about it all day and the rest of it, we need to go back to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[2:09:14.980 --> 2:09:20.980]  the power of the presidency that the Supreme Court has confirmed has the power to totally shut down legal and illegal immigration.
[2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:25.980]  And I think we should do it just to show it's our house, it's our country, and it's not going to be used by the UN anymore.
[2:09:25.980 --> 2:09:27.980]  So Pete, thank you for joining us.
[2:09:27.980 --> 2:09:28.980]  Give us your take on the situation.
[2:09:28.980 --> 2:09:34.980]  Your interview last week is the biggest attention I've seen in a long time of a Tucker Carlson interview.
[2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:35.980]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:36.980]  I appreciate it.
[2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:38.980]  It's going to be on with you.
[2:09:38.980 --> 2:09:43.980]  The immigration moratorium is absolutely a necessary policy to implement.
[2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:48.980]  And it's one that, fortunately for us, is gaining steam.
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:55.980]  Like you said, the status quo in most countries around the world is closed borders, right?
[2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:57.980]  I mean, you can't go to Poland without the proper paperwork.
[2:09:57.980 --> 2:09:58.980]  They will send you home.
[2:09:58.980 --> 2:10:02.980]  You can't even go to Botswana without the proper paperwork.
[2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:04.980]  They will send you home.
[2:10:04.980 --> 2:10:07.980]  You know, that's a third world country that we're talking about, right?
[2:10:07.980 --> 2:10:14.980]  So the idea that this is somehow radical is absolutely untrue.
[2:10:14.980 --> 2:10:21.980]  The idea that this hasn't happened before in American history is absolutely untrue for half of the 20th century.
[2:10:21.980 --> 2:10:24.980]  There was an immigration moratorium in the United States.
[2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:32.980]  The fact of the matter is the mass legal immigration to the United States, one million people per year, is not helping us.
[2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:38.980]  It's not helping the conservative cause, because eventually the Republican Party will die by demographics.
[2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:40.980]  And it's not helping us economically.
[2:10:40.980 --> 2:10:47.980]  It's putting, you know, working class people out of jobs and increasingly upper middle class people now out of jobs.
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:57.980]  Right now, Mike Lee, the reposed conservative senator from Utah, is trying to push through this S386,
[2:10:57.980 --> 2:11:00.980]  which is going to increase high-tech worker visas.
[2:11:00.980 --> 2:11:04.980]  He's trying to push it through without a forevote.
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:08.980]  And this is how, you know, our elites behave in Washington, D.C.
[2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:12.980]  It's tried time to get this under control.
[2:11:12.980 --> 2:11:16.980]  And the immigration moratorium is the best place to start.
[2:11:16.980 --> 2:11:25.980]  The issue is Asian immigrants that become citizens tend to become nationalistic and conservative.
[2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:28.980]  A lot of your Indian immigrants do.
[2:11:28.980 --> 2:11:33.980]  But the low-skilled particularly are literally put in to these refugee camps before they get here.
[2:11:33.980 --> 2:11:37.980]  They're taught a U.N. globalist doctrine for up to six months.
[2:11:37.980 --> 2:11:42.980]  Then they're brought here. Democrats pick them up, move them into their houses, collect welfare money off of it.
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:48.980]  Democrats, as you know, now have just a job of managing illegals who they didn't make legal.
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:51.980]  And, I mean, this is a takeover planned by the Democrats.
[2:11:51.980 --> 2:11:54.980]  This is a Democrat race-based system.
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:12:00.980]  It's not that the Christian ethos of the West unify us all under Christianity is a bad thing.
[2:12:00.980 --> 2:12:02.980]  It's a great thing. It's under attack.
[2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:08.980]  So we're not having people go through the melting pot of Christianity or the love of Western civilization.
[2:12:08.980 --> 2:12:12.980]  Instead, they're being recruited and brought in by the globalists who want to end the nation in their own admissions.
[2:12:12.980 --> 2:12:18.980]  And I have all these clips every week to come out of universities and Democrats saying white people are bad.
[2:12:18.980 --> 2:12:22.980]  Thank God America isn't white anymore. The demographics will be communist now.
[2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:26.980]  Well, only because they're teaching brown people to hate America and be communist.
[2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:31.980]  And until that stops, we've got to have a moratorium because they're teaching the brown people that white people are bad
[2:12:31.980 --> 2:12:34.980]  when we're the people that ended the damn slavery worldwide.
[2:12:34.980 --> 2:12:36.980]  I'm sick of it.
[2:12:36.980 --> 2:12:39.980]  Yeah, of course. The whole premise is absurd.
[2:12:39.980 --> 2:12:44.980]  I mean, you have three out of four legal imprints that come here will vote for Democrats.
[2:12:44.980 --> 2:12:47.980]  So they're voting to end America as we know it.
[2:12:47.980 --> 2:12:51.980]  They're going to vote for the socialist policies that conservatives claim that they hate.
[2:12:51.980 --> 2:12:54.980]  That, you know, folks, and I named them by name.
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:56.980]  I'll name them by name again because the people who are doing this to-
[2:12:56.980 --> 2:13:01.980]  No, it's true. And Republicans keep thinking they roll a red carpet out and give all the free goodies to people.
[2:13:01.980 --> 2:13:06.980]  Whether they be black, white, old, young, they're going to be nice. No, they're being indoctrinated by Democrats.
[2:13:06.980 --> 2:13:11.980]  They're controlled by Democrats as a permanent underclass and they're voting to end the nation.
[2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:15.980]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all. The leg is cut off.
[2:13:15.980 --> 2:13:23.980]  So if we don't tie a tourniquet on it, turn the brainwashing off and recruit these people to America, we're already going to be sunk.
[2:13:23.980 --> 2:13:30.980]  That's right. 100 percent. And so, fortunately, you know, this conversation is entering the mainstream now.
[2:13:30.980 --> 2:13:36.980]  I know for a fact that there will be other congressional candidates in the 2020 cycle calling for an immigration moratorium.
[2:13:36.980 --> 2:13:44.980]  It is an idea whose time has come as much as the DC elites on both sides want to call this idea fringe.
[2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:47.980]  They say it's a fringe idea. That's just not true.
[2:13:47.980 --> 2:13:54.980]  The response I've gotten since going on Tucker's show has been overwhelmingly positive from ordinary conservatives all around the country.
[2:13:54.980 --> 2:14:00.980]  I don't just hide stuff and say it for no reason. I mean, Tucker hasn't gotten this much attention. He gets huge attention all the time.
[2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:07.980]  He's awesome. And I can't remember like six months. This is like the hottest thing on the show, which shows people want this.
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:19.980]  Yes. 100 percent. I mean, I started running this campaign in August, Alex, because in my mind as an ordinary American myself, somebody who grew up in the working class, it just makes sense, right?
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:22.980]  It's what we need at this particular moment.
[2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:29.980]  When the big corporations are bringing people in and recruiting them to hate you and politically see you as the enemy, you better stop it.
[2:14:29.980 --> 2:14:36.980]  Yeah, it seems like it would be common sense, right? But unfortunately, our DC elites don't have much of that.
[2:14:36.980 --> 2:14:41.980]  And they want to paint us as fringe when really their ideas are the French ones.
[2:14:41.980 --> 2:14:54.980]  I mean, you've got the Mexican border police military being and they're not wimps being overrun by huge hordes of people from Africa, not even Latin America.
[2:14:54.980 --> 2:15:00.980]  And there's huge caravans of 20,000 smashing across and left this grabbing them with open arms.
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:05.980]  The other side, you better get control of that. This is this is road warrior stuff.
[2:15:05.980 --> 2:15:10.980]  Yeah, that's right. I mean, Mexico is a failed client state of the United States anyways, right?
[2:15:10.980 --> 2:15:17.980]  So it's time for us to close the borders and then maybe start to focus on how Mexico can not be a failed state anymore.
[2:15:17.980 --> 2:15:23.980]  Considering it's right there on our border and people from all over the world, not just from Latin America, sneak in through their borders.
[2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:27.980]  I mean, you can go to the Texas border, Alice, I'm sure you know this.
[2:15:27.980 --> 2:15:32.980]  In the middle of the desert, they have signs trying to make sure people don't get lost.
[2:15:32.980 --> 2:15:34.980]  Illegal aliens who have crossed the league don't get lost.
[2:15:34.980 --> 2:15:39.980]  And the languages on the signs are Arabic, Chinese, Al-Khanzl, not just Spanish.
[2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:43.980]  80% of the women coming across get raped, not by us, but on the other side.
[2:15:43.980 --> 2:15:47.980]  And it's a total hellhole with children being killed, but it's all our fault.
[2:15:47.980 --> 2:16:13.980]  When we come back, we'll talk about why this is so hot and exploded. Stay with us.
[2:16:17.980 --> 2:16:22.980]  Trust your family survival to SurvivalisCamps.com.
[2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:52.980]  That's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[2:16:52.980 --> 2:16:55.980]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:16:55.980 --> 2:17:00.980]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[2:17:00.980 --> 2:17:02.980]  But the symptoms are there.
[2:17:02.980 --> 2:17:10.980]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:17:10.980 --> 2:17:16.980]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:17:16.980 --> 2:17:20.980]  High blood pressure has normalized my diabetes, has totally improved.
[2:17:20.980 --> 2:17:24.980]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:17:24.980 --> 2:17:26.980]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:17:26.980 --> 2:17:34.980]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:17:54.980 --> 2:18:04.980]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival and we're a war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence.
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:12.980]  That's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families, trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[2:18:12.980 --> 2:18:23.980]  Well, Info Wars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[2:18:23.980 --> 2:18:30.980]  That's why we're running Giant Cyber Week Specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:36.980]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[2:18:36.980 --> 2:18:45.980]  Don't do your shopping with the new world order, Amazon, do it with Info Wars store, get high quality supplements, get high quality air filtration, water filtration,
[2:18:45.980 --> 2:18:53.980]  patron apparel, and so much more in every order gets a whole bunch of free Info Wars bumper stickers to spread the word. Take action, folks.
[2:18:53.980 --> 2:19:05.980]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate Info Wars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:15.980]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[2:19:15.980 --> 2:19:25.980]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves,
[2:19:25.980 --> 2:19:31.980]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:19:31.980 --> 2:19:41.980]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:19:41.980 --> 2:20:05.980]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive, they fear the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:35.980]  In Europe, they will arrest you. I see the news all the time. If you say that a man can't have a baby, they'll fire nurses in Canada and England.
[2:20:35.980 --> 2:20:46.980]  When a man comes in with tattoos and a big beard and spreads his legs in the chair, a gynecologist says, check my cervix.
[2:20:46.980 --> 2:20:55.980]  The nurse says, sir, you don't have a cervix. He says, you get me that manager and they get fired.
[2:20:55.980 --> 2:21:06.980]  I've got articles of that coming up. Now, I'm going to go through all your calls.
[2:21:06.980 --> 2:21:21.980]  I don't mean to run over our guests. He starts exciting me when I talk about this subject because it's such a no-brainer that the third world's exploding in population doubling every 20 years.
[2:21:21.980 --> 2:21:27.980]  It's Islam. It's about to be 3 billion. It's 1.8 billion in change.
[2:21:27.980 --> 2:21:37.980]  And these are all centralized systems. I mean, China is the most racist country in the world against Japanese, against Koreans.
[2:21:37.980 --> 2:21:43.980]  I mean, if you study the history, there's about seven different ethnic groups of Chinese. They won't even really work with each other.
[2:21:43.980 --> 2:21:47.980]  I'm not putting Chinese people down. It's just a fact.
[2:21:47.980 --> 2:21:52.980]  They don't allow Islam there. But again, the left loves communist China.
[2:21:52.980 --> 2:21:59.980]  So this idea that we have any doors on our house is bad, is insane.
[2:21:59.980 --> 2:22:06.980]  So going back to Peter DeBrosco's running for Congress in North Carolina, Pete Four, NC.com.
[2:22:06.980 --> 2:22:09.980]  And the time we have left, if you've got the floor, I'll stop ranting.
[2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:18.980]  It's just what you're saying absolutely is popular, is the most read articles at town hall, is the most popular thing on Tucker Carlson.
[2:22:18.980 --> 2:22:21.980]  I'm always proud of him. Full Wars is an incubator we've had you on for months.
[2:22:21.980 --> 2:22:25.980]  Obviously, with the audience helping get you to that level, that's what it's all about a team effort.
[2:22:25.980 --> 2:22:33.980]  Showing as a beta test what you're saying is common sense like, hey, have oxygen tanks when you go diving on your feet underwater.
[2:22:33.980 --> 2:22:39.980]  Or, hey, when you go into the Arctic, have a coat and some shoes, and maybe a compass. I mean, we need borders.
[2:22:39.980 --> 2:22:45.980]  There's a reason borders were developed, especially when you're surrounded by third world countries. Please continue.
[2:22:45.980 --> 2:22:52.980]  Yeah, absolutely. And for the record, your show is five, ten years ahead of the mainstream press.
[2:22:52.980 --> 2:22:56.980]  Always has been. Has been since I started watching in 2015.
[2:22:56.980 --> 2:23:00.980]  So you guys get all the credit for perpetuating the ideas that are popular.
[2:23:00.980 --> 2:23:06.980]  You the audience of supporters. And what I love is audiences, people like you taking action.
[2:23:06.980 --> 2:23:09.980]  I bet you get into Congress. But regardless, you're kicking ass.
[2:23:09.980 --> 2:23:15.980]  You're now on the national news with the leading story just by taking action. You are the resistance.
[2:23:15.980 --> 2:23:19.980]  You're the badass. You're the badass, Pete.
[2:23:19.980 --> 2:23:23.980]  Well, look, I'm doing my best to fight for ordinary people and I will continue to do so.
[2:23:23.980 --> 2:23:32.980]  Now, you're exactly right, Alice, when you say that this idea is a no brainer, which is why our DC elites don't get it because they have no brains.
[2:23:32.980 --> 2:23:40.980]  But the point I really want to make here is that this idea is not going away. America first is rising.
[2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:48.980]  So when you see the political left and when you see this sort of bought and paid for conservatives trying to trample over us,
[2:23:48.980 --> 2:23:52.980]  trying to act like our ideas are not mainstream, that's because they're afraid of us.
[2:23:52.980 --> 2:23:57.980]  That's why Georgia is running around policing us, saying ban this person, ban that person.
[2:23:57.980 --> 2:23:59.980]  What an un-American sack of filth.
[2:23:59.980 --> 2:24:05.980]  That's right. And for some reason, these people seem to think that once President Trump is gone, whether they impeach him,
[2:24:05.980 --> 2:24:13.980]  whether he doesn't get reelected in 2020 or after 2024, they seem to think that we're going back to the old globalist, you know, fake two-party...
[2:24:13.980 --> 2:24:18.980]  Yeah, no, you destroy Trump. It makes us even more strong. And I don't want that to happen.
[2:24:18.980 --> 2:24:24.980]  But they don't know history. Why do you think leftists think one-dimensionally? What's their problem?
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:29.980]  You know, I'm not exactly sure. They are good long-term strategists.
[2:24:29.980 --> 2:24:33.980]  If you look over the past 50 years, they've accomplished pretty much every goal that they set out.
[2:24:33.980 --> 2:24:37.980]  I get it. You said they don't make sense it looked one-dimensional because they're actually long-term players
[2:24:37.980 --> 2:24:41.980]  and the people we see are just minions carrying out orders. That's why they look so stupid.
[2:24:41.980 --> 2:24:43.980]  But the brains behind it is actually very calculated.
[2:24:43.980 --> 2:24:49.980]  That's right. And the Republicans have the exact opposite sort of problems, right?
[2:24:49.980 --> 2:24:55.980]  But, you know, regardless of what happens to the president, the idea of America first has been ceded.
[2:24:55.980 --> 2:25:01.980]  And it's not going away. So if the people in Washington, D.C., think that once Trump is gone,
[2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:06.980]  that we're going to go back to this sort of globalist two-party system, they're wrong.
[2:25:06.980 --> 2:25:14.980]  People understand that America must finally be put first after years and years of corporate pillaging and plundering
[2:25:14.980 --> 2:25:22.980]  and putting our citizens last behind the interests of literally the entire rest of the world.
[2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:27.980]  It's just not going to happen anymore. There are people like me who are ordinary, average Americans.
[2:25:27.980 --> 2:25:31.980]  We are everywhere. We are walking among everybody.
[2:25:31.980 --> 2:25:36.980]  We're not going to let the United States go by the wayside without a fight.
[2:25:36.980 --> 2:25:41.980]  Regardless of what the people in D.C. want to do, regardless of how much they try and sell us out to foreign powers,
[2:25:41.980 --> 2:25:43.980]  it's simply not going to happen.
[2:25:43.980 --> 2:25:47.980]  That's right. Once you're awake, there's no turning that off again, is there?
[2:25:47.980 --> 2:25:53.980]  No, you can't do it. I mean, you know, five years ago, six years ago, I wasn't even involved in politics.
[2:25:53.980 --> 2:25:55.980]  I never had even had—
[2:25:55.980 --> 2:25:57.980]  What woke you up?
[2:25:57.980 --> 2:26:01.980]  Well, I decided I wanted to be informed going into the 2016 election.
[2:26:01.980 --> 2:26:03.980]  I mean, now you've got radio shows. Now you've written books that are selling well.
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:06.980]  Now you're running for Congress. Now you're on Tucker Carlson. Now you've got one of the—
[2:26:06.980 --> 2:26:08.980]  I mean, yeah, what triggered you?
[2:26:08.980 --> 2:26:13.980]  All that happened was I decided to turn on the news going—
[2:26:13.980 --> 2:26:17.980]  I mean, in early 2015, I said, I'm going to be informed going into the 2016 election.
[2:26:17.980 --> 2:26:22.980]  I feel like it's my duty as a citizen, and I realized it was all nonsense from the beginning.
[2:26:22.980 --> 2:26:26.980]  So what do you do when you realize the mainstream press is all nonsense when you start turning to the alternative press?
[2:26:26.980 --> 2:26:30.980]  So I started watching your show. I started reading news sites like Breitbart.
[2:26:30.980 --> 2:26:37.980]  That's critical. You had an impetus. You had a hunger separate from Alex Jones triggering you.
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:44.980]  Everybody else is the same. People are seeking. And once you're seeking, there's no hiding anything.
[2:26:44.980 --> 2:26:49.980]  That's right. And you can't put the toothpaste back in tubes. Our friend, Roger Stone, likes to say.
[2:26:49.980 --> 2:26:54.980]  So, you know, once you realize that the corporate press is totally phony, you start wondering,
[2:26:54.980 --> 2:26:57.980]  well, why am I being lied to on a daily basis consistently?
[2:26:57.980 --> 2:27:00.980]  What is it that they're trying to hide from me that I should actually know?
[2:27:00.980 --> 2:27:06.980]  And once you start seeking out the answers to those questions, you start, you know, becoming a voracious reader.
[2:27:06.980 --> 2:27:09.980]  There's more answers, and more answers, and then it's not work to be informed.
[2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:11.980]  Once it's real info, it's exciting.
[2:27:11.980 --> 2:27:14.980]  That's right. Absolutely. And you want to keep going. And you want to keep learning.
[2:27:14.980 --> 2:27:18.980]  And you want to tell everybody else around you what it is that you've learned.
[2:27:18.980 --> 2:27:22.980]  And I've become, I know, a pain to my friends and family by doing that.
[2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:26.980]  But again, you know, this is our duty as Americans is our duty to be informed.
[2:27:26.980 --> 2:27:30.980]  Well, that's like physical therapy. People that don't want to hear their family tell them what's really going on.
[2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:33.980]  That's because they're living in a shell because they're basically paralyzed.
[2:27:33.980 --> 2:27:37.980]  And if somebody's been paralyzed for a year and they finally get their spine fixed,
[2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:40.980]  and some of you're trying to get them to walk again, they're going to be yelling at you and telling you,
[2:27:40.980 --> 2:27:44.980]  hey, don't make me get out of this wheelchair. No, you're getting out of the wheelchair. Damn it.
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:45.980]  Yes.
[2:27:45.980 --> 2:27:50.980]  Well, look, I have great family and friends personally who, you know, listen in support
[2:27:50.980 --> 2:27:54.980]  and have been, oh, no, I know, but you're just saying there's still some that you pay. Yeah.
[2:27:54.980 --> 2:27:57.980]  But, you know, obviously it gets tiresome, right?
[2:27:57.980 --> 2:28:02.980]  I mean, we're engulfed in this, in this sort of daily political battle.
[2:28:02.980 --> 2:28:05.980]  And some people just don't want to do it. I understand that impulse, but also, you know,
[2:28:05.980 --> 2:28:09.980]  on the other side of the token, understand how important it is to do this.
[2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:12.980]  We must do this. We do not have a choice.
[2:28:12.980 --> 2:28:17.980]  Otherwise, our way of life will be ended forever. It is that dire of that's right.
[2:28:17.980 --> 2:28:21.980]  We're being conquered. We're being overwritten. This is a global takeover in their own admissions.
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:26.980]  UN replacement migration. The ADL says if you say that, that you're a liar.
[2:28:26.980 --> 2:28:28.980]  That's in the UN documents. It's public.
[2:28:28.980 --> 2:28:35.980]  All right. Pete4NC.com. Peter, thank you so much. We look forward to speaking to you again. Please join us again.
[2:28:35.980 --> 2:28:37.980]  Thank you, Alistair. I mean, I appreciate it.
[2:28:37.980 --> 2:28:41.980]  That guy gets me going. Everything he says is like, yeah, let's back that up.
[2:28:41.980 --> 2:28:44.980]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now. I want to hear from the callers. We already took some.
[2:28:44.980 --> 2:28:49.980]  We're having a lot right now. Get ready for Nick in New Jersey, Ryan in Florida,
[2:28:49.980 --> 2:28:52.980]  Tyler in California, Joseph in Ireland.
[2:28:52.980 --> 2:28:57.980]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:57.980 --> 2:29:01.980]  You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:01.980 --> 2:29:07.980]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:07.980 --> 2:29:12.980]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:12.980 --> 2:29:17.980]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:17.980 --> 2:29:20.980]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:27.980]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:27.980 --> 2:29:33.980]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:33.980 --> 2:29:39.980]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[2:29:39.980 --> 2:29:43.980]  800-506-6740.
[2:29:43.980 --> 2:29:47.980]  800-506-6740.
[2:29:47.980 --> 2:29:53.980]  That's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:53.980 --> 2:29:57.980]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically.
[2:29:57.980 --> 2:30:01.980]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[2:30:01.980 --> 2:30:05.980]  There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[2:30:05.980 --> 2:30:09.980]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:17.980]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system
[2:30:17.980 --> 2:30:21.980]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[2:30:21.980 --> 2:30:26.980]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[2:30:26.980 --> 2:30:29.980]  which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[2:30:29.980 --> 2:30:32.980]  110% God will finish the move.
[2:30:32.980 --> 2:30:36.980]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[2:30:36.980 --> 2:30:38.980]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist.
[2:30:38.980 --> 2:30:42.980]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight
[2:30:42.980 --> 2:30:45.980]  for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[2:30:45.980 --> 2:30:50.980]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[2:30:50.980 --> 2:30:52.980]  Because we're in this together.
[2:30:52.980 --> 2:31:02.980]  MoreStore.com.
[2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:27.980]  Until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[2:31:27.980 --> 2:31:32.980]  than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God,
[2:31:32.980 --> 2:31:40.980]  believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[2:31:40.980 --> 2:31:45.980]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[2:31:45.980 --> 2:31:47.980]  This is the post-human error.
[2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:50.980]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[2:31:50.980 --> 2:31:53.980]  This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.

[2:33:24.980 --> 2:33:30.980]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:32.980 --> 2:33:37.980]  There's reporting going on right now from Fox News and others in New Jersey
[2:33:37.980 --> 2:33:40.980]  of men in black trench coats with long guns.
[2:33:40.980 --> 2:33:44.980]  Let's pray it's not a false flag.
[2:33:44.980 --> 2:33:47.980]  Let's pray that whoever's doing it gets taken out quickly,
[2:33:47.980 --> 2:33:50.980]  but they're talking about organizing a police response as we speak.
[2:33:50.980 --> 2:33:53.980]  This is happening live right now.
[2:33:53.980 --> 2:33:57.980]  Brand new information now on the active shooter situation in Jersey City, New Jersey.
[2:33:57.980 --> 2:34:02.980]  Let's go back to Brian Yenis. He is on the scene. Brian?
[2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:06.980]  Dana, we've just been told by federal law enforcement source that that's school,
[2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:10.980]  the Sacred Heart School, across from this kosher supermarket where this happened.
[2:34:10.980 --> 2:34:16.980]  We're calling it a bodega. It's a small kosher supermarket has been cleared.
[2:34:16.980 --> 2:34:20.980]  That school, Sacred Heart, has been cleared. No children are in danger,
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:22.980]  but they are now looking for a third suspect.
[2:34:22.980 --> 2:34:27.980]  There was a male and a female suspect that had been taken down by police,
[2:34:27.980 --> 2:34:34.980]  dressed in all black, and now they're looking for a black male dressed in all black.
[2:34:34.980 --> 2:34:36.980]  That is a third suspect they are now looking for.
[2:34:36.980 --> 2:34:40.980]  Obviously the scene is still very much active,
[2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:44.980]  but the good news here is that that school has been cleared,
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:47.980]  and from what we understand, the children are safe.
[2:34:47.980 --> 2:34:49.980]  Dana?
[2:34:49.980 --> 2:34:51.980]  Police officer has been shot in the head.
[2:34:51.980 --> 2:34:53.980]  Children on their way home.
[2:34:53.980 --> 2:34:56.980]  We'll continue monitoring that situation and update you as news breaks,
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:59.980]  but right now House Democrats announcing two articles of impeachment.
[2:34:59.980 --> 2:35:01.980]  Let's cut away from that live feed.
[2:35:01.980 --> 2:35:05.980]  We are getting the latest for you right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:08.980]  We have a police officer who has been shot in the head,
[2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:13.980]  and we don't know exactly what's going on right now,
[2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:17.980]  but we are going to get you the latest up on infowars.com.
[2:35:17.980 --> 2:35:22.980]  I'm sure drudgereport.com is always really good about having what's happening as it breaks.
[2:35:22.980 --> 2:35:24.980]  This does not look good.
[2:35:24.980 --> 2:35:28.980]  A bunch of police and SWAT gear running around, and police officers shot in the head,
[2:35:28.980 --> 2:35:37.980]  and they were saying it's, again, a church and then something to do with other businesses,
[2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:42.980]  so we're going to continue to follow that as it unfolds,
[2:35:42.980 --> 2:35:45.980]  and obviously hoping that nobody else has been hurt,
[2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:49.980]  and it could be drug-related, or it could be a staged event,
[2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:51.980]  or it could be an actual real event.
[2:35:51.980 --> 2:35:55.980]  It's totally normal to question any event to try to get the latest on what happens,
[2:35:55.980 --> 2:35:58.980]  because there have been so many events that have been staged,
[2:35:58.980 --> 2:36:01.980]  like babies and incubators having their brains bashed out and thrown on the ground
[2:36:01.980 --> 2:36:03.980]  to start the First Iraq War,
[2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:06.980]  or the fake WMDs to have the second one, or the Gulf of Tonkin,
[2:36:06.980 --> 2:36:08.980]  to start the Vietnam War officially in 1964,
[2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:11.980]  or Operation Northwood is the plan to do mass shootings inside the U.S.
[2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:14.980]  to blame it on the Soviet Union to start a war,
[2:36:14.980 --> 2:36:19.980]  or does he small at staging events, or all the other hundreds and hundreds of events,
[2:36:19.980 --> 2:36:22.980]  but most of these shootings are real and do indeed happen,
[2:36:22.980 --> 2:36:25.980]  in the case of Texas and Ohio,
[2:36:25.980 --> 2:36:30.980]  it was a false media report that they were Trump supporters,
[2:36:30.980 --> 2:36:32.980]  they were actually Democrat supporters,
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:37.980]  so this footage is, I guess, a group of police have gotten together
[2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:43.980]  to try to stop what's happening.
[2:36:43.980 --> 2:36:47.980]  This is Jersey's city footage right here,
[2:36:47.980 --> 2:36:52.980]  I'm supposedly the police looking for who's doing this.
[2:36:52.980 --> 2:36:55.980]  Again, I may just go to rebroadcast while I get some articles
[2:36:55.980 --> 2:36:57.980]  and figure out exactly what's going on real quick,
[2:36:57.980 --> 2:37:03.980]  because too much is unfolding and happening here, I've got to find out.
[2:37:03.980 --> 2:37:09.980]  Nick in New Jersey, go ahead and finish up your point.
[2:37:09.980 --> 2:37:11.980]  Well, just real quick,
[2:37:11.980 --> 2:37:13.980]  my prayers go out for that police officer,
[2:37:13.980 --> 2:37:15.980]  but I'm not surprised stuff like this happens in New Jersey
[2:37:15.980 --> 2:37:17.980]  with our governor and our attorney general,
[2:37:17.980 --> 2:37:22.980]  so when sheriff's departments who aren't in compliance with
[2:37:22.980 --> 2:37:25.980]  or who want to comply with federal law and the department,
[2:37:25.980 --> 2:37:29.980]  I mean with ICE, so New Jersey's got its own problems,
[2:37:29.980 --> 2:37:33.980]  but as far as what I wanted to say earlier was with the impeachment,
[2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:39.980]  with Turley giving his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee,
[2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:43.980]  he's a commentator for CNN and MSNBC,
[2:37:43.980 --> 2:37:47.980]  and after his testimony, it's not surprising that he's not on there to explain
[2:37:47.980 --> 2:37:51.980]  why he sees what the Democrats is doing as actually hurting
[2:37:51.980 --> 2:37:54.980]  our republic hurting or going against our constitution.
[2:37:54.980 --> 2:37:58.980]  And I mean, it just goes to show that the level of brainwashing
[2:37:58.980 --> 2:38:03.980]  that these network television shows, due to the American people,
[2:38:03.980 --> 2:38:04.980]  because there's people who hear this stuff,
[2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:06.980]  they don't look into things themselves,
[2:38:06.980 --> 2:38:08.980]  they don't read for themselves,
[2:38:08.980 --> 2:38:10.980]  they just take what they hear verbatim.
[2:38:10.980 --> 2:38:13.980]  And that's the scary thing is you've got informed people
[2:38:13.980 --> 2:38:14.980]  that ask questions or involved,
[2:38:14.980 --> 2:38:16.980]  and the system is trying to make that illegal,
[2:38:16.980 --> 2:38:19.980]  and then you've got those that literally believe I'm a Russian agent
[2:38:19.980 --> 2:38:21.980]  and believe that Devin Nunes is a Russian agent.
[2:38:21.980 --> 2:38:24.980]  He has people come and get in his face in New York
[2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:26.980]  with a grandfather with little kids and say,
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:28.980]  we're going to get you, you're a Russian agent.
[2:38:28.980 --> 2:38:30.980]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[2:38:30.980 --> 2:38:31.980]  By the way, here's the latest.
[2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:35.980]  We've got multiple agencies respond to active shooting situations in New Jersey,
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:42.980]  heavy gunfire reported, that's from CNN, KTLA, Channel 5 News.
[2:38:42.980 --> 2:38:45.980]  Law enforcement responds to shooting in New Jersey,
[2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:48.980]  at least one officer shot, so it could just be drug related,
[2:38:48.980 --> 2:38:50.980]  regardless it's still terrible.
[2:38:50.980 --> 2:38:53.980]  An active shooting situation is underway in New Jersey,
[2:38:53.980 --> 2:38:55.980]  New Jersey Sheriff's Office says,
[2:38:55.980 --> 2:38:59.980]  police officer shot and had an active shooting situation in New Jersey,
[2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:01.980]  nothing else is really known.
[2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:04.980]  At this time, we will track that as it unfolds,
[2:39:04.980 --> 2:39:08.980]  but this is certainly an important story.
[2:39:08.980 --> 2:39:12.980]  But you know, millions of people are dying from opium-related deaths a year,
[2:39:12.980 --> 2:39:14.980]  hundreds of thousands from fentanyl alone, it's getting worse.
[2:39:14.980 --> 2:39:18.980]  Everyone I know has family that's died from fentanyl alone,
[2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:20.980]  the China shipping in.
[2:39:20.980 --> 2:39:24.980]  Somebody dies from fentanyl, doesn't even make the news.
[2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:27.980]  And you know, your teenage child thinks they're getting a vape pen,
[2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.980]  it's got an off-market cartridge in it.
[2:39:29.980 --> 2:39:32.980]  Some of those have got fentanyl on them,
[2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:36.980]  and people are taking one puff and dropping dead.
[2:39:36.980 --> 2:39:38.980]  But you don't see a big buildup for that,
[2:39:38.980 --> 2:39:43.980]  because that's just chemical warfare.
[2:39:43.980 --> 2:39:45.980]  But when one person gets shot,
[2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:47.980]  and I'm glad there's a big response, there's a big response,
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:50.980]  lead a big response to the scourge of GMO,
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:53.980]  or the millions of kids that have gotten brain damage,
[2:39:53.980 --> 2:39:55.980]  the thousands that have died from vaccines, they admit,
[2:39:55.980 --> 2:39:57.980]  but you're not supposed to talk about.
[2:39:57.980 --> 2:40:00.980]  All right, let's go to Ireland, and then we'll go to Tyler and Ryan.
[2:40:00.980 --> 2:40:02.980]  Joseph in Ireland, thanks for calling, thanks for holding.
[2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:05.980]  Welcome, give us your take on the historic events taking place.
[2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:07.980]  Alex, how are you?
[2:40:07.980 --> 2:40:10.980]  I'll try and make my point as quick as I can.
[2:40:10.980 --> 2:40:14.980]  To me, you have to prioritize the problems.
[2:40:14.980 --> 2:40:17.980]  The one you've been banging on about is the tech censorship.
[2:40:17.980 --> 2:40:20.980]  But to me, it has to be number one,
[2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:22.980]  Trump has to come out and say,
[2:40:22.980 --> 2:40:27.980]  I will not accept results when any machine is owned, controlled,
[2:40:27.980 --> 2:40:31.980]  or run by a foreign company, or any company is connected
[2:40:31.980 --> 2:40:34.980]  to a Democrat donor, Democrat party person.
[2:40:34.980 --> 2:40:37.980]  He must come out and say it, and he's got to say,
[2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:39.980]  I will not accept the results.
[2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:41.980]  And turn it back on the Democrats and say,
[2:40:41.980 --> 2:40:43.980]  this is foreign election meddling.
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:45.980]  I think this is priority one,
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:48.980]  because I watched the Millie Weaver's report
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:52.980]  on the election fraud there in the United States.
[2:40:52.980 --> 2:40:54.980]  To me, it's number one.
[2:40:54.980 --> 2:40:56.980]  Number two is what the last guy was talking about,
[2:40:56.980 --> 2:40:59.980]  and number three is the tech censorship.
[2:40:59.980 --> 2:41:02.980]  Number two, but number two and three are quite...
[2:41:02.980 --> 2:41:05.980]  Let me stop you, and I'm one trillion percent agree with you.
[2:41:05.980 --> 2:41:07.980]  I was thinking that last night that I've got to talk about,
[2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:09.980]  Trump needs to challenge any election
[2:41:09.980 --> 2:41:11.980]  that has foreign owned or mysterious machines.
[2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:13.980]  The Democrats, Nadler said,
[2:41:13.980 --> 2:41:16.980]  Trump's getting ready to steal the election again.
[2:41:16.980 --> 2:41:18.980]  Well, he didn't steal the first one,
[2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:20.980]  so they're going to challenge it
[2:41:20.980 --> 2:41:22.980]  when they're the ones of the fraudsters.
[2:41:22.980 --> 2:41:24.980]  So you're absolutely right.
[2:41:24.980 --> 2:41:27.980]  And you've seen the last three special elections,
[2:41:27.980 --> 2:41:29.980]  though the Republicans were supposed to win,
[2:41:29.980 --> 2:41:31.980]  the Democrats have won,
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:34.980]  and then you find the fixes in Virginia,
[2:41:34.980 --> 2:41:36.980]  in Kentucky, in Louisiana.
[2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:38.980]  You're absolutely right. Please continue.
[2:41:38.980 --> 2:41:40.980]  There is no way Trump will win.
[2:41:40.980 --> 2:41:43.980]  It doesn't matter if 90 percent of the people vote for him.
[2:41:43.980 --> 2:41:45.980]  If you control the machines,
[2:41:45.980 --> 2:41:48.980]  and the machines, you can't get the information
[2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:51.980]  as many showed that it's foreign control.
[2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:53.980]  This is foreign election meddling.
[2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:55.980]  He has got to come out.
[2:41:55.980 --> 2:41:57.980]  Be damned what the media say.
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:41:59.980]  Oh, he's a tyrant or whatever.
[2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:01.980]  No, turn it back on them and say,
[2:42:01.980 --> 2:42:03.980]  no, this is foreign election meddling,
[2:42:03.980 --> 2:42:05.980]  and show the proof.
[2:42:05.980 --> 2:42:07.980]  This has to be number one.
[2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:09.980]  Everything else falls.
[2:42:09.980 --> 2:42:11.980]  It doesn't matter if you sort out the immigration thing.
[2:42:11.980 --> 2:42:14.980]  It doesn't matter if you stop the text meddling,
[2:42:14.980 --> 2:42:16.980]  which is total racketeering.
[2:42:16.980 --> 2:42:19.980]  You're right. It's fraud from top to bottom.
[2:42:19.980 --> 2:42:21.980]  I mean, that's my point.
[2:42:21.980 --> 2:42:23.980]  Can I make one other point?
[2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:25.980]  Yes, sir, please.
[2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:27.980]  The other point I want to make is,
[2:42:27.980 --> 2:42:29.980]  this is a spiritual battle.
[2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:31.980]  You're dealing with pure evil people.
[2:42:31.980 --> 2:42:33.980]  God is going to enter the ring here, Alex.
[2:42:33.980 --> 2:42:35.980]  Don't hang up, Joseph.
[2:42:35.980 --> 2:42:37.980]  You've been holding from Ireland.
[2:42:37.980 --> 2:42:39.980]  Plus, I love your voice and everything you're saying.
[2:42:39.980 --> 2:42:41.980]  So true. Stay there and finish up.
[2:42:41.980 --> 2:42:43.980]  You're right. God's about to enter the ring.
[2:42:43.980 --> 2:42:45.980]  And that's the thing.
[2:42:45.980 --> 2:42:47.980]  Aren't you scared of the globalist?
[2:42:47.980 --> 2:42:49.980]  Folks, I can feel fear,
[2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:51.980]  like, shit, like, that chill you get?
[2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:53.980]  That's God. It's like, whoa.
[2:42:53.980 --> 2:42:55.980]  Sometimes the right thing to do
[2:42:55.980 --> 2:42:57.980]  is the easy thing to do.
[2:42:57.980 --> 2:42:59.980]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[2:42:59.980 --> 2:43:01.980]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:03.980]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[2:43:03.980 --> 2:43:05.980]  And it's ever been easier
[2:43:05.980 --> 2:43:07.980]  to do the right thing this Christmas season
[2:43:07.980 --> 2:43:09.980]  than to go to M4warstore.com

[2:43:35.980 --> 2:43:37.980]  and the big globalist online merchants
[2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:39.980]  who literally are working against you
