[00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:17.299]  Is the President of the United States above the law?
[00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.542]  No person is above the law.
[00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:22.882]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.123]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.863]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:27.884]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.465]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:30.545]  He's certainly not above the law.
[00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:31.566]  Nobody's above the law.
[00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.606]  No one is above the law.
[00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:38.048]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:41.130]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.231]  This President believes he is above the law.
[00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:47.074]  And no one, not even the President, should be above the law.
[00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:50.336]  No one is above the law, and certainly not the President.
[00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:51.136]  Oh my God!
[00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:54.599]  Again I'll repeat, no one, not even the President, is above the law.
[00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.300]  Oh my God, do you know what this means?
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.360]  We finally got him!
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.821]  We have a President who believes he is above the law.
[00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:03.122]  The President is not above the law.
[00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:06.004]  We have a President who believes he is above the law.
[00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.825]  He is not, as some people have tried to suggest, above the law.
[00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.006]  The President is declaring himself above the law.
[00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.508]  No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.
[00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:19.711]  Donald Trump has tried to put himself above the law.
[00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:20.852]  And that's not how it works.
[00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:22.773]  That's not how any of this works.
[00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:24.454]  You are above the law.
[00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:30.158]  In my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law.
[00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:37.904]  The American people do not want a president who believes that he is above the law.
[00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:39.005]  No one is above the law.
[00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.666]  Nobody is above the law.
[00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.228]  We must ensure that no one is above the law.
[00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:48.071]  I mean, dear God, this guy cannot in any way be allowed to be above the law.
[00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:50.673]  This is the United States of America.
[00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:53.615]  No one is above the law.
[00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.475]  No one.
[00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:55.196]  No one.
[00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:56.897]  No one is above the law.
[00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:58.658]  No one is above the law.
[00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:02.201]  President Trump and his administration are not above the law.
[00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:04.582]  There is big news that just came out.
[00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.484]  Looks like Donald Trump may have broken the law.
[00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:09.626]  No one is above the law.
[00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:13.108]  No one, not even the president, is above the law.
[00:02:13.108 --> 00:02:14.990]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.330]  Adjourned.
[00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:37.136]  We don't know how many.
[00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:41.819]  I asked anywhere at the colloquy last week, can you tell me how many journalists Adam Schiff was spying on?
[00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.000]  He couldn't answer that.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.221]  How many members of Congress is he spying on?
[00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:47.602]  Or other citizens across this country?
[00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:49.924]  And they can't even answer a basic question like that.
[00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:54.967]  We all should be alarmed at how they've abused their power with this majority in Congress.
[00:02:55.547 --> 00:03:02.593]  And it's a shame, because there's a lot more we should be doing that families across this country are counting on us to do, like lower drug prices.
[00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:15.185]  At least, as House Republicans, we're going to stay focused on fighting hard for those families across America who are counting on us and working with President Trump to go deliver more wins for American workers and the American economy.
[00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:18.608]  And with that, I'll turn it over to our Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy.
[00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:24.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December 10th, 2019.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:37.531]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we've got four big guests lined up today that'll pop in quickly, but I do intend to mainly take your phone calls.
[00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:40.995]  This is a time for the citizens of the nation to be able to respond.
[00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:42.496]  It's official.
[00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:45.218]  Democrats released texts of articles of impeachment.
[00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:51.058]  And I have it right here in front of me, two different articles of impeachment.
[00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:55.181]  They were looking at four of them, but they realized there's no evidence of anything.
[00:03:55.181 --> 00:04:09.689]  So these have to be these nebulous, nebulous resolutions that absolutely still cannot even be proven.
[00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.132]  So we're going to be walking through all of that here today.
[00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:23.260]  And again, we will be taking your phone calls throughout the four hours of the broadcast today.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.906]  I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour as well ahead of the War Room while Owen Schroer and the crew are on the East Coast and in D.C.
[00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:35.849]  We've got Savannah Hernandez and some of the other great crew hosting the War Room.
[00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.992]  And then I'll be back tonight with live coverage.
[00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:51.521]  From 6 to about 10 this evening of the Trump-slash-Pence rally, supposingly one of the biggest ever, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:55.266]  Working around the clock, fighting hard for our republic, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:56.668]  This is the Info War.
[00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:06.888]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:14.941]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.642]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.303]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:25.468]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:36.896]  Well, two articles of impeachment have been introduced against the President of the United States, and they're the two nebulous ones.
[00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.817]  Abuse of power,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.102]  And obstructing Congress.
[00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:47.025]  Abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
[00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:49.366]  Because they can't prove the Russiagate.
[00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:51.767]  They can't prove real obstruction of justice.
[00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.910]  They can't prove any quid pro quo with Ukraine.
[00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.132]  Even though that's legal, as long as the President is doing it in the interest of the U.S.
[00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:01.993]  and not for his own interest.
[00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:06.756]  And they are just in full, complete rampage mode for a reason.
[00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:10.784]  There's a reason, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:28.563]  They have a plan, once the Senate trial kicks off, to bring forward a bunch of other fake, faux, synthetic crises and scandals, coupled with civil unrest, to push the President out.
[00:07:28.563 --> 00:07:31.546]  Now, so far, we've been dead on predicting what they're going to do.
[00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:35.267]  Just a few months ago, oh, Alex is wrong.
[00:07:35.267 --> 00:07:37.069]  Pelosi doesn't have the nerve.
[00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:53.241]  She will never, ever, ever, ever be able to get the articles of impeachment through.
[00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.264]  They'll never actually have the vote because it's unpopular.
[00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:57.525]  Everything they're doing
[00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:16.797]  And they're saying they're going to have their full House vote next week, which of course will indict the president and go to the Senate.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.041]  So we'll lay it all out today.
[00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.062]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:25.725]  I'm going to take your phone calls on this key issue.
[00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:29.888]  And what are we as citizens going to do to stop their plan?
[00:08:29.888 --> 00:08:31.649]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:39.915]  Now here is the Republican leader of the House, McCarthy, just minutes ago making his statement in response to what the Democrats have done.
[00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:40.275]  Here it is.
[00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:45.467]  Good morning.
[00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:51.592]  You know, back in 2016, the Democrats called those who supported Donald Trump deplorables.
[00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:55.295]  And now they're trying to disqualify their votes.
[00:08:55.295 --> 00:09:01.680]  Democrats still cannot get over the fact that the President won the election and they lost.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:11.808]  Just last week at this podium, Nancy Pelosi went to point out that they created a timeline to impeach President Trump that she said started two and a half years ago.
[00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:18.726]  Many of you know of this timeline, because once they took the majority, they had to decide who would become chairs of their committee.
[00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:23.250]  The Impeachment Committee of the Judiciary, who could win?
[00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:30.896]  Jerry Nadler campaigned on that he would be the very strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.
[00:09:30.896 --> 00:09:41.785]  On the day of swearing in, these new freshmen that gave him the majority, a mere few hours after being sworn in, Congresswoman Tlaib proclaimed, we are going to impeach the mother.
[00:09:43.377 --> 00:09:51.182]  You had Al Green admitting that the Democrats have true fears if they do not impeach President Trump that he would win re-election.
[00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:57.166]  And now and today, we watched them introduce two articles of impeachment.
[00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:03.430]  It changed the course of Congress to take away due process for any point of where we are.
[00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:09.915]  It is a fear that Alexander Hamilton had that came to fruition in this Congress.
[00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:13.057]  I just hope no Congress ever repeats what we're going through today.
[00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:17.852]  They have a lot of members on their side very concerned.
[00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:29.097]  Because from the moment they started impeachment and letting the American public see what they believed, and keep changing the term of what they thought was out there, it has been falling in the polls.
[00:10:29.097 --> 00:10:36.360]  If you need any more evidence of how unpopular impeachment is, watch the two press conferences today.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.801]  After announcing impeachment within less than an hour,
[00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:44.130]  The Speaker finally relented and said she would bring USMCA up.
[00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.951]  She has held it for more than a year, making America weaker in our negotiations with China.
[00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:54.954]  Our number one and number two trader in Mexico and Canada was being held up within our own agreement.
[00:10:54.954 --> 00:11:01.936]  But those who are vulnerable in this vote for impeachment continuing to make the argument, as the rest of America was too.
[00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:06.658]  At no time when she would bring this bill up would there's ever fear of it not passing.
[00:11:06.658 --> 00:11:08.879]  But the only reason she would finally relented
[00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:16.194]  It's because the unpopularity of impeachment itself.
[00:11:16.194 --> 00:11:31.584]  We watched in a hearing a Democrat constitutional scholar that did not vote for President Trump say this was the weakest, the thinnest, the fastest impeachment in the history of America.
[00:11:31.584 --> 00:11:36.387]  He then went to say if there was an abuse, it'd be abuse on the Democrats to move forward.
[00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:42.916]  The Speaker must not have listened to that hearing.
[00:11:42.916 --> 00:11:53.018]  If the Speaker had only waited 48 hours to release of the transcript, America would not be put through this nightmare.
[00:11:53.018 --> 00:12:07.361]  If the Speaker would pause and read the IG report, the Inspector General, to thank in a place of America that we would have a law enforcement agency spy on a presidential campaign
[00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:26.015]  In more than 51 instances, not hold up to the rule of law or change all the information and evidence to be able to move forward on something they knew or should have known was not true is a sad day for America.
[00:12:26.015 --> 00:12:36.417]  But to compound that with the idea just because you created a timeline to impeach a president that you disliked, you ignored facts.
[00:12:37.478 --> 00:12:42.221]  We would never be here if they paid attention to the facts or the hearings.
[00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:45.142]  This is not a day that America will be proud about.
[00:12:45.142 --> 00:12:50.745]  It's not a day that history will write that anybody wants to repeat.
[00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:54.527]  Alexander Hamilton warned us that this day would come.
[00:12:54.527 --> 00:13:00.510]  That a majority would use their political power just for politics.
[00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.532]  Even though we all raise our hands to uphold the Constitution.
[00:13:07.527 --> 00:13:15.609]  I just hope no Congress, regardless who's in the majority, will ever take us down this path again.
[00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:25.332]  We have such great potential in this nation, but to have wasted a majority on this is an embarrassment to this Congress.
[00:13:25.332 --> 00:13:26.232]  Questions?
[00:13:26.232 --> 00:13:26.532]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:40.854]  Does it make it harder to defend the President when his personal attorney is still traveling to Ukraine, investigating his campaign rivals, and claims he wants to give some sort of presentation about it to Congress?
[00:13:42.003 --> 00:13:47.444]  It does not, it is not hard to defend this president surely on the facts of what's out there.
[00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:53.986]  I think it's hard for the Democrats to move forward when they start with a quick pro quo to bribery to every other element they go.
[00:13:53.986 --> 00:14:00.488]  It's hard for the Democrats to continue this when the people they bring forth in their hearings are pretty much donors.
[00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:07.733]  Their expert witnesses, when it comes to their scholars, were donors to presidential campaigns.
[00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:08.394]  That's right.
[00:14:08.394 --> 00:14:20.723]  The idea that they're going to change the course of history, that staff is going to interview... All right, folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, December 10, 2019, worldwide transmission.
[00:14:20.723 --> 00:14:23.025]  I intend to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:23.945]  That's in about 15 minutes.
[00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:26.407]  I'm going to give the number out now.
[00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:31.071]  On the whitewash IG report that we predicted with total precision,
[00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:34.708]  We're going to walk through that.
[00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:48.454]  We're taking calls on that subject, the impeachment, the votes they've got to pass it by next week, and then into the trial in the Senate just for Christmas, and what type of tricks you think they're going to play during that period.
[00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:51.976]  I'm going to lay out what they're going to do.
[00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:56.078]  Next week's, next month's news today from my research.
[00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.089]  And also, Owen Schroyer, the answer.
[00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:03.870]  The people rising up peacefully in civil disobedience and shutting down these corrupt globalists.
[00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.511]  You better do it or we're going to lose everything we've got.
[00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:07.212]  It's all coming up.
[00:15:07.212 --> 00:15:07.952]  877-789-2539.
[00:15:07.952 --> 00:15:08.812]  877-789-Alex.
[00:15:08.812 --> 00:15:16.855]  I want to give first-time callers again a chance in the first hour to get on board.
[00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:18.256]  There will be open phones for everybody.
[00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:18.696]  After that, 877-789-2539.
[00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:18.736]  877-789-2539.
[00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:29.281]  And we'll be going right to your phone calls at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:29.281 --> 00:15:36.946]  When we come back, we're going to look at the two articles, Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress.
[00:15:36.946 --> 00:15:40.349]  They said when he tweeted and called witnesses liars, which was true.
[00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:42.291]  That's illegal.
[00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:46.557]  Having his lawyer go around and find corruption against the Democrats, that's not allowed.
[00:15:46.557 --> 00:15:50.663]  Going after corruption is a crime in an upside-down world.
[00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:53.728]  I'm Alex Jones, Banned.Video.
[00:15:53.728 --> 00:15:55.230]  They hate it when you share that link.
[00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.913]  Live feeds at Banned.Video.
[00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:09.297]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:09.297 --> 00:16:18.501]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:23.884]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here, right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:23.884 --> 00:16:36.089]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's backstory.
[00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:37.330]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.331]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system
[00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:41.614]  At My Own Power Grid dot com.
[00:16:41.614 --> 00:16:43.857]  That's My Own Power Grid dot com.
[00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:47.982]  Over a thousand dollars in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses, too.
[00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:48.663]  And the best part?
[00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:49.944]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.
[00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:52.327]  Go to My Own Power Grid dot com to learn more.
[00:16:52.327 --> 00:16:54.330]  That's My Own Power Grid dot com.
[00:16:57.874 --> 00:16:59.835]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:59.835 --> 00:17:05.138]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:05.138 --> 00:17:06.739]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:06.739 --> 00:17:15.084]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:17:15.084 --> 00:17:20.787]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:22.768]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:24.930]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.433]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:31.634]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:39.480]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:03.643]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[00:18:03.643 --> 00:18:12.345]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago, and I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemforwars.com.
[00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:21.607]  And he talked about in the darkest hours of the beginning of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[00:18:21.607 --> 00:18:27.749]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[00:18:27.749 --> 00:18:28.629]  There's a third time
[00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:35.454]  When you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[00:18:35.454 --> 00:18:36.796]  That's a paraphrase.
[00:18:36.796 --> 00:18:45.063]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:50.587]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:51.368]  That's a fact.
[00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:54.130]  They fear info wars because we are alive.
[00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.813]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[00:18:59.332 --> 00:19:00.193]  Andy in Florida.
[00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:00.773]  Thank you, Andy.
[00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:01.193]  Go ahead.
[00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:02.494]  Hey, Alex.
[00:19:02.494 --> 00:19:03.254]  I love you, man.
[00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:03.894]  We love you.
[00:19:03.894 --> 00:19:07.856]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I've got to talk about one of your products.
[00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.417]  A little bit about me.
[00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:10.017]  I'm 245 pounds.
[00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:13.039]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:16.341]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[00:19:16.341 --> 00:19:20.803]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[00:19:21.323 --> 00:19:21.663]  I think so.
[00:19:36.684 --> 00:19:38.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:12.745]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:13.586]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.640]  I don't
[00:20:56.297 --> 00:21:10.224]  That you're saying you are, he's a really smart guy, you can tell by their questioning, of obstruction of Congress for Trump criticizing witnesses and Trump going to courts and trying to block your action.
[00:21:10.224 --> 00:21:16.227]  Congress and the executive, the legislative and the executive, battle each other through the courts.
[00:21:16.227 --> 00:21:20.089]  They can also battle each other through legislation, executive orders.
[00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:21.770]  But that's what the president does.
[00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:29.586]  Other presidents have arrested members of Congress and, you know, spied on them.
[00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:33.929]  Imagine if Trump did that.
[00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:41.214]  Imagine if Trump got caught illegally spying on Congress.
[00:21:41.214 --> 00:21:46.798]  But that's what the Democrats did to Trump.
[00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:48.679]  And then now that's what Schiff's done.
[00:21:50.404 --> 00:21:51.865]  They've been surveilling all these people.
[00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:57.249]  They just go get warrants later and parallel construct what they're doing.
[00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:02.012]  In live time, shift spying on hundreds of members of the press, Congress, everybody.
[00:22:02.012 --> 00:22:04.073]  It's an incredible scandal.
[00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:08.956]  Now remember, they opened up these espionage investigations of Trump.
[00:22:08.956 --> 00:22:11.378]  Then they opened criminal investigations up during the campaign.
[00:22:11.378 --> 00:22:12.539]  That's all admitted.
[00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:18.323]  Two years ago, the Inspector General of the Courts put out a report saying we were given false information
[00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.672]  For these warrants, in hindsight, that got zero coverage except here on air.
[00:22:23.672 --> 00:22:24.853]  Zero.
[00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:31.037]  William Benny got contacted by the White House and said, hey, you and others directed us at this.
[00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.798]  Think you can get the press to cover it?
[00:22:32.798 --> 00:22:39.962]  And Benny called up a bunch of people, including me, and said, hey, certain people want this to get out there.
[00:22:39.962 --> 00:22:41.383]  And zero coverage.
[00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:43.424]  That's how controlled the corporate press is.
[00:22:43.424 --> 00:22:48.167]  They are in lockstep like North Korea when it comes to hoaxes and lies.
[00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:58.880]  And that's the biggest whopper out of all this, the IG report coming out, Beyond Nothing Burger, is Comey comes out and says, this exonerates me.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.663]  No spying on the president happened.
[00:23:01.663 --> 00:23:02.744]  No spying on his campaign.
[00:23:02.744 --> 00:23:04.546]  He goes, no wiretaps.
[00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:08.802]  That's because they haven't called him that in court filings in 30 years.
[00:23:08.802 --> 00:23:10.984]  They don't put a wire on the phone line.
[00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:12.104]  It's data collection.
[00:23:12.104 --> 00:23:13.945]  They scoop it up digitally.
[00:23:13.945 --> 00:23:16.666]  But I've got his tweets and his quotes in the news.
[00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:18.747]  Boy, Trump was delusional.
[00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:21.869]  Nobody ever spied on him.
[00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:26.331]  That's like saying Clydesdales aren't horses.
[00:23:26.331 --> 00:23:29.293]  Or Budweiser isn't a beer.
[00:23:29.293 --> 00:23:31.754]  Or Tom Brady doesn't play for the Patriots.
[00:23:31.754 --> 00:23:35.616]  I mean, it's just a lie of a magnitude
[00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:41.437]  In your face that is beyond gaslighting.
[00:23:41.437 --> 00:23:44.138]  It's like saying, I'm not wearing a light blue shirt, it's a red shirt.
[00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:45.479]  You're like, that's a light blue shirt.
[00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:52.463]  You're like, I'm not wearing a shirt actually, you're crazy!
[00:23:52.463 --> 00:24:04.569]  Vanity Fair and more than 20 publications, I stayed up late last night reading all this, said that Owen Schroyer said that Trump, said that Obama should be hung
[00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:08.826]  At the impeachment hearing.
[00:24:08.826 --> 00:24:12.228]  He never said any such thing.
[00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:17.432]  They then said he wore a tailored suit because he likes Nazis.
[00:24:17.432 --> 00:24:19.333]  I'm not kidding.
[00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:22.815]  In news publications with no link.
[00:24:22.815 --> 00:24:25.157]  This is next level.
[00:24:25.157 --> 00:24:25.617]  There it is.
[00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:31.681]  The impeachment protester was a wolf in a wool blend suit.
[00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:34.243]  But it wasn't just that.
[00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:35.524]  There were these headlines with,
[00:24:38.814 --> 00:24:42.518]  President Obama in racist rant at impeachment hearing.
[00:24:42.518 --> 00:24:43.999]  He said no such thing.
[00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:47.803]  He didn't say anything about Obama.
[00:24:47.803 --> 00:24:49.764]  They don't care.
[00:24:49.764 --> 00:24:59.554]  And when you've got the media and everybody so willing to be criminal, it means that we have crossed the Rubicon and it means they're only going to get worse.
[00:24:59.554 --> 00:25:01.836]  And the question is, how much are we going to put up with?
[00:25:01.836 --> 00:25:02.977]  Because it's just going to get more crazy.
[00:25:06.308 --> 00:25:10.531]  And there it is, M4's host called for Obama to be lynched.
[00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:13.033]  Interrupts impeachment hearings.
[00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:14.535]  What the hell?
[00:25:14.535 --> 00:25:16.316]  That's salon.
[00:25:16.316 --> 00:25:19.578]  And you read it and they write it like he actually said it.
[00:25:19.578 --> 00:25:24.222]  Years ago, out of context, he said, people say you get hung for treason.
[00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.584]  I'm not saying you hang Obama.
[00:25:26.584 --> 00:25:29.406]  That turns into, oh, he's a black guy, hang a black guy.
[00:25:29.406 --> 00:25:29.967]  Oh, you mean
[00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:33.730]  Like the KKK.
[00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.791]  Again, it's just incredible.
[00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:38.634]  So lies, based on lies, based on lies.
[00:25:38.634 --> 00:25:41.176]  And it just gets crazier and crazier.
[00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:44.238]  But the big one here is, Schiff threatens press freedom.
[00:25:44.238 --> 00:25:46.019]  That's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:51.543]  Controversy of the spying on members of the press and Republicans that are on the committee.
[00:25:51.543 --> 00:25:52.584]  That's a conflict of interest.
[00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:55.986]  You can't do that.
[00:25:55.986 --> 00:25:57.768]  But Schiff won't even be called as a witness.
[00:25:59.278 --> 00:26:01.399]  He says, oh, not in the House or the Senate.
[00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:03.521]  Just, I'm above the law, I'm God, you can't call me.
[00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:06.743]  But I'm spying on everyone illegally.
[00:26:06.743 --> 00:26:07.464]  We must act.
[00:26:07.464 --> 00:26:13.308]  Democrats unveil Trump impeachment charges.
[00:26:13.308 --> 00:26:19.092]  And then I've got all the stacks right here of Jonathan Turley was threatened and his dog was threatened.
[00:26:19.092 --> 00:26:24.576]  They threatened to kill his dog.
[00:26:24.576 --> 00:26:27.358]  And then now we've got, proud of himself,
[00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:38.655]  Former FBI Director, the lying giant, the leaker, saying no one ever spied on the Trump campaign or Trump.
[00:26:38.655 --> 00:26:47.122]  The IV report doesn't even say that, it just says it was legitimate spying, which of course it wasn't.
[00:26:47.122 --> 00:26:51.725]  So you really got to pull back and ask yourself, what planet are these people from?
[00:26:53.732 --> 00:26:58.456]  IG Horowitz's sham report says FBI was biased in favor of Trump.
[00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:05.081]  This guy's definitely got some chutzpah, writes Chris Minahan at Information Liberation.
[00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:06.222]  We're going to take your calls at 877-789-ALEX.
[00:27:06.222 --> 00:27:06.302]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:06.703]  We come back.
[00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:19.877]  On the IG report, on the ongoing impeachment, on the tricks they're going to pull, on what we're going to do to take action against it, what you're going to do, it's all coming up.
[00:27:19.877 --> 00:27:27.882]  Please don't forget that your purchases this Christmas season at InfoWarsTore.com get you great products, you don't have to fight the big lines, the traffic.
[00:27:28.362 --> 00:27:39.366]  You don't support these big box stores and big corporate outfits that almost to a company literally have it out for you and your family, your children, your Second Amendment, and are totally globalist and occultic.
[00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:48.370]  Why in the hell would you spend money with the establishment when you can go to m4warstore.com and keep this beacon of liberty and freedom and just game-changing information warfare?
[00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:55.917]  It's scary being, you know, the most valuable operation in the fight against the New World Order, but we got to stay in the game, folks.
[00:27:55.917 --> 00:28:00.502]  So we're offering the best deal ever on the real Red Pill Plus.
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:08.070]  It's got three different forms of natural powerful energy in it, and regular Red Pill is what I take, because I don't need the three forms of powerful energy that are in it.
[00:28:09.506 --> 00:28:19.799]  It has the preglanone that is the big game changer that they try to keep secret from you that they've been for a hundred years prescribing for people with things like arthritis and things.
[00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:21.381]  But it's over-the-counter.
[00:28:21.381 --> 00:28:23.484]  It's the base of all hormones in your body.
[00:28:23.484 --> 00:28:25.687]  As you get older, you have lower and lower levels of it.
[00:28:26.207 --> 00:28:32.651]  But whether you're playing football in high school, or whether you're a 60-year-old, you know, janitor, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:33.052]  It's amazing.
[00:28:33.052 --> 00:28:36.674]  And with all the vitamins and minerals with it, it uploads even better.
[00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:45.460]  Real Red Pill Plus is 67% off at cost, with a free bottle of bio-true selenium from the mustard seed that's critical for electrochemical activities in the body.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.503]  These two products together are unbelievable at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:49.503 --> 00:28:50.304]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:28:51.175 --> 00:28:55.548]  Free shipping, double Patriot points, at cost with a free bottle of Biotrus Selenium.
[00:28:55.548 --> 00:28:56.571]  We're selling everything out.
[00:28:58.004 --> 00:29:03.749]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[00:29:08.854 --> 00:29:16.581]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:24.448]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:26.409]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:35.937]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:35.937 --> 00:29:36.778]  Don't miss this one.
[00:29:36.778 --> 00:29:38.079]  Stake your claim today.
[00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:38.359]  Call 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:38.659]  That's 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:40.761]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:41.021]  Call now.
[00:29:41.021 --> 00:29:41.081]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:41.081 --> 00:29:41.121]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:52.952]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk to owners.
[00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:54.654]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[00:29:54.654 --> 00:29:57.178]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[00:29:59.102 --> 00:30:02.323]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[00:30:02.323 --> 00:30:19.729]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[00:30:19.729 --> 00:30:21.950]  We're being taken off the land.
[00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:27.432]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery.
[00:30:28.172 --> 00:30:45.026]  Until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human, then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God, believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[00:30:45.826 --> 00:30:50.310]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.172]  This is the post-human error.
[00:30:52.172 --> 00:30:54.935]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[00:30:54.935 --> 00:30:56.376]  This is the crossroads.
[00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:59.018]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[00:30:59.018 --> 00:31:09.928]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:20.202]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:31:20.202 --> 00:31:24.788]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:31:24.788 --> 00:31:27.692]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:28.232]  And that's
[00:31:58.752 --> 00:32:06.594]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot Points.

[00:32:52.688 --> 00:32:54.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:12.128 --> 00:33:23.030]  If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.
[00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:44.776]  It's your abuse of power.
[00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:48.817]  You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the president for doing.
[00:33:48.817 --> 00:33:58.480]  You're saying Article 1 gives us complete authority that when we demand information from another branch, it must be turned over or we'll impeach you in record time.
[00:33:59.591 --> 00:34:03.753]  Now, making that worse is that you have such a short investigation.
[00:34:03.753 --> 00:34:05.674]  It's a perfect storm.
[00:34:05.674 --> 00:34:14.339]  You set an incredibly short period, demand a huge amount of information, and when the president goes to court, you then impeach him.
[00:34:14.339 --> 00:34:19.222]  Now, does that track with what you've heard about impeachment?
[00:34:19.222 --> 00:34:23.884]  Does that track with the rule of law that we've talked about?
[00:34:23.884 --> 00:34:27.066]  So, on obstruction, I would encourage you to think about this.
[00:34:28.314 --> 00:34:31.155]  In Nixon, it did go to the courts.
[00:34:31.155 --> 00:34:34.335]  And Nixon lost.
[00:34:34.335 --> 00:34:37.656]  And that was the reason Nixon resigned.
[00:34:37.656 --> 00:34:43.198]  He resigned a few days after the Supreme Court ruled against- Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:43.198 --> 00:34:44.718]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:44.718 --> 00:34:46.418]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:50.899]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this December 10th, 2019, worldwide broadcast.
[00:34:54.352 --> 00:34:55.932]  And I'm shaking the broadcast up.
[00:34:55.932 --> 00:35:01.473]  I'm going to your phone calls right here in the middle of the first hour, as promised.
[00:35:01.473 --> 00:35:05.394]  Because when I listen to rebroadcast, I love it when I'm taking calls.
[00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:07.314]  I love it when I got a good guest on.
[00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:11.875]  And I really just gauge the broadcast according to what I like to hear and what I like to tune into.
[00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:13.696]  So I want to get right into your calls.
[00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:15.976]  Coming up, Lou Dobbs calls it a whitewash.
[00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:18.416]  The IG report, I totally agree with him.
[00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:19.617]  It's beyond a whitewash.
[00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:20.537]  It's a travesty.
[00:35:21.377 --> 00:35:24.561]  And then I've got this little juicy piece of news.
[00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:30.147]  IG Horowitz sham report says FBI was biased in favor of Trump.
[00:35:30.147 --> 00:35:34.172]  That's what the Obama-appointed official did, the so-called watchdog.
[00:35:34.172 --> 00:35:35.554]  What a joke.
[00:35:35.554 --> 00:35:36.955]  Everybody needs to wait.
[00:35:36.955 --> 00:35:38.837]  Horowitz is going to get them.
[00:35:38.837 --> 00:35:39.498]  And here's Comey.
[00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:47.052]  Tweeting, so it was all lies, no treason, no spying on the campaign, no tapping Trump's wires.
[00:35:47.052 --> 00:35:48.752]  See, technically there's no wires.
[00:35:48.752 --> 00:35:49.933]  Now it's digital.
[00:35:49.933 --> 00:35:52.894]  It was just good people trying to protect America.
[00:35:52.894 --> 00:36:00.697]  Well, even Horowitz admits they were spying on him and using digital collection, but there's no wires!
[00:36:00.697 --> 00:36:03.418]  See that, legalese, how criminal that is?
[00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:07.720]  That he thinks you're so stupid he says that to you?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.300]  And they go on.
[00:36:10.558 --> 00:36:12.159]  James Comey, the truth is finally out.
[00:36:12.159 --> 00:36:14.141]  The FBI fulfilled its mission.
[00:36:14.141 --> 00:36:18.163]  There was no spying, even though it's admitted spying.
[00:36:18.163 --> 00:36:20.645]  The IG report says, oh, it was legitimate.
[00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:24.948]  Just a few people went too far and didn't follow all the rules.
[00:36:24.948 --> 00:36:27.050]  Wow.
[00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.192]  And the average person now will actually believe
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:47.150]  That watches mainstream media that no one was ever spied on, even though they've been spying on members of Congress during the impeachment who are on the committee and spying on the press.
[00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.092]  Think about that.
[00:36:50.092 --> 00:36:57.497]  So that they know the strategies of the Republicans with the press and what the Republicans are going to say before they say it, because who are the Republicans going to talk to?
[00:36:57.497 --> 00:36:59.538]  They're going to talk to the press.
[00:36:59.538 --> 00:37:00.679]  We learned it's Sean Hannity.
[00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:04.750]  Who else are they spying on?
[00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.010]  You know, it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.952]  People like Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[00:37:09.952 --> 00:37:13.394]  Everybody's getting spied on.
[00:37:13.394 --> 00:37:14.854]  And they know, who do we talk to?
[00:37:14.854 --> 00:37:19.676]  Well, we talk to reporters, off record.
[00:37:19.676 --> 00:37:25.079]  And so, these criminals are doing this, and they think we're all stupid.
[00:37:28.186 --> 00:37:29.667]  And aren't aware of it.
[00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:38.091]  I don't come up here and say, hey, I told you the IG report would be a total beyond whitewash.
[00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:43.433]  A prophylactic for the deep state to cover up, to demoralize you.
[00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:49.396]  I told you and I was right again, because we need to stop being delusional about what we're facing.
[00:37:51.912 --> 00:38:04.801]  If you think you can climb a 10,000 foot mountain when you can't even climb a set of stairs because you haven't exercised in 20 years and you're 100 pounds overweight, you're not going to go sign up for a mountaineering event and scale the mountain.
[00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:09.925]  You need to be honest about it.
[00:38:09.925 --> 00:38:16.910]  That's my allegory or analogy or parable or parallel.
[00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.851]  I want to kick ass.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.541]  I want to change the world.
[00:38:20.541 --> 00:38:23.963]  I want my children to live in a free world and I want yours to as well.
[00:38:23.963 --> 00:38:26.784]  I believe in you.
[00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:35.129]  And I've learned how these globalists rope-a-dope and how they manipulate us.
[00:38:35.129 --> 00:38:36.550]  And I don't want to lose.
[00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.811]  We can win very easily.
[00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:44.851]  But it's going to take the type of action you saw with Owen Schroyer yesterday, that was one of the biggest stories in the world, and resonated with people.
[00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:49.415]  So they ridiculed him, they lied about him, they attacked him, they called for him to be deplatformed.
[00:38:49.415 --> 00:38:55.180]  Think of everybody else as cowards, and if you see those attacks, you'll think, oh, I better not speak up.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.401]  You want those attacks.
[00:38:56.401 --> 00:38:59.764]  Those are the red badge of courage.
[00:38:59.764 --> 00:39:03.768]  To have these criminals and scumbags and liars at the New York Times attack you.
[00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:10.526]  Don't you know the Times of London attacked George Washington in 1776?
[00:39:10.526 --> 00:39:18.589]  This is the blood of courage and what America is.
[00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:28.993]  To not just charge machine gun nest, but the moral courage that historians have found is even more rare to stand against lies and demonization from the establishment.
[00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:31.874]  To go against the headwind, straight in.
[00:39:31.874 --> 00:39:33.954]  Because you know it's the right thing to do.
[00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:35.275]  That's the essence of leadership.
[00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:42.239]  And so many people are thanking Owen saying, we really appreciate what you did, great job.
[00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:45.901]  Well, all of you need to go to Congress.
[00:39:45.901 --> 00:39:49.464]  All of you need to protest outside.
[00:39:49.464 --> 00:39:53.426]  They have the mall like flypapers, so you go there and no one ever covers what you're doing.
[00:39:53.426 --> 00:40:04.634]  Go jump in front of the news cameras, go to the press scrums, go bullhorn outside, go to the rallies, go to the Democrat events, go to the sporting events, and legally and lawfully take them over!
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.941]  Just like we did in 2016.
[00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:14.984]  They wanted us off the air so we couldn't be an inspiration, but we're still here.
[00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:31.151]  But I gotta tell you, I'm not ready to reveal this at this point, but the dirty tricks and the criminality and the corruption and the sabotage behind the scenes is what you'd expect from this deep state trying to take back America that they thought they had their foot on the neck of.
[00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:40.573]  To Lauren, and Bobby, and Tyler, and David, and Bob, and Andrea, and Russell, and Luke, and Brandon, I'm gonna go to all of you.
[00:40:40.573 --> 00:41:01.726]  I'm gonna take a ton of calls today, and we're gonna look at every angle of this, but if you think Comey can get up there all over the news, he's all over TV, and say we're exonerated, no crime, no spying, Trump made it up, he's saying there wasn't even an investigation when the IG report just says it was legitimate.
[00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:13.375]  That insult to you, you've not met back with a response, is literally pissing in your face.
[00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:20.838]  And they do it on purpose to teach you to sit there and to piss on you and to tell you it's raining.
[00:41:20.838 --> 00:41:23.399]  Are you angry about that?
[00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:24.660]  Are you upset about that?
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.241]  I'm going to say this and I'm not going to reveal
[00:41:27.546 --> 00:41:30.450]  Some of the stuff going on for strategic reasons, but I'll just tell you this.
[00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:35.617]  You want to see this operation that is the number one game changer out there thanks to your support continue in the future?
[00:41:37.182 --> 00:41:43.446]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on, and I'm working 18 hours a day because I don't want to lose.
[00:41:43.446 --> 00:41:47.188]  Because the innocents want us and demand that we stand up for them.
[00:41:47.188 --> 00:41:49.009]  God demands we stand up.
[00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:56.453]  God is going to stand up for all these children and other people that are being abused through men and women that stand up and take action.
[00:41:56.453 --> 00:42:00.455]  You have got to answer the prayers to God.
[00:42:00.455 --> 00:42:01.916]  God works through men and women.
[00:42:03.715 --> 00:42:19.981]  So I need your prayers, and I need you to go, hey, I'm going to do my Christmas shopping at InfoWarsTore.com with air filters and water filters and non-GMO heirloom seeds and t-shirts and books and films and every order gets tons of free bumper stickers to get the word out.
[00:42:19.981 --> 00:42:33.186]  And I'm going to get the krill oil that's back in stock, and I'm going to try the protein bars, and I'm going to get the Brain Force, and I'm going to get the Biotris Selenium, and I'm going to get the Real Red Pill Plus and experience it and fund us because I need a lot of money
[00:42:34.332 --> 00:42:41.440]  To launch new projects that they're not going to be able to shut down or stop, and I'm going to leave it at that, okay?
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.223]  In any war, ladies and gentlemen, what's the answer?
[00:42:44.223 --> 00:42:47.506]  Have more weapons systems in orbit.
[00:42:47.506 --> 00:42:50.429]  And we are building new Death Stars.
[00:42:50.429 --> 00:42:51.650]  This one's under attack.
[00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.012]  We're building new Death Stars.
[00:42:53.012 --> 00:42:53.492]  Just know that.
[00:42:53.492 --> 00:42:55.795]  I need capital to complete their construction.
[00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:05.935]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.
[00:43:05.935 --> 00:43:10.117]  Don't shop with Amazon and other big tech companies that hate your guts.
[00:43:10.117 --> 00:43:14.300]  Take the InfoWars Christmas Challenge and support the fight for freedom.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.262]  Finish your Christmas shopping with one click and support the InfoWars.
[00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:31.430]  For the 12 days of Christmas, we're adding a new special every day, plus free shipping, double Patriot points, and extra stickers in every package to be good little elves and spread the info war, triggering Libtards.
[00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.132]  Check in every day to find the new deals.
[00:43:34.132 --> 00:43:37.354]  We're also coming out of the gates with specials we've never had before.
[00:43:37.354 --> 00:43:41.676]  The Christmas Mega Pack is at cost at $99.95.
[00:43:41.676 --> 00:43:42.997]  Get two bottles of knockout.
[00:43:43.117 --> 00:43:52.187]  Two bottles of Brain Force Plus, one box of Turbo Force, one bottle of Ultimate Krill Oil, and one bottle of Survival Shield X3 at cost.
[00:43:52.187 --> 00:43:57.453]  Again, find this amazing special and over a hundred others at InfoWarsTore.com and support the InfoWar.
[00:43:58.214 --> 00:44:01.436]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:18.849]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:20.189]  We're being taken off the land.
[00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:31.676]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[00:44:31.676 --> 00:44:40.822]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[00:44:41.582 --> 00:44:44.925]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[00:44:44.925 --> 00:44:49.408]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[00:44:49.408 --> 00:44:51.269]  This is the post-human error.
[00:44:51.269 --> 00:44:54.032]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[00:44:54.032 --> 00:44:55.493]  This is the crossroads.
[00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:59.356]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[00:44:59.356 --> 00:45:01.237]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[00:45:01.237 --> 00:45:03.058]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[00:45:03.058 --> 00:45:06.601]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually.
[00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:08.643]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[00:45:08.643 --> 00:45:10.144]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[00:45:11.815 --> 00:45:15.138]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[00:45:15.138 --> 00:45:26.466]  Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[00:45:26.466 --> 00:45:27.587]  And so it's very simple.
[00:45:27.587 --> 00:45:34.732]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:37.634]  110% God will finish the move.
[00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:41.177]  And I know I need to stay in the fight, in the attack, attack, attack.
[00:45:41.357 --> 00:45:42.277]  I don't want to attack.
[00:45:42.277 --> 00:45:43.778]  I want to go after the globalists.
[00:45:43.778 --> 00:45:51.021]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[00:45:51.021 --> 00:45:54.042]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us.
[00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:55.743]  For myself, for my family, for your family.
[00:45:55.743 --> 00:45:56.923]  Because we're in this together!
[00:45:56.923 --> 00:45:58.104]  InfoWareStore.com
[00:45:59.284 --> 00:46:06.129]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[00:46:06.129 --> 00:46:17.957]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:46:17.957 --> 00:46:20.079]  There is no one formula.
[00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:23.401]  You're gonna find out there that is more game-changing.
[00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:25.883]  It's 65% off right now.
[00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:31.928]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling BioTrue Selenium for the mustard seed.
[00:46:31.928 --> 00:46:37.833]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy, your focus, your entire body.
[00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:40.775]  The globalists know about this but have been suppressing it.
[00:46:41.115 --> 00:46:51.144]  Take advantage of it now, the Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus combo with Badger Selenium at InfoWarStore.com and help yourself, your family, and the InfoWar.
[00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:54.587]  Again, do your Christmas shopping for yourself and your family.
[00:46:54.587 --> 00:47:01.934]  You need to try the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Badger Selenium for yourselves.
[00:47:01.934 --> 00:47:04.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:24.234]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:24.234 --> 00:47:26.916]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.916 --> 00:47:29.178]  We're going to stay on the air.
[00:47:29.178 --> 00:47:32.580]  We're going to continue to get the transmission out.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.061]  Too critical.
[00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:43.349]  As the total censorship increases, multimedia institutions that are left standing will be beyond critical.
[00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:48.153]  Unfortunately, the NRA has shut down their multimedia operation, crippled by infiltrators.
[00:47:50.323 --> 00:47:55.385]  I can't tell you all of it because I was told in confidence, but it's bad.
[00:47:55.385 --> 00:47:57.685]  They're storming everything.
[00:47:57.685 --> 00:48:01.747]  Can you imagine being the president totally surrounded by criminals?
[00:48:01.747 --> 00:48:05.028]  We have some good members of Congress and that's it.
[00:48:05.028 --> 00:48:06.888]  Some good people in the military.
[00:48:06.888 --> 00:48:11.210]  But the lawyer governing class are the scum of the earth and true cowards.
[00:48:13.055 --> 00:48:21.181]  It is their dishonor itself that empowers them because they love being pieces of crap and backstabbing weasels and have no honor in them.
[00:48:21.181 --> 00:48:28.286]  So they attack those that do have honor because they understand it's an existential threat to their system.
[00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:31.508]  Trump surges in battleground states as Dems push impeachment.
[00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:34.110]  And it's true, even in the fake polls he's way up.
[00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:39.194]  But we're 328 days out and they're planning false flag events to blame the president.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:47.147]  It'll be white supremacists attacking Jewish centers, black community areas.
[00:48:47.147 --> 00:48:48.448]  You know they're gearing it all up.
[00:48:48.448 --> 00:48:49.610]  They've done it before, they'll do it again.
[00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:58.118]  They're preparing all sorts of economic collapse, all sorts of military crises.
[00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:00.821]  They're going to bring forward women that say Trump raped them?
[00:49:02.176 --> 00:49:04.057]  They're going to replay every card they've done that's failed.
[00:49:04.057 --> 00:49:04.818]  They don't care.
[00:49:04.818 --> 00:49:18.488]  They're going to pile on during the Senate trial with all these giant scandals to have senators go, well, these are the articles we have and I'm going to go ahead and vote for it because we just got to get him out of here.
[00:49:18.488 --> 00:49:27.355]  It's too big a crisis with the civil unrest that will then be triggered by the stay-behind networks in the State Department and the CIA run by Soros and the Clintons.
[00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:30.177]  And I told you, Hillary's waiting in the wings like a
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.044]  Mentally retarded vampire bat.
[00:49:36.044 --> 00:49:40.608]  And we'll swoop in with this weak field she put in to take over at the last minute.
[00:49:40.608 --> 00:49:43.330]  You notice she's number one in the polls now.
[00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.611]  Biden was never meant to be there.
[00:49:44.611 --> 00:49:45.312]  He's a placeholder.
[00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:50.733]  All the other candidates are stepping back for her when the big goblin comes into the room.
[00:49:50.733 --> 00:49:52.614]  They're like, oh, your lordship.
[00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:59.358]  And then she's waiting for them to wound Trump enough and then they'll have some placeholder Republicans she runs against.
[00:49:59.358 --> 00:50:00.859]  That's her dream.
[00:50:00.859 --> 00:50:03.140]  Doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:09.824]  But if we aren't aware of their plans, they're going to win!
[00:50:09.824 --> 00:50:11.885]  And I'm not going to stand here and watch it!
[00:50:16.135 --> 00:50:21.037]  So we have to turn our will against the enemy!
[00:50:21.037 --> 00:50:26.259]  You'll simply stop believing delusions and tune into reality and ask God to give you guidance.
[00:50:26.259 --> 00:50:28.679]  Believe me, you will be given it.
[00:50:28.679 --> 00:50:33.201]  I was driving to work this morning and my sight is so clear now.
[00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:38.063]  My consciousness is so on that it was just spectacularly beautiful in the rain.
[00:50:38.971 --> 00:50:43.354]  And we've all had those experiences in life, but I'm like that all the time now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:43.354 --> 00:50:47.358]  Because I'm challenging evil, and I'm asking God to come into me even stronger.
[00:50:47.358 --> 00:50:50.120]  And it's incredible, the empowerment!
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.561]  And all the statistics show it.
[00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:56.325]  Christians are richer, stronger, better looking, live longer, are more empowered.
[00:50:56.325 --> 00:50:59.027]  Because Jesus is real!
[00:50:59.027 --> 00:51:00.628]  Our God is real!
[00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:03.030]  The life force is real!
[00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.413]  We want to empower children, not deform them and rape them!
[00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:07.754]  I said I'd take your calls, I will!
[00:51:10.199 --> 00:51:15.502]  God's spirit's coming into the world really strong right now because the enemy is coming into the world.
[00:51:15.502 --> 00:51:19.504]  And God always matches that.
[00:51:19.504 --> 00:51:33.393]  And when the devil starts cheating and really playing dirty tricks, God's gonna remove the controls on his people and we are going to have incredible power that has not been seen in thousands of years.
[00:51:33.393 --> 00:51:35.554]  It's going to be on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:42.042]  I don't know about you, but I just want to keep following the path I'm on with the relationship with God.
[00:51:42.042 --> 00:51:47.026]  It's unbelievable.
[00:51:47.026 --> 00:51:48.527]  Thank God I'm not a Satanist.
[00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:51.229]  Thank God I didn't get tricked into that crap.
[00:51:51.229 --> 00:51:52.970]  Thank you, Jesus.
[00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.611]  Thank you, Jesus.
[00:51:56.084 --> 00:52:06.248]  I just pray to God to not give me strength and power that I can't handle, because let me tell you, it's just, it's unbelievable to stare into the universe and begin to have discernment at this level.
[00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:12.310]  And that's why the enemy hates Christians and wants us wiped off the face of the earth, because they can't carry out their plan until we're gone.
[00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:21.654]  They have to sabotage our genetics, sabotage our spirit, sabotage our code, because you can't fix something that isn't broken.
[00:52:25.247 --> 00:52:28.609]  The only thing that's fallen is that we're able to interface with evil.
[00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:33.212]  It didn't mean that Adam and the archetype didn't know what evil was.
[00:52:33.212 --> 00:52:38.336]  It was that it wasn't infected with it.
[00:52:38.336 --> 00:52:40.277]  We were immune to it.
[00:52:40.277 --> 00:52:41.878]  We were that straight and strong.
[00:52:41.878 --> 00:52:45.600]  But once evil systems start, they train you to depend on it.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.362]  And you become weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker.
[00:52:48.362 --> 00:52:50.744]  That's how evil works as a binary spiritual weapon.
[00:52:50.744 --> 00:52:51.384]  I'm gonna stop now!
[00:52:51.384 --> 00:52:52.065]  I'm gonna go to your calls!
[00:52:55.404 --> 00:52:58.445]  The innocents cry out to God as they're being tortured.
[00:52:58.445 --> 00:53:02.266]  Can you not hear them?
[00:53:02.266 --> 00:53:04.147]  How are they going to try to take Trump out?
[00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:04.927]  Because they're making their move.
[00:53:04.927 --> 00:53:05.887]  This is all a deep state coup.
[00:53:05.887 --> 00:53:06.548]  It's all admitted now.
[00:53:06.548 --> 00:53:08.348]  It's all out in the open, you see?
[00:53:08.348 --> 00:53:09.148]  What are you going to do?
[00:53:09.148 --> 00:53:11.509]  What are they going to do?
[00:53:11.509 --> 00:53:13.130]  Joe in Louisiana, thanks for holding.
[00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:14.010]  Thanks for calling.
[00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:15.130]  I really appreciate you.
[00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:18.011]  What do you think is coming next?
[00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:23.893]  I wouldn't be surprised if a false flag would be implicated, executed.
[00:53:24.918 --> 00:53:38.405]  To distract and just like a circus magician, redirect your attention to this hand over here while something else is going on on the other.
[00:53:38.405 --> 00:53:39.405]  I totally agree with you.
[00:53:39.405 --> 00:53:41.946]  In fact, you were on the board before I brought up false flags.
[00:53:41.946 --> 00:53:44.007]  That's what you wanted to get into.
[00:53:44.007 --> 00:53:49.430]  We're entering the season of false flags to prop up the House of Cards.
[00:53:52.093 --> 00:53:55.154]  That's all they got.
[00:53:55.154 --> 00:54:01.495]  How many lies can you commit before it just blows up in your face?
[00:54:01.495 --> 00:54:10.817]  They gotta have something extraordinary for people to look at and say, oh my, let's do something, let's do something, and the government be the savior of the world.
[00:54:10.817 --> 00:54:11.797]  How do we counter that?
[00:54:11.797 --> 00:54:19.319]  Because you're not supposed to question public events, but so many of them are staged, some of them are fake, and they get caught constantly.
[00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:20.659]  How do we get out ahead of that?
[00:54:24.016 --> 00:54:28.742]  Well, it's called wisdom, and wisdom comes from above.
[00:54:28.742 --> 00:54:31.985]  The wisdom of this world is foolishness.
[00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:44.419]  The only wisdom that is eternal comes from God, and I don't see that happening with them, those that are wanting to take over this world with the prince of this world.
[00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:55.854]  I was about to say, they've been given all the money and all the power and all the mechanisms, but notice how they're getting uglier and stupider and dumber and making more mistakes and just flopping around like fish out of water.
[00:54:55.854 --> 00:54:57.895]  Look at the wages of their master.
[00:54:57.895 --> 00:55:00.257]  Look at what they're turning into.
[00:55:00.257 --> 00:55:00.877]  Exactly.
[00:55:00.877 --> 00:55:07.140]  I was telling my wife the other day, I read the last chapter of the book, okay?
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:13.023]  Those that have their trust in the Lord, they know how the outcome is going to end up.
[00:55:14.105 --> 00:55:24.493]  They're the ones that's scratching for every bit of ground that they can possibly get, and they're being deceived, thinking that they're going to win.
[00:55:24.493 --> 00:55:32.840]  I agree, and the final part of the equation is, we have to spread the word because the beast will make war against the saints and overcome us, but only in the first half.
[00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.446]  In the second half, we win.
[00:55:36.446 --> 00:55:37.767]  And people have to be ready.
[00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:42.431]  The churches that tell folks, oh, it's going to be great, you'll get beamed out of here like Star Trek before it all happens.
[00:55:42.431 --> 00:55:43.813]  That's not in the Bible.
[00:55:43.813 --> 00:55:44.774]  It's not going to happen.
[00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:45.594]  Don't be deceived.
[00:55:45.594 --> 00:55:52.160]  That's why Christ said, you know, be very careful and read the Bible and have discernment because even the elect, if it was possible,
[00:55:52.941 --> 00:55:54.442]  Would be deceived.
[00:55:54.442 --> 00:55:58.845]  And you really can't get deceived on the big issues if you've got God in you.
[00:55:58.845 --> 00:55:59.726]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:55:59.726 --> 00:56:00.387]  God bless you, sir.
[00:56:00.387 --> 00:56:01.788]  I appreciate the call, Joe.
[00:56:01.788 --> 00:56:03.449]  Lauren in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[00:56:03.449 --> 00:56:05.450]  Lauren, thanks for calling today.
[00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.712]  Oh, Alex, my captain, my captain.
[00:56:07.712 --> 00:56:09.393]  So good to hear from you finally.
[00:56:09.393 --> 00:56:11.955]  Thank you for calling.
[00:56:11.955 --> 00:56:13.516]  Thank you for having me.
[00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:15.858]  So listen, the pendulum always swings back.
[00:56:16.514 --> 00:56:18.275]  They are exposed now.
[00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:21.637]  We see their Luciferian system for what it is.
[00:56:21.637 --> 00:56:26.019]  Nadler, Pelosi, all these people, we know their names.
[00:56:26.019 --> 00:56:27.840]  We know they're the scum of the earth.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.443]  And I know good names like Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan and the good people that are trying to help us.
[00:56:34.249 --> 00:56:36.489]  So who cares what they have planned?
[00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:40.390]  Who cares what they, their big globalist operation to get us?
[00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:41.430]  Who cares?
[00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.771]  They're exposed to the light!
[00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:46.531]  And sunlight is the best disinfectant.
[00:56:46.531 --> 00:56:48.031]  We have them, sir.
[00:56:48.031 --> 00:56:49.112]  We have them!
[00:56:49.112 --> 00:56:52.172]  Lauren, but why doesn't Communist China ever get out from under it?
[00:56:52.172 --> 00:56:57.393]  I agree that we've had Providence, and the West has had Providence because of Christianity.
[00:56:57.393 --> 00:57:02.534]  The West was not doing anything but literally mainly living in caves and stuff until we got Christ.
[00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:03.194]  Then we took off.
[00:57:04.404 --> 00:57:05.725]  IQ and all of it didn't do it.
[00:57:05.725 --> 00:57:10.167]  It took that final equation of Christianity and of God.
[00:57:10.167 --> 00:57:17.991]  So yes, yes, everything they do to us, but only because we still have Christians in this nation, that's why they're trying to eradicate it and lower that hedge of protection.
[00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:21.412]  You can't have communism without satanism.
[00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:22.453]  It's an ism.
[00:57:22.453 --> 00:57:25.435]  It's an evil practice that will not prevail.
[00:57:25.435 --> 00:57:33.119]  And the only reason it survives in China is because China was an imperial nation, and I think imperialism got mixed up with China.
[00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:34.060]  Stay there, Lauren.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.400]  Listen to how smart our listeners are.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.282]  I'm going to come right back and get more of your wisdom.
[00:57:37.282 --> 00:57:38.842]  And then we're going to everybody else.
[00:57:38.842 --> 00:57:40.503]  I'm taking a ton of calls next hour.
[00:57:40.503 --> 00:57:41.864]  I'm wound up and ready.
[00:57:41.864 --> 00:57:43.125]  And we've got a bunch of guests as well.
[00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:44.786]  But first, I'm going right back to your calls.

[00:59:51.916 --> 00:59:54.537]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:07.365]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.365 --> 01:00:11.692]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:15.318]  Oh, there's definitely a war on for your mind, your body, your soul.
[01:00:15.318 --> 01:00:16.539]  We're talking to Lauren and Mass.
[01:00:18.361 --> 01:00:20.642]  I agree that this isn't going well for them in the House.
[01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:21.282]  They're going to pass it.
[01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:23.023]  It's going to go in the Senate.
[01:00:23.023 --> 01:00:26.324]  But the dirty tricks they're going to pull, we need to be aware of those.
[01:00:26.324 --> 01:00:33.866]  I mean, what are we going to do if, say, a black college gets attacked and 300 poor black people get killed, and it's some guy running around saying, I love Trump, I love Trump.
[01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:35.606]  I mean, you know they've got that wound up.
[01:00:35.606 --> 01:00:37.787]  You know the deep state's trying to pull that.
[01:00:37.787 --> 01:00:40.368]  So they've got some serious wild cards up their sleeves.
[01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:46.067]  I think that you are unaware that something's happening in the nation.
[01:00:46.067 --> 01:00:51.151]  I live in Revere, Massachusetts, one of the most mixed places in the country.
[01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:54.873]  Muslims, Latinos, Chinese, very mixed.
[01:00:54.873 --> 01:00:58.076]  And I walk around with my Interwar Trump pants shirt.
[01:00:58.076 --> 01:00:59.056]  I don't care.
[01:00:59.056 --> 01:00:59.817]  I am who I am.
[01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:01.278]  Beautiful.
[01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.079]  And people know what's up, sir.
[01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:09.564]  People understand what's happening, that they have, they indicted him on the most ridiculous
[01:01:10.262 --> 01:01:12.823]  What was that?
[01:01:12.823 --> 01:01:14.584]  He didn't do what we told him to do.
[01:01:14.584 --> 01:01:16.084]  Are you kidding me?
[01:01:16.084 --> 01:01:18.285]  He's the president with unlimited power!
[01:01:18.285 --> 01:01:23.307]  Well, unlimited is the separation of powers unless he commits a crime against the people and then they have a real reason.
[01:01:23.307 --> 01:01:23.867]  Exactly.
[01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:28.669]  But executing his office faithfully, he is allowed to keep whatever he wants away from Congress.
[01:01:28.669 --> 01:01:30.890]  And the idea that he doesn't submit to them is totally true.
[01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.591]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:34.731]  Yeah, I went down to the Christmas tree to shoot some videos.
[01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:37.632]  It was mainly Hispanic Americans, but a lot of folks didn't speak English.
[01:01:37.632 --> 01:01:38.633]  It looked like they weren't from here.
[01:01:39.213 --> 01:01:45.798]  They were all the ones going, Merry Christmas, and yeah, you're right, and broken English saying, yes, war on Christmas, we know about it, war on the family.
[01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:50.181]  And so, yeah, the globalists are losing, trying to turn all the minorities into racist idiots.
[01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:50.881]  It's not working.
[01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:52.382]  It's why they're panicking.
[01:01:52.382 --> 01:01:53.563]  Let's take another call here.
[01:01:53.563 --> 01:01:54.243]  Let's go ahead.
[01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:58.346]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:01:58.346 --> 01:02:00.748]  Let's take a call from Andre in New York.
[01:02:00.748 --> 01:02:01.628]  You're on the air, Andre.
[01:02:01.628 --> 01:02:02.209]  Thanks for calling.
[01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:05.531]  Hi Alex.
[01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:06.731]  Hi, welcome.
[01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:07.332]  Hi.
[01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.873]  Hi, it's Andrea.
[01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:10.253]  Andrea, I'm sorry I read your name wrong.
[01:02:10.253 --> 01:02:11.614]  I'm a dummy.
[01:02:11.614 --> 01:02:12.655]  That's okay.
[01:02:12.655 --> 01:02:13.915]  Andrea is a very pretty name.
[01:02:13.915 --> 01:02:15.256]  Sorry.
[01:02:15.256 --> 01:02:16.437]  That's okay.
[01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:21.659]  First of all, I want to thank you for what you're doing and I commend Owen Troyer for yesterday.
[01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:24.621]  I thought that he was very brave in what he did.
[01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:26.362]  I'm calling from New York.
[01:02:26.362 --> 01:02:27.903]  Okay.
[01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:30.624]  I live in a suburb outside of New York.
[01:02:30.624 --> 01:02:31.525]  I'm a woman.
[01:02:31.525 --> 01:02:33.166]  I'm a suburban woman.
[01:02:34.515 --> 01:02:41.519]  And I want to tell you that what you are promoting around the country is great, but there's a problem in New York.
[01:02:41.519 --> 01:02:44.020]  Now, we all grew up with Trump.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.462]  We all know Trump's background before he became president.
[01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:55.206]  There are a lot of people that love him, including Jerry Nadler, that loved him before he became president, was always asking him for money.
[01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:57.847]  We know the backstory of his life.
[01:02:57.847 --> 01:03:02.490]  However, my problem is, is I want to get involved and do what you want.
[01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:04.785]  Or telling the guests to do.
[01:03:04.785 --> 01:03:05.726]  But I have a problem.
[01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:08.528]  I work in New York City.
[01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:11.810]  There was one incident where I was walking to a client.
[01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:13.151]  I was in a building.
[01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:20.016]  There was this crazy lady screaming and yelling and carrying on about something that happened with the abortion or whatever.
[01:03:20.016 --> 01:03:24.319]  And she turned to me and she said to me, and what do you think?
[01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:29.342]  And I learned that I have to keep my mouth shut because if I don't, they will attack
[01:03:30.255 --> 01:03:32.176]  I know a bunch of people that have been attacked.
[01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:32.837]  No, no, you're right.
[01:03:32.837 --> 01:03:37.279]  The left, the governor said Christians and conservatives and gun owners and pro-liberals should get out of the state.
[01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:41.042]  So you're saying if you speak out, you'll be fired, you'll be physically attacked.
[01:03:41.042 --> 01:03:46.885]  You're living in a Soviet nightmare and you're letting other Americans know that New York's not free right now?
[01:03:46.885 --> 01:03:48.826]  No, New York is not free.
[01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.127]  So I didn't say nothing.
[01:03:50.763 --> 01:03:52.204]  They couldn't.
[01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:55.786]  I didn't have any garb on or anything which I would love to wear.
[01:03:55.786 --> 01:03:57.448]  I'd love to wear your t-shirt.
[01:03:57.448 --> 01:03:58.949]  I'd love to wear everything with Trump.
[01:03:58.949 --> 01:04:00.249]  I have a keychain.
[01:04:00.249 --> 01:04:01.250]  But that's about it.
[01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:04.592]  But you're living under such a Soviet tyranny that you can't do it.
[01:04:04.592 --> 01:04:11.036]  I mean, listen, I know in blue areas like of Austin, they will physically attack you if you're wearing a Trump shirt or an Infowars shirt.
[01:04:11.036 --> 01:04:11.757]  And I understand.
[01:04:11.757 --> 01:04:16.620]  And I go out as a man and do it as an exercise of free speech and as a stunt.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.081]  And it shows us how far we've gotten.
[01:04:18.081 --> 01:04:19.142]  I mean, how far we've gone down.
[01:04:20.464 --> 01:04:29.087]  Right, and what I'm trying to say is that I wanted to finish the story, so she's yelling at me and I said, I'm sorry ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:04:29.087 --> 01:04:30.867]  I proceed to go in the elevator.
[01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.468]  It was totally packed.
[01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:36.489]  She turns around to me and she says to me, you're one of those.
[01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:39.270]  You listen to the guy with the tin hat.
[01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.050]  I swear she said that.
[01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:42.531]  I said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:04:43.117 --> 01:04:44.478]  Screaming, yelling, crying.
[01:04:44.478 --> 01:04:46.000]  I said, get away from me.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.360]  Get out.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.061]  Hold on.
[01:04:47.061 --> 01:04:48.482]  Listen, Gerald Solande is popping in.
[01:04:48.482 --> 01:04:50.824]  We'll go back to calls, but don't hang up, Andrea.
[01:04:50.824 --> 01:04:52.146]  I want to hear this story.
[01:04:52.146 --> 01:04:52.606]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:52.606 --> 01:04:56.350]  I'm the archetype of the devil now to these people with all these shows, Homeland.
[01:04:57.774 --> 01:05:02.436]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival.
[01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:15.380]  And we're at war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence, that's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families, trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:25.964]  Well, Infowars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[01:05:26.664 --> 01:05:33.447]  That's why we're running giant Cyber Week specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[01:05:33.447 --> 01:05:39.070]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.591]  Don't do your shopping with the New World Order, Amazon.
[01:05:42.591 --> 01:05:44.252]  Do it with InfoWars Store.
[01:05:44.252 --> 01:05:50.195]  Get high-quality supplements, get high-quality air filtration, water filtration, Patriot apparel, and so much more.
[01:05:50.195 --> 01:05:54.516]  And every order gets a whole bunch of free InfoWars bumper stickers to spread the word.
[01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:55.397]  Take action, folks.
[01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:13.162]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:06:13.162 --> 01:06:15.548]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.546 --> 01:06:25.007]  Dems charged Trump with abuse of power, obstruction of Congress, not submitting to them.
[01:06:25.007 --> 01:06:29.789]  Gerald Cilente, Trends Forecaster, has got his list of trends for 2020 coming out today.
[01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:33.570]  We're going to be talking to him in a moment, and we'll continue on with phone calls.
[01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:38.271]  Dave, Tyler, Bobby, Dennis, Danny, Bart, Ryan, Tyler, Gordon.
[01:06:38.271 --> 01:06:43.752]  Calls from Hawaii to Washington, from Arizona to Virginia, from Oregon to Pennsylvania.
[01:06:43.752 --> 01:06:45.212]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[01:06:45.212 --> 01:06:47.473]  I want to finish up with Andrea.
[01:06:49.130 --> 01:07:03.396]  In New York, if you just joined us, she was talking about in New York you get fired from your job if you support Trump or Americana or the trade war against China that Pelosi's been trying to help China block Trump on.
[01:07:03.396 --> 01:07:08.098]  And she said that this woman was yelling and screaming about people that weren't for abortion.
[01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:10.979]  And then she wouldn't say anything to the woman.
[01:07:10.979 --> 01:07:16.584]  So the woman got on the elevator with her and said, oh, you listen to that tinfoil hat guy on the Internet.
[01:07:16.584 --> 01:07:18.125]  That's what I'm called by these people.
[01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:25.451]  So she was finishing up the story about they're so looking for enemies now that they will target you.
[01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:26.832]  Devin Nunes was on Fox this morning.
[01:07:26.832 --> 01:07:31.176]  He talked about he was in New York yesterday before he flew back to D.C.
[01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:32.057]  to be on Fox News.
[01:07:32.057 --> 01:07:37.021]  He said in his hotel, a man with what looked like grandchildren came up and said, we're going to get you Russian agent.
[01:07:38.436 --> 01:07:39.257]  And that's what happens to me.
[01:07:39.257 --> 01:07:40.317]  They go, we're going to kill you.
[01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:42.299]  We're going to put you in prison.
[01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:44.541]  This is what, you're a Russian agent, you're a white supremacist.
[01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:44.981]  They do this.
[01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:48.443]  So finish up your story, ma'am, please.
[01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:48.844]  Yeah.
[01:07:48.844 --> 01:07:57.410]  So, so anyway, so I, I kept my mouth shut and, and he was trying to get in my face and it was very crowded and the people look very nervous.
[01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:02.574]  Nobody was sticking up for me or even, you know, going with her.
[01:08:02.574 --> 01:08:04.095]  So I said, get out of my face.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.562]  I said, I'm not going to get into an encounter with you.
[01:08:07.562 --> 01:08:12.204]  And she says, and she starts telling me, what are you doing to your body?
[01:08:12.204 --> 01:08:17.087]  And, and, and, and you know what he is and all, you know, talking about you and talking about President Trump.
[01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:25.472]  So as she gets out of the elevator and the door is halfway closed, I turned to her and I said, you're lucky I didn't take your hair and knock you out.
[01:08:25.472 --> 01:08:26.893]  But that's all I can do.
[01:08:27.563 --> 01:08:38.165]  I get from President Trump and Melania Trump and all through the mail asking me to represent my district.
[01:08:38.165 --> 01:08:39.845]  I'm afraid to do that.
[01:08:39.845 --> 01:08:41.746]  I'm afraid to speak up.
[01:08:41.746 --> 01:08:44.966]  So I feel like I'm living in like... No, I understand.
[01:08:44.966 --> 01:08:52.188]  And Jonathan Turley, the liberal constitutional lawyer who voted for Obama and who voted for Hillary,
[01:08:53.533 --> 01:09:00.075]  He's now getting death threats and so is his dog, and then the national news station where he said it, took the video offline.
[01:09:00.075 --> 01:09:04.777]  And I've got that article on Infowars.com, but only the text because the video's been taken down.
[01:09:04.777 --> 01:09:12.140]  Jonathan Turley, then they threatened my dog for defending Trump at impeachment hearings, when all he was doing was defending the rule of law.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.080]  So God bless you, Andrea.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:20.663]  You're calling into radio, you're speaking out, you can do things online, you can covertly put up Infowars stickers that are free in every order.
[01:09:21.443 --> 01:09:22.684]  But yes, I understand.
[01:09:22.684 --> 01:09:25.447]  That's why I wanted to have you on and hold you over.
[01:09:25.447 --> 01:09:28.731]  So Gerald Cilente, before we get to these trends, he's just popping in briefly.
[01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:35.478]  I really appreciate him being on with us today, just giving us a boil down of what's coming out in his new trends journal for the year, his big one.
[01:09:35.478 --> 01:09:36.439]  And boy, has he been accurate.
[01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.361]  So we really appreciate him being here with us.
[01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:42.745]  He's in Kingston, New York, and I wonder how popular populism is there.
[01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.166]  But yes, in many blue cities,
[01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:49.489]  Being pro-gun, being pro-Trump, being pro-America.
[01:09:49.489 --> 01:09:50.569]  Now the Democrats love war.
[01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:53.570]  They're against Trump trying to end these wars.
[01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.831]  How do you respond to that?
[01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:59.112]  How do you respond to the Governor of New York saying, if you're pro-Second Amendment, get out of the state?
[01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.093]  I mean, this is real bullying, Gerald.
[01:10:02.093 --> 01:10:02.713]  Yeah, it is.
[01:10:02.713 --> 01:10:06.154]  And it's only going to get worse as we see it.
[01:10:06.154 --> 01:10:11.055]  And I've never seen the country so divided and it's so sad.
[01:10:11.055 --> 01:10:14.496]  Because you mentioned about, you know, the Russian agent, stupidity.
[01:10:15.179 --> 01:10:20.043]  The whole thing went out one shred of evidence and they keep going back.
[01:10:20.043 --> 01:10:23.065]  How come Hillary Clinton lost because of the Russians?
[01:10:23.065 --> 01:10:26.167]  No, Hillary Clinton lost because people couldn't stand her.
[01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:33.313]  I mean, you know, both her and Trump, by the way, had very high negative poll ratings in terms of personality.
[01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:36.555]  It was like 63% of the people didn't care for her.
[01:10:36.555 --> 01:10:39.618]  But look at how we have been taught to hate the Russians.
[01:10:40.216 --> 01:10:44.539]  Look how we're being taught now to hate the Chinese and the Iranians and on and on.
[01:10:44.539 --> 01:10:46.060]  And the people pick up soundbites.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.641]  Same thing with Trump.
[01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:58.447]  So now it's we're going to go into an election like I've never seen with such a split in the nation like the one going on now.
[01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:01.669]  So you're going to have, as we see it, the majority.
[01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:04.471]  And we're talking about New Yorkers, New Yorkers, California.
[01:11:04.471 --> 01:11:09.334]  That's a whole different world compared to the rest of the nation, the East Coast and West Coasts.
[01:11:10.054 --> 01:11:15.156]  So you're going to have the popular vote as we see it go against Trump.
[01:11:15.156 --> 01:11:22.918]  But as I mentioned, one of our top trends is Trump 2020 by default.
[01:11:22.918 --> 01:11:26.760]  And it's default of the Democrats.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.580]  They don't have anybody to run up against him.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.181]  He's going to win the swing states.
[01:11:30.714 --> 01:11:33.555]  With the candidates set up as they are now.
[01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:37.955]  I agree, but the Democrats are trying to set up civil unrest ahead of them.
[01:11:37.955 --> 01:11:42.196]  What are the wild cards that Trump should look out for, in your view?
[01:11:42.196 --> 01:11:53.918]  Well, as far as them setting up civil unrest, the people that support Trump will get out stronger than those against him, depending on who's running against him.
[01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:57.519]  So if you've got a Joe Biden, you're not going to get young people.
[01:11:58.286 --> 01:12:05.150]  Young people are not going to go nuts over that Bernie Sanders had his day and Elizabeth Warren doesn't have it.
[01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:10.413]  So the wild card... The Tulsi Gabbards of the establishment didn't try to block her, beat Trump?
[01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:14.295]  I think Tulsi Gabbard to me is the best wild card.
[01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:24.041]  Because, and again, that might be a sentiment and I try not to be put my heart into these things, but she is anti-war and as being a
[01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:30.199]  A veteran and worked in the medical section of that.
[01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:35.701]  She saw the suffering, you know, of the soldiers coming in and being wounded.
[01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:38.623]  You talk about one of the roughest places is in the medical corps.
[01:12:38.623 --> 01:12:40.003]  My God.
[01:12:40.003 --> 01:12:45.886]  And that's why she's so against it, because the people have no clue of what war is.
[01:12:45.886 --> 01:12:48.547]  So I think she's the only wild card.
[01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:53.589]  But as the trump card that could play against him, you don't know what's going to happen with the economy.
[01:12:54.307 --> 01:12:58.651]  The markets are artificially propped up, as we know with the repo markets.
[01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:08.458]  I mean, nobody's ever heard of a repo market before, and the Feds have pumped in over $3 trillion since... And that's my next question.
[01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:14.102]  What is your analysis for next year in the economy?
[01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:21.268]  The economy should do okay, because I believe they're going to lower interest rates again, probably two times at least.
[01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:26.432]  We may be down to zero to negative interest rate policy by next year.
[01:13:26.432 --> 01:13:28.834]  There's a global slowdown.
[01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:31.256]  And you could look at these job numbers that came out.
[01:13:31.256 --> 01:13:33.698]  But when you look behind them, they're not great.
[01:13:33.698 --> 01:13:45.870]  The jobs that we've created, like an ambulatory services, you know, health care, working in restaurants, hospitality sector, they don't pay a lot.
[01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:48.182]  There's a global slowdown.
[01:13:48.182 --> 01:13:50.002]  India, China.
[01:13:50.002 --> 01:13:54.764]  Again, the economy globally is going to slow down continually.
[01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:57.085]  They're going to have to prop up the American economy.
[01:13:57.085 --> 01:14:01.287]  So I think this year, next time, we'll be like we are today.
[01:14:01.287 --> 01:14:04.068]  It'll be more of the same, but a little worse.
[01:14:04.068 --> 01:14:08.310]  And the Democrats are not coming up with anything to give a better solution.
[01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:14.993]  All they're saying is, we're going to increase your taxes, spend more money, and that's not going to work to improve the economy.
[01:14:15.947 --> 01:14:18.230]  What are your predictions on the impeachment?
[01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:19.191]  I think you said it.
[01:14:19.191 --> 01:14:21.914]  It's going to pass in the House, fail in the Senate.
[01:14:21.914 --> 01:14:23.176]  It makes no difference.
[01:14:23.176 --> 01:14:24.958]  It's going to blow away.
[01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:27.140]  By this time next year, it'll be forgotten.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.522]  It's a waste of time.
[01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:31.505]  And as I said, it's going to be a negative for Biden.
[01:14:33.561 --> 01:14:41.147]  Because there's going to become more and more information coming out about the dirty deals that Big Joe did for his little boy, Hunter.
[01:14:41.147 --> 01:14:44.230]  What is Chief going to do when he finally is forced to come in the Senate?
[01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:47.573]  I mean, they're going to get in a lot of trouble in the Senate once what they've done comes out.
[01:14:47.573 --> 01:14:50.475]  I mean, the illegal spying on the media that Chief's doing?
[01:14:50.475 --> 01:14:52.397]  That guy's a maniac.
[01:14:52.397 --> 01:14:53.338]  Exactly.
[01:14:53.338 --> 01:14:55.960]  And again, he's a warmonger besides.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.601]  I mean, by their deeds, you shall know him.
[01:14:57.601 --> 01:14:58.142]  But again,
[01:14:58.945 --> 01:15:10.530]  How did his little boy Hunter get a job in Ukraine making 50k plus a month and didn't know anything about the energy business or had been to Ukraine?
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:11.650]  What am I, six years old?
[01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:13.291]  I got to swallow this crap?
[01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:20.114]  And that's what the people are going to feel because they don't like Joe Biden already.
[01:15:20.114 --> 01:15:21.534]  He ain't that popular.
[01:15:21.534 --> 01:15:23.595]  All right, we're going to break, Joe.
[01:15:23.595 --> 01:15:27.437]  So I'll tell you, what are some of the other big trends coming out in your trends forecast for 2020?
[01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:38.595]  The New World Disorder, it's going on around the world, from Ecuador to Chile, to Sudan, to Zimbabwe, to Lebanon, to France.
[01:15:38.595 --> 01:15:40.296]  This is going wild.
[01:15:40.296 --> 01:15:42.378]  And add another one on to that.
[01:15:42.378 --> 01:15:43.099]  The homeless?
[01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:44.079]  Oof!
[01:15:44.079 --> 01:15:46.621]  We haven't seen the beginning of the homeless trend.
[01:15:46.621 --> 01:15:52.325]  Alright, so break down the worldwide upsurge in rioting and homelessness and what's behind it.
[01:15:52.325 --> 01:15:52.906]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.027 --> 01:16:01.754]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[01:16:01.754 --> 01:16:06.879]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:16:06.879 --> 01:16:14.328]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:16:14.588 --> 01:16:17.990]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:22.633]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:16:22.633 --> 01:16:24.434]  Not a security IPO or note.
[01:16:24.434 --> 01:16:33.080]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:33.940]  Each month.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.781]  Don't miss this one.
[01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:35.621]  Stake your claim today.
[01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:35.822]  Call 800-600-3388.
[01:16:35.822 --> 01:16:36.022]  That's 800-600-3388.
[01:16:36.022 --> 01:16:37.342]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:37.683]  Call now.
[01:16:37.683 --> 01:16:37.743]  800-600-3388.

[01:17:25.513 --> 01:17:26.734]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:26.734 --> 01:17:30.656]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:30.656 --> 01:17:32.197]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:32.197 --> 01:17:35.159]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:40.722]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:41.923]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.864]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:44.864 --> 01:17:47.086]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[01:17:59.298 --> 01:18:03.821]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, it doesn't matter if you're a woman, it doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[01:18:03.821 --> 01:18:08.663]  As you age, preglanone levels in the body go down.
[01:18:08.663 --> 01:18:21.350]  Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglanone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis, and then it just gets wilder from there.
[01:18:22.091 --> 01:18:22.291]  I think?
[01:18:39.412 --> 01:18:39.612]  Thank you.

[01:20:32.624 --> 01:20:36.465]  He's got his big trends of next year coming out.
[01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:37.846]  Find more details there on the site.
[01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:38.766]  Find his daily shows.
[01:20:38.766 --> 01:20:40.306]  He does as well.
[01:20:40.306 --> 01:20:41.507]  Also guest host with us.
[01:20:41.507 --> 01:20:42.047]  We really appreciate it.
[01:20:42.047 --> 01:20:43.047]  We're only here a few more minutes.
[01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:58.434]  Plunging into global trends, you have been, for a long time, saying homelessness is going to increase, civil unrest is going to get really bad, and you've been tracking that very accurately.
[01:20:58.434 --> 01:21:03.898]  Tell us what's happening, and then tell us why it's happening, and then where you think it's going.
[01:21:03.898 --> 01:21:08.402]  The what's happening on the New World Disorder, it's basically one issue.
[01:21:08.402 --> 01:21:09.983]  Income inequality.
[01:21:09.983 --> 01:21:14.166]  You know what I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it, and they're losing it.
[01:21:15.266 --> 01:21:19.089]  They're fighting for their lives.
[01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:20.890]  So now think about it.
[01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:23.392]  You think we have an immigration problem now?
[01:21:23.392 --> 01:21:24.973]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[01:21:24.973 --> 01:21:27.014]  Because the global economy is slowing down.
[01:21:27.014 --> 01:21:27.795]  That's a fact.
[01:21:27.795 --> 01:21:28.776]  It's there.
[01:21:28.776 --> 01:21:33.899]  You're seeing these revolutions and civil wars and demonstrations and unrest all over the globe.
[01:21:33.899 --> 01:21:42.445]  As I said, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Lebanon, Hong Kong.
[01:21:43.496 --> 01:21:47.519]  Algeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe, you go all over the world.
[01:21:47.519 --> 01:21:49.801]  Now, the economy slows down.
[01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:51.102]  Go back to 1930.
[01:21:51.102 --> 01:21:55.184]  You had 2 billion people on the planet.
[01:21:55.184 --> 01:21:59.027]  In 90 years we added 5.5 billion people.
[01:21:59.027 --> 01:22:02.310]  Now you've got to slow down an economy, you have civil unrest.
[01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:09.615]  You think people are going to try to leave where they are because of war, because of violence, because of corruption, because of poverty?
[01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:12.484]  So now, where are they going to go?
[01:22:12.484 --> 01:22:15.685]  They're going to try to go to places where they're going to be safe.
[01:22:15.685 --> 01:22:17.265]  Are they going to find jobs?
[01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.086]  No!
[01:22:18.086 --> 01:22:25.768]  You're not going to find jobs in America because this economy is not creating those kind of jobs and we're seeing more and more homeless.
[01:22:25.768 --> 01:22:31.770]  There's going to be homeless problems all over the world in a city, town, village near you.
[01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:35.852]  It's just going to increase and they're doing nothing to prepare for this.
[01:22:35.852 --> 01:22:39.473]  And I have some solutions because people say, you know, you say about what's going on,
[01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.627]  How are you going to fix it?
[01:22:41.627 --> 01:22:44.031]  Well, as you know, I'm up here in Kingston, New York.
[01:22:44.031 --> 01:22:46.354]  It's the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
[01:22:46.354 --> 01:22:48.378]  Used to be a thing called the Borscht Belt.
[01:22:48.378 --> 01:22:51.983]  Back in the day, all the great entertainers came up to the Catskills.
[01:22:51.983 --> 01:22:53.225]  Those places are all gone.
[01:22:53.749 --> 01:22:55.830]  The beautiful Catskill Mountains.
[01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:06.014]  How about taking people out of these housing developments and all these people sleeping on the streets and putting them in these beautiful places and fix them up.
[01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:09.055]  And now they could farm, they could cook, they could make things.
[01:23:09.055 --> 01:23:11.476]  Instead, they never do that for citizens and veterans.
[01:23:11.476 --> 01:23:16.838]  They bring in unskilled people, mainly from the Middle East, put them on welfare and put them in areas like that.
[01:23:16.838 --> 01:23:18.019]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:20.660]  We need a renaissance here.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:29.785]  Instead, the UN and the globalists are weaponizing the third world, making them hate the West, and getting ready to bring them in during the collapse as a political weapon.
[01:23:29.785 --> 01:23:32.327]  Yeah, and again, even the ones we have here already.
[01:23:32.327 --> 01:23:34.348]  And it's terrible.
[01:23:35.089 --> 01:23:43.314]  So, in other words, let's take some real money, and it isn't a lot considering the trillion dollars we spend on a defense budget.
[01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:52.138]  Just create economic development zones that are tax-free to move people into the rural, gorgeous areas and revitalize what's already waiting there.
[01:23:52.138 --> 01:23:57.121]  I mean, what, just 30, 40 years ago, what, didn't Rodney Dangerfield have a club up at the Catskills?
[01:23:57.121 --> 01:23:58.502]  I mean, everybody went up there.
[01:23:59.342 --> 01:24:00.963]  Yeah, all the greats.
[01:24:00.963 --> 01:24:04.764]  So now you have this beautiful land and all this state land, federal land.
[01:24:04.764 --> 01:24:08.285]  We can work to do these, but people are not looking ahead.
[01:24:08.285 --> 01:24:09.706]  By the way, I've been to the Catskills.
[01:24:09.706 --> 01:24:11.626]  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
[01:24:11.626 --> 01:24:13.147]  And like you said, it's a freaking ghost town.
[01:24:14.264 --> 01:24:15.806]  Yeah, a lot of them.
[01:24:15.806 --> 01:24:17.329]  And of course, a lot of them's coming back.
[01:24:17.329 --> 01:24:17.970]  But there's that.
[01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:27.725]  So now, you know, I was at a party and a guy worth, I'm saying in the 30, 40, 50 million dollar range, all he kept doing is talking about Trump.
[01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:28.627]  You can't stand Trump.
[01:24:28.627 --> 01:24:29.348]  Can't stand Trump.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.461]  And I said, are you looking at the things going on around the world?
[01:24:33.461 --> 01:24:36.643]  He knew nothing about what was going on in the places I'm talking about.
[01:24:36.643 --> 01:24:40.565]  Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Lebanon, nothing.
[01:24:40.565 --> 01:24:41.065]  Venezuela.
[01:24:41.065 --> 01:24:42.345]  Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:46.287]  So what I'm saying is people are not preparing for what's coming down.
[01:24:46.287 --> 01:24:50.829]  And they don't even want to have any border while the third world is collapsing and been weaponized.
[01:24:52.071 --> 01:24:52.792]  Exactly.
[01:24:52.792 --> 01:24:56.377]  And what I'm saying is we have to deal with this now.
[01:24:56.377 --> 01:24:58.039]  It's going to get worse.
[01:24:58.039 --> 01:25:00.742]  But people are not looking to the future.
[01:25:00.742 --> 01:25:03.425]  The news is just telling you garbage.
[01:25:03.425 --> 01:25:05.408]  We tell you this is going on.
[01:25:05.408 --> 01:25:06.970]  This is what it means.
[01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:08.211]  This is where it's going.
[01:25:08.872 --> 01:25:10.312]  How can we address it?
[01:25:10.312 --> 01:25:11.613]  Well, I want to invite you down.
[01:25:11.613 --> 01:25:19.415]  I'll fly you down here, Gerald, in the next few weeks to come down here and co-host shows with us and do a whole breakdown of this, because I totally agree with your analysis.
[01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:31.017]  You were about 10 years ahead on this, but it's all coming, and the globalists want to use this to flood us and totally control us and use the crisis to end nation-states as they exist, and that's not going to even help the third world.
[01:25:31.017 --> 01:25:37.779]  I want to help them and help us, but we've got to really understand that globalism is what has helped engineer this and what has helped create it.
[01:25:37.779 --> 01:25:38.099]  We have
[01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:38.939]  To stop it.
[01:25:38.939 --> 01:25:40.100]  What are some of the other trends?
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.261]  Real quick, and then I'd love to have you back next week for a full hour.
[01:25:43.261 --> 01:25:46.802]  Yeah, yeah, well, on some high notes, you know, elegance.
[01:25:46.802 --> 01:25:48.662]  You know, go back to the Roaring Twenties.
[01:25:48.662 --> 01:25:52.164]  I have a photo of my parents, man, of Saul's rest in peace at their wedding, 1934.
[01:25:52.164 --> 01:25:55.305]  Height of the Depression.
[01:25:55.305 --> 01:25:57.525]  Everybody's dressed to the nines.
[01:25:57.525 --> 01:25:59.686]  They worked in factories.
[01:25:59.686 --> 01:26:01.246]  They were construction workers.
[01:26:01.246 --> 01:26:02.667]  People need to respect themselves again.
[01:26:04.264 --> 01:26:09.546]  Bring yourself to the highest level as things go down, so you don't go down with it.
[01:26:09.546 --> 01:26:11.947]  Because this thing's going down.
[01:26:11.947 --> 01:26:13.148]  You just said it.
[01:26:13.148 --> 01:26:16.169]  Have the self-respect of who you are and who your ancestors are.
[01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:18.050]  Don't feel bad when everything's hell around you.
[01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:20.491]  Don't let that take you over and depress you.
[01:26:20.491 --> 01:26:23.512]  Surviving and moving forward is victory.
[01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:24.312]  You got it.
[01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:25.373]  Perfectly said.
[01:26:25.373 --> 01:26:33.116]  Now, an entrepreneur that sees these trends say, OK, how could I jump on that and make it happen?
[01:26:34.543 --> 01:26:35.263]  Swing time.
[01:26:35.263 --> 01:26:41.185]  The hottest, happiest music America ever knew at the height of the Great Depression.
[01:26:41.185 --> 01:26:42.766]  So that's what we're seeing.
[01:26:42.766 --> 01:26:43.946]  It's the roaring 2020s.
[01:26:43.946 --> 01:26:48.587]  Hey listen, Infowars is under attack like never before and it's causing us to innovate and do incredible things.
[01:26:48.587 --> 01:26:49.848]  Gerald, amazing.
[01:26:49.848 --> 01:26:53.029]  Please join us for a full hour next week to get more into this and take calls.
[01:26:53.029 --> 01:26:54.769]  And thank you so much.
[01:26:54.769 --> 01:26:56.790]  Again, how do people get a copy of this great magazine?
[01:26:57.711 --> 01:27:00.652]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[01:27:00.652 --> 01:27:02.352]  The only magazine like it in the world.
[01:27:02.352 --> 01:27:03.673]  Money-back guarantee.
[01:27:03.673 --> 01:27:06.054]  TrendsJournal.com and Trends Research takes the same place.
[01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.634]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[01:27:07.634 --> 01:27:08.694]  Thank you.
[01:27:08.694 --> 01:27:09.035]  All right.
[01:27:09.035 --> 01:27:14.816]  Well, we've got several other guests popping up, but I'm going to get to all your calls today, and I appreciate everybody calling in, and I appreciate your points.
[01:27:14.816 --> 01:27:18.718]  So let's get one in here before we go to break, and a few more, and another guest pops in.
[01:27:18.718 --> 01:27:20.358]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:27:20.358 --> 01:27:23.879]  That would be Bart in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:23.879 --> 01:27:24.459]  Bart, thank you.
[01:27:24.459 --> 01:27:24.760]  Go ahead.
[01:27:26.858 --> 01:27:30.360]  Alex, it's great listening to you.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.681]  I'm like you.
[01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:37.965]  My Savior and Lord is Jesus Christ, and I have all the faith in Him, and I know He's going to pull us through this.
[01:27:37.965 --> 01:27:38.525]  Yes.
[01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:44.808]  Remember what Jesus said, it'll get worse than the days before Noah.
[01:27:44.808 --> 01:27:54.854]  If you recall in Genesis, early part of Genesis, why did God get upset when the fallen angels mixed into the human race?
[01:27:54.854 --> 01:27:55.935]  Genetic engineering.
[01:27:57.128 --> 01:27:57.929]  Exactly.
[01:27:57.929 --> 01:27:59.991]  They were destroying the human race.
[01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:02.073]  And do you think God is going to continue with that?
[01:28:02.073 --> 01:28:03.954]  No.
[01:28:03.954 --> 01:28:04.815]  There's going to be a record.
[01:28:04.815 --> 01:28:05.636]  No, God made us.
[01:28:05.636 --> 01:28:10.200]  That is the ultimate sin to God, is manipulating the human genome.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.002]  And he will not let that happen.
[01:28:12.002 --> 01:28:14.484]  And I have faith that all that will happen.
[01:28:14.484 --> 01:28:15.705]  But also, Jesus said,
[01:28:16.684 --> 01:28:19.226]  In revelations and throughout the gospel.
[01:28:19.226 --> 01:28:20.147]  Bart, don't hang up.
[01:28:20.147 --> 01:28:20.527]  Don't hang up.
[01:28:20.527 --> 01:28:21.528]  I've got one more guest popping in.
[01:28:21.528 --> 01:28:22.308]  I'm going to let you finish.
[01:28:22.308 --> 01:28:24.670]  I'm going to get to them quickly, but they're very important as well.
[01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.831]  And then we're going to go to calls.
[01:28:25.831 --> 01:28:27.772]  Boom, boom, boom, to the very end of the show.
[01:28:27.772 --> 01:28:29.613]  The No Insurance is popping in, but I promise callers.
[01:28:29.613 --> 01:28:30.614]  There's going to be tons of calls.
[01:28:30.614 --> 01:28:33.236]  Not just these calls, but everybody at 877-789-2539.
[01:28:33.236 --> 01:28:38.139]  The phones are full right now, but after I get to these, you can call in.
[01:28:38.139 --> 01:28:38.880]  Nobody hang up.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.642]  Bart, finish up what you're saying right there.
[01:28:41.642 --> 01:28:42.623]  That's why I'm so urgent.
[01:28:43.304 --> 01:28:50.138]  Is that you can feel God's spirit with this evil and what's happening and you know it's dangerous and that's why I want the evil to stop.
[01:28:50.138 --> 01:28:50.539]  You know what?
[01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:52.503]  It's not going to stop and God's wrath is going to come in.

[01:31:17.953 --> 01:31:19.294]  We're being taken off the land.
[01:31:20.154 --> 01:31:30.807]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[01:31:30.807 --> 01:31:39.957]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:42.900]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.

[01:32:59.464 --> 01:33:02.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.916 --> 01:33:21.439]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:21.439 --> 01:33:25.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.081 --> 01:33:26.882]  His name is Peter Dabrowski.
[01:33:26.882 --> 01:33:27.662]  House candidate.
[01:33:27.662 --> 01:33:32.145]  Gives Tucker his case for an all-out immigration moratorium.
[01:33:32.145 --> 01:33:32.805]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:33:32.805 --> 01:33:34.706]  The Democrats are weaponizing the people coming in.
[01:33:34.706 --> 01:33:35.707]  We're going bankrupt.
[01:33:35.707 --> 01:33:37.408]  They're trying to break our borders.
[01:33:37.408 --> 01:33:39.529]  Absolutely, we need a moratorium.
[01:33:39.529 --> 01:33:40.729]  We need it now.
[01:33:40.729 --> 01:33:41.770]  The crime waves.
[01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.951]  All of it is just unbelievable.
[01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.312]  Here he is talking about it on Tucker.
[01:33:46.804 --> 01:33:49.846]  Pete Dabrowski is a congressional candidate from the state of North Carolina.
[01:33:49.846 --> 01:33:53.688]  He's called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration.
[01:33:53.688 --> 01:33:54.228]  He joins us.
[01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:55.569]  Pete, thanks so much for coming on tonight.
[01:33:55.569 --> 01:33:59.110]  When you say all immigration, do you mean all immigration or just all illegal immigration?
[01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.450]  Sure.
[01:33:59.450 --> 01:34:02.392]  So Tucker, it's important that we define what an immigration moratorium is.
[01:34:02.432 --> 01:34:04.353]  Well, you are not alone.
[01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:27.693]  And then it goes on from there, and he makes his case for that.
[01:34:27.693 --> 01:34:28.174]  Here's the deal.
[01:34:28.174 --> 01:34:31.199]  The Democrats, the globalists, have weaponized the population.
[01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:34.485]  As you just heard, Gerald Celente, he's a classical liberal.
[01:34:34.485 --> 01:34:36.368]  He travels all over the world, a lot.
[01:34:37.256 --> 01:34:42.239]  He was the best-selling, number one New York Times best-selling author on subjects like this in 1982 and stuff like that.
[01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:46.683]  And he's saying that the third world's about to totally collapse.
[01:34:46.683 --> 01:34:55.349]  And the Democrats are collapsing cities into third world conditions by design to gain power and control and to make money off the crisis that they manage.
[01:34:55.349 --> 01:34:58.291]  Here are some of the headlines dealing with it.
[01:34:58.291 --> 01:35:02.834]  Sweden Rape Most Convicted Attackers Foreign Born.
[01:35:02.834 --> 01:35:04.135]  Says Government Report, BBC.
[01:35:05.507 --> 01:35:10.865]  Italian government numbers show 42% of rapes are carried out by migrants alone, not even non-citizens.
[01:35:12.025 --> 01:35:16.308]  Swedish couple savagely tortured for hours by Hitler-worshipping Islamist migrant.
[01:35:16.308 --> 01:35:18.350]  That's at europewars.com.
[01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:20.671]  Mayors ask Trump to import more refugees to U.S.
[01:35:20.671 --> 01:35:22.032]  for cultural diversity.
[01:35:22.032 --> 01:35:24.074]  Say America's too white, too Christian.
[01:35:24.074 --> 01:35:25.755]  These are quotes.
[01:35:25.755 --> 01:35:29.017]  And admit that they're on welfare, but say that's what we need.
[01:35:29.017 --> 01:35:31.799]  Record number of African migrants at U.S.-Mexico border.
[01:35:31.799 --> 01:35:35.582]  Many of them untested from the Congo where there is Ebola that's now reached the Caribbean.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.823]  So, Pete Nebraska joins us, Pete4NC.com.
[01:35:42.823 --> 01:35:45.705]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:35:45.705 --> 01:35:53.511]  Okay, and again, we're very, very excited about all of that, and we're very excited about him coming on, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:35:53.511 --> 01:36:00.015]  Again, he was supposed to be on yesterday, but he's going to be actually coming on today.
[01:36:00.876 --> 01:36:06.938]  Now, before I go any further, though, I want to go back to that Tucker piece with him and play some more of it.
[01:36:06.938 --> 01:36:09.900]  And then we're going to go back to Bart and then all the other callers.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:13.921]  We're going to get to every single one of them here on the list.
[01:36:13.921 --> 01:36:20.524]  David, Tyler, Bobby, Dennis, Danny, Nick, Ryan, Tyler, Gordon and others here in just a moment.
[01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:27.607]  But first, I just wanted to get to that stack of news that I hadn't got to yet, because it just illustrates everything
[01:36:29.011 --> 01:36:43.500]  That he is saying, that Pete's saying, and that's what Gerald Celente's saying, because it's the truth, and the UN says they are carrying this out, and they say it is their plan.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.641]  So here's more of him on Tucker, then we'll go to your calls.
[01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:52.674]  But bottom line, we would like to have no population increase from legal immigration.
[01:36:52.674 --> 01:36:54.815]  You are not allowed to say that.
[01:36:54.815 --> 01:37:00.699]  So the left has decided, because the left controls the terms that the right uses, as you know, and the right goes along with this.
[01:37:00.699 --> 01:37:08.084]  And you're allowed to say under duress that you're against illegal immigration, but you're never allowed to say that there should be some absolute cap.
[01:37:08.724 --> 01:37:09.945]  Why are you saying that?
[01:37:09.945 --> 01:37:14.449]  Well, those are the old party rules, Tucker, and I think that there's a new Republican Party in town.
[01:37:14.449 --> 01:37:21.635]  It's people like myself who are, you know, younger and less controlled by, should we say, the conservative Inc.
[01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:27.419]  crowd, or maybe the donor class in Washington, D.C., and the political elites.
[01:37:27.419 --> 01:37:29.001]  We understand the game.
[01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:32.824]  We understand that the Chamber of Commerce has bought and paid for our congresspeople.
[01:37:33.064 --> 01:37:38.646]  And we understand that it has bought and paid for organizations like Turning Point USA.
[01:37:38.646 --> 01:37:49.790]  We understand it has bought and paid for media outlets like the Daily Wire, for example, who are not meaningfully conservative in any way, who can never be trusted to conserve anything.
[01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:52.951]  So tell me what your rationale is, though.
[01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:59.553]  I mean, they're going to attack you probably on a bunch of different levels for saying this.
[01:37:59.553 --> 01:38:01.314]  Why should people agree with your idea?
[01:38:02.014 --> 01:38:14.164]  Well, Tucker, I mean, when you think about the situation that we have economically in America, where the working class continues to dwindle, legal immigration is not helping us in this scenario.
[01:38:14.164 --> 01:38:21.790]  So we're bringing in roughly a million legal immigrants a year in various visa programs and via green cards.
[01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:30.837]  And these folks are increasingly taking jobs not just from working class Americans, you know, like we do with the sort of farm visas like you were just discussing,
[01:38:31.617 --> 01:38:35.720]  But increasingly from middle-class Americans, too.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:43.404]  So we're, I mean, Congress, even Republicans in Congress, supposed conservatives, are lobbying right now to increase high-skilled tech.
[01:38:43.404 --> 01:38:46.345]  That's right, and he's going to be again with us next hour.
[01:38:46.345 --> 01:38:57.712]  I'm going to your calls, but the reason I wanted to raise this is I see the articles out of Europe every day, and I don't cover them because I've already read them, I've already looked at them, and they make me so upset.
[01:38:59.124 --> 01:39:00.705]  That I tend to not go back to them.
[01:39:00.705 --> 01:39:02.727]  It's not really a conscious thing.
[01:39:02.727 --> 01:39:08.211]  It's that it's so upsetting, it's so ridiculous, it's so crazy, you can't believe it.
[01:39:08.211 --> 01:39:11.853]  Like, everybody's seeing this happen five years ago, four years ago.
[01:39:11.853 --> 01:39:18.878]  The footage of the old Italian man at his little family-owned hotel they'd owned for 200 years, only held 20 rooms.
[01:39:18.878 --> 01:39:20.459]  So 40, 50 people could stay there.
[01:39:20.459 --> 01:39:22.140]  Little bitty restaurant by the sea.
[01:39:23.539 --> 01:39:39.164]  And they bring in African migrants who illegally landed on the beach and the federal police are laughing while the old man cries and the tenants are thrown out and given their money back.
[01:39:39.164 --> 01:39:45.026]  There's hours of this on Italian TV and the illegal aliens move into his hotel.
[01:39:45.026 --> 01:39:45.987]  Well, I mean, I saw
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:40:05.084]  This week, we're in Sweden, they're kicking people out of their old folks' Section 8 housing, welfare housing, saying, oh, the toilets weren't green enough, they were a centimeter too small, and they just use that as the cover to move the Islamicist military-age men in.
[01:40:05.084 --> 01:40:10.906]  And I see these articles every day.
[01:40:10.906 --> 01:40:14.166]  And then articles about how we should praise and love the Islamicists.
[01:40:14.166 --> 01:40:15.967]  When we go to their countries, they don't give us crap.
[01:40:17.734 --> 01:40:19.254]  Except kill you if you don't convert.
[01:40:19.254 --> 01:40:21.415]  It's crazy.
[01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:23.796]  But this is the authoritarianism of these people.
[01:40:23.796 --> 01:40:24.496]  So I'm going to go to Bart.
[01:40:24.496 --> 01:40:28.817]  I'm going to go to everybody here in just a moment.
[01:40:28.817 --> 01:40:31.298]  Here's another article on this.
[01:40:31.298 --> 01:40:38.340]  CIS.org, 63% of non-citizen households access welfare programs in the United States.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.981]  It's over 80% in Europe of these Islamic illegal aliens.
[01:40:42.981 --> 01:40:46.642]  And again, I'll tell you, people from Mexico and other places try to assimilate.
[01:40:47.492 --> 01:40:48.835]  Mexico's a war zone now.
[01:40:48.835 --> 01:40:50.117]  Its population has exploded.
[01:40:50.117 --> 01:40:50.999]  There's big problems.
[01:40:50.999 --> 01:40:56.430]  But Islamists out of the Middle East are like cancer when you bring them in.
[01:40:57.845 --> 01:41:05.330]  And the third world, I mean, they don't let Islamists move into places in the third world because they're not stupid.
[01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:08.772]  They have some form of tribalism to protect themselves.
[01:41:08.772 --> 01:41:10.313]  So, this is a UN plan.
[01:41:10.313 --> 01:41:13.175]  I know everybody knows it, but we need to make a big deal about it.
[01:41:13.175 --> 01:41:14.676]  Okay, I want to get back into impeachment.
[01:41:14.676 --> 01:41:16.137]  I want to get back into the articles.
[01:41:16.137 --> 01:41:17.578]  I want to get back into your calls.
[01:41:17.578 --> 01:41:18.278]  I want to do it all.
[01:41:18.278 --> 01:41:19.339]  I'm not going to plug next segment.
[01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:20.900]  I'm going to do it in just a minute and a half left here.
[01:41:22.096 --> 01:41:39.322]  Ladies and gentlemen, our big sale, we got a lot of big sales going in free shipping and double patriot points at m4store.com, and it is your Christmas shopping with us that helps us continue on and do a lot of amazing things like you saw with Owen in Congress, and we'll be at the Trump rally tonight, we've got reporters all over the U.S., and we're just so many times the outlet that breaks the big news.
[01:41:39.322 --> 01:41:40.982]  That's what they're trying to shut us down.
[01:41:40.982 --> 01:41:44.264]  Well, we have the Real Red Pill and the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:47.945]  Real Red Pill Plus just has three forms of good, healthy, added energy in it.
[01:41:49.025 --> 01:41:55.187]  And it has vitamins, minerals, but then preglanone, which again the system tries to suppress.
[01:41:55.187 --> 01:41:59.008]  We have the good form of preglanone that's the basis of all the hormones in the body.
[01:41:59.008 --> 01:42:02.109]  It's over the counter, but they're moving to try to stop that.
[01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:03.549]  Been around for a hundred years.
[01:42:03.549 --> 01:42:05.130]  They really suppress it.
[01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:08.471]  Get a bottle of this for $29.95.
[01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:09.951]  That is very close to cost.
[01:42:09.951 --> 01:42:12.032]  It's like 20 bucks a bottle for us.
[01:42:12.032 --> 01:42:12.432]  And then
[01:42:13.832 --> 01:42:23.402]  You will get a free bottle of bio-true selenium from the mustard seed with it, ladies and gentlemen, and that is a big, big, big deal.
[01:42:26.147 --> 01:42:26.607]  Selenium.
[01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.928]  If you don't have selenium, you die.
[01:42:27.928 --> 01:42:28.868]  It's electrochemical.
[01:42:28.868 --> 01:42:31.069]  It's what all the cells use to operate.
[01:42:31.069 --> 01:42:33.971]  So you add that with the preglanone, the vitamins, the minerals.
[01:42:33.971 --> 01:42:35.551]  It is an explosive combination.
[01:42:35.551 --> 01:42:36.772]  You want to go next level, this is it.
[01:42:36.772 --> 01:42:37.652]  Be careful.
[01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:39.593]  Consult your physician, because this isn't a game.
[01:42:39.593 --> 01:42:41.534]  We sell hardcore, real stuff.
[01:42:41.534 --> 01:42:43.455]  It's one of our big sales at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:44.156]  Great for you.
[01:42:44.156 --> 01:42:45.256]  Great for a gift.
[01:42:45.256 --> 01:42:48.398]  And we're selling out of all the big inventory to fund into next year.
[01:42:48.398 --> 01:42:50.418]  So please take action at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:50.418 --> 01:42:53.120]  I will come back, and I'll take five calls in the next segment.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:53.500]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.016 --> 01:43:02.860]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:14.088]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:43:14.668 --> 01:43:20.134]  There is no one formula that you're gonna find out there that is more game-changing.
[01:43:20.134 --> 01:43:22.597]  It's 65% off right now.
[01:43:22.597 --> 01:43:28.644]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling BioTrue Selenium for the mustard seed.
[01:43:28.644 --> 01:43:29.565]  These two formulas go
[01:43:29.585 --> 01:43:29.885]  I think so.
[01:43:55.766 --> 01:44:03.593]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars, with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[01:44:57.102 --> 01:45:00.323]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[01:45:00.323 --> 01:45:17.707]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[01:45:17.707 --> 01:45:19.047]  We're being taken off the land.
[01:45:19.907 --> 01:45:30.552]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[01:45:30.552 --> 01:45:39.696]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[01:45:40.456 --> 01:45:43.799]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[01:45:43.799 --> 01:45:48.302]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[01:45:48.302 --> 01:45:50.144]  This is the post-human error.
[01:45:50.144 --> 01:45:52.926]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[01:45:52.926 --> 01:45:54.367]  This is the crossroads.
[01:45:54.367 --> 01:45:56.209]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.

[01:46:41.974 --> 01:46:44.015]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:10.117 --> 01:47:19.723]  Waging War.
[01:47:19.723 --> 01:47:22.324]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:47:22.324 --> 01:47:23.845]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:23.845 --> 01:47:29.968]  All right, let's move quickly through your calls, because I want to get to a lot of them.
[01:47:29.968 --> 01:47:34.431]  Bart was talking about God's Spirit, what can be done against the globalists.
[01:47:34.431 --> 01:47:35.691]  Finish up the points you were making, Bart.
[01:47:35.691 --> 01:47:36.472]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:47:37.506 --> 01:47:48.508]  Well, what I mean about the Globalist is, if you look back in the Bible and read it, and through all the Gospels, what Jesus keeps reminding us is, ye of little faith.
[01:47:48.508 --> 01:47:53.989]  I mean, you've got to have faith in the Lord that he's going to be protecting us and taking us through.
[01:47:53.989 --> 01:48:06.291]  Yes, we're going to have some hard times, but just go back to the beginning at Genesis, when the fallen angels try to corrupt the human race, and God interfered, and that's why the flood of Noah came.
[01:48:07.165 --> 01:48:12.447]  And then after Noah made his sacrifice, he told man to eat meat.
[01:48:12.447 --> 01:48:15.088]  Man was a vegetarian before that.
[01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:17.208]  What are we hearing now today?
[01:48:17.208 --> 01:48:18.649]  Oh, not to eat meat.
[01:48:18.649 --> 01:48:20.429]  Not to do this.
[01:48:20.429 --> 01:48:32.553]  And all the corruption of the defiled sect going on in the days of Noah is coming back with these drag queen readings in the library.
[01:48:32.553 --> 01:48:34.634]  Well, you know, the drag queens are the priesthood.
[01:48:35.782 --> 01:48:39.704]  Their men in demonic clown outfits is what Satan is actually wearing in their events.
[01:48:39.704 --> 01:48:45.988]  And then they are the priesthood, and then our children are given to them, and then they teach them perversion, and it's all done out in the open.
[01:48:45.988 --> 01:48:46.708]  You're absolutely right.
[01:48:46.708 --> 01:48:57.074]  And if you read the Bible, and then you go back and study what those civilizations were doing, the Bible says they were being taught this by fallen entities from space.
[01:48:57.074 --> 01:48:58.755]  And then now we see it all repeating.
[01:48:58.755 --> 01:48:59.835]  I appreciate your call, Bart.
[01:48:59.835 --> 01:49:00.296]  Great points.
[01:49:01.314 --> 01:49:04.416]  Make no mistake, we've never been in Kansas.
[01:49:04.416 --> 01:49:14.101]  This planet, you know, the archetype Kansas is calm and nice and then you go to the Magic World and the Emerald Castle and all the rest of it.
[01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:18.043]  There's a lot of stuff going on and the establishment knows that and they bet on the wrong team.
[01:49:18.043 --> 01:49:21.285]  They bet on the wrong honcho.
[01:49:21.285 --> 01:49:23.966]  Let's go ahead and go to more calls here.
[01:49:23.966 --> 01:49:26.347]  Up next is David in Washington State.
[01:49:26.347 --> 01:49:27.148]  Thank you for calling.
[01:49:27.148 --> 01:49:27.448]  Go ahead.
[01:49:30.482 --> 01:49:32.524]  Quick comment.
[01:49:32.524 --> 01:49:36.606]  I've been using TurboForce and I'll tell you what, I got everybody around me hooked on it.
[01:49:36.606 --> 01:49:38.267]  Stuff is amazing.
[01:49:38.267 --> 01:49:39.627]  Truly amazing.
[01:49:39.627 --> 01:49:44.790]  Tell me what you think of TurboForce because I went to like four or five big top places.
[01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:51.133]  I got a famous nutrition developer, well-known person if you're into that, he's a household name, and we paid him a lot of money.
[01:49:51.133 --> 01:49:53.995]  He didn't want his name on it because of how we get attacked, but I said I really want
[01:49:54.535 --> 01:50:00.937]  If companies would put more money into something, as most companies put almost nothing into it and still works really great, you know, similar things.
[01:50:00.937 --> 01:50:06.839]  This has more of the natural energy ingredients, more of the enzymes, however it all works.
[01:50:06.839 --> 01:50:10.201]  I mean, we put more into turbo force than anybody else does.
[01:50:10.201 --> 01:50:12.061]  It's really 10-hour clean energy.
[01:50:12.061 --> 01:50:13.182]  What did turbo force do for you?
[01:50:14.324 --> 01:50:14.544]  All right.
[01:50:14.544 --> 01:50:16.785]  So first off, Will Johnson was right.
[01:50:16.785 --> 01:50:19.626]  Got to use orange juice and if not, pineapple juice.
[01:50:19.626 --> 01:50:21.566]  Two best things you can ever use.
[01:50:21.566 --> 01:50:22.387]  OK.
[01:50:22.387 --> 01:50:26.028]  Second off, a lot of the products, to be honest, don't work for me.
[01:50:26.028 --> 01:50:33.310]  But this one was like I gave to a friend of the guinea pig because I was like, oh, I'm not sure it's going to work.
[01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:34.831]  It worked.
[01:50:34.831 --> 01:50:37.792]  And, you know, I mean, you know, I run heavy equipment.
[01:50:38.379 --> 01:50:38.799]  Well, the reason
[01:51:00.322 --> 01:51:11.017]  The reason sometimes Knockout works better, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes Brain Force Plus works better, sometimes it doesn't, is these are real, organic, high-quality sourcing and compounds.
[01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:15.012]  And sometimes the herbs aren't as strong as the next batch.
[01:51:15.012 --> 01:51:18.332]  It's kind of like, sometimes you go get cherries at the store and it's the same company.
[01:51:18.332 --> 01:51:19.873]  Everything may taste really good.
[01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:21.593]  Sometimes they look good, but don't taste good.
[01:51:21.593 --> 01:51:23.553]  You know, or they look bad, but taste great.
[01:51:23.553 --> 01:51:25.214]  I mean, these are real formulas.
[01:51:25.214 --> 01:51:28.434]  So, and they're natural and they're organic.
[01:51:28.434 --> 01:51:30.915]  And so that's why they're going to vary batch to batch.
[01:51:30.915 --> 01:51:32.195]  So, God bless you.
[01:51:32.195 --> 01:51:35.436]  What's your point on the IG report I see you wanted to get into?
[01:51:36.391 --> 01:51:37.331]  Two things.
[01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:44.013]  First off, the IG report, listen, everybody, you know, you'd have to be living in a hole in the wall if you didn't see this one coming.
[01:51:44.013 --> 01:51:49.754]  I mean, honestly, you know, the whole deck stacked against Trump, it doesn't really matter.
[01:51:49.754 --> 01:52:00.156]  You know, I mean, we as a citizen, you know, we could do something, but really, I see all day long, people, oh, I want to do this, or oh, I want to do that, but no one stands up anymore.
[01:52:00.156 --> 01:52:00.936]  Everybody is afraid.
[01:52:01.713 --> 01:52:02.734]  Everybody's afraid.
[01:52:02.734 --> 01:52:12.604]  You know, I'm glad you raised this because I wanted to come in here on Friday and Monday and say this and I was all ready to talk about it and really thought about it and was all hyped up and then I forgot.
[01:52:12.604 --> 01:52:17.109]  So let me just briefly say something about this and then hopefully do a whole show on it and take calls on just this subject.
[01:52:18.576 --> 01:52:21.277]  Everyone's calling what Owen did the most brave thing they ever saw.
[01:52:21.277 --> 01:52:27.719]  Come on, firefighters going in collapsing buildings, rescue divers, and the people that went into those caves in Malaysia to get all those kids out.
[01:52:27.719 --> 01:52:31.800]  I mean, that is scarier than hell and super dangerous than what three or four divers died.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:36.942]  Now that's going into a situation where you got probably a 5% chance to die.
[01:52:36.942 --> 01:52:38.922]  Every dive, you do 20, 30 missions.
[01:52:38.922 --> 01:52:43.304]  I mean, B-17 pilots, half of them were dying in World War II over Germany.
[01:52:43.304 --> 01:52:46.245]  I mean, there are certain things where you know you're about to die and you still do it.
[01:52:47.805 --> 01:52:55.731]  But just going in and standing up to criminals and getting arrested and maybe paying a $1,000 fine, that's important and Owen did it and he's awesome.
[01:52:55.731 --> 01:53:00.635]  But exactly, how have people gotten so cowed where they're afraid of what's going to happen to them?
[01:53:00.635 --> 01:53:07.320]  That's called living in tyranny and that's what you ought to be scared of, is the end product of laying down means you're a slave.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.461]  Keep going.
[01:53:08.461 --> 01:53:13.585]  I don't tell anybody that I voted because, you know, where I live, you know, you just don't say it.
[01:53:14.281 --> 01:53:15.783]  Can I say one really important thing that really upsets me?
[01:53:15.783 --> 01:53:16.944]  And I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:53:16.944 --> 01:53:18.045]  I'll be completely frank.
[01:53:32.662 --> 01:53:34.503]  You know what aggravates me most about you?
[01:53:34.503 --> 01:53:41.428]  And I'm sorry, I hate to break this to you, but when you sit there and tell people that I can't do this anymore, you know, that's like crushing us.
[01:53:41.428 --> 01:53:44.870]  When we hear you sit there and say, oh, well, you know, I just can't do this anymore.
[01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:45.450]  I gotta give up.
[01:53:45.450 --> 01:53:50.333]  You know, believe it or not, you say that the audience is, you know, is the power.
[01:53:50.333 --> 01:53:54.356]  But the reality is you give the audience the word.
[01:53:54.356 --> 01:53:57.057]  You give us... David, let me just stop right there.
[01:53:57.057 --> 01:53:57.718]  Here's the problem.
[01:53:59.198 --> 01:54:13.685]  When I get super angry, and when they literally hand me stacks of news, so many stories of them teaching pedophilia to children in schools, so many stories of them cutting three-year-olds' balls off now, that I will say, I can't take it anymore because I'm about to turn the desk over.
[01:54:13.685 --> 01:54:15.326]  A minute later, I'm okay.
[01:54:15.326 --> 01:54:16.246]  I'm not scripted.
[01:54:16.246 --> 01:54:17.787]  What I'm saying, I really feel.
[01:54:17.787 --> 01:54:23.110]  I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I'm very, you know, extroverted when it comes to that.
[01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:24.590]  I don't mean it, but you're right.
[01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:27.312]  But I mean, sometimes, like three, four hours into the show,
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.643]  What I'm really saying is, man, I want to start killing people.
[01:54:32.643 --> 01:54:39.148]  That's what that means is I can't do this anymore because I start thinking about being violent and I'm not going to be violent.
[01:54:39.148 --> 01:54:41.029]  I'm just saying that's what that really means.
[01:54:41.029 --> 01:54:41.629]  Okay.
[01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:42.470]  Is it a certain point?
[01:54:43.626 --> 01:54:54.828]  They got it all set up where if we get violent, they're going to say we're the bad guys, even though they're the violent people with the vaccines and the GMOs and the hurting children and destroying their futures and all the corruption and all the things they do.
[01:54:54.828 --> 01:54:58.949]  And so when I say that, it means as a man, I'm redlining like a race car engine.
[01:54:58.949 --> 01:54:59.849]  So I apologize.
[01:54:59.849 --> 01:55:01.109]  You're absolutely right, David.
[01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:02.090]  I'm going to jump.
[01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:04.610]  I will not say I can't take it anymore.
[01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:05.630]  I'm going to quit.
[01:55:05.630 --> 01:55:07.031]  What I mean is I'm not giving up.
[01:55:07.031 --> 01:55:07.771]  It means I I'm.
[01:55:10.356 --> 01:55:11.857]  I need a vacation, okay?
[01:55:11.857 --> 01:55:13.218]  And it's not in a bad way.
[01:55:13.218 --> 01:55:15.299]  It's like all I do is work now.
[01:55:15.299 --> 01:55:24.363]  And I just need to not be as aggressive is what I'm saying, okay?
[01:55:24.363 --> 01:55:25.724]  Because that's what it comes down to.
[01:55:25.724 --> 01:55:29.706]  But let's go to Danny in Oregon and then Gordon in Hawaii.
[01:55:29.706 --> 01:55:30.387]  Danny, you're on the air.
[01:55:30.387 --> 01:55:32.368]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:32.368 --> 01:55:34.028]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:34.028 --> 01:55:38.731]  You know, I agree with you there as far as people calling in the period that it's
[01:55:39.574 --> 01:55:41.103]  Brave what Owen did, I mean...
[01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:47.524]  It's just what anybody and everybody should be doing at this point.
[01:55:47.524 --> 01:55:51.807]  I'm surprised it took that long for somebody to stand up and start yelling at them.
[01:56:13.141 --> 01:56:15.002]  That's what everyone should be doing!
[01:56:15.002 --> 01:56:24.186]  And that's what I keep saying, it's not extraordinary to say John Hopkins is now doing sex reassignments on three-year-olds.
[01:56:24.186 --> 01:56:24.767]  Okay?
[01:56:24.767 --> 01:56:26.547]  That's a damn criminal action!
[01:56:26.547 --> 01:56:31.210]  And it's not normal to sit here and put up with it!
[01:56:31.210 --> 01:56:33.831]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:56:33.831 --> 01:56:35.111]  No, I agree with you.
[01:56:35.111 --> 01:56:39.353]  I'm just, I am extremely mad.
[01:56:39.353 --> 01:56:40.554]  And you know, I feel
[01:56:42.026 --> 01:56:51.372]  It's that feeling in your spirit when you're just around so much people, um, just kind of bubbling up and it just, I, it got indirected somewhere.
[01:56:51.372 --> 01:56:52.593]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:52.593 --> 01:56:56.656]  And so we're not going to get violent and we don't support offensive violence because they're going to spin it against us.
[01:56:56.656 --> 01:57:03.480]  Even though these globalists are carrying out violence against us, we're going to expose what they're doing and we're going to stop laying down to them.
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.441]  And that's how we're going to do it.
[01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:06.543]  Do you agree with me?
[01:57:06.543 --> 01:57:07.363]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:57:07.363 --> 01:57:07.983]  Absolutely.
[01:57:07.983 --> 01:57:08.684]  Alex.
[01:57:08.684 --> 01:57:10.045]  Uh, and you know, I just, uh,
[01:57:10.996 --> 01:57:19.765]  I hope that everybody and more people will take the inspiration and get up and do something about it.
[01:57:19.765 --> 01:57:20.827]  I'm doing what I can.
[01:57:20.827 --> 01:57:22.829]  It's hard.
[01:57:22.829 --> 01:57:24.971]  I understand everybody says the same thing.
[01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:29.636]  They say, oh, well, you guys can do it, but I have a full-time job.
[01:57:29.636 --> 01:57:31.478]  Well, everybody has a full-time job.
[01:57:31.698 --> 01:57:32.519]  Well, that's it, Danny.
[01:57:32.519 --> 01:57:35.362]  And we all get frustrated because we know about the evil and it should be reversed.
[01:57:35.362 --> 01:57:37.323]  But the good news is, at least we're talking about it.
[01:57:37.323 --> 01:57:39.446]  At least we're trying to censor us because we're effective.
[01:57:39.446 --> 01:57:40.426]  God bless you, Danny.
[01:57:40.426 --> 01:57:41.007]  Thank you.
[01:57:41.007 --> 01:57:42.288]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:42.789]  Stay with us.
[01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:47.153]  Andy in Florida.
[01:57:47.153 --> 01:57:47.753]  Thank you, Andy.
[01:57:47.753 --> 01:57:48.173]  Go ahead.
[01:57:48.173 --> 01:57:49.454]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:49.454 --> 01:57:50.234]  I love you, man.
[01:57:50.234 --> 01:57:50.855]  We love you.
[01:57:50.855 --> 01:57:54.817]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[01:57:54.817 --> 01:57:56.398]  A little bit about me.
[01:57:56.398 --> 01:57:56.998]  I'm 245 pounds.
[01:57:56.998 --> 01:58:00.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.302]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[01:58:03.302 --> 01:58:07.785]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[01:58:08.285 --> 01:58:08.645]  I think so.
[01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.051]  We're really proud of TurboForce, so thank you, sir.
[01:58:26.051 --> 01:58:29.213]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at InfoWareStore.com, then help us spread the word.
[01:58:29.213 --> 01:58:29.953]  Let's just get busy.
[01:58:29.953 --> 01:58:30.373]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:52.443]  It's shocking but true.
[01:58:52.443 --> 01:58:59.530]  2019 is almost a memory in the rear view mirror and Cyber Week is here.
[01:58:59.530 --> 01:59:07.457]  The best deals of the year, store-bought free shipping, triple Patriot points for the first time ever, 50 to 70 percent off.
[01:59:07.457 --> 01:59:10.260]  Many of these products are lost leaders.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:10.900]  We are
[01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:16.863]  Only 330 days out from the 2020 election.
[01:59:16.863 --> 01:59:18.404]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:59:18.404 --> 01:59:23.146]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air when almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[01:59:23.146 --> 01:59:26.468]  Yes, we were the first to be censored because we're such a threat to the globalists.
[01:59:26.468 --> 01:59:29.989]  But now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support, we're still on air.
[01:59:29.989 --> 01:59:32.070]  But bigger attacks are already happening.
[01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:33.031]  More are coming.
[01:59:33.511 --> 01:59:38.256]  So please spread the word about the broadcast and fund our operation while getting great products at the same time.
[01:59:38.256 --> 01:59:40.639]  A true 360 win.
[01:59:40.639 --> 01:59:41.580]  Cyber Week is here.
[01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:49.948]  Get those Christmas presents for you and your family today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:49.948 --> 01:59:52.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.405 --> 02:00:13.630]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:18.112]  You're taking your phone calls.
[02:00:18.112 --> 02:00:21.614]  The two articles of impeachment are out there on the table.
[02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:24.835]  Not doing what Congress orders the President to do, that's not a crime.
[02:00:24.835 --> 02:00:26.996]  Obstructing Congress.
[02:00:26.996 --> 02:00:28.537]  And abuse of power.
[02:00:29.597 --> 02:00:32.278]  I've never seen such projection in my life.
[02:00:32.278 --> 02:00:37.859]  Gordon in the beautiful, most isolated islands of the planet, Hawaii.
[02:00:37.859 --> 02:00:38.920]  Gordon, you're on the air.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.680]  Welcome.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.240]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:44.481]  Yeah, this is paradise where I'm at.
[02:00:44.481 --> 02:00:47.022]  I've got some great news for you.
[02:00:47.022 --> 02:00:57.585]  I listen to Hawaii News now and they have their internet thing going and comments and they did the no one's above the law headline today.
[02:00:57.585 --> 02:00:58.765]  And I'll tell you, nobody
[02:00:59.674 --> 02:01:05.097]  And well, then they had a whole bunch of anti-Trump garbage on there also.
[02:01:05.097 --> 02:01:18.465]  But nobody is buying this Democrat impeachment garbage because normally it's 90% anti-Trump comments, and today it was 90-plus comments for Trump, anti-Democrat.
[02:01:18.465 --> 02:01:24.509]  Everybody is furious here in Hawaii with what the Democrats are doing.
[02:01:24.509 --> 02:01:27.911]  And I find that to be good news because we're so left out here.
[02:01:29.382 --> 02:01:35.488]  There were such leftists out here, they threw us out into the middle of the ocean.
[02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:51.002]  Well, that's what I'm seeing, is that people fundamentally remember Trump being spied on, remember all the crimes being committed, and now the Democrats are denying that that happened, and everything they're saying, Trump's done, they've done, and it's really backfiring.
[02:01:51.002 --> 02:01:52.584]  How do you expect them to pull out of this?
[02:01:54.962 --> 02:01:55.363]  I don't.
[02:01:55.363 --> 02:02:02.608]  There's only one way that we're going to be able to pull out of what's going on, and that's if Trump does something about this censorship.
[02:02:02.608 --> 02:02:07.891]  I am 100% banned, I guess shadow banned, from the internet now.
[02:02:07.891 --> 02:02:14.676]  My Facebook, I get absolutely no acknowledgments, no comments, and I was getting thousands.
[02:02:14.676 --> 02:02:16.357]  Do this.
[02:02:16.357 --> 02:02:19.019]  Use another IP address.
[02:02:19.019 --> 02:02:21.240]  Create something that's about surfing or
[02:02:22.608 --> 02:02:26.970]  And then build a profile on that and then use that for a while and you just have to keep doing it.
[02:02:26.970 --> 02:02:28.651]  You have to keep fooling the AI.
[02:02:28.651 --> 02:02:29.732]  It's a war.
[02:02:29.732 --> 02:02:32.953]  We need everyone to get back on there and hit the enemy hard.
[02:02:32.953 --> 02:02:38.016]  Well, you also have to get a new phone because they go by the phone number also.
[02:02:38.016 --> 02:02:42.118]  I had my other... I'm saying it's worth it.
[02:02:42.118 --> 02:02:43.479]  Go get a burner phone.
[02:02:43.479 --> 02:02:44.239]  Use your landline.
[02:02:44.239 --> 02:02:45.580]  Do whatever you have to do.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:47.441]  Just keep in the fight.
[02:02:47.441 --> 02:02:51.103]  That's exactly what I'm going to do is get a whole nother phone because my other
[02:02:52.174 --> 02:02:58.339]  Uh, Facebook page got taken down because I was on Hawaii News Now and they accused me of being a Russian bot.
[02:02:58.339 --> 02:02:59.440]  Of course!
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:06.686]  Oh, everyone that loves freedom, everyone that wants justice, everyone that wants vaccine safety, everyone that wants common sense, we're all Russians!
[02:03:06.686 --> 02:03:08.267]  You didn't know that?
[02:03:08.267 --> 02:03:09.928]  Oh, I know, yeah.
[02:03:09.928 --> 02:03:10.529]  Thanks, Vlad.
[02:03:11.698 --> 02:03:12.939]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:03:12.939 --> 02:03:13.879]  Great points, Gordon.
[02:03:13.879 --> 02:03:15.060]  Very exciting.
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:20.163]  You see, almost all the calls on local news are saying this is a fiasco.
[02:03:20.163 --> 02:03:21.364]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:03:21.364 --> 02:03:22.744]  Let's take another call before we go to break here.
[02:03:22.744 --> 02:03:25.006]  Let's jam in one more.
[02:03:25.006 --> 02:03:27.327]  Let's go to Nick in New Jersey.
[02:03:27.327 --> 02:03:29.028]  Go ahead.
[02:03:29.028 --> 02:03:29.468]  Hi, Alex.
[02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.088]  How you doing?
[02:03:30.088 --> 02:03:30.469]  Good, brother.
[02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:30.929]  Thanks for calling.
[02:03:31.792 --> 02:03:42.120]  Yeah, so real quick, I just wanted to say, um, I didn't know who you were or what InfoWars was until you guys were banned last year, so I'm one of the examples of how it turned on the globalists.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:42.520]  Beautiful.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.862]  Well, the only way we get out is you spreading the word, brother.
[02:03:44.862 --> 02:03:47.104]  Please release me from prison.
[02:03:47.104 --> 02:03:59.593]  Yes, I show my friends a lot of things and, you know, surprisingly, you know, I'm 23, so a lot of my friends, especially being from New Jersey, are a little liberal, but they don't disagree with things you say, which, you know, I think when people hear what you have to say,
[02:04:00.286 --> 02:04:08.969]  You know, if they're down to actually critically, I think they take that information and hopefully they think about what it is they're seeing.
[02:04:08.969 --> 02:04:14.770]  But really, the reason I called you today was, one, with the impeachment.
[02:04:14.770 --> 02:04:24.293]  I can't remember the man's name now, Talani, one of the four that was talking about how this impeachment is going to only hurt the Democrats.
[02:04:24.293 --> 02:04:25.974]  He was giving the testimony.
[02:04:25.974 --> 02:04:26.734]  The funny thing is,
[02:04:27.403 --> 02:04:33.506]  Hold on, I got a guest popping in, but as soon as we come in, if you can hold, hold, I'm going to pop back in here, what you had to say.
[02:04:33.506 --> 02:04:37.268]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:04:54.790 --> 02:05:02.617]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars, with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[02:05:46.028 --> 02:05:54.393]  8-Pack Power Stack is also at cost at $29.95 with free shipping and over 100 others at InfoWareStore.com and support the InfoWare.
[02:06:05.934 --> 02:06:09.975]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:09.975 --> 02:06:12.316]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.316 --> 02:06:15.297]  Peter Dabrowski is about to join us.
[02:06:15.297 --> 02:06:18.558]  I played this clip last hour, but I'm going to play it again from Dr. Carlson.
[02:06:18.558 --> 02:06:21.319]  Brazil doesn't have a moratorium on immigration.
[02:06:21.319 --> 02:06:23.039]  We've taken in more than we ever have.
[02:06:23.039 --> 02:06:25.320]  The Democrats are turning them against America.
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:26.760]  We have a right to have borders.
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.441]  The third world's collapsing.
[02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:32.062]  We've got to get control of the drug gangs, the Islamic invasions.
[02:06:32.062 --> 02:06:33.022]  Here's some of what he had to say.
[02:06:34.679 --> 02:06:37.682]  Pete Dabrowski is a congressional candidate from the state of North Carolina.
[02:06:37.682 --> 02:06:41.545]  He has called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration.
[02:06:41.545 --> 02:06:42.186]  He joins us now.
[02:06:42.186 --> 02:06:43.427]  Pete, thanks so much for coming on tonight.
[02:06:43.427 --> 02:06:46.970]  When you say all immigration, do you mean all immigration or just all illegal immigration?
[02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:47.311]  Sure.
[02:06:47.311 --> 02:06:55.158]  So Tucker, it's important that we define what an immigration moratorium is, and in this case it means no net immigration to the United States.
[02:06:55.438 --> 02:07:00.264]  So, about 200,000 people leave the United States every year.
[02:07:00.264 --> 02:07:09.995]  Bringing in 200,000 legal aliens would be fine, but bottom line, we would like to have no population increase from legal immigration.
[02:07:11.356 --> 02:07:13.358]  So, Pete Dobroska joins us.
[02:07:13.358 --> 02:07:15.179]  Pete4NC.com.
[02:07:15.179 --> 02:07:16.840]  He's been on Owen's show, The War Room.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:26.146]  He's been on some of the broadcasts like Firepower with Will Johnson, who's out on the road tonight with a crew there in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[02:07:26.146 --> 02:07:29.208]  I'm doing a live broadcast tonight from 6 p.m.
[02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:33.071]  until it ends with live feeds and more at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[02:07:33.071 --> 02:07:39.175]  We're also going to put it out on the radio and TV satellites for TV stations and radio stations that would like to pick that up.
[02:07:39.175 --> 02:07:40.596]  It's going to be pretty powerful, I think.
[02:07:41.096 --> 02:07:44.318]  And I think your listeners will be informed by it.
[02:07:44.318 --> 02:07:48.260]  But I wanted to just talk about the fact that people are like, this is a radical statement.
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.781]  You can't immigrate to Saudi Arabia.
[02:07:49.781 --> 02:07:51.702]  You can't teach Christianity in Saudi Arabia.
[02:07:51.702 --> 02:07:52.442]  You'll get executed.
[02:07:52.442 --> 02:07:56.485]  They didn't take one Islamic refugee, but we've taken millions.
[02:07:57.762 --> 02:07:58.342]  The U.N.
[02:07:58.342 --> 02:08:00.503]  ran our refugee program until two years ago.
[02:08:00.503 --> 02:08:02.364]  Trump took us out of that program.
[02:08:02.364 --> 02:08:05.906]  Now he's signed executive orders blocking even more of it because it's weaponization.
[02:08:05.906 --> 02:08:07.147]  Here's some headlines.
[02:08:07.147 --> 02:08:10.049]  Mayors ask Trump to import more refugees to U.S.
[02:08:10.049 --> 02:08:11.149]  for cultural diversity.
[02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:12.890]  It's a Breitbart article.
[02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:18.593]  And it goes on to have these mayors saying we need this diversity even if they just live on welfare.
[02:08:18.593 --> 02:08:20.294]  Here's a big government study.
[02:08:20.294 --> 02:08:24.256]  63% of non-citizen households access welfare programs.
[02:08:24.256 --> 02:08:24.877]  In Europe it's over 80%.
[02:08:27.264 --> 02:08:28.384]  So it goes on from there.
[02:08:28.384 --> 02:08:34.246]  House candidate in North Carolina, our guest, talks about an all-out moratorium.
[02:08:34.246 --> 02:08:35.447]  Sweden rape.
[02:08:35.447 --> 02:08:40.208]  Most convicted attackers are foreign-born, BBC News reports.
[02:08:40.208 --> 02:08:44.309]  In Italy, it's close to 50% of the actual migrants doing it.
[02:08:44.309 --> 02:08:46.410]  Same thing in Sweden.
[02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:51.131]  And we're just supposed to pay for it all and just unvetted bring people in.
[02:08:51.131 --> 02:08:52.772]  They call it the Underground Railroad.
[02:08:54.053 --> 02:09:02.638]  Well, people were getting out of something bad going to something good, the Underground Railroad, but when people are brought here, they're saying America's bad, the left is, but they're bringing them here.
[02:09:03.834 --> 02:09:05.394]  The supposed Nazi command base.
[02:09:05.394 --> 02:09:09.055]  So, it's been weaponized, the globalists are behind it, we have to shut it down.
[02:09:09.055 --> 02:09:15.277]  And instead of arguing about it all day and the rest of it, we need to go back to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:15.277 --> 02:09:21.178]  The power of the presidency, the Supreme Court has confirmed, has the power to totally shut down legal and illegal immigration.
[02:09:21.178 --> 02:09:26.620]  And I think we should do it just to show it's our house, it's our country, and it's not going to be used by the UN anymore.
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:28.060]  So Pete, thank you for joining us.
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.541]  Give us your take on the situation, your interview last week.
[02:09:31.001 --> 02:09:35.866]  This is the biggest attention I've seen in a long time of a Tucker Carlson interview.
[02:09:35.866 --> 02:09:36.687]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:09:36.687 --> 02:09:37.667]  I appreciate it.
[02:09:37.667 --> 02:09:39.329]  It's good to be on with you.
[02:09:39.329 --> 02:09:48.398]  The immigration moratorium is absolutely a necessary policy to implement and it's one that fortunately for us is gaining steam.
[02:09:49.276 --> 02:09:56.203]  Like you said, the status quo in most countries around the world is closed borders, right?
[02:09:56.203 --> 02:09:58.546]  I mean, you can't go to Poland without the proper paperwork.
[02:09:58.546 --> 02:09:59.887]  They will send you home.
[02:09:59.887 --> 02:10:03.270]  You can't even go to Botswana without the proper paperwork.
[02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:04.331]  They will send you home.
[02:10:04.331 --> 02:10:08.495]  You know, that's a third world country that we're talking about, right?
[02:10:10.198 --> 02:10:15.385]  The idea that this is somehow radical is absolutely untrue.
[02:10:15.385 --> 02:10:19.871]  The idea that this hasn't happened before in American history is absolutely untrue.
[02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:24.658]  For half of the 20th century, there was an immigration moratorium against the United States.
[02:10:25.256 --> 02:10:33.438]  The fact of the matter is, the mass legal immigration to the United States, one million people per year, is not helping us.
[02:10:33.438 --> 02:10:41.420]  It's not helping the conservative cause, because eventually the Republican Party will die by demographics, and it's not helping us economically.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:48.782]  It's putting, you know, working class people out of jobs, and increasingly upper middle class people now out of jobs.
[02:10:48.782 --> 02:10:53.583]  Right now, Mike Lee, a reposed conservative senator from Utah,
[02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:55.053]  The issue is,
[02:11:21.016 --> 02:11:25.952]  Asian immigrants that become citizens tend to become nationalistic and conservative.
[02:11:25.952 --> 02:11:27.757]  A lot of your Indian immigrants do.
[02:11:28.939 --> 02:11:34.301]  But the low-skilled, particularly, are literally put into these refugee camps before they get here.
[02:11:34.301 --> 02:11:37.743]  They're taught a UN globalist doctrine for up to six months.
[02:11:37.743 --> 02:11:38.603]  Then they're brought here.
[02:11:38.603 --> 02:11:42.725]  Democrats pick them up, move them into their houses, collect welfare money off of it.
[02:11:42.725 --> 02:11:48.207]  A lot of Democrats, as you know, now have just a job of managing illegals, who they then make legal.
[02:11:48.207 --> 02:11:51.989]  I mean, this is a takeover plan by the Democrats.
[02:11:51.989 --> 02:11:55.171]  This is a Democrat race-based system.
[02:11:56.371 --> 02:12:01.176]  The Christian ethos of the West, unify us all under Christianity, is a bad thing.
[02:12:01.176 --> 02:12:02.257]  It's a great thing.
[02:12:02.257 --> 02:12:03.278]  It's under attack.
[02:12:03.278 --> 02:12:09.044]  So we're not having people go through the melting pot of Christianity or the love of Western civilization.
[02:12:09.044 --> 02:12:13.489]  Instead, they're being recruited and brought in by the globalists who want to end the nation in their own admissions.
[02:12:13.489 --> 02:12:19.234]  And I have all these clips every week that come out of universities and Democrats saying, white people are bad.
[02:12:19.855 --> 02:12:21.816]  Thank God America isn't white anymore.
[02:12:21.816 --> 02:12:23.456]  The demographics will be communist now.
[02:12:23.456 --> 02:12:27.398]  Well, only because they're teaching brown people to hate America and be communist.
[02:12:27.398 --> 02:12:30.039]  And until that stops, we've got to have a moratorium.
[02:12:30.039 --> 02:12:36.081]  Because they're teaching the brown people that white people are bad, when we're the people that ended the damn slavery worldwide!
[02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:36.741]  I'm sick of it!
[02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:39.070]  Yeah, of course.
[02:12:39.070 --> 02:12:40.392]  The whole premise is absurd.
[02:12:40.392 --> 02:12:45.858]  I mean, you have three out of four legal immigrants that come here will vote for Democrats.
[02:12:45.858 --> 02:12:48.861]  So they're voting to end America as we know it.
[02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:54.047]  They're going to vote for the socialist policies that conservatives claim that they hate.
[02:12:54.047 --> 02:12:58.452]  And I name them by name, and I'll name them by name again, because the people who are doing this to us... No, it's true.
[02:12:58.892 --> 02:13:05.578]  And Republicans keep thinking if they roll a red carpet out and give all the free goodies to people, whether they be black, white, old, young, they're going to be nice.
[02:13:05.578 --> 02:13:12.764]  No, they're being indoctrinated by Democrats, they're controlled by Democrats as a permanent underclass, and they're voting to end the nation.
[02:13:12.764 --> 02:13:15.166]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[02:13:15.166 --> 02:13:16.567]  The leg is cut off.
[02:13:16.567 --> 02:13:23.613]  So if we don't tie a tourniquet on it, turn the brainwashing off, and recruit these people to America, we're already going to be sunk.
[02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:26.612]  That's right, 100%.
[02:13:26.612 --> 02:13:31.435]  And so, fortunately, you know, this conversation is entering the mainstream now.
[02:13:31.435 --> 02:13:36.959]  I know for a fact that there will be other congressional candidates in the 2020 cycle calling for an immigration moratorium.
[02:13:36.959 --> 02:13:39.901]  It is an idea whose time has come.
[02:13:39.901 --> 02:13:41.742]  As much as the D.C.
[02:13:41.742 --> 02:13:47.926]  elites on both sides want to call this idea fringe, they say it's a fringe idea, that's just not true.
[02:13:47.926 --> 02:13:52.189]  The response I've gotten since going on Tucker's show has been overwhelmingly positive.
[02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:54.910]  From ordinary conservatives all around the country.
[02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:57.670]  Yeah, Pete, I don't just hide stuff and say it for no reason.
[02:13:57.670 --> 02:14:00.211]  I mean, Tucker hasn't gotten this much attention.
[02:14:00.211 --> 02:14:01.311]  He gets huge attention all the time.
[02:14:01.311 --> 02:14:02.311]  He's awesome.
[02:14:02.311 --> 02:14:04.072]  And I can't remember, like, six months.
[02:14:04.072 --> 02:14:08.253]  This is like the hottest thing on this show, which shows people want this.
[02:14:08.253 --> 02:14:09.113]  Yes, 100%.
[02:14:09.113 --> 02:14:18.475]  I mean, I started running this campaign in August, Alex, because in my mind, as an ordinary American myself, somebody who grew up in the working class,
[02:14:19.190 --> 02:14:20.931]  It just makes sense, right?
[02:14:20.931 --> 02:14:24.193]  It's what we need at this particular moment in history.
[02:14:24.193 --> 02:14:31.197]  When the big corporations are bringing people in and recruiting them to hate you and politically see you as the enemy, you better stop it.
[02:14:31.197 --> 02:14:32.978]  Yeah, it seems like it would be common sense, right?
[02:14:32.978 --> 02:14:35.499]  But unfortunately, our D.C.
[02:14:35.499 --> 02:14:43.064]  elites don't have much of that and they want to paint us as fringe when really their ideas are the fringe ones.
[02:14:43.064 --> 02:14:46.946]  Well, when you've got the Mexican border police, military,
[02:14:48.147 --> 02:15:01.573]  Being, and they're not wimps, being overrun by huge hordes of people from Africa, not even Latin America, and there's huge caravans of 20,000 smashing across and leftists grabbing them with open arms on the other side.
[02:15:01.573 --> 02:15:03.114]  You better get control of that.
[02:15:03.114 --> 02:15:05.295]  This is, this is road warrior stuff.
[02:15:06.431 --> 02:15:06.951]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:15:06.951 --> 02:15:11.273]  I mean, Mexico is a failed client state of the United States anyways, right?
[02:15:11.273 --> 02:15:24.320]  So it's time for us to close the borders and then maybe start to focus on how Mexico can not be a failed state anymore, considering it's right there on our border and people from all over the world, not just from Latin America, sneak in through their borders.
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.922]  You can go to the Texas border, Alex.
[02:15:26.922 --> 02:15:28.083]  I'm sure you know this.
[02:15:28.083 --> 02:15:32.646]  In the middle of the desert, they have signs trying to make sure people don't get lost.
[02:15:32.646 --> 02:15:34.868]  Illegal aliens who have crossed illegally don't get lost.
[02:15:34.868 --> 02:15:42.514]  And the languages on the signs are Arabic, Chinese, all kinds of... And 80% of the women coming across get raped.
[02:15:42.514 --> 02:15:44.756]  Not by us, but on the other side.
[02:15:44.756 --> 02:15:48.219]  And it's a total hellhole with children being killed, but it's all our fault.
[02:15:48.219 --> 02:15:51.741]  When we come back, we'll talk about why this is so hot and exploding.
[02:15:51.741 --> 02:15:52.182]  Stay with us.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.301]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:55.301 --> 02:15:56.582]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:56.582 --> 02:16:00.324]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:00.324 --> 02:16:01.404]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:01.404 --> 02:16:03.246]  You're not a live-underground gopher.
[02:16:03.246 --> 02:16:04.947]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[02:16:04.947 --> 02:16:12.751]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[02:16:12.751 --> 02:16:13.752]  Bold statement?
[02:16:13.752 --> 02:16:14.752]  You bet.

[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:25.021]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:28.944]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:28.944 --> 02:16:30.485]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:30.485 --> 02:16:33.447]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:33.447 --> 02:16:39.011]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:39.011 --> 02:16:40.212]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:40.212 --> 02:16:43.154]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:43.154 --> 02:16:45.376]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:16:45.376 --> 02:16:49.819]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:16:49.819 --> 02:16:52.101]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:16:53.777 --> 02:16:55.738]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:55.738 --> 02:17:01.042]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:01.042 --> 02:17:02.643]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:02.643 --> 02:17:10.988]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:10.988 --> 02:17:16.672]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:17:16.852 --> 02:17:18.673]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:17:18.673 --> 02:17:20.953]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:17:20.953 --> 02:17:25.335]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:17:25.335 --> 02:17:27.535]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:17:27.535 --> 02:17:35.358]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:17:35.438 --> 02:17:39.603]  Order your two month supply today by calling 8 6 6 2 9 5 5 3 0 5.
[02:17:39.603 --> 02:17:43.488]  That's 8 6 6 2 9 5 5 3 0 5.

[02:17:55.675 --> 02:18:00.357]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival.
[02:18:00.357 --> 02:18:13.301]  And we're at war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence, that's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families, trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[02:18:13.301 --> 02:18:23.885]  Well, Infowars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[02:18:24.585 --> 02:18:31.367]  That's why we're running giant Cyber Week specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[02:18:31.367 --> 02:18:36.988]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[02:18:36.988 --> 02:18:40.509]  Don't do your shopping with the New World Order, Amazon.
[02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:42.149]  Do it with InfoWars Store.
[02:18:42.149 --> 02:18:48.111]  Get high-quality supplements, get high-quality air filtration, water filtration, Patriot apparel, and so much more.
[02:18:48.111 --> 02:18:52.432]  And every order gets a whole bunch of free InfoWars bumper stickers to spread the word.
[02:18:52.432 --> 02:18:53.312]  Take action, folks.
[02:18:54.952 --> 02:19:06.663]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[02:19:06.663 --> 02:19:15.471]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[02:19:16.132 --> 02:19:20.717]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[02:19:20.717 --> 02:19:26.643]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[02:19:26.643 --> 02:19:31.688]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[02:19:32.208 --> 02:19:42.133]  It is up to us, who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[02:19:42.133 --> 02:19:44.854]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[02:19:44.854 --> 02:19:47.435]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[02:19:47.435 --> 02:19:50.557]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[02:19:50.557 --> 02:19:57.821]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[02:19:57.821 --> 02:20:00.462]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.029 --> 02:20:25.051]  In Europe, they will arrest you.
[02:20:25.051 --> 02:20:27.453]  I see the news all the time.
[02:20:27.453 --> 02:20:32.036]  If you say that a man can't have a baby.
[02:20:32.036 --> 02:20:35.519]  They'll fire nurses in Canada and England.
[02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:47.776]  When a man comes in with tattoos and a big beard and spreads his legs in the chair, the gynecologist says, check my cervix.
[02:20:47.776 --> 02:20:51.759]  The nurse says, sir, you don't have a cervix.
[02:20:51.759 --> 02:20:56.723]  He says, you get me that manager, and they get fired.
[02:20:56.723 --> 02:20:57.944]  Got articles of that coming up.
[02:20:58.829 --> 02:20:59.970]  I'm going to go through all your calls.
[02:20:59.970 --> 02:21:02.791]  Owen Schroeder is going to pop in at the start of the next hour, but I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[02:21:02.791 --> 02:21:04.432]  We're going to your calls next segment.
[02:21:04.432 --> 02:21:07.133]  Nick and Ryan and Tyler and Joseph in Ireland.
[02:21:07.133 --> 02:21:08.094]  I didn't know I'd have a call from Ireland.
[02:21:08.094 --> 02:21:10.455]  I'm going to get to you quick.
[02:21:10.455 --> 02:21:11.696]  And I don't mean to run over our guest.
[02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:22.141]  He starts exciting me when I talk about this subject because it's such a no-brainer that the third world's exploding in population, doubling every 20 years.
[02:21:22.141 --> 02:21:24.763]  Islam is about to be 3 billion.
[02:21:24.763 --> 02:21:26.904]  It's 1.8 billion and change.
[02:21:28.407 --> 02:21:32.430]  And these are all centralized systems.
[02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:37.933]  I mean, China is the most racist country in the world against Japanese, against Koreans.
[02:21:37.933 --> 02:21:42.696]  I mean, if you study the history, there's about seven different ethnic groups of Chinese.
[02:21:42.696 --> 02:21:44.117]  They won't even really work with each other.
[02:21:44.117 --> 02:21:45.278]  I'm not putting Chinese people down.
[02:21:45.278 --> 02:21:48.760]  It's just a fact.
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:51.061]  They don't allow Islam there.
[02:21:51.061 --> 02:21:53.203]  But again, the left loves communist China.
[02:21:53.203 --> 02:21:56.545]  So this idea that we have any doors on our house
[02:21:58.012 --> 02:21:58.855]  Is bad!
[02:21:58.855 --> 02:21:59.717]  Is insane!
[02:21:59.717 --> 02:22:04.951]  So going back to Peter DeBrasco's running for Congress in North Carolina, Pete Forre.
[02:22:06.155 --> 02:22:07.536]  NC.com.
[02:22:07.536 --> 02:22:08.937]  In the time we have left, you've got the floor.
[02:22:08.937 --> 02:22:10.177]  I'll stop ranting.
[02:22:10.177 --> 02:22:18.882]  It's just what you're saying absolutely is popular, is the most read articles at Town Hall, is the most popular thing on Tucker Carlson.
[02:22:18.882 --> 02:22:19.563]  I'm always proud of him.
[02:22:19.563 --> 02:22:24.746]  Full Wars is an incubator we've had you on for months, obviously with the audience helping get you to that level.
[02:22:24.746 --> 02:22:25.466]  That's what it's all about.
[02:22:25.466 --> 02:22:29.909]  A team effort showing as a beta test what you're saying is common sense.
[02:22:30.569 --> 02:22:34.293]  Like, hey, have oxygen tanks when you go, you know, diving 100 feet underwater.
[02:22:34.293 --> 02:22:38.837]  Or, hey, when you go into the Arctic, have a coat and some shoes and maybe a compass.
[02:22:38.837 --> 02:22:40.699]  I mean, we need borders.
[02:22:40.699 --> 02:22:45.323]  There's a reason borders were developed, especially when you're surrounded by third world countries.
[02:22:45.323 --> 02:22:45.864]  Please continue.
[02:22:47.165 --> 02:22:48.646]  Yeah, absolutely Alex.
[02:22:48.646 --> 02:22:53.227]  And for the record, your show is 5-10 years ahead of the mainstream press.
[02:22:53.227 --> 02:22:54.308]  Always has been.
[02:22:54.308 --> 02:22:57.749]  Has been since I started watching in 2015.
[02:22:57.749 --> 02:23:01.410]  So you guys get all the credit for perpetuating the ideas that are popular.
[02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:02.791]  No, you the audience of supporters!
[02:23:03.755 --> 02:23:07.096]  And what I love is audiences, people like you taking action.
[02:23:07.096 --> 02:23:08.437]  I bet you get into Congress.
[02:23:08.437 --> 02:23:10.117]  But regardless, you're kicking ass.
[02:23:10.117 --> 02:23:14.658]  You're now on the national news with the leading story just by taking action.
[02:23:14.658 --> 02:23:16.559]  You are the resistance.
[02:23:16.559 --> 02:23:18.080]  You're the badass.
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:19.020]  You're the badass, Pete.
[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:23.984]  Well, look, I'm doing my best to fight for ordinary people, and I will continue to do so.
[02:23:23.984 --> 02:23:33.434]  Now, you're exactly right, Alice, when you say that this idea is a no-brainer, which is why our DC elites don't get it, because they have no brains.
[02:23:33.434 --> 02:23:35.255]  But the point I really want to make here is
[02:23:36.116 --> 02:23:38.959]  That this idea is not going away.
[02:23:38.959 --> 02:23:41.040]  America First is rising.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:53.170]  So when you see the political left and when you see this sort of bought and paid for conservatives trying to trample over us, trying to act like our ideas are not mainstream, that's because they're afraid of us.
[02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:58.054]  That's why Gorka is running around policing us, saying ban this person, ban that person.
[02:23:58.054 --> 02:23:59.896]  What an un-American sack of filth.
[02:24:00.851 --> 02:24:01.431]  That's right.
[02:24:01.431 --> 02:24:14.540]  And for some reason, these people seem to think that once President Trump is gone, whether they impeach him, whether he doesn't get re-elected in 2020 or after 2024, they seem to think that we're going back to the old globalist, you know, fake 2.0.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:18.062]  Yeah, no, you destroy Trump, it makes us even more strong!
[02:24:18.062 --> 02:24:20.943]  And I don't want that to happen, but they don't know history.
[02:24:20.943 --> 02:24:23.965]  Why do you think leftists think one-dimensionally?
[02:24:23.965 --> 02:24:24.746]  What's their problem?
[02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:27.711]  You know, I'm not exactly sure.
[02:24:27.711 --> 02:24:30.073]  They are good long-term strategists.
[02:24:30.073 --> 02:24:34.055]  If you look over the past 50 years, they've accomplished pretty much every goal that they set out to accomplish.
[02:24:34.055 --> 02:24:34.255]  I get it.
[02:24:34.255 --> 02:24:40.619]  So you're saying they don't make sense and look one-dimensional because they're actually long-term players and the people we see are just minions carrying out orders.
[02:24:40.619 --> 02:24:41.980]  That's why they look so stupid.
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:43.861]  But the brains behind it is actually very calculating.
[02:24:44.673 --> 02:24:45.253]  That's right.
[02:24:45.253 --> 02:24:50.817]  And the Republicans have the exact opposite sort of problems, right?
[02:24:50.817 --> 02:24:58.121]  But, you know, regardless of what happens to the president, the idea of America First has been seeded and it's not going away.
[02:24:58.121 --> 02:25:00.403]  So if the people in Washington, D.C.
[02:25:00.403 --> 02:25:06.907]  think that once Trump is gone that we're going to go back to this sort of globalist two-party system, they're wrong.
[02:25:07.587 --> 02:25:16.993]  People understand that America must finally be put first after years and years of corporate pillaging and plundering and putting our citizens
[02:25:18.932 --> 02:25:24.835]  Last, behind the interests of literally the entire rest of the world, it's just not going to happen anymore.
[02:25:24.835 --> 02:25:28.097]  There are people like me who are ordinary, average Americans.
[02:25:28.097 --> 02:25:29.097]  We are everywhere.
[02:25:29.097 --> 02:25:31.719]  We are walking among everybody.
[02:25:31.719 --> 02:25:38.782]  And we're not going to let the United States go by the wayside without a fight, regardless of what the people in D.C.
[02:25:38.782 --> 02:25:42.124]  want to do, regardless of how much they try and sell us out to foreign powers.
[02:25:42.124 --> 02:25:44.025]  It's simply not going to happen.
[02:25:44.025 --> 02:25:44.685]  That's right.
[02:25:44.685 --> 02:25:47.547]  Once you're awake, there's no turning that off again, is there?
[02:25:49.033 --> 02:25:49.953]  No, you can't do it.
[02:25:49.953 --> 02:25:55.575]  I mean, you know, five years ago, six years ago, I wasn't even involved in politics.
[02:25:55.575 --> 02:25:56.895]  What woke you up?
[02:25:56.895 --> 02:26:01.096]  Well, I decided I wanted to be informed going into the 2016 election.
[02:26:01.096 --> 02:26:08.338]  I mean, now you've got radio shows, now you've written books that are selling well, now you're running for Congress, now you're on Tucker Carlson, now you've got one of the... I mean, yeah, what triggered you?
[02:26:09.808 --> 02:26:14.111]  All that happened was I decided to turn on the news.
[02:26:14.111 --> 02:26:17.854]  I mean, in early 2015, I said, I'm going to be informed going into the 2016 election.
[02:26:17.854 --> 02:26:19.916]  I feel like it's my duty as a citizen.
[02:26:19.916 --> 02:26:22.998]  And I realized it was all nonsense from the beginning.
[02:26:22.998 --> 02:26:25.600]  So what do you do when you realize the mainstream press is all nonsense?
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:27.261]  Well, you start turning to the alternative press.
[02:26:27.261 --> 02:26:28.782]  So I started watching your show.
[02:26:28.782 --> 02:26:30.463]  I started reading news sites like Breitbart.
[02:26:31.784 --> 02:26:32.985]  And that's critical.
[02:26:32.985 --> 02:26:34.306]  You had an impetus.
[02:26:34.306 --> 02:26:38.548]  You had a hunger separate from Alex Jones triggering you.
[02:26:38.548 --> 02:26:40.350]  Everybody else is the same.
[02:26:40.350 --> 02:26:41.790]  People are seeking.
[02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:43.892]  And once you're seeking, there's no hiding anything.
[02:26:45.083 --> 02:26:45.683]  That's right.
[02:26:45.683 --> 02:26:50.525]  And you can't put the toothpaste back in tubes, our friend Roger Stone likes to say.
[02:26:50.525 --> 02:26:58.527]  So, you know, once you realize that the corporate press is totally phony, you start wondering, well, why am I being lied to on a daily basis consistently?
[02:26:58.527 --> 02:27:01.828]  What is it that they're trying to hide from me that I should actually know?
[02:27:01.828 --> 02:27:07.050]  And once you start seeking out the answers to those questions, you start, you know, becoming a voracious reader.
[02:27:07.050 --> 02:27:10.291]  And there's more answers and more answers and then it's not work to be informed.
[02:27:10.291 --> 02:27:11.771]  Once it's real info, it's exciting.
[02:27:12.748 --> 02:27:13.429]  That's right.
[02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.809]  Absolutely.
[02:27:13.809 --> 02:27:14.630]  And you want to keep going.
[02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:15.630]  And you want to keep learning.
[02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:19.794]  And you want to tell everybody else around you what it is that you've learned.
[02:27:19.794 --> 02:27:22.977]  And I've become, I know, a pain to my friends and family by doing that.
[02:27:22.977 --> 02:27:25.899]  But, again, you know, this is our duty as Americans.
[02:27:25.899 --> 02:27:27.300]  This is our duty to be informed.
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:28.982]  Well, that's like physical therapy.
[02:27:28.982 --> 02:27:34.046]  People that don't want to hear their family tell them what's really going on, that's because they're living in a shell because they're basically paralyzed.
[02:27:34.466 --> 02:27:42.649]  And if somebody's been paralyzed for a year and they finally get their spine fixed, and suddenly you're trying to get them to walk again, they're going to be yelling at you and telling you, hey, don't make me get out of this wheelchair.
[02:27:42.649 --> 02:27:44.650]  No, you're getting out of the wheelchair!
[02:27:44.650 --> 02:27:45.590]  Dammit!
[02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:54.694]  Well, look, I have great family and friends, personally, who, you know, listen and support and have been... Oh, no, I know, but you're just saying there's still some that you pay, yeah.
[02:27:55.663 --> 02:27:58.226]  But, you know, obviously it gets tiresome, right?
[02:27:58.226 --> 02:28:04.734]  I mean, we're engulfed in this in this sort of daily political battle and some people just don't want to do it.
[02:28:04.734 --> 02:28:10.841]  I understand that impulse, but also, you know, on the other side of the token, understand how important it is to do this.
[02:28:10.841 --> 02:28:11.842]  We must do this.
[02:28:11.842 --> 02:28:13.104]  We do not have a choice.
[02:28:13.924 --> 02:28:16.865]  Otherwise, our way of life will be ended forever.
[02:28:16.865 --> 02:28:17.906]  It is that dire of a situation.
[02:28:17.906 --> 02:28:18.286]  That's right.
[02:28:18.286 --> 02:28:19.266]  We're being conquered.
[02:28:19.266 --> 02:28:20.347]  We're being overwritten.
[02:28:20.347 --> 02:28:22.828]  This is a globalist takeover in their own admissions.
[02:28:22.828 --> 02:28:23.228]  U.N.
[02:28:23.228 --> 02:28:24.849]  replacement migration.
[02:28:24.849 --> 02:28:27.290]  The ADL says if you say that, that you're a liar.
[02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:28.090]  That's in the U.N.
[02:28:28.090 --> 02:28:28.550]  documents.
[02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:29.490]  It's public.
[02:28:29.490 --> 02:28:30.191]  Alright.
[02:28:30.191 --> 02:28:32.532]  Pete4NC.com.
[02:28:32.532 --> 02:28:33.832]  Peter, thank you so much.
[02:28:33.832 --> 02:28:34.973]  We look forward to speaking to you again.
[02:28:34.973 --> 02:28:36.633]  Please join us again.
[02:28:36.633 --> 02:28:37.514]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:28:37.514 --> 02:28:37.994]  I appreciate it.
[02:28:38.598 --> 02:28:39.939]  That guy gets me going.
[02:28:39.939 --> 02:28:42.181]  Everything he says is like, yeah, let's back that up.
[02:28:42.181 --> 02:28:43.622]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up now.
[02:28:43.622 --> 02:28:44.763]  I want to hear from the callers.
[02:28:44.763 --> 02:28:45.423]  We already took some.
[02:28:45.423 --> 02:28:46.364]  We're gonna take a lot right now.
[02:28:47.523 --> 02:28:53.766]  Get ready for Nick in New Jersey, Ryan in Florida, Tyler in California, Joseph in Ireland.
[02:28:53.766 --> 02:28:58.328]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:58.328 --> 02:29:00.409]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:00.409 --> 02:29:02.150]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:08.713]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:08.713 --> 02:29:13.775]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:13.775 --> 02:29:16.336]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem,
[02:29:16.596 --> 02:29:18.917]  And you know you can't do it alone.
[02:29:18.917 --> 02:29:22.038]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:22.038 --> 02:29:29.041]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:29.041 --> 02:29:34.222]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:34.222 --> 02:29:37.524]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:37.524 --> 02:29:38.484]  Get clean.
[02:29:38.484 --> 02:29:40.305]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:40.305 --> 02:29:40.345]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:45.107 --> 02:29:48.370]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:48.370 --> 02:29:55.036]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:29:55.036 --> 02:29:56.918]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[02:29:56.918 --> 02:29:58.720]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:02.263]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually.
[02:30:02.263 --> 02:30:04.305]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[02:30:04.305 --> 02:30:05.867]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[02:30:07.475 --> 02:30:10.657]  In a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[02:30:37.515 --> 02:30:37.976]  We're good to go.
[02:30:55.106 --> 02:30:58.328]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[02:30:58.328 --> 02:31:15.720]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:17.081]  We're being taken off the land.
[02:31:17.941 --> 02:31:28.570]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[02:31:28.570 --> 02:31:37.718]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[02:31:38.459 --> 02:31:41.822]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[02:31:41.822 --> 02:31:46.305]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[02:31:46.305 --> 02:31:48.166]  This is the post-human error.
[02:31:48.166 --> 02:31:50.928]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[02:31:50.928 --> 02:31:52.389]  This is the crossroads.
[02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:54.231]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[02:31:57.509 --> 02:31:59.310]  Real Red Pill.
[02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:01.470]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:14.134]  Please go to infowarshore.com and research the preglanone alone that is in each of these products and then research all the other things that are in Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus

[02:32:39.114 --> 02:32:41.736]  I'd say it funds the InfoWar before losing money on this.
[02:32:41.736 --> 02:32:47.822]  This is my gift to you this Christmas so you experience it for yourself like the other products.
[02:32:47.822 --> 02:32:49.784]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:49.784 --> 02:32:51.485]  That's InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:51.485 --> 02:32:57.811]  Please take action.
[02:32:57.811 --> 02:33:00.453]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.879 --> 02:33:25.883]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:25.883 --> 02:33:33.609]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.609 --> 02:33:42.076]  There's reporting going on right now from Fox News and others in New Jersey of men in black trench coats with long guns.
[02:33:42.076 --> 02:33:43.998]  Let's pray it's not a false flag.
[02:33:45.649 --> 02:33:51.452]  Let's pray that whoever's doing it gets taken out quickly, but they're talking about organizing a police response as we speak.
[02:33:51.452 --> 02:33:54.774]  This is happening live right now.
[02:33:54.774 --> 02:33:58.536]  Brand new information now on the active shooter situation in Jersey City, New Jersey.
[02:33:58.536 --> 02:34:00.237]  Let's go back to Brian Yennis.
[02:34:00.237 --> 02:34:01.098]  He is on the scene.
[02:34:01.098 --> 02:34:01.378]  Brian?
[02:34:03.703 --> 02:34:17.290]  Dana, we've just been told by a federal law enforcement source that that school, the Sacred Heart School, across from this kosher supermarket where this happened, we're calling it a bodega, it's a small kosher supermarket, has been cleared.
[02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:19.732]  That school, Sacred Heart, has been cleared.
[02:34:19.732 --> 02:34:23.874]  No children are in danger, but they are now looking for a third suspect.
[02:34:23.874 --> 02:34:31.078]  There was a male and a female suspect that had been taken down by police, dressed in all black, and now they're looking for a black
[02:34:32.859 --> 02:34:35.422]  A black male dressed in all black.
[02:34:35.422 --> 02:34:37.364]  That is a third suspect they are now looking for.
[02:34:37.364 --> 02:34:48.495]  It's still very, obviously the scene is still very much active, but the good news here is that that school has been cleared and from what we understand, the children are safe.
[02:34:48.495 --> 02:34:48.915]  Dana?
[02:34:48.915 --> 02:34:51.238]  Alright, Brian, and again, police officer has been shot in the head.
[02:34:52.399 --> 02:35:02.167]  Let's cut away from that live feed.
[02:35:02.167 --> 02:35:06.090]  We are getting the latest for you right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:18.340]  We have a police officer who has been shot in the head, and we don't know exactly what's going on right now, but we're going to get you the latest up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.482]  I'm sure DrugsReport.com is always really good about
[02:35:21.215 --> 02:35:23.716]  Having what's happening as it breaks.
[02:35:23.716 --> 02:35:24.916]  This does not look good.
[02:35:24.916 --> 02:35:28.597]  A bunch of police and SWAT gear running around and police officers shot in the head and.
[02:35:28.597 --> 02:35:33.858]  They were saying it's.
[02:35:33.858 --> 02:35:37.740]  Again, the church and then something to do with.
[02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:41.321]  Other businesses, so we're going to continue to follow that.
[02:35:41.321 --> 02:35:42.541]  As it unfolds.
[02:35:43.922 --> 02:35:46.444]  And obviously hoping that nobody else has been hurt.
[02:35:46.444 --> 02:35:51.788]  And it could be drug-related, or it could be a staged event, or it could be an actual real event.
[02:35:51.788 --> 02:36:03.518]  It's totally normal to question any event and try to get the latest on what happens because there have been so many events that have been staged, like babies in incubators having their brains bashed out and thrown on the ground to start the first Iraq War.
[02:36:04.298 --> 02:36:08.960]  Or the fake WMDs to have the second one, or the Gulf of Tonkin to start the Vietnam War officially in 1964.
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.441]  Or Operation Northwoods, the plan to do mass shootings inside the U.S.
[02:36:12.441 --> 02:36:14.942]  to blame it on the Soviet Union to start a war.
[02:36:14.942 --> 02:36:22.745]  Or Jesse Smollett staging events, or all the other hundreds and hundreds of events, but mostly shootings are real and do indeed happen.
[02:36:22.745 --> 02:36:28.007]  But in the case of Texas and Ohio, it was a false
[02:36:29.605 --> 02:36:33.726]  Media report that they were Trump supporters, they were actually Democrat supporters.
[02:36:33.726 --> 02:36:44.310]  So this footage is, I guess, a group of police have gotten together to try to stop what's happening.
[02:36:44.310 --> 02:36:53.993]  This is Jersey City footage right here of supposedly the police looking for who's doing this.
[02:36:53.993 --> 02:36:57.454]  Again, I may just go to rebroadcast while I get some articles and figure out exactly what's going on real quick.
[02:36:58.578 --> 02:36:59.939]  How much is unfolding and happening here?
[02:36:59.939 --> 02:37:04.383]  I've got to find out.
[02:37:04.383 --> 02:37:05.344]  Nick in New Jersey.
[02:37:05.344 --> 02:37:10.648]  Go ahead and finish up your point.
[02:37:10.648 --> 02:37:12.710]  Well, just real quick.
[02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:25.261]  My prayers go out for that police officer, but I'm not surprised stuff like this happens in New Jersey with our governor and our attorney general doing, you know, sheriff's departments who aren't in compliance with or who want to comply with federal law.
[02:37:25.977 --> 02:37:27.778]  I mean, with ICE.
[02:37:27.778 --> 02:37:41.325]  So, you know, New Jersey's got its own problems, but as far as what I wanted to say earlier was with the impeachment, with Turley giving his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee.
[02:37:41.325 --> 02:37:55.312]  He's a commentator for CNN and MSNBC, and after his testimony, it's not surprising that he's not on there to explain why he sees what the Democrats are doing as actually hurting our republic, hurting or going against our Constitution.
[02:37:56.148 --> 02:38:02.104]  And I mean it just goes to show that the level of brainwashing that network television shows
[02:38:03.158 --> 02:38:12.024]  Uh, due to the American people, because there's people who hear this stuff, they don't look into things themselves, they don't read for themselves, they just take what they hear, uh, verbatim.
[02:38:12.024 --> 02:38:23.152]  And that's the scary thing is you've got informed people that ask questions that are involved, and the system's trying to make that illegal, and you've got those that literally believe I'm a Russian agent, and believe that Devin Nunes is a Russian agent.
[02:38:23.152 --> 02:38:29.516]  He has people come and get in his face in New York with a grandfather with little kids and say, we're gonna get you, you're a Russian agent.
[02:38:29.516 --> 02:38:31.097]  Uh, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:31.097 --> 02:38:32.278]  By the way, here's the latest we've got.
[02:38:33.178 --> 02:38:36.679]  Multiple agencies respond to active shooting situation in New Jersey.
[02:38:36.679 --> 02:38:38.960]  Heavy gunfire reported.
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.082]  That's from CNN, KTLA, Channel 5 News.
[02:38:44.082 --> 02:38:46.342]  Law enforcement responds to shooting in New Jersey.
[02:38:46.342 --> 02:38:47.543]  At least one officer shot.
[02:38:48.587 --> 02:38:49.969]  It could just be drug-related.
[02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:52.292]  Regardless, it's still terrible.
[02:38:52.292 --> 02:38:54.595]  An active shooting situation is underway in New Jersey.
[02:38:54.595 --> 02:39:00.622]  New Jersey Sheriff's Office says a police officer shot and hit an active shooting situation in New Jersey.
[02:39:00.622 --> 02:39:03.786]  Nothing else is really known at this time.
[02:39:03.786 --> 02:39:07.331]  We will track that as it unfolds, but this is certainly an important story.
[02:39:09.343 --> 02:39:13.006]  But you know, millions of people are dying from opium-related deaths a year.
[02:39:13.006 --> 02:39:14.547]  Hundreds of thousands from fentanyl alone.
[02:39:14.547 --> 02:39:15.948]  It's getting worse.
[02:39:15.948 --> 02:39:20.151]  Everyone I know has family that's died from fentanyl alone.
[02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:21.432]  The China shipping it.
[02:39:21.432 --> 02:39:25.896]  Somebody dies from fentanyl, doesn't even make the news.
[02:39:25.896 --> 02:39:30.720]  And you know, your teenage child thinks they're getting a vape pen that's got an off-market cartridge in it.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:36.224]  Some of those have got fentanyl in them, and people are taking one puff and dropping dead.
[02:39:37.563 --> 02:39:44.926]  You don't see a big buildup for that, because that's just chemical warfare.
[02:39:44.926 --> 02:39:47.127]  But when one person gets shot, I'm glad there's a big response.
[02:39:47.127 --> 02:39:48.087]  There's a big response.
[02:39:48.087 --> 02:39:55.210]  We need a big response to the scourge of GMO, or the millions of kids that have gotten brain damage, the thousands that have died from vaccines.
[02:39:55.210 --> 02:39:57.431]  They admit, but you're not supposed to talk about.
[02:39:57.431 --> 02:40:00.972]  All right, let's go to Ireland, and then we'll go to Tyler and Ryan.
[02:40:00.972 --> 02:40:02.513]  Joseph in Ireland, thanks for calling.
[02:40:02.513 --> 02:40:03.633]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:03.633 --> 02:40:03.953]  Welcome.
[02:40:03.953 --> 02:40:05.954]  Give us your take on the historic events taking place.
[02:40:06.866 --> 02:40:08.608]  Alex, how are you?
[02:40:08.608 --> 02:40:11.212]  I'll try and make my point as quick as I can.
[02:40:11.212 --> 02:40:14.996]  To me, you have to prioritise the problems.
[02:40:14.996 --> 02:40:17.840]  The one you've been banging on about is the tech censorship.
[02:40:18.410 --> 02:40:35.484]  But to me it has to be, number one, Trump has to come out and say, I will not accept the results when any machine is owned, controlled or run by a foreign company or any company is connected to a Democrat donor, Democrat party person.
[02:40:35.484 --> 02:40:40.368]  He must come out and say it and he's got to say, I will not accept the results.
[02:40:40.368 --> 02:40:44.491]  And turn it back on the Democrats and say this is foreign election meddling.
[02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:46.773]  I think this is priority one because I watched
[02:40:47.705 --> 02:40:53.627]  Billy Weaver's report on the election fraud in the United States.
[02:40:53.627 --> 02:40:54.667]  To me, it's number one.
[02:40:54.667 --> 02:40:56.948]  Number two is what the last guy was talking about.
[02:40:56.948 --> 02:40:59.849]  And number three is the tech censorship.
[02:40:59.849 --> 02:41:03.530]  Number two and three are quite... By the way, let me stop you.
[02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:05.211]  I'm one trillion percent agree with you.
[02:41:05.211 --> 02:41:12.153]  I was thinking that last night that I've got to talk about Trump needs to challenge any election that has foreign-owned or mysterious machines.
[02:41:12.153 --> 02:41:15.034]  The Democrats, Nadler said, Trump's getting ready.
[02:41:15.774 --> 02:41:17.175]  to steal the election again.
[02:41:17.175 --> 02:41:18.676]  Well, he didn't steal the first one.
[02:41:18.676 --> 02:41:22.138]  So they're going to challenge it when they're the ones of the fraudsters.
[02:41:22.138 --> 02:41:23.179]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:41:23.179 --> 02:41:25.680]  Trump has got to get out ahead of this.
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:31.244]  And you've seen the last three special elections, though the Republicans were supposed to win, the Democrats have won.
[02:41:31.244 --> 02:41:36.367]  And then you find the fixes in Virginia, in Kentucky, in Louisiana.
[02:41:36.367 --> 02:41:37.488]  You're absolutely right.
[02:41:37.488 --> 02:41:38.028]  Please continue.
[02:41:38.885 --> 02:41:41.167]  There is no way Trump will win.
[02:41:41.167 --> 02:41:46.231]  It doesn't matter if 90% of the people vote for him, if you control the machines.
[02:41:46.231 --> 02:41:51.475]  And the machines, you can't get the information, as many showed, that it's foreign control.
[02:41:51.475 --> 02:41:54.237]  This is foreign election meddling.
[02:41:54.237 --> 02:41:55.918]  He has got to come out.
[02:41:55.918 --> 02:41:58.320]  And be damned what the media say.
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:41:59.861]  Oh, he's a tyrant or whatever.
[02:41:59.861 --> 02:42:04.645]  No, turn it back on them and say, no, this is foreign election meddling and show the proof.
[02:42:04.645 --> 02:42:06.146]  Millie has it.
[02:42:06.146 --> 02:42:07.427]  This has to be number one.
[02:42:08.763 --> 02:42:09.764]  Everything else falls.
[02:42:09.764 --> 02:42:12.066]  It doesn't matter if you sort out the immigration thing.
[02:42:12.066 --> 02:42:16.749]  It doesn't matter if you stop the text meddling, which is total racketeering.
[02:42:16.749 --> 02:42:17.149]  You're right.
[02:42:17.149 --> 02:42:19.371]  It's fraud from top to bottom.
[02:42:19.371 --> 02:42:20.932]  I mean, that's my point.
[02:42:20.932 --> 02:42:23.714]  Can I make one other point?
[02:42:23.714 --> 02:42:28.358]  The other point I want to make is this is a spiritual battle.
[02:42:28.358 --> 02:42:30.739]  You're dealing with pure evil people.
[02:42:30.739 --> 02:42:32.721]  God is going to enter the ring here, Alex.
[02:42:34.065 --> 02:42:34.986]  Don't hang up, Joseph.
[02:42:34.986 --> 02:42:35.966]  You've been holding from Ireland.
[02:42:35.966 --> 02:42:38.828]  Plus, I love your voice and everything you're saying is so true.
[02:42:38.828 --> 02:42:40.269]  Stay there and finish up.
[02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.649]  You're right.
[02:42:40.649 --> 02:42:42.110]  God's about to enter the ring.
[02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:44.491]  And that's the thing people go, are you scared of the globalists?
[02:42:44.491 --> 02:42:49.294]  Folks, I can feel fear and it's not the globalists I'm scared of.
[02:42:49.294 --> 02:42:50.414]  I mean, it's just like shit.
[02:42:50.414 --> 02:42:51.595]  Like that chill you get?
[02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:52.315]  That's God.
[02:42:52.315 --> 02:42:52.676]  It's like, whoa.
[02:42:53.886 --> 02:42:57.347]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[02:42:57.347 --> 02:42:59.308]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[02:42:59.308 --> 02:43:05.629]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better, and that's taking care of our individual health.
[02:43:05.629 --> 02:43:21.414]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health,
[02:43:22.014 --> 02:43:27.700]  Your stamina, your libido, but then of course it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical.
[02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:32.986]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[02:43:32.986 --> 02:43:40.895]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[02:43:41.415 --> 02:43:49.159]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:49.159 --> 02:43:51.000]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.642]  Please make the right decision.
[02:43:53.642 --> 02:44:01.606]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.
[02:44:01.606 --> 02:44:05.788]  Don't shop with Amazon and other big tech companies that hate your guts.

[02:44:33.023 --> 02:44:37.345]  The Christmas Mega Pack is at cost at $99.95.
[02:44:37.345 --> 02:44:38.666]  Get two bottles of knockout.
[02:44:38.766 --> 02:44:47.830]  Two bottles of Brain Force Plus, one box of Turbo Force, one bottle of Ultimate Krill Oil, and one bottle of Survival Shield X3 at cost.
[02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:53.133]  Again, find this amazing special and over a hundred others at InfoWareStore.com and support the InfoWare.
[02:44:54.713 --> 02:44:57.115]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[02:44:57.115 --> 02:45:01.619]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[02:45:01.619 --> 02:45:06.503]  As you age, preglanone levels in the body go down.
[02:45:06.503 --> 02:45:17.553]  Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglanone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[02:45:17.553 --> 02:45:19.175]  And then it just gets wilder from there.
[02:45:19.895 --> 02:45:25.377]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about Preglanone.
[02:45:25.377 --> 02:45:32.279]  We've got the best form of Preglanone with a bunch of high-quality vitamins and minerals in Real Red Pill.
[02:45:32.279 --> 02:45:35.280]  Real Red Pill Plus has some added energy as well.
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:40.961]  Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of BioTrue Selenium that's from the mustard seed.
[02:45:40.961 --> 02:45:43.162]  The two go together in an incredible way.
[02:45:43.542 --> 02:45:46.264]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[02:45:46.264 --> 02:45:50.126]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us.
[02:46:04.514 --> 02:46:15.647]  Poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[02:46:15.647 --> 02:46:17.869]  We're being taken off the land.
[02:46:17.869 --> 02:46:23.355]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery.
[02:46:24.096 --> 02:46:40.955]  Until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human, then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God, believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[02:46:41.716 --> 02:46:46.217]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[02:46:46.217 --> 02:46:48.077]  This is the post-human error.
[02:46:48.077 --> 02:46:50.838]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[02:46:50.838 --> 02:46:52.278]  This is the crossroads.
[02:46:52.278 --> 02:46:57.240]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.706 --> 02:47:11.167]  I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:47:11.167 --> 02:47:15.910]  Owen Schroyer has been a busy bee.
[02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:19.012]  I'm not gonna get to it till he's confronted someone.
[02:47:19.012 --> 02:47:21.854]  And he's riding around the armored vehicle in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[02:47:21.854 --> 02:47:23.935]  He ran into Jordan Klepper.
[02:47:23.935 --> 02:47:29.399]  A little disinfo-operative.
[02:47:29.399 --> 02:47:33.581]  But right now, Joseph and Arnold, you're getting into pure evil and God's getting ready to step in.
[02:47:33.581 --> 02:47:34.202]  Please continue.
[02:47:35.259 --> 02:47:37.602]  Yes, Alex, I'll be straight honest with you.
[02:47:37.602 --> 02:47:41.245]  I'm coming from a Catholic background, but I have no problem with somebody's Protestant.
[02:47:41.245 --> 02:47:45.329]  I don't... We're all on the same side as far as I'm concerned, okay?
[02:47:45.329 --> 02:47:47.992]  But yes, people interpret the Bible differently.
[02:47:47.992 --> 02:47:52.717]  But I believe... But there's people that love God and are with God, and there's people that are with the devil.
[02:47:52.717 --> 02:47:53.878]  That's just a fact.
[02:47:53.878 --> 02:47:55.440]  I totally agree with you, sir, so please continue.
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:59.866]  Yeah, and I mean, I don't, my battle is not with anybody like that.
[02:47:59.866 --> 02:48:00.788]  Those days are gone.
[02:48:00.788 --> 02:48:08.179]  It is a shame that Christians killed one another in a different, you know, over words in the Bible, but unfortunately that has happened in the past.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.323]  But our fight is not with one another, even though we interpret the Bible differently.
[02:48:12.323 --> 02:48:15.726]  But I believe, as a Catholic, God is about to step into the ring.
[02:48:15.726 --> 02:48:17.127]  It is what we call it as Catholics.
[02:48:17.127 --> 02:48:19.108]  There's very few Catholics who are aware of this.
[02:48:19.108 --> 02:48:22.291]  It's the prophecy of Garbandel, and it's called the illumination of the soul.
[02:48:22.291 --> 02:48:26.114]  And God will divide the good from the evil there, then.
[02:48:26.114 --> 02:48:30.217]  After that, no one will be able to deny that God exists.
[02:48:30.217 --> 02:48:34.321]  And this is about to happen, because things have gone so bad with the pedophilia.
[02:48:34.321 --> 02:48:38.344]  This is the thing that offends God the most, is when you interfere with children.
[02:48:39.111 --> 02:48:41.472]  And this will be brought to a stop.
[02:48:41.472 --> 02:48:42.613]  Has to be brought to a stop.
[02:48:42.613 --> 02:48:46.055]  It's pure evil and they are poisoning the next generation.
[02:48:46.055 --> 02:48:47.475]  They're teaching it now in the schools.
[02:48:47.475 --> 02:48:54.639]  I see, you know, they're pushing the stuff with child protection and then it goes on to next levels.
[02:48:54.639 --> 02:49:03.083]  And they're now about to bring in a law in the Republic of Ireland where they want to teach young kids about abortion, teaching them all the stories, the same sex and all this.
[02:49:03.083 --> 02:49:03.784]  And this is coming.
[02:49:05.268 --> 02:49:06.789]  Sorry Alex, I don't mean to take up all your time.
[02:49:06.789 --> 02:49:08.010]  You're right, it's not coming.
[02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:11.851]  I'm looking at it in England and in Ireland in test areas right now.
[02:49:11.851 --> 02:49:13.572]  Yes, the laws.
[02:49:13.572 --> 02:49:26.918]  I don't mean to take up all your time, but there's one point here as well, because you see you're obviously very concentrated on American politics, but I can see it here very clearly because I've learned from you to observe and interpret what's going on.
[02:49:26.918 --> 02:49:33.821]  What they're doing here is they're using the old divide in the north of Ireland, which is Protestant, Catholic, Nationalist, Unionist.
[02:49:34.682 --> 02:49:41.808]  And they're running programs now on the television where they're showing up all the old stuff.
[02:49:41.808 --> 02:49:43.449]  Oh yeah, they're trying to open old wounds.
[02:49:43.449 --> 02:49:44.570]  That's the same thing here.
[02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:45.310]  Yes.
[02:49:45.310 --> 02:49:46.752]  And they will do this.
[02:49:46.752 --> 02:49:48.293]  They will tear the UK apart.
[02:49:48.866 --> 02:49:50.528]  Rather than let it leave the EU.
[02:49:50.528 --> 02:49:57.313]  And they've used this issue, and they're now savaging the one party in the North, which is Unionists, the DUP.
[02:49:57.313 --> 02:50:02.838]  They're getting it in the media, left, right and centre now, because they're pro-Brexit.
[02:50:02.838 --> 02:50:09.204]  And they're heaping... No, you're absolutely right, and people all over Europe and all over the UK and in Ireland need to be smart enough to get that.
[02:50:09.784 --> 02:50:11.045]  And I think they are getting it.
[02:50:11.045 --> 02:50:15.147]  I mean, I think the internal poll numbers are showing people are getting stronger for Brexit.
[02:50:15.147 --> 02:50:18.429]  You're right, they're going to try to ignite crises, but I think people are going to see through it.
[02:50:18.429 --> 02:50:19.289]  Thank you, Joseph.
[02:50:19.289 --> 02:50:20.250]  Do you think they'll see through it?
[02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:20.790]  I do, Alex.
[02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:21.630]  Thank you.
[02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:22.091]  You do?
[02:50:22.091 --> 02:50:22.511]  God bless.
[02:50:22.511 --> 02:50:24.452]  All right, we should talk to that guy for five hours.
[02:50:24.452 --> 02:50:25.172]  We've got to get to everybody.
[02:50:25.172 --> 02:50:26.353]  These are all awesome callers.
[02:50:26.353 --> 02:50:29.214]  All right, who's been holding longest the next now?
[02:50:29.214 --> 02:50:34.037]  That'd be Ryan and Tyler.
[02:50:34.037 --> 02:50:35.157]  Tyler's holding longer than Ryan.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:38.381]  Is next, but Tyler's now.
[02:50:38.381 --> 02:50:39.762]  Tyler in California, thanks for holding.
[02:50:39.762 --> 02:50:41.263]  Go ahead.
[02:50:41.263 --> 02:50:42.204]  How's it going, man?
[02:50:42.204 --> 02:50:43.325]  Good, brother.
[02:50:43.325 --> 02:50:44.145]  Alright, brother.
[02:50:44.145 --> 02:50:48.028]  Hey, something quick just happened right before you picked up the phone here.
[02:50:48.028 --> 02:50:49.129]  I'm sitting here in California.
[02:50:49.129 --> 02:50:55.694]  I'm looking out through my deck and this red-tailed hawk comes down and swoops up, snatches up a gopher right in front of me.
[02:50:55.694 --> 02:50:57.255]  Isn't that awesome?
[02:50:57.255 --> 02:51:00.738]  Yeah, the only thing I could think of was Nadler's face on that little gopher.
[02:51:02.526 --> 02:51:04.547]  Red Tail Hawks are amazing.
[02:51:04.547 --> 02:51:11.471]  We've got one lands in my backyard and it lands on the edge of the pool and it knows us so I can go outside of it.
[02:51:11.471 --> 02:51:12.611]  I don't walk towards it.
[02:51:12.611 --> 02:51:14.632]  It just sits there like 15 feet away.
[02:51:14.632 --> 02:51:16.233]  Yeah, man.
[02:51:16.233 --> 02:51:16.873]  Awesome.
[02:51:16.873 --> 02:51:17.834]  That wasn't symbolic.
[02:51:17.834 --> 02:51:19.214]  I don't know what it is.
[02:51:19.214 --> 02:51:20.915]  But hey, let me say something.
[02:51:20.915 --> 02:51:29.560]  You know, the greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was making him think that he didn't exist and right now he's showing his face through the Democratic Party and
[02:51:30.546 --> 02:51:31.446]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:51:50.678 --> 02:51:58.661]  And then, you know, I saw your supplements, and then I started hearing your word, and, you know, I'm a faithful father, man, and I gotta thank you for that.
[02:51:58.661 --> 02:51:59.341]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:51:59.341 --> 02:52:01.542]  How did you hear about the supplements before the show?
[02:52:01.542 --> 02:52:06.424]  Because I hear that a lot.
[02:52:06.424 --> 02:52:07.785]  How did you hear about the supplements first?
[02:52:07.785 --> 02:52:08.265]  That's interesting.
[02:52:08.265 --> 02:52:11.586]  Did a friend tell you about it, or what happened?
[02:52:11.586 --> 02:52:18.469]  A radio channel down in Santa Cruz that doesn't even play your show anymore after the election and stuff, if you could believe that.
[02:52:20.168 --> 02:52:20.648]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:52:20.648 --> 02:52:21.329]  That's how you heard about it.
[02:52:21.329 --> 02:52:22.109]  It was the supplement.
[02:52:22.109 --> 02:52:24.551]  You didn't really know about the show, so you tried it.
[02:52:24.551 --> 02:52:26.192]  And then that was KSCO.
[02:52:26.192 --> 02:52:29.534]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:52:29.534 --> 02:52:33.756]  Again and again, you prove that it's tomorrow's news today.
[02:52:33.756 --> 02:52:35.737]  You know, and the truth comes out.
[02:52:35.737 --> 02:52:37.959]  I mean, you know, you're a genuine, hard person, man.
[02:52:37.959 --> 02:52:38.859]  You're only human.
[02:52:38.859 --> 02:52:42.221]  And it breaks my heart when I hear people call and critique you.
[02:52:42.221 --> 02:52:42.441]  You know?
[02:52:42.441 --> 02:52:43.122]  Well, that's okay.
[02:52:43.122 --> 02:52:43.602]  I'm a big boy.
[02:52:43.602 --> 02:52:44.102]  I can take it.
[02:52:44.102 --> 02:52:44.743]  And God bless you.
[02:52:44.743 --> 02:52:47.124]  Thank you, Tyler.
[02:52:47.124 --> 02:52:47.665]  Yeah, it's...
[02:52:50.655 --> 02:53:07.361]  I just want to stay in the fight and I can beat them politically and I can beat them with your help standing with us through a lot of this, but the treachery I've seen, I mean just the treachery you see in the news is nothing compared to the treachery behind the scenes.
[02:53:07.361 --> 02:53:15.244]  I was asleep last night and at about 11 o'clock at night my oldest daughter came in and she woke me up and she said,
[02:53:18.519 --> 02:53:28.482]  Is it true that you shoot guns at the employees and that you killed an employee's fish?
[02:53:28.482 --> 02:53:31.963]  And I said, honey, have you ever seen me be unsafe with guns?
[02:53:31.963 --> 02:53:33.284]  She said, no, you're all in the safety.
[02:53:33.284 --> 02:53:35.644]  And I said, you ever seen me be mean to fish?
[02:53:35.644 --> 02:53:37.045]  She goes, no, you got mad at me when
[02:53:37.970 --> 02:53:40.595]  I didn't feed my little fishbowl enough and one of them died.
[02:53:40.595 --> 02:53:44.623]  I'm like, yeah, so she goes, wow, so they lie that bad?
[02:53:44.623 --> 02:53:49.874]  And I said, honey, they tell fantastic lies because people can't believe you'd make something up like that.
[02:53:50.831 --> 02:53:51.752]  She said, I know.
[02:53:51.752 --> 02:54:00.480]  I was just up and, you know, my friends on my computer were sending me messages about their moms, bringing it up to them and, you know, asking questions.
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:02.242]  Are you really that bad of a person?
[02:54:02.242 --> 02:54:13.612]  Because people don't pick up the New York Times and think you're shooting guns at your employees and you come up to their desk and kill their fish.
[02:54:13.612 --> 02:54:14.573]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:54:15.766 --> 02:54:21.208]  It's got to be over the top because if I read that about somebody in the New York Times, I think that's got to be true.
[02:54:21.208 --> 02:54:25.550]  I mean, you don't make that up, but of course they do.
[02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:27.230]  It's like they had that woman testify against Trump.
[02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:32.892]  She goes, he's assaulted more women than 99% of immigrants.
[02:54:32.892 --> 02:54:33.133]  Really?
[02:54:33.133 --> 02:54:33.533]  Where are they?
[02:54:33.533 --> 02:54:34.213]  Where's the indictments?
[02:54:34.213 --> 02:54:34.813]  Where's the admissions?
[02:54:34.813 --> 02:54:35.713]  Where's the woman claiming it?
[02:54:35.713 --> 02:54:36.554]  It doesn't exist.
[02:54:36.554 --> 02:54:38.815]  It's made up.
[02:54:38.815 --> 02:54:39.575]  And then I've learned
[02:54:42.056 --> 02:55:01.124]  We got a call on one of these fact-checkers from another publication, because there's a type of things they like to get, I don't know, like a year ago or so, and they said, we hear you shoot apples off of people's heads.
[02:55:01.124 --> 02:55:03.425]  No one's ever shot an apple off anybody's head.
[02:55:03.425 --> 02:55:04.565]  No one's aimed guns at anybody.
[02:55:04.565 --> 02:55:05.966]  There's not guns out around here.
[02:55:09.497 --> 02:55:13.280]  The story of the apple is William Tell and how Switzerland started.
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:16.683]  It's a true story, too.
[02:55:16.683 --> 02:55:28.374]  It's had, you know, things added to it that are legend, but that's why it said the fish was for a niece and Jones found out and went and took it and killed it.
[02:55:28.374 --> 02:55:29.855]  That's finding Nemo.
[02:55:29.855 --> 02:55:31.456]  It starts when they go get the fish.
[02:55:31.456 --> 02:55:34.079]  So they tell each other as a joke.
[02:55:34.079 --> 02:55:36.221]  In these publications, I've learned
[02:55:37.312 --> 02:55:42.414]  They'll make jokes and plagiarize something out of something famous just to make it a bigger joke on the public.
[02:55:42.414 --> 02:55:43.714]  And that's what it's like.
[02:55:43.714 --> 02:55:50.276]  I mean, the New York Times has articles about how to engage in propaganda and how to lie to the American people.
[02:55:50.276 --> 02:55:51.737]  Written by, what was that guy's name?
[02:55:51.737 --> 02:55:52.637]  Weasel.
[02:55:52.637 --> 02:55:53.137]  Weasel.
[02:55:53.137 --> 02:55:54.418]  It's actually named Weasel.
[02:55:54.418 --> 02:55:56.138]  Last name's Weasel.
[02:55:56.138 --> 02:56:00.160]  And imagine if your last name's Weasel.
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:04.001]  Or maybe he picked the name Weasel.
[02:56:04.001 --> 02:56:04.381]  Weasel.
[02:56:06.866 --> 02:56:10.129]  So, that's who these people are.
[02:56:10.129 --> 02:56:11.910]  And that's another guy that did that.
[02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:13.431]  And you sit there and you look at this.
[02:56:13.431 --> 02:56:14.852]  I mean, they said about Owen.
[02:56:14.852 --> 02:56:18.535]  Then I'll go to your calls.
[02:56:18.535 --> 02:56:23.119]  That he said at the impeachment hearing, we're going to hang Obama.
[02:56:23.119 --> 02:56:23.860]  He didn't say that.
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:25.281]  He didn't say the name Obama.
[02:56:25.281 --> 02:56:28.603]  They don't care.
[02:56:28.603 --> 02:56:33.027]  Because their own readers want to be deceived and just want to read that crap.
[02:56:33.027 --> 02:56:35.489]  So you can imagine the type of articles they write.
[02:56:38.166 --> 02:56:48.990]  You know, Jones killing animals and garages full of their blood and just all this ridiculous crap.
[02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:53.592]  But to them, it seems so alien to actually go out and go hunting.
[02:56:53.592 --> 02:56:55.733]  But then they project that back to their own audience.
[02:56:55.733 --> 02:56:58.273]  And again, I don't care about being attacked myself.
[02:56:58.273 --> 02:57:01.895]  It's like articles about the devil in the wool suit.
[02:57:03.226 --> 02:57:11.772]  Vanity Fair, a senior writer, a story about Owen saying we're going to kill Obama?
[02:57:11.772 --> 02:57:15.475]  And saying he said it in the impeachment hearing?
[02:57:15.475 --> 02:57:20.198]  What he really said was, years ago, for treason, I'm not saying we should hang Obama.
[02:57:20.198 --> 02:57:25.863]  And then the idea that if you hang traitors and one of them happens to be black, you mean that because it's a lynching?
[02:57:25.863 --> 02:57:28.985]  Again, it's all just insane.
[02:57:28.985 --> 02:57:30.066]  I'm going to all these calls.
[02:57:31.294 --> 02:57:32.314]  So Ryan, stay there.
[02:57:32.314 --> 02:57:34.915]  We're going right to you and everybody else.
[02:57:34.915 --> 02:57:35.955]  I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[02:57:35.955 --> 02:57:38.416]  Owen Schroer's coming up.
[02:57:38.416 --> 02:57:39.617]  Whatever you do, spread the word.
[02:57:39.617 --> 02:57:44.818]  That's how we reach new people and the globalists hate it when you do.
[02:57:44.818 --> 02:57:46.799]  Twilight is here.
[02:57:46.799 --> 02:57:49.139]  The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020.
[02:57:49.139 --> 02:57:51.520]  Only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[02:57:58.675 --> 02:58:02.819]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection.
[02:58:02.819 --> 02:58:04.520]  He's completely surrounded.
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:17.211]  And to pray for him to have discernment and to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[02:58:17.211 --> 02:58:22.996]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office.
[02:58:23.817 --> 02:58:29.243]  And that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down.
[02:58:29.243 --> 02:58:34.209]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him, that the globalists could win.
[02:58:34.209 --> 02:58:39.034]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for worse.
[02:58:39.034 --> 02:58:41.837]  And please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalists.
[02:58:41.837 --> 02:58:42.879]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[02:58:45.837 --> 02:58:50.520]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival.
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:59:03.209]  And we're at war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence, that's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families, trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[02:59:03.209 --> 02:59:14.056]  Well, Infowars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[02:59:14.736 --> 02:59:21.518]  That's why we're running giant Cyber Week specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[02:59:21.518 --> 02:59:27.140]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[02:59:27.140 --> 02:59:30.662]  Don't do your shopping with the New World Order, Amazon.
[02:59:30.662 --> 02:59:32.322]  Do it with InfoWars Store.
[02:59:32.322 --> 02:59:33.963]  Get high-quality supplements.
[02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:38.264]  Get high-quality air filtration, water filtration, Patriot apparel, and so much more.
[02:59:38.264 --> 02:59:42.606]  And every order gets a whole bunch of free InfoWars bumper stickers to spread the word.
[02:59:42.606 --> 02:59:43.466]  Take action, folks.
[02:59:48.266 --> 02:59:59.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.672 --> 03:00:05.636]  Well, the Trump rally's already got people wrapped around the block in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[03:00:05.636 --> 03:00:09.778]  So Owen and Drew and the crew cannot even get an internet connection to do Skype.
[03:00:09.778 --> 03:00:12.339]  So they're driving outside of town to try to find a connection.
[03:00:12.339 --> 03:00:14.160]  There's so many tens of thousands lining up.
[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:16.882]  So we're going to have live coverage of that tonight.
[03:00:18.348 --> 03:00:19.888]  But I wanted to say something again about this.
[03:00:19.888 --> 03:00:23.569]  There's hundreds of articles a week attacking us.
[03:00:23.569 --> 03:00:27.750]  Sometimes, you know, they have one article that's been syndicated into hundreds of newspapers, if not thousands.
[03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:29.810]  And that just happened with this New York Times thing.
[03:00:29.810 --> 03:00:33.011]  I mean, it's been in every paper I ran into.
[03:00:33.011 --> 03:00:37.132]  They actually printed it in the paper to really try to attack me.
[03:00:37.132 --> 03:00:39.353]  And then people just come check out the show to find out the truth.
[03:00:39.353 --> 03:00:41.053]  So God turns that evil against them.
[03:00:42.850 --> 03:00:53.495]  When you shoot deer and game, and you take it to a processor, you generally gut them yourselves.
[03:00:53.495 --> 03:00:55.036]  Unless the processor's right down the road.
[03:00:55.036 --> 03:00:59.157]  I used to hunt out in Fredericksburg, and my uncle lived a mile from the processor.
[03:00:59.157 --> 03:01:02.139]  So I'd shoot a deer, and I'd usually shoot it for meat, so I'd shoot a doe.
[03:01:02.139 --> 03:01:04.580]  They taste better than an old buck.
[03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:05.440]  And I'd be lazy.
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:06.161]  I would even gut it.
[03:01:06.161 --> 03:01:08.562]  I'd just drive it, put a tag on it,
[03:01:09.793 --> 03:01:13.275]  Drive it a mile, still warm, they got it right there.
[03:01:13.275 --> 03:01:16.076]  Can't leave the guts in long as they can mess the meat up.
[03:01:16.076 --> 03:01:19.858]  I'm not going to get into details of that, but that's just normal behavior.
[03:01:19.858 --> 03:01:26.921]  But imagine from the soy boy perspective and then the way the female writers of that article who wrote it through their cutout operate.
[03:01:28.055 --> 03:01:32.098]  It's the Elizabeth Williamson lady that writes the fake Sandy Hook stories against us.
[03:01:32.098 --> 03:01:37.942]  Um, to them, that's so alien, to then take animals you've shot to a processor.
[03:01:37.942 --> 03:01:40.343]  I remember the footage they're talking about that one of the crew members saw.
[03:01:40.343 --> 03:01:44.086]  It's us bringing stuff we've shot in and then you go in, they said, looks like a garage.
[03:01:44.086 --> 03:01:51.271]  No, it's a, it's the processing, uh, barns, you know, and then they got refrigerators and all that.
[03:01:51.271 --> 03:01:54.453]  They then skin them and everything and then cut them up in the type of steaks you want.
[03:01:56.121 --> 03:02:02.043]  And it's always a good old boy sitting there and saying, what do you want these cut into?
[03:02:02.043 --> 03:02:04.984]  And you tell them, I want this much made into sausage, you know, and mixed with sausage.
[03:02:04.984 --> 03:02:06.305]  I don't want that much into steaks.
[03:02:06.305 --> 03:02:09.506]  And they'll tell you, okay, well, that's how much this is going to cost for us to cut it up.
[03:02:09.506 --> 03:02:10.647]  You say, deal.
[03:02:10.647 --> 03:02:13.628]  And you sign a ticket like a butcher.
[03:02:13.628 --> 03:02:17.329]  But imagine to them a barn full of animals hanging up.
[03:02:17.329 --> 03:02:21.251]  It's like, and again, it's not even that article that's important.
[03:02:21.251 --> 03:02:23.612]  It shows how they take something real
[03:02:24.622 --> 03:02:26.082]  And they turn it into something ridiculous.
[03:02:26.082 --> 03:02:32.744]  In fact, pull up Trump sons, Trump brothers hunt Triceratops.
[03:02:32.744 --> 03:02:37.406]  Now if you believe the numbers, they've been dead 60-something million years since the big asteroid hit.
[03:02:37.406 --> 03:02:39.946]  There are no Triceratops alive living on the earth.
[03:02:39.946 --> 03:02:42.107]  And it was a photoshopped photo of the Trump sons.
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:45.261]  Hunting the Triceratops.
[03:02:45.261 --> 03:02:53.224]  But that got millions of views and got passed around on Facebook with leftists believing they killed endangered Triceratopses.
[03:02:53.224 --> 03:02:56.606]  Just type it in.
[03:02:56.606 --> 03:02:58.106]  Don Jr.
[03:02:58.106 --> 03:03:02.028]  and Eric Trump hunt dinosaurs.
[03:03:02.028 --> 03:03:04.009]  There it is.
[03:03:04.009 --> 03:03:07.951]  Now folks, that's not real.
[03:03:07.951 --> 03:03:10.892]  But that's the average domesticated leptard.
[03:03:16.249 --> 03:03:17.649]  And that's how they operate.
[03:03:17.649 --> 03:03:20.150]  So I've talked about that enough.
[03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:23.150]  It's just incredible.
[03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:28.831]  And that's why Bloomberg wants to first tax soda drinks and salt, or ban them, and then he wants to not let you have meat.
[03:03:28.831 --> 03:03:30.591]  They want to control what you eat.
[03:03:30.591 --> 03:03:33.732]  That's why all over the news they're saying, eat bugs, it's good for the earth.
[03:03:33.732 --> 03:03:37.033]  But the globalists aren't going to eat bugs, they're going to eat filet mignon.
[03:03:37.033 --> 03:03:45.434]  It's all about your austerity, not their austerity, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:46.624 --> 03:03:48.985]  I can't believe he killed that Triceratops.
[03:03:48.985 --> 03:03:50.905]  And by the way, I really like elephants.
[03:03:50.905 --> 03:03:53.786]  I'm not judging you if you shoot one, because I know what's really going on with that.
[03:03:53.786 --> 03:03:56.907]  I couldn't bring myself to shoot an elephant.
[03:03:56.907 --> 03:04:05.709]  The problem is, is in Africa, the populations have gotten so big, and the elephant populations are actually getting bigger in some areas, that the elephants come and break into things at night.
[03:04:05.709 --> 03:04:09.170]  They come into cities and towns, and they rob people.
[03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:11.091]  And they rob your crops, and they will also kill you.
[03:04:12.159 --> 03:04:13.960]  So they're very, very aggressive.
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:21.502]  And so they have controlled hunts along the belts of where the elephants are coming out of their sanctuary for food.
[03:04:21.502 --> 03:04:23.922]  And in some areas, Africa is overpopulated.
[03:04:23.922 --> 03:04:27.683]  It's very sad, it's terrible, and I like elephants.
[03:04:27.683 --> 03:04:30.824]  But they're doing it in controlled hunts.
[03:04:30.824 --> 03:04:33.885]  I'm not personally going to shoot an elephant.
[03:04:33.885 --> 03:04:37.306]  I instinctively don't want to kill things that aren't game animals.
[03:04:37.306 --> 03:04:39.827]  See, a rabbit is a prey animal.
[03:04:40.777 --> 03:04:42.018]  A cow is a prey animal.
[03:04:42.018 --> 03:04:42.958]  They're designed in nature.
[03:04:42.958 --> 03:04:44.680]  That's how they are.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:47.541]  A lion, a tiger, you know, a elephant?
[03:04:47.541 --> 03:04:48.302]  No.
[03:04:48.302 --> 03:04:49.142]  Those are not prey animals.
[03:04:49.142 --> 03:04:49.943]  They're not meant to be hunted.

[03:06:11.283 --> 03:06:12.724]  I'm Troyer, coming up bottom of the hour.
[03:06:12.724 --> 03:06:14.065]  I want to get through all your calls right now.
[03:06:14.065 --> 03:06:15.427]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[03:06:15.427 --> 03:06:16.548]  Great points, great callers.
[03:06:16.548 --> 03:06:18.589]  It's been an amazing broadcast so far today.
[03:06:18.589 --> 03:06:20.711]  Two articles of impeachment brought forward, like we said.
[03:06:20.711 --> 03:06:27.517]  Abuse of power, obstruction of Congress, not obstruction of justice, not quid pro quo, not bribery.
[03:06:27.517 --> 03:06:29.899]  Two nebulous things that are all objective.
[03:06:31.008 --> 03:06:34.909]  Alex, I'm angry, and I'm sick of it!
[03:06:51.721 --> 03:06:53.582]  I got two things I want to get to, if you don't mind.
[03:06:53.582 --> 03:06:58.504]  But first, I really want to request if you could have Devin Stack of Blackpill back on your show.
[03:06:58.504 --> 03:06:59.685]  He's been on before.
[03:06:59.685 --> 03:07:02.686]  His content on YouTube has just been, like, out of this world.
[03:07:02.686 --> 03:07:04.567]  Yeah, let me get the guy from Blackpill back on.
[03:07:04.567 --> 03:07:05.047]  He's awesome.
[03:07:05.047 --> 03:07:05.747]  That's a good idea.
[03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:06.428]  Yeah, man.
[03:07:06.428 --> 03:07:08.348]  Super pro-family, pro-America.
[03:07:08.348 --> 03:07:09.169]  You know, just great.
[03:07:09.169 --> 03:07:10.349]  Really articulate guy.
[03:07:10.349 --> 03:07:11.990]  I apologize for not getting him back on.
[03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:13.451]  We'll get him back on.
[03:07:13.451 --> 03:07:13.911]  Awesome, man.
[03:07:13.911 --> 03:07:20.554]  Okay, so first, I think Trump's biggest enemy in 2020 is himself.
[03:07:20.554 --> 03:07:21.114]  I think that
[03:07:21.570 --> 03:07:32.879]  He is going to be so confident at the polls that are on, you know, Fox or whatever, or how big his crowds are, that he's going to be overconfident and it's going to leach into his supporters.
[03:07:32.879 --> 03:07:34.740]  And they're also going to think, oh, we got this.
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:37.162]  It's in the bag, you know, just like the midterms, right?
[03:07:37.162 --> 03:07:37.303]  Yeah.
[03:07:37.303 --> 03:07:38.624]  Look how that turned out.
[03:07:38.624 --> 03:07:47.711]  So I think he really needs, he's going to end up getting blindsided by extreme voter fraud and just, they're going to pull out all the stops and that's what's going to happen.
[03:07:47.711 --> 03:07:49.132]  And we're going to be left, you know,
[03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:54.590]  Ryan, I am so glad you held to say that because I was thinking that this morning.
[03:08:10.066 --> 03:08:17.351]  That saying he's way ahead in the polls now and this has backfired is true, but they'd always lie about polls and fix polls if they wanted to.
[03:08:17.351 --> 03:08:18.372]  Those are already skewed polls.
[03:08:18.372 --> 03:08:19.693]  He's even higher than that.
[03:08:19.693 --> 03:08:25.837]  They want him to be overconfident so they can openly steal this election and cement all the censorship.
[03:08:25.837 --> 03:08:32.081]  What you said is absolutely zeitgeist, is the most important thing said on the broadcast in the last month.
[03:08:33.195 --> 03:08:33.915]  I appreciate it, man.
[03:08:33.915 --> 03:08:34.435]  Thank you.
[03:08:34.435 --> 03:08:36.736]  No, I don't appreciate it.
[03:08:36.736 --> 03:08:37.356]  You just said it.
[03:08:37.356 --> 03:08:38.717]  It's scary as hell.
[03:08:38.717 --> 03:08:40.838]  So what do we do about that?
[03:08:40.838 --> 03:08:43.559]  Well, I also think that they're playing a long game.
[03:08:43.559 --> 03:08:47.500]  They're playing a Saul Alinsky, you know, accuse your opponent of what you're doing.
[03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:49.101]  They're playing that long game.
[03:08:49.101 --> 03:08:53.802]  And that's what they did with his election, saying, oh, it was Russia, it was voter fraud, it was all crap.
[03:08:53.802 --> 03:08:54.943]  And now they're pushing impeachment.
[03:08:54.943 --> 03:08:57.363]  They're trying to impeach him on anything imaginable.
[03:08:57.363 --> 03:08:58.964]  That way, when they get in there illegally,
[03:08:59.424 --> 03:09:04.889]  The conservatives are going to be parroting the same thing the leftists were saying about Trump.
[03:09:04.889 --> 03:09:07.231]  And they're going to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, that didn't work on Trump.
[03:09:07.231 --> 03:09:08.352]  That's not going to work on us.
[03:09:08.352 --> 03:09:09.674]  Now you guys are pro-impeachment.
[03:09:09.674 --> 03:09:12.316]  Now you guys think voter fraud is real.
[03:09:12.316 --> 03:09:12.937]  Get out of here.
[03:09:12.937 --> 03:09:14.858]  They're playing us right now.
[03:09:14.858 --> 03:09:20.083]  And everybody says that Trump is the guy with the laser pointer and the dems, the media, the cat.
[03:09:20.083 --> 03:09:20.944]  But that's not how it is.
[03:09:21.465 --> 03:09:23.586]  They're playing us with this impeachment crap.
[03:09:23.586 --> 03:09:26.387]  We're all focusing on impeachment.
[03:09:26.387 --> 03:09:30.348]  Oh, 100% it's meant to change the subject from their treasonous activity.
[03:09:30.348 --> 03:09:39.071]  They're working with the Chi-Coms, how she's been blocking us getting laws passed to stop China ripping us off.
[03:09:39.071 --> 03:09:42.712]  You are totally, absolutely correct.
[03:09:42.712 --> 03:09:43.952]  Anything else, Ryan?
[03:09:43.952 --> 03:09:46.933]  Yeah, my second point real quick is I really think Trump supporters
[03:09:47.358 --> 03:09:52.883]  I know we have to support him, but I really think we need to stop just identifying as Puritan Trump supporters.
[03:09:52.883 --> 03:09:54.404]  Like you say, we're not cult members.
[03:09:54.404 --> 03:09:57.847]  Yeah, because long after Trump's gone, it's the Liberty Movement that brought Trump in.
[03:09:57.847 --> 03:10:00.349]  And if he goes sideways, we don't need to be identified with that.
[03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:03.071]  We're Americans that want the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[03:10:03.071 --> 03:10:07.415]  We're Christian, Nationalist, Populist, Free Marketers, whatever you want to call us.
[03:10:07.415 --> 03:10:09.837]  We're people that don't want to live on the New World Order plantation.
[03:10:09.837 --> 03:10:10.678]  We're not Trumpites.
[03:10:11.423 --> 03:10:11.923]  Exactly.
[03:10:11.923 --> 03:10:13.384]  I don't care about unemployment rates.
[03:10:13.384 --> 03:10:15.465]  I don't care about these little things that he's doing.
[03:10:15.465 --> 03:10:32.273]  If you're destroying our First Amendment and our Second Amendment like he's doing right now with doing no action on Big Tech, he's doing red flag laws, he's doing all this crap that if Obama even said or thought about, we would have the militia and we would have people be in the streets tomorrow, but because it's Trump, everybody gives him a pass.
[03:10:32.273 --> 03:10:34.354]  Like, oh, no, no, he knows what he's doing.
[03:10:34.354 --> 03:10:37.115]  It's like, no, apparently we don't know what we're doing because
[03:10:37.688 --> 03:10:42.112]  He's doing, he's doing hardcore things that Obama wouldn't even try.
[03:10:42.112 --> 03:10:45.254]  Cheryl, I don't think Trump is actively setting us up.
[03:10:45.254 --> 03:10:51.099]  He thought red flags were when people have already been adjudicated nuts, making sure there's more money to put that in the database.
[03:10:51.099 --> 03:10:54.441]  Once he learned it was get rid of due process, he backed off of it real quick.
[03:10:54.441 --> 03:10:56.323]  But yeah, still it's dangerous.
[03:10:56.323 --> 03:10:57.464]  I appreciate your call.
[03:10:57.464 --> 03:10:58.304]  Excellent points.
[03:10:59.346 --> 03:11:02.690]  By the way, some of the other news we haven't gotten to while we've been taking calls.
[03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:04.311]  Trump to fire Director Wray.
[03:11:04.311 --> 03:11:05.373]  That's what they're saying.
[03:11:05.373 --> 03:11:08.336]  President refers to Wray as current director.
[03:11:08.336 --> 03:11:10.478]  Big article by Kit Daniels and fullwars.com.
[03:11:10.478 --> 03:11:15.063]  And then we've got all this other articles.
[03:11:15.063 --> 03:11:19.088]  Epstein funded scientists creating DNA-based eugenics dating app.
[03:11:20.674 --> 03:11:23.495]  And as I told you, what did I tell you in the last few months?
[03:11:23.495 --> 03:11:27.317]  They were recruiting women to have elitist babies.
[03:11:27.317 --> 03:11:33.461]  They were impregnating them and doing all the brainwashing at the Zorro Ranch.
[03:11:33.461 --> 03:11:34.881]  Ah, tomorrow's news today.
[03:11:34.881 --> 03:11:38.423]  I didn't just guess that.
[03:11:38.423 --> 03:11:40.204]  I know all about it.
[03:11:40.204 --> 03:11:42.245]  You don't think Hitler had the first breeding programs.
[03:11:42.245 --> 03:11:43.406]  What do you think royalty is?
[03:11:45.566 --> 03:11:47.269]  Okay, who's been holding longest now?
[03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:51.576]  Although we had Owen up on Skype, even where he was, it's not working.
[03:11:51.576 --> 03:11:55.542]  He literally, the shot we had, it was live for a couple minutes, I was about to go to him.
[03:11:55.542 --> 03:11:56.644]  I could see it there on the screen, was...
[03:11:57.793 --> 03:12:04.876]  Four or five lines snaking behind him of people trying to just get out of the parking lot to line up in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[03:12:04.876 --> 03:12:11.639]  I was looking at hundreds of people just in the shot of the camera in line after line trying to snake into it.
[03:12:11.639 --> 03:12:12.680]  They were moving quick, too.
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:13.720]  The lines were like this.
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:18.182]  I mean, it must just be a gigantor.
[03:12:18.182 --> 03:12:24.605]  Dallas was probably the biggest, if not some of the places in Florida, with 20,000 people there, 20,000 turned away.
[03:12:24.605 --> 03:12:25.646]  I don't know what this is going to be.
[03:12:26.306 --> 03:12:27.586]  I mean, this is going to be crazy.
[03:12:27.586 --> 03:12:34.028]  So we're going to be looking at all of that as it unfolds as soon as I can get to a place with Skype.
[03:12:34.028 --> 03:12:36.609]  If Ellen can't do it, we'll do it on phone, okay?
[03:12:36.609 --> 03:12:41.570]  I know you got all those extra people in Hershey right now, so I'm going to have a lot of bandwidth.
[03:12:41.570 --> 03:12:42.650]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[03:12:42.650 --> 03:12:45.991]  You know, we got extra hotspots and all this fan-dangled equipment.
[03:12:45.991 --> 03:12:48.452]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in North Carolina.
[03:12:48.452 --> 03:12:49.892]  Thank you for calling, sir.
[03:12:49.892 --> 03:12:50.212]  Welcome.
[03:12:51.986 --> 03:12:53.147]  Hello, Alex.
[03:12:53.147 --> 03:12:55.088]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[03:12:55.088 --> 03:12:57.490]  Honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:12:57.490 --> 03:12:59.211]  And your crew as well.
[03:12:59.211 --> 03:12:59.711]  Thank you, sir.
[03:12:59.711 --> 03:13:03.194]  My wife and I feel very proud about your crew.
[03:13:03.194 --> 03:13:08.337]  We've been listening to you since 2009.
[03:13:08.337 --> 03:13:12.480]  As far as the impeachment, yes, we get angry.
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:15.362]  Sometimes I get livid.
[03:13:15.362 --> 03:13:17.863]  But I'm not looking at the big picture.
[03:13:17.863 --> 03:13:18.724]  I'm just looking at
[03:13:20.768 --> 03:13:26.670]  We do watch a couple of news channels on Fox, but that's it.
[03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:40.414]  But, um, um, yeah, the impeachment, um, the gentleman that did, wasn't he from Ireland that spoke to you?
[03:13:40.414 --> 03:13:42.114]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:42.114 --> 03:13:46.635]  I'm of the same mind as him that this is a, this is a spiritual battle.
[03:13:46.635 --> 03:13:46.675]  Uh,
[03:13:48.795 --> 03:13:54.757]  It's not really just flesh and blood.
[03:13:54.757 --> 03:14:03.799]  I was listening to Rabbi Jonathan Cahn that wrote The Paradigm, and at the end he said, we were born for this time.
[03:14:03.799 --> 03:14:06.560]  Not to be afraid, we were born for this time.
[03:14:06.560 --> 03:14:10.161]  If God would have wanted us back in the Dark Ages, we would have been there.
[03:14:12.035 --> 03:14:16.780]  By the way, what you said is so powerful, and you say a lot of it's spiritual.
[03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:18.762]  It's all spiritual.
[03:14:18.762 --> 03:14:20.344]  These are just our bodies.
[03:14:20.344 --> 03:14:21.945]  It's 100% spiritual.
[03:14:21.945 --> 03:14:25.789]  And think about it, we've been chosen for this epic of epic times.
[03:14:25.789 --> 03:14:27.211]  That is a blessing.
[03:14:27.211 --> 03:14:29.493]  People think, oh my God, we've been chosen for this terrible time.
[03:14:29.493 --> 03:14:30.394]  No.
[03:14:30.394 --> 03:14:31.495]  We've been chosen because
[03:14:32.659 --> 03:14:34.099]  Yes, there's things we have to do.
[03:14:34.099 --> 03:14:37.740]  We have to pray, and we have to be active, and we have to talk to people.
[03:14:37.740 --> 03:14:42.461]  Most of my friends are Trump supporters, and their eyes are open now, and more people are coming.
[03:14:42.461 --> 03:14:44.102]  More people's eyes are being opened.
[03:15:03.342 --> 03:15:05.404]  But I do get upset sometimes.
[03:15:05.404 --> 03:15:07.847]  Are you familiar with Kim Clement?
[03:15:07.847 --> 03:15:13.873]  He was a prophet of... Not that I just listen to any prophet, but... No, no, brother, I hear you.
[03:15:13.873 --> 03:15:15.895]  No, I'm not, but I'll look into it.
[03:15:15.895 --> 03:15:17.377]  And I really appreciate you holding, Jeff.
[03:15:17.377 --> 03:15:18.598]  God bless you.
[03:15:18.598 --> 03:15:19.780]  And listen to these callers.
[03:15:19.780 --> 03:15:21.782]  Loving, focused, thoughtful.
[03:15:21.782 --> 03:15:22.783]  I am so blessed.
[03:15:24.121 --> 03:15:31.205]  When I hear somebody say they've been listening for, you know, 10, 15 years, I feel sorry for you sometimes, because good Lord, I can be a train wreck and I know it.
[03:15:31.205 --> 03:15:32.866]  But sometimes the show's really great, isn't it?
[03:15:32.866 --> 03:15:35.727]  And sometimes we really hit the high notes and have a big effect.
[03:15:35.727 --> 03:15:38.329]  Other times I act like a petulant child.
[03:15:38.329 --> 03:15:42.031]  But in the end of the day, we're fighting, we're winning with God's help.
[03:15:42.031 --> 03:15:44.452]  And you're right, there's a huge awakening taking place.
[03:15:44.452 --> 03:15:45.692]  All right.
[03:15:45.692 --> 03:15:48.994]  Michael, Reed, James, Terry, Jefferson, Daniel.
[03:15:48.994 --> 03:15:50.055]  In fact, Daniel's up next.
[03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:53.110]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:57.032]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.032 --> 03:15:58.573]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.573 --> 03:16:01.534]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.534 --> 03:16:07.077]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.077 --> 03:16:08.278]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.278 --> 03:16:11.220]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.220 --> 03:16:13.441]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.441 --> 03:16:17.883]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.883 --> 03:16:20.184]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.425 --> 03:16:27.789]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:27.789 --> 03:16:30.811]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:30.811 --> 03:16:36.754]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:36.754 --> 03:16:40.537]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:40.537 --> 03:16:41.797]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:41.797 --> 03:16:43.138]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:43.138 --> 03:16:49.342]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:49.342 --> 03:16:50.783]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:51.738 --> 03:16:54.760]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:57.681]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[03:16:57.681 --> 03:17:04.885]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[03:17:04.885 --> 03:17:10.108]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[03:17:53.368 --> 03:17:57.851]  Driving into the operations center this morning, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:17:57.851 --> 03:18:01.914]  I need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell out the facts.
[03:18:01.914 --> 03:18:10.641]  When you spend your money at places like Dick's Sporting Goods, you're financing a group that gives huge amounts of money to gun control, disarming you and your family.
[03:18:11.281 --> 03:18:16.564]  When you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart, did you know they're doing the same thing now?
[03:18:16.564 --> 03:18:25.228]  Did you know that almost every big box store, including Target, they're the worst, are actually funding the transgender movement targeting children?
[03:18:25.228 --> 03:18:27.730]  Do you know what Jeff Bezos and Amazon's up to?
[03:18:28.650 --> 03:18:31.011]  Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head spin.
[03:18:31.011 --> 03:18:34.652]  Why in the hell are we supporting these people?
[03:18:34.652 --> 03:18:41.974]  Why are you going to buy your Christmas presents for your family from these institutions that hate America and hate your guts?
[03:18:41.974 --> 03:18:45.535]  Do your shopping at infowarsstore.com and get great products.
[03:18:45.535 --> 03:18:50.616]  And then rest assured, you're funding the resistance, you're funding the voice of liberty in the face of tyranny.

[03:18:53.067 --> 03:18:53.928]  Andy in Florida.
[03:18:53.928 --> 03:18:54.508]  Thank you, Andy.
[03:18:54.508 --> 03:18:55.589]  Go ahead.
[03:18:55.589 --> 03:18:56.229]  Hey, Alex.
[03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.989]  I love you, man.
[03:18:56.989 --> 03:18:57.630]  We love you.
[03:18:57.630 --> 03:19:01.592]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[03:19:01.592 --> 03:19:03.173]  A little bit about me.
[03:19:03.173 --> 03:19:03.773]  I'm 245 pounds.
[03:19:03.773 --> 03:19:06.775]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[03:19:06.775 --> 03:19:10.077]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[03:19:10.077 --> 03:19:14.560]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[03:19:15.060 --> 03:19:15.420]  I think so.
[03:19:30.419 --> 03:19:31.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:11.317 --> 03:20:23.809]  I'll take you live to Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[03:20:23.809 --> 03:20:24.450]  Owen Schroyer!
[03:20:26.147 --> 03:20:26.667]  He's there!
[03:20:26.667 --> 03:20:33.930]  I haven't stood up today here in the studio, but I thought I'd stand up for Owen and what he did yesterday and the incredible videos he put out.
[03:20:33.930 --> 03:20:45.536]  And then last night, I watched that final video he did laying out the New York Times and others calling for his full deplatforming, calling him a white supremacist, saying that he called for Obama's hanging during the hearing.
[03:20:45.536 --> 03:20:47.356]  All of it total lies.
[03:20:47.356 --> 03:20:48.657]  Vanity Fair, all of them.
[03:20:48.657 --> 03:20:50.738]  These people are rapists of the truth.
[03:20:51.786 --> 03:21:04.271]  But the good news is he's there in Hershey with massive crowds already assembling for the Trump rally tonight that we're going to be here covering live right after the war room with Savannah Hernandez hosting for him today along with Rebecca and others.
[03:21:04.271 --> 03:21:07.152]  And then I'll be back tonight right through the event with live feeds.
[03:21:07.152 --> 03:21:07.833]  Owen Schroyer!
[03:21:08.933 --> 03:21:10.774]  Just as great looking at you, my friend.
[03:21:10.774 --> 03:21:12.134]  Great that we're still on the air.
[03:21:12.134 --> 03:21:14.975]  The audience has kept us in the game because they're not an audience.
[03:21:14.975 --> 03:21:16.756]  They are men and women in the arena.
[03:21:16.756 --> 03:21:21.638]  So here's to the InfoWars crew and the audience and all of you that make it possible!
[03:21:21.638 --> 03:21:23.638]  We're really doing something together, aren't we, Owen?
[03:21:23.638 --> 03:21:26.520]  How about this, Alex?
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:28.760]  I got a lot of people out here that might agree with you.
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:32.822]  Hey, how do you guys feel about InfoWars and Alex Jones?
[03:21:32.822 --> 03:21:33.082]  Huh?
[03:21:34.036 --> 03:21:37.579]  So Alex, everybody's energy is resonating with you right now.
[03:21:37.579 --> 03:21:43.363]  But man, let me tell you, there's already at least 10,000 people out here already.
[03:21:43.363 --> 03:21:46.346]  We're still hours away from the rally actually starting.
[03:21:46.346 --> 03:21:49.328]  We've been walking around talking to the crowd behind me here, Alex.
[03:21:49.328 --> 03:21:50.849]  By the way, it's raining out here.
[03:21:50.849 --> 03:21:54.052]  That didn't stop the tens of thousands of people from coming out here.
[03:21:54.052 --> 03:21:56.273]  And so, there were people lined up at 4 a.m.
[03:21:57.478 --> 03:22:04.303]  The line is so long here, it's longer than they expected, so they didn't even have the barricades laid out because the line has gone so far back.
[03:22:04.303 --> 03:22:13.009]  So, it's without a doubt they're going to reach maximum capacity of 10,500 inside Giant Center this evening for the Trump rally.
[03:22:13.009 --> 03:22:18.753]  And then there will be an overflow out here in the parking lot of, I would guess, at least 5,000 people.
[03:22:18.753 --> 03:22:21.855]  So you're going to have at least 15,000 people out here supporting Trump.
[03:22:22.955 --> 03:22:27.923]  There may be some Trump protests, some resistance, but we haven't really seen much of that yet.
[03:22:27.923 --> 03:22:29.225]  So we'll be scouting for that too.
[03:22:29.225 --> 03:22:31.068]  We'll give you that footage as well.
[03:22:31.068 --> 03:22:34.192]  Now let's be clear because the Antifasoros funded trash...
[03:22:35.521 --> 03:22:37.643]  A bomb-threaded local facility.
[03:22:37.643 --> 03:22:39.704]  You guys are going to have a speech tonight until they shut it down.
[03:22:39.704 --> 03:22:46.269]  Now, I know an alternate's been opened, but we can't say until right before they'll bomb-thread that, the cowardly, un-American terrorists.
[03:22:46.269 --> 03:22:48.410]  And they're supposed to come up and beat everybody up.
[03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:54.955]  But, of course, this isn't a leftist, libtard city, I'm told, so I guess they'll probably keep their little traitorous tails between their filthy meth-head legs.
[03:22:57.290 --> 03:23:13.645]  Yeah, Alex, I know that because obviously we're only a couple hours from New York and from Baltimore and from D.C., we thought that, you know, the left and Soros might bus a bunch of people out here to act like they have a presence, but it is kind of a measuring stick.
[03:23:13.645 --> 03:23:15.767]  How much hatred is still left for Trump?
[03:23:15.767 --> 03:23:20.952]  How much energy can they really still get behind all these fascist protesters against Trump?
[03:23:20.952 --> 03:23:21.453]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:23:21.793 --> 03:23:24.554]  Alex, I'm telling you, man, we can't not get recognized out here, Alex.
[03:23:24.554 --> 03:23:26.315]  InfoWars is bigger than ever.
[03:23:26.315 --> 03:23:31.117]  It's just unbelievable what the censorship attempt has done to try to shut us down.
[03:23:31.117 --> 03:23:32.397]  It's only made us bigger than ever.
[03:23:32.397 --> 03:23:33.377]  Absolutely.
[03:23:33.377 --> 03:23:38.339]  Tell Drew or whoever's running camera there to give us a 360 and then tell us how the great Will Johnson's doing.
[03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:41.921]  I know he's following a lot of kick-butt reports out there as well.
[03:23:41.921 --> 03:23:43.361]  Yeah, Will's been busy out here.
[03:23:43.361 --> 03:23:45.402]  He's on the other side of the deal.
[03:23:45.402 --> 03:23:47.483]  Wow, that looks like a NASCAR race!
[03:23:48.636 --> 03:23:51.598]  Alex, they've already let 5,000 people in.
[03:23:51.598 --> 03:23:54.801]  They've already let 5,000 people in, Alex.
[03:23:54.801 --> 03:23:57.283]  This is like what was the back of the line earlier.
[03:23:57.283 --> 03:23:57.983]  It's crazy.
[03:23:57.983 --> 03:24:01.145]  I'm telling you, there's going to be 15,000 of them out here, Alex.
[03:24:01.145 --> 03:24:03.487]  And this is who they want to impeach.
[03:24:03.487 --> 03:24:05.589]  Trump is just a representative of these people.
[03:24:05.589 --> 03:24:07.310]  They really want to impeach the American people.
[03:24:07.310 --> 03:24:09.932]  They really want to remove the right for us to vote.
[03:24:09.932 --> 03:24:11.353]  They want to dominate us.
[03:24:11.353 --> 03:24:13.474]  They want to select who our president is.
[03:24:13.474 --> 03:24:14.015]  And I'm telling you,
[03:24:14.978 --> 03:24:15.298]  I can't.
[03:24:15.298 --> 03:24:18.881]  I mean, dude, Alex, literally everybody wants to come by and give me a hug and shake my hand.
[03:24:18.881 --> 03:24:19.421]  Well, let them do it.
[03:24:19.421 --> 03:24:20.462]  Let them do it live on air.
[03:24:20.462 --> 03:24:21.582]  Turn that camera around the other way.
[03:24:21.582 --> 03:24:24.584]  Look at this t-shirt he's got on right here.
[03:24:24.584 --> 03:24:25.225]  What do you think?
[03:24:25.225 --> 03:24:26.565]  Say hi to Alex Jones.
[03:24:26.565 --> 03:24:27.226]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[03:24:27.226 --> 03:24:27.866]  I'm a big fan.
[03:24:27.866 --> 03:24:31.268]  I've been listening to your show for a long time, and it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
[03:24:31.268 --> 03:24:32.809]  Tell him God bless.
[03:24:32.809 --> 03:24:36.792]  Give us his take on the impeachment, and I do believe it's backfiring.
[03:24:36.792 --> 03:24:38.113]  What will the Libtards do next?
[03:24:39.218 --> 03:24:42.841]  Alex wants to know, what do you think about the Libtar Democrat impeachment process?
[03:24:42.841 --> 03:24:46.164]  I think it is, uh, total, total bullshit.
[03:24:46.164 --> 03:24:46.864]  Oh!
[03:24:46.864 --> 03:24:47.525]  Oh, he cursed!
[03:24:47.525 --> 03:24:48.306]  Dump him!
[03:24:48.306 --> 03:24:48.746]  Dump him!
[03:24:48.746 --> 03:24:50.327]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:24:50.327 --> 03:24:53.090]  Say, say a curse word, but I mean... Bravo Sierra!
[03:24:53.090 --> 03:24:55.872]  It's total, total crap.
[03:24:55.872 --> 03:24:56.392]  Yep.
[03:24:56.392 --> 03:24:57.814]  Thank you for supporting us.
[03:24:57.814 --> 03:24:58.534]  Thank you.
[03:24:58.534 --> 03:24:59.635]  My friend Rod over here.
[03:24:59.635 --> 03:25:01.116]  Yeah, what's up man?
[03:25:01.116 --> 03:25:01.657]  How you doing?
[03:25:03.188 --> 03:25:05.310]  Good afternoon, how are you?
[03:25:05.310 --> 03:25:08.673]  How long have you been a Trump supporter since the beginning or did he convince you later on?
[03:25:08.673 --> 03:25:10.695]  I was convinced later on after the election.
[03:25:10.695 --> 03:25:14.879]  I didn't vote in the first election and I'm convinced now.
[03:25:14.879 --> 03:25:19.283]  I think there's a lot of people like you out there who weren't necessarily Trump supporters but now they will be.
[03:25:19.283 --> 03:25:22.346]  I think 2020 is looking pretty good as long as we can stop the election.
[03:25:22.346 --> 03:25:24.748]  Come over here man, I know you've been aching to get in here.
[03:25:24.748 --> 03:25:26.129]  Say hi to Alex Jones.
[03:25:26.129 --> 03:25:26.950]  What's going on Alex?
[03:25:27.495 --> 03:25:31.937]  I tell them we love them, but imagine if that crowd decided to get in their cars and drive to D.C.
[03:25:31.937 --> 03:25:35.339]  for the fake impeachment hearings, and if they legally and lawfully took over the Capitol.
[03:25:35.339 --> 03:25:38.220]  How about Trump call for that?
[03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:38.841]  Yeah, so what do you think?
[03:25:38.841 --> 03:25:42.242]  Do you think Trump should call for... Here, let me go ahead and grab this umbrella.
[03:25:42.242 --> 03:25:43.403]  The rain's coming down again.
[03:25:43.403 --> 03:25:53.268]  Do you think Trump should call for people to organize activism to try to stop this impeachment process, let the Democrats know that America's not behind the fake impeachment scam?
[03:25:53.268 --> 03:25:53.848]  Absolutely.
[03:25:53.848 --> 03:25:55.749]  I think we as people should get together
[03:25:56.957 --> 03:25:58.058]  And just trying to get this stopped.
[03:25:58.058 --> 03:26:02.480]  I know we can't really do much now, but absolutely we should try to do something for this.
[03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:03.921]  Alex, they won't stop coming by.
[03:26:03.921 --> 03:26:04.901]  They're all taking pictures.
[03:26:04.901 --> 03:26:06.122]  We love you guys.
[03:26:06.122 --> 03:26:06.602]  We love you guys.
[03:26:06.602 --> 03:26:07.463]  Tell them I love them.
[03:26:07.463 --> 03:26:07.923]  We love them.
[03:26:07.923 --> 03:26:13.346]  And tell them, go to the Capitol, legally and lawfully, and get in that little demonic penguin's face, Nadler.
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:16.220]  Scott Pressler is a national treasure.
[03:26:16.220 --> 03:26:18.121]  Hey, we're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:26:18.121 --> 03:26:20.381]  Scott Pressler is a national treasure right here.
[03:26:20.381 --> 03:26:24.202]  He goes around the country wearing Trump gear, picking up trash.
[03:26:24.202 --> 03:26:26.643]  It's heroic work, so I just wanted to give Scott a big shout out.
[03:26:26.643 --> 03:26:28.844]  So Scott, you're doing hero's work.
[03:26:28.844 --> 03:26:30.364]  When is the next trash pickup?
[03:26:30.364 --> 03:26:37.966]  Actually, I was just in Houston where we picked up 20 tons of trash in four hours in the city of Houston, the 5th Ward.
[03:26:38.386 --> 03:26:41.709]  It's called the nickel, the bloody fifth, because it's so dangerous.
[03:26:41.709 --> 03:26:44.050]  But we went in with love and we were accepted.
[03:26:44.050 --> 03:26:49.474]  We're going this Saturday back to Baltimore for cleanup number four, Saturday, December 14th.
[03:26:49.474 --> 03:26:53.657]  We're not only going to clean up trash, but we're going to collect toys for tots and give back to the community.
[03:26:53.657 --> 03:26:54.238]  Amazing work.
[03:26:54.238 --> 03:26:57.200]  Notice the left just produced pedophilia and trash and rats.
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:26:58.120]  We produced the opposite.
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:26:59.962]  Great job.
[03:26:59.962 --> 03:27:00.562]  Exactly.
[03:27:00.562 --> 03:27:01.563]  You got something to say to Alex?
[03:27:02.563 --> 03:27:03.203]  What's up?
[03:27:03.203 --> 03:27:04.604]  Alex, they're non-stop here, man.
[03:27:04.604 --> 03:27:06.305]  Sorry, Alex, but listen.
[03:27:06.305 --> 03:27:07.186]  I loved you, Alex.
[03:27:07.186 --> 03:27:13.670]  You were exposing the two-party paradigm for long enough, and now you went Republican, and you went full conservative.
[03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:16.191]  Trump continues to send people to Bilderberg Group.
[03:27:16.191 --> 03:27:18.873]  He's a bigger supporter of Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[03:27:18.873 --> 03:27:20.134]  The First Amendment is gone.
[03:27:20.134 --> 03:27:22.775]  The Second Amendment, he says, we'll deal with due process later.
[03:27:22.775 --> 03:27:23.976]  Take their guns first.
[03:27:23.976 --> 03:27:25.217]  The entire Bill of Rights is gone.
[03:27:25.217 --> 03:27:26.137]  It's been three years on.
[03:27:26.137 --> 03:27:26.578]  Hold on, Alex.
[03:27:26.578 --> 03:27:27.298]  You want to respond to that?
[03:27:27.498 --> 03:27:27.858]  Absolutely.
[03:27:27.858 --> 03:27:28.879]  He doesn't have to say sorry.
[03:27:28.879 --> 03:27:31.000]  This is great evidence by the disagrees.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.782]  Trump is upsetting the left-right paradigm.
[03:27:33.782 --> 03:27:35.984]  Trump is taking over the Republican Party.
[03:27:35.984 --> 03:27:42.308]  I'd love to take over the Democratic Party if somebody like, you know, the congresswoman from Hawaii would do it.
[03:27:42.308 --> 03:27:44.829]  So that's what this comes down to.
[03:27:44.829 --> 03:27:47.931]  And I'm on Trump and upset about some of the things Trump's done.
[03:27:47.931 --> 03:27:50.493]  I'm definitely not a cult person here.
[03:27:50.493 --> 03:27:52.754]  The deep state's trying to remove Trump.
[03:27:52.754 --> 03:27:53.775]  Is Trump perfect?
[03:27:53.775 --> 03:27:55.056]  So Alex actually agrees with a lot
[03:27:56.693 --> 03:27:59.034]  Yeah, yeah, and we've been talking about that.
[03:27:59.034 --> 03:28:08.677]  However, we think that, you know, considering the Republicans didn't really want Trump either, and still aren't really accepting of Trump, that, you know, Trump has not really been an establishment Republican.
[03:28:08.677 --> 03:28:13.179]  So, do you feel that Trump is an establishment Republican, even though they've tried to destroy him too?
[03:28:13.179 --> 03:28:14.180]  I think at this point he is.
[03:28:14.180 --> 03:28:20.462]  When you're sending delegates to the Bilderberg Group three years in a row, when we still have the Federal Reserve, when we still have them bootlicking the CIA, the
[03:28:20.982 --> 03:28:22.543]  Hold on, tell him not to go anywhere.
[03:28:22.543 --> 03:28:23.684]  We gotta go to break.
[03:28:23.684 --> 03:28:25.165]  I'm gonna come back to him.
[03:28:25.165 --> 03:28:26.766]  I really want to answer those questions.
[03:28:26.766 --> 03:28:36.772]  I am gonna, I want him to repeat those, and then we'll finish up here, and I promise I'm gonna get to Daniel, everybody that's been patiently holding, and Reed, everybody holding, Laura, Terry, we're gonna get to all the calls.
[03:28:36.772 --> 03:28:39.014]  I'm gonna finish up with Owen, and this little feller.
[03:28:39.014 --> 03:28:44.257]  When we come back, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, you buying the products, funds this all over the country.
[03:28:44.257 --> 03:28:48.440]  We got so many big plans, but do your Christmas shopping with us, and we will not let you down!
[03:28:51.894 --> 03:28:53.876]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:53.876 --> 03:28:59.180]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:28:59.180 --> 03:29:00.762]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:00.762 --> 03:29:09.129]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:09.129 --> 03:29:14.814]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:14.974 --> 03:29:16.796]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:16.796 --> 03:29:18.959]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:18.959 --> 03:29:23.464]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:23.464 --> 03:29:25.667]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:25.667 --> 03:29:33.416]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:29:33.556 --> 03:29:35.899]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[03:29:35.899 --> 03:29:36.239]  That's 866-295-5305.
[03:29:36.239 --> 03:29:37.961]  Or order online at hbextract.com.
[03:29:37.961 --> 03:29:39.723]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[03:29:52.782 --> 03:29:56.003]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[03:29:56.003 --> 03:30:13.388]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[03:30:13.388 --> 03:30:14.749]  We're being taken off the land.
[03:30:15.609 --> 03:30:26.255]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[03:30:26.255 --> 03:30:35.401]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[03:30:36.141 --> 03:30:39.504]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[03:30:39.504 --> 03:30:43.989]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[03:30:43.989 --> 03:30:45.851]  This is the post-human error.
[03:30:45.851 --> 03:30:48.613]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[03:30:48.613 --> 03:30:50.075]  This is the crossroads.
[03:30:50.075 --> 03:30:51.896]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[03:30:52.677 --> 03:31:04.407]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate Infowars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[03:31:04.407 --> 03:31:13.895]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[03:31:13.895 --> 03:31:18.458]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[03:31:18.458 --> 03:31:21.381]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[03:31:21.661 --> 03:31:29.946]  And they do what they do because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[03:31:29.946 --> 03:31:39.872]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[03:31:39.872 --> 03:31:42.033]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[03:31:42.593 --> 03:31:45.175]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[03:31:45.175 --> 03:31:48.277]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[03:31:48.277 --> 03:31:52.460]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[03:31:52.460 --> 03:32:00.426]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[03:32:34.346 --> 03:32:35.447]  Get two bottles of knockout.
[03:32:37.588 --> 03:32:38.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:16.414 --> 03:33:24.272]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[03:33:24.272 --> 03:33:26.016]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:33:32.045 --> 03:33:33.486]  All right.
[03:33:33.486 --> 03:33:38.229]  I had Savannah Hernandez walk to me during the little short break and she said, hey, do you want me to have Owen on his own show today?
[03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:39.349]  And I said, just talk to Owen.
[03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:41.250]  She said, well, he's busy out in the field.
[03:33:41.250 --> 03:33:42.211]  And I said, no, he's not.
[03:33:42.211 --> 03:33:47.094]  As you know, via the miracle of technology that we've developed as an amazing species made in the image of God.
[03:33:47.634 --> 03:33:48.815]  It was pretty cool stuff.
[03:33:48.815 --> 03:33:50.577]  We've got him in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[03:33:50.577 --> 03:33:53.640]  So let's get Owen on, because the show's coming up in about 27 minutes.
[03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:55.682]  You're going to host it for three hours.
[03:33:55.682 --> 03:33:57.444]  The War Room, Infowars.com.
[03:33:57.444 --> 03:34:01.027]  It's on the TV and radio satellite for folks to pick it up as well.
[03:34:01.027 --> 03:34:03.930]  We'll have live coverage tonight that I'm going to host after you go off.
[03:34:04.551 --> 03:34:04.791]  Thank you.
[03:34:04.791 --> 03:34:04.991]  Thank you.
[03:34:23.752 --> 03:34:28.693]  Yes and so Alex had me come on today too because he wants me to talk about what's coming up on the war room.
[03:34:28.693 --> 03:34:35.295]  Of course we're going to be talking about these impeachment hearings still, but more importantly the Trump rally that's happening in Hershey today.
[03:34:35.295 --> 03:34:37.836]  I've been watching your live streams all morning and they've been great.
[03:34:37.836 --> 03:34:39.877]  You've gotten a lot of great interviews.
[03:34:39.877 --> 03:34:45.058]  I think you even confronted someone who I want to ask you a little bit more about on the war room later today.
[03:34:45.058 --> 03:34:46.359]  But what have you seen so far?
[03:34:46.359 --> 03:34:49.439]  How's the rally going and what can we expect later on tonight?
[03:34:51.934 --> 03:34:55.936]  There's at least 10,000 plus people here in the pouring rain.
[03:34:55.936 --> 03:34:57.257]  They're standing outside.
[03:34:57.257 --> 03:34:59.238]  They're trying to get inside the rally.
[03:34:59.238 --> 03:35:05.702]  Many of them won't get in, so they'll be standing outside in the pouring rain, watching on the big screen, just to be a part of this energy.
[03:35:05.702 --> 03:35:11.606]  But you know, normally we come to these things and we expose the violent left and the fascists known as Antifa.
[03:35:12.066 --> 03:35:15.310]  But there are none that I've seen so far.
[03:35:15.310 --> 03:35:17.332]  I haven't really been looking for them, but it's kind of been nice.
[03:35:17.332 --> 03:35:25.441]  You know, it's kind of been nice to actually talk to nice people, talk to real people, talk to a smart guy like this who maybe doesn't agree with everything, but we're both on the same page.
[03:35:25.441 --> 03:35:26.463]  We want to stop corruption.
[03:35:27.003 --> 03:35:30.205]  We're going to talk to him in a moment, but Savannah brought up that really good question.
[03:35:30.205 --> 03:35:31.966]  Tell us about Jordan Klepper.
[03:35:31.966 --> 03:35:34.528]  We'll play that clip here.
[03:35:34.528 --> 03:35:42.713]  This is the guy who tried to run the hit piece on us, a show designed to get us off the air, which had some success but didn't have ratings, so they cancelled it.
[03:35:42.713 --> 03:35:47.276]  We'll play that clip from Comedy Central, Minion, that you ran into today.
[03:35:47.276 --> 03:35:49.177]  Tell us about running into Klepper.
[03:35:50.816 --> 03:35:54.899]  You know, it was actually strange because I thought he was going to be like a normal dude.
[03:35:54.899 --> 03:36:00.283]  You know, I thought he was going to be kind of cool and we could have fun and maybe shake hands and, you know, jolt each other a little bit.
[03:36:00.283 --> 03:36:06.047]  But no, he was like really weird and he like was scared of me and was like trying to make jokes that weren't funny.
[03:36:06.047 --> 03:36:07.528]  So it was very awkward.
[03:36:07.528 --> 03:36:10.550]  Like I said, I thought he was going to be cool and like at least talk to me.
[03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:17.555]  And, you know, even if we don't agree politically, like at least be able to say, hey, you know, you know, these guys, Sasha Barricone and this guy, these are all sociologists.
[03:36:17.955 --> 03:36:19.316]  These guys are operatives, man.
[03:36:19.316 --> 03:36:24.238]  These are supposedly because, you know, they're connected to agencies and stuff, and they work for the deep state.
[03:36:24.238 --> 03:36:27.139]  They're supposed to be James Bond, and then you're not.
[03:36:27.139 --> 03:36:33.703]  So they're just so freaked out by how real you are, Owen, and how powerful we are, how powerful the American people are, how our authenticity is.
[03:36:33.703 --> 03:36:35.503]  So that scares him.
[03:36:35.503 --> 03:36:37.324]  He is an enemy of America, brother.
[03:36:37.324 --> 03:36:38.345]  We've got his M.O.
[03:36:39.895 --> 03:36:44.802]  Well look, I want to give this guy one last comment, because he loves us, he loves you, he loves what we're doing.
[03:36:44.802 --> 03:36:48.507]  We're going to go to him in a moment, I just want Savannah to finish up some work.
[03:36:48.507 --> 03:36:52.052]  In just a second Owen, Savannah Hernandez, tell us what's coming up in the war room today.
[03:36:52.762 --> 03:36:54.563]  So we've got a lot of great stuff coming up.
[03:36:54.563 --> 03:36:57.505]  Like I said, we're going to be talking about this Trump rally in Hershey.
[03:36:57.505 --> 03:37:04.631]  We're going to be talking about the anti-Trump protest that's going to be happening by Antifa as well.
[03:37:04.631 --> 03:37:06.652]  We also have a lot of really great guests coming up.
[03:37:06.652 --> 03:37:13.097]  Jesse Lee Peterson and I are going to be talking about Pete Buttigieg and how he cannot be both gay and a conservative.
[03:37:13.097 --> 03:37:15.238]  Not conservative, but... A Christian.
[03:37:15.238 --> 03:37:15.899]  Exactly.
[03:37:15.899 --> 03:37:18.741]  He's going to these black churches and saying he has the moral authority.
[03:37:19.361 --> 03:37:22.843]  Just according to Christianity, we're not even judging him, or I'm not.
[03:37:22.843 --> 03:37:25.825]  It's just we don't need to hear how Nancy Pelosi is the second coming of Christ.
[03:37:25.825 --> 03:37:27.686]  They have this new thing where they're our Jesus.
[03:37:27.686 --> 03:37:29.987]  No, Pete Buttigieg is not our Jesus.
[03:37:30.555 --> 03:37:30.935]  Exactly.
[03:37:30.935 --> 03:37:33.457]  So we're going to be talking a little bit about that.
[03:37:33.457 --> 03:37:36.280]  And just there's so much in the news today.
[03:37:36.280 --> 03:37:38.021]  There's been a lot on dredge this morning.
[03:37:38.021 --> 03:37:40.343]  So I'm really excited to get all into it.
[03:37:40.343 --> 03:37:49.110]  And hopefully Owen will pop in with us as well and talk to us, you know, like I said, about what he's seeing at the rally, what he's been experiencing, because so far I've heard there's a lot of energy there.
[03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:50.791]  People were lining up at 4 a.m.
[03:37:50.791 --> 03:37:54.854]  this morning, and he already said that there's thousands there waiting for President Trump.
[03:37:54.854 --> 03:37:55.194]  All right.
[03:37:55.194 --> 03:37:58.117]  Savannah Hernandez hosting the War Room, kicking ass.
[03:37:58.117 --> 03:37:59.017]  Thank you, Savannah.
[03:37:59.017 --> 03:37:59.318]  Thank you.
[03:37:59.983 --> 03:38:03.665]  Alright, now, going back to Owen Schroyer and our little buddy there.
[03:38:03.665 --> 03:38:09.788]  Sorry to interrupt you, Owen, but her earpiece was going in and out so she couldn't hear everything you were saying.
[03:38:09.788 --> 03:38:13.050]  Let's make any other points you want to make, then we'll finish up with our friend here.
[03:38:13.050 --> 03:38:14.491]  Go ahead.
[03:38:14.491 --> 03:38:18.773]  Yeah, no, it's just, I think that there's a lack of candor
[03:38:19.497 --> 03:38:21.319]  Between people that disagree politically.
[03:38:21.319 --> 03:38:26.764]  And while me and this guy and you probably agree on a lot of things, we just have a different approach to how to get there.
[03:38:26.764 --> 03:38:30.587]  But you know, earlier today I spoke to a Bernie Sanders supporter, and it was very cordial.
[03:38:30.587 --> 03:38:33.230]  We disagreed on a lot of things, but we were like, hey, we need more of this.
[03:38:33.230 --> 03:38:35.372]  Exactly, we want these folks on the show.
[03:38:35.372 --> 03:38:38.855]  So, sir, recap your... I guess he didn't have an earpiece.
[03:38:38.855 --> 03:38:40.196]  Tell him to recap his questions.
[03:38:40.196 --> 03:38:42.558]  One was Federal Reserve, the other was Bilderberg.
[03:38:42.558 --> 03:38:43.099]  What was the other one?
[03:38:43.973 --> 03:38:48.354]  I'll just give him the mic to make a final statement here, Alex, and you can respond, and then it'll probably be break time.
[03:38:48.354 --> 03:38:48.994]  Sure.
[03:38:48.994 --> 03:38:50.955]  Go ahead.
[03:38:50.955 --> 03:38:51.535]  Thank you very much.
[03:38:51.535 --> 03:39:01.458]  I just wanted to say briefly that, Alex, people like you, David Icke, Jordan Maxwell, woke me up and took me down this path of nonviolent resistance, and what you continue to do, I love it.
[03:39:01.458 --> 03:39:02.378]  Stay the course.
[03:39:02.378 --> 03:39:05.519]  And also, I'd like to say, go to youtube.com forward slash demand the truth.
[03:39:07.970 --> 03:39:08.310]  Don't go.
[03:39:08.310 --> 03:39:09.331]  I want to respond to him.
[03:39:26.372 --> 03:39:29.555]  We exposed Bilderberg as a globalist secret confab.
[03:39:29.555 --> 03:39:30.956]  People ask, well we don't cover it a lot now.
[03:39:30.956 --> 03:39:32.417]  We send reporters.
[03:39:32.417 --> 03:39:34.639]  It's just that they're not denying world government anymore.
[03:39:34.639 --> 03:39:36.761]  So we forced it out in the open.
[03:39:36.761 --> 03:39:37.861]  That's mission complete.
[03:39:37.861 --> 03:39:43.146]  Of course he sent White House people to that to tell the globalists on notice.
[03:39:43.146 --> 03:39:48.070]  It's like when Trump goes to Davos and they all hate his guts, he's there delivering the message.
[03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:49.651]  I have talked on the phone with globalists.
[03:39:49.651 --> 03:39:51.272]  I've met with globalists.
[03:39:51.272 --> 03:39:53.874]  I have had them offer me deals.
[03:39:53.874 --> 03:39:54.435]  I don't, you know,
[03:39:55.635 --> 03:40:00.545]  Blow those agreements to say who they are, but I said that I refused them and that's what happened.
[03:40:01.991 --> 03:40:04.292]  Then you talk about, okay, that was Bilderberg.
[03:40:04.292 --> 03:40:05.412]  The other thing was the Federal Reserve.
[03:40:05.412 --> 03:40:09.213]  He's been the biggest critic of the Federal Reserve as a president I've ever seen.
[03:40:09.213 --> 03:40:10.874]  It's like Ron Paul's president.
[03:40:10.874 --> 03:40:13.915]  He's making them cut interest rates.
[03:40:13.915 --> 03:40:16.676]  He's put new people in at the Federal Reserve.
[03:40:16.676 --> 03:40:19.797]  And he's talked about abolishing it, so that's really, really exciting.
[03:40:19.797 --> 03:40:21.818]  Red flag stuff was the scariest thing he did.
[03:40:21.818 --> 03:40:23.919]  It was terrible to even consider it.
[03:40:23.919 --> 03:40:30.201]  I knew what his tactic was, was to take the steam out of them and have them admit they want total gun control, which was his plan, to trick them into saying what they wanted.
[03:40:30.201 --> 03:40:30.841]  I still don't like
[03:40:31.481 --> 03:40:33.362]  That type of deception.
[03:40:33.362 --> 03:40:37.005]  And so, you know, the Globals legitimately don't like Trump.
[03:40:37.005 --> 03:40:39.346]  They're legitimately persecuting people that support him.
[03:40:39.346 --> 03:40:41.648]  So when I'm getting persecuted, I know I'm doing the right thing.
[03:40:41.648 --> 03:40:44.489]  I've never been persecuted like I am now for supporting Trump.
[03:40:44.489 --> 03:40:50.213]  So, he's got his problems and, you know, I'm not a Trump cult member.
[03:40:50.213 --> 03:40:54.956]  But I, I mean, I think, obviously, asking this, who would he like to replace?
[03:40:54.956 --> 03:40:57.317]  I mean, who would have been better than Trump in the last election?
[03:40:57.317 --> 03:40:58.498]  I'm not in the lesser of two evils.
[03:40:58.498 --> 03:40:59.939]  I'm just saying, my goodness.
[03:41:01.989 --> 03:41:06.490]  He's saying, in your criticism of Trump, is there another candidate that you think would be better?
[03:41:06.490 --> 03:41:09.751]  Is there anyone else better than Trump that you'd like to see or rather see?
[03:41:09.751 --> 03:41:20.533]  I think at this point, somebody like an Adam Kokesh, who would want to really deal with the debt that we're in, take us through a proper process for rectifying that debt.
[03:41:20.533 --> 03:41:25.074]  Okay, but Adam Kokesh, he's not a candidate, is he?
[03:41:25.074 --> 03:41:26.595]  Is Kokesh running in 2020?
[03:41:26.595 --> 03:41:28.415]  Yeah, he's running for not president, yeah.
[03:41:29.787 --> 03:41:36.673]  So he basically wants to basically take us through resolving the budget and then breaking things back down.
[03:41:36.673 --> 03:41:36.913]  Hold on.
[03:41:36.913 --> 03:41:38.515]  So he's running for president.
[03:41:38.515 --> 03:41:39.896]  Is he affiliated with any party?
[03:41:39.896 --> 03:41:42.038]  He's trying to get the Libertarian nomination.
[03:41:42.038 --> 03:41:42.478]  Okay.
[03:41:42.478 --> 03:41:42.818]  Okay.
[03:41:42.818 --> 03:41:45.941]  Listen, I'm talking about serious stuff here, but I understand what you're saying.
[03:41:45.941 --> 03:41:46.642]  And I like Adam.
[03:41:46.642 --> 03:41:47.602]  He's a good guy.
[03:41:47.602 --> 03:41:48.183]  All right, Owen.
[03:41:48.183 --> 03:41:48.683]  Great job.
[03:41:48.683 --> 03:41:49.944]  We'll be watching you tonight.
[03:41:49.944 --> 03:41:51.766]  We'll be tracking everything you do.
[03:41:51.766 --> 03:41:54.328]  And I take it you're going to be on the war room as well coming up here in a few minutes.
[03:41:54.328 --> 03:41:56.690]  Thank you so much.
[03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:57.371]  That's right, Alex.
[03:41:59.352 --> 03:42:03.155]  Owen Schroyer, what do folks think of the armored vehicle?
[03:42:03.155 --> 03:42:21.110]  Oh man, you know, we kind of have it, we weren't able to bring it out here where all these people are, but we have it stationed very nearby and it's going to be featured in a lot of videos coming up and everybody that either has seen it, loves it, or people are like, where's the truck, where's the truck, I gotta see the truck!
[03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:22.931]  So it's drawing a lot of attention out here.
[03:42:22.931 --> 03:42:23.932]  God bless you.
[03:42:23.932 --> 03:42:24.352]  Thank you.
[03:42:24.352 --> 03:42:25.413]  Well, we'll talk to you tonight.
[03:42:25.413 --> 03:42:27.575]  I hired a security company in Dallas that had it.
[03:42:28.635 --> 03:42:42.169]  And so, then, it would literally take over all the media events and got massive publicity for freedom and issues we were covering, and so we got the used truck, got a great deal on it, and it's just invaluable at these events, and so, Andy, if I can't get to it, they get really, really mad.
[03:42:42.169 --> 03:42:47.855]  I promise, your phone calls, when we come back, straight ahead, Daniel and others, we're going right to you, Daniel, Michael,
[03:42:48.436 --> 03:42:51.159]  Reed, Zach, Laura, Terry, Jefferson, all of you, stay with us.
[03:43:03.832 --> 03:43:16.690]  For the 12 days of Christmas, we're adding a new special every day, plus free shipping, double Patriot points, and extra stickers in every package to be good little elves and spread the info war, triggering Libtards.
[03:43:16.690 --> 03:43:19.054]  Check in every day to find the new deals.

[03:43:28.742 --> 03:43:35.027]  Buy Real Red Pill Plus and Real Red Pill at 65% off and get a free bottle of Selenium as well.
[03:43:35.027 --> 03:43:37.409]  Silver Bullet is only $9.95.
[03:43:37.409 --> 03:43:42.533]  Ultimate Female Force and Super Female Vitality Combo are at cost at $29.95.
[03:43:42.533 --> 03:43:45.275]  8-Pack Power Stack is also at cost.
[03:43:45.935 --> 03:43:55.078]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[03:43:55.078 --> 03:44:12.484]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[03:44:12.484 --> 03:44:13.825]  We're being taken off the land
[03:44:14.685 --> 03:44:25.330]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[03:44:25.330 --> 03:44:34.474]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[03:44:35.214 --> 03:44:38.557]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[03:44:38.557 --> 03:44:43.060]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[03:44:43.060 --> 03:44:44.921]  This is the post-human error.
[03:44:44.921 --> 03:44:47.684]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[03:44:47.684 --> 03:44:49.145]  This is the crossroads.
[03:44:49.145 --> 03:44:53.008]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[03:44:53.008 --> 03:44:54.749]  You want to break some globalist ribs?
[03:44:54.749 --> 03:44:56.690]  You want to crush some skulls politically?
[03:44:56.690 --> 03:45:00.213]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually?
[03:45:00.213 --> 03:45:02.255]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[03:45:02.255 --> 03:45:03.796]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[03:45:05.430 --> 03:45:08.612]  In a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:37.412]  I want to go after the globalists.
[03:45:37.412 --> 03:45:44.657]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[03:45:44.657 --> 03:45:47.679]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us.
[03:45:47.679 --> 03:45:49.361]  For myself, my family, for your family.
[03:45:49.361 --> 03:45:50.341]  Because we're in this together!
[03:45:53.973 --> 03:46:05.441]  Christmas is here, and it's time to give yourself, your family, and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.
[03:46:05.441 --> 03:46:09.503]  Now, look, there are a lot of stimulants out there that'll give you that for a while, but then burn you out.
[03:46:09.503 --> 03:46:14.347]  But if you have the foundation of what your body needs, then it takes you to the next level.
[03:46:15.027 --> 03:46:20.269]  Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus are total game-changing formulas.

[03:46:55.649 --> 03:46:58.311]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.268 --> 03:47:12.011]  Don't know much about history.
[03:47:12.011 --> 03:47:15.753]  Don't know much biology.
[03:47:15.753 --> 03:47:19.516]  Don't know much about a science book.
[03:47:19.516 --> 03:47:21.677]  Don't know much about the French I took.
[03:47:21.677 --> 03:47:25.840]  But I do know that I love you.
[03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:27.141]  That's right.
[03:47:27.141 --> 03:47:29.002]  And I know that if you love me too.
[03:47:29.002 --> 03:47:32.065]  All right, I'm going to try to jam in six, seven calls here at the end.
[03:47:32.065 --> 03:47:35.647]  So please, Jefferson, Bobby, Michael, Reed, Jack, Laura, be ready.
[03:47:35.647 --> 03:47:36.828]  I'm going to go to you and get you out of there.
[03:47:38.097 --> 03:47:41.498]  Did that collar just hang up that had been holding the longest?
[03:47:41.498 --> 03:47:43.038]  I was going to him next about the ADL.
[03:47:43.038 --> 03:47:43.778]  He just hung up.
[03:47:43.778 --> 03:47:45.138]  I'm sorry, sir.
[03:47:45.138 --> 03:47:46.439]  I was gonna go to you.
[03:47:46.439 --> 03:47:47.319]  Look at this headline.
[03:47:47.319 --> 03:47:50.399]  Monkey-pig hybrids created by Chinese scientists.
[03:47:50.399 --> 03:47:52.160]  The London Independent.
[03:47:52.160 --> 03:47:56.561]  That was done decades ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:56.561 --> 03:48:00.161]  Decades ago, and I told you about it specifically.
[03:48:00.161 --> 03:48:00.701]  Unbelievable.
[03:48:00.701 --> 03:48:02.242]  They're just bringing it all out in the open now.
[03:48:02.242 --> 03:48:03.722]  Okay, who's holding the next longest?
[03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:08.231]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in California.
[03:48:08.231 --> 03:48:11.594]  Thanks for holding.
[03:48:11.594 --> 03:48:13.095]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:13.095 --> 03:48:14.936]  Thank you, sir.
[03:48:14.936 --> 03:48:19.640]  Spiritual battle is being manifest through specific religious entities.
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:25.805]  Trump will be impeached and convicted to make room for Pence, who is a major church state guy.
[03:48:25.805 --> 03:48:30.308]  He will join hands with the Vatican, who are pushing the Green Sabbath.
[03:48:30.308 --> 03:48:31.789]  Google Green Sabbath.
[03:48:32.452 --> 03:48:38.316]  I mean, I don't think Trump is trying to sit there and tell anybody what day to worship on, so I'm confused, but I appreciate your call, Michael.
[03:48:38.316 --> 03:48:40.418]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:48:40.418 --> 03:48:40.798]  Let's talk to
[03:49:02.964 --> 03:49:04.065]  Reed in Florida.
[03:49:04.065 --> 03:49:04.766]  Reed, you're on the air.
[03:49:04.766 --> 03:49:06.989]  Go ahead.
[03:49:06.989 --> 03:49:08.611]  Hey, Alex.
[03:49:08.611 --> 03:49:22.547]  Just wanted to let you know that what Owen did was amazing, and I've never seen you guys get so much publicity ever since he's done that, and more people need to start standing up and talking out.
[03:49:23.297 --> 03:49:24.237]  Well, absolutely.
[03:49:24.237 --> 03:49:29.678]  We've had millions and millions of extra views at Band.Video, just on our own videos.
[03:49:29.678 --> 03:49:32.199]  Hundreds of millions of people ended up seeing the report.
[03:49:32.199 --> 03:49:35.959]  We've seen triple the traffic to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:49:35.959 --> 03:49:37.640]  We haven't seen any extra sales of product.
[03:49:37.640 --> 03:49:45.661]  It's our hardcore listeners that buy the product that then translates to us having the platform that reaches the other 99%.
[03:49:45.661 --> 03:49:46.902]  So, absolutely.
[03:49:46.902 --> 03:49:47.742]  Owen did a great job.
[03:49:47.742 --> 03:49:48.742]  I did not tell him to do that.
[03:49:49.599 --> 03:49:54.321]  They were supposed to go to Hershey first, then he called me the day before they left, I guess on Saturday.
[03:49:54.321 --> 03:49:55.681]  He said, hey, I think I should go to the impeachment.
[03:49:55.681 --> 03:49:56.962]  I think it's going to start Monday.
[03:49:56.962 --> 03:49:58.742]  They were holding it close to their vest.
[03:49:58.742 --> 03:50:00.323]  And he went and just did that.
[03:50:00.323 --> 03:50:03.564]  And boy, everybody else, I think, should be doing things like that.
[03:50:03.564 --> 03:50:05.585]  What do you think?
[03:50:05.585 --> 03:50:06.125]  Definitely.
[03:50:06.125 --> 03:50:09.126]  People need to start standing up and speaking out more.
[03:50:09.126 --> 03:50:15.948]  And also, you were trying to think of ideas for Infowarsstore.com.
[03:50:15.948 --> 03:50:16.849]  Did you get my head?
[03:50:16.849 --> 03:50:17.309]  I sent you.
[03:50:20.416 --> 03:50:24.139]  The 45 caliber justice.
[03:50:24.139 --> 03:50:28.121]  My, my, my wireless headset broke up right before you said 45 caliber justice.
[03:50:28.121 --> 03:50:29.582]  Say that again.
[03:50:29.582 --> 03:50:32.104]  Did you get the hat 45 caliber justice?
[03:50:32.104 --> 03:50:32.464]  I did.
[03:50:32.464 --> 03:50:34.886]  It's a, it's a black hat, right?
[03:50:34.886 --> 03:50:35.506]  Yeah.
[03:50:35.506 --> 03:50:35.747]  Yes.
[03:50:35.747 --> 03:50:39.529]  It's in there on my desk and I haven't worn it yet, but everybody likes it.
[03:50:39.529 --> 03:50:40.670]  I do intend to wear it at some point.
[03:50:41.598 --> 03:50:47.983]  Well, I'm also going to make another one that says Fake News Networks and put some other stuff on a hat for you.
[03:50:47.983 --> 03:50:49.384]  In fact, you sent the crew some other hats.
[03:50:49.384 --> 03:50:51.386]  You sent Owen one, right?
[03:50:51.386 --> 03:50:57.751]  I sent Owen one, and I also made the United America First hat for Will.
[03:50:57.751 --> 03:50:59.053]  Well, thank you so much for doing that.
[03:50:59.053 --> 03:51:01.555]  Yes, everyone loves it, and they are wearing the hats.
[03:51:01.555 --> 03:51:02.435]  Thank you so much, Reed.
[03:51:02.435 --> 03:51:02.956]  You're awesome.
[03:51:02.956 --> 03:51:03.796]  Thank you.
[03:51:03.796 --> 03:51:04.777]  Thanks for holding.
[03:51:04.777 --> 03:51:05.538]  What a trooper.
[03:51:05.538 --> 03:51:07.960]  Okay, Laura in Alabama, thank you for holding.
[03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:08.921]  Then Jefferson, go ahead.
[03:51:10.396 --> 03:51:11.156]  Great show, Alex.
[03:51:11.156 --> 03:51:11.956]  I'll try to be brief.
[03:51:11.956 --> 03:51:12.817]  I know you're trying to get through.
[03:51:12.817 --> 03:51:13.097]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:51:13.097 --> 03:51:13.877]  I think we'll get everybody here.
[03:51:13.877 --> 03:51:14.117]  Go ahead.
[03:51:14.117 --> 03:51:15.797]  All right.
[03:51:15.797 --> 03:51:23.479]  I do want to give a shout out to my favorite products, X2, X3, Besa Beats, and especially TurboForce.
[03:51:23.479 --> 03:51:27.159]  I put those two into TurboForce and drink it every morning.
[03:51:27.159 --> 03:51:28.280]  I only use a half a pack.
[03:51:28.280 --> 03:51:29.100]  That's all I need.
[03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:29.560]  Yes.
[03:51:29.560 --> 03:51:32.921]  And I noticed it started disappearing quickly or more quickly.
[03:51:32.921 --> 03:51:36.121]  And I discovered that my husband now has a TurboForce habit.
[03:51:36.121 --> 03:51:40.002]  And I'm going to have to order twice a month instead of once a month because he has decided that
[03:51:40.549 --> 03:51:41.630]  He loves the energy.
[03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:45.852]  So, I was trying to keep it a secret so I wouldn't have to buy more, but I'm going to.
[03:51:45.852 --> 03:51:47.533]  Thank you.
[03:51:47.533 --> 03:51:49.354]  So, my favorite products.
[03:51:49.354 --> 03:51:50.374]  Love them.
[03:51:50.374 --> 03:51:52.895]  And I wanted to mention two things.
[03:51:52.895 --> 03:51:55.257]  One, what Owen was doing was demonstrating leadership.
[03:51:55.257 --> 03:51:57.418]  He was showing us what we need to do.
[03:51:57.418 --> 03:51:59.299]  And I love to see that out of this generation.
[03:51:59.299 --> 03:52:03.721]  He is a millennial and so many disappointing things come from that generation.
[03:52:03.721 --> 03:52:05.662]  He's like a bright and shining star.
[03:52:05.662 --> 03:52:06.482]  I love it.
[03:52:06.482 --> 03:52:08.083]  He's showing us what we need to be doing.
[03:52:08.083 --> 03:52:09.544]  It's not heroism, it's leadership.
[03:52:10.063 --> 03:52:18.145]  And we all just need to, you know... You're right, it's not heroism, it's leadership, which is getting people to see an example and do the right thing.
[03:52:18.145 --> 03:52:34.249]  Of course people should be confronting these criminals, and not to stop their fake vote, to show what frauds they are, and not let them go unanswered, because they're censoring the American people, and the Democrats are directing the censorship from those congressional hearings against this very operation.
[03:52:34.249 --> 03:52:36.890]  Owen had an absolute right and duty to do what he did.
[03:52:37.310 --> 03:52:37.690]  I agree.
[03:52:37.690 --> 03:52:41.571]  And the second thing is, I've seen articles written about how some Republicans may defect and vote against Trump.
[03:53:01.414 --> 03:53:08.197]  And they've tried to balance it out with, oh, there's going to be some Democrats that vote for him in the Senate, specifically about the Senate battle.
[03:53:08.197 --> 03:53:11.999]  And they point out several, one of which is Doug Jones in Alabama.
[03:53:11.999 --> 03:53:16.281]  I can tell you right now, living here, Doug Jones knows he's not getting elected again.
[03:53:16.281 --> 03:53:18.882]  It was a fluke how he got elected in that special election.
[03:53:18.882 --> 03:53:20.023]  It was a big fluke.
[03:53:20.023 --> 03:53:21.224]  He won't get elected again.
[03:53:21.224 --> 03:53:26.406]  The next Republican runner will run away, but he has no chance.
[03:53:26.406 --> 03:53:27.106]  And he knows this.
[03:53:28.982 --> 03:53:34.234]  I would not bet that he's going to vote just because we're a red state that he's going to vote with Trump.
[03:53:34.234 --> 03:53:34.915]  Do not count on that.
[03:53:35.672 --> 03:53:36.212]  I agree with you.
[03:53:36.212 --> 03:53:39.374]  We're going to see every arm twisted, every trick pulled out.
[03:53:39.374 --> 03:53:41.194]  We're going to see blackmail, payoffs.
[03:53:41.194 --> 03:53:43.355]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:53:43.355 --> 03:53:48.617]  And they're going to have a bunch of big scandals that break during the trial in the Senate.
[03:53:48.617 --> 03:53:49.638]  Just watch.
[03:53:49.638 --> 03:53:50.758]  They're making their move.
[03:53:50.758 --> 03:53:52.219]  Civil unrest, everything.
[03:53:52.219 --> 03:53:53.420]  Doesn't mean they're going to win.
[03:53:53.420 --> 03:53:57.021]  Not saying they'll remove him, but he's in more danger than people think.
[03:53:57.021 --> 03:54:01.323]  I can intellectually see it, but at a spiritual level, I can feel it.
[03:54:01.323 --> 03:54:02.303]  Thank you so much, Laura.
[03:54:02.303 --> 03:54:02.743]  Great call.
[03:54:02.743 --> 03:54:03.764]  All these calls are amazing.
[03:54:04.244 --> 03:54:06.525]  Okay, up next, let's talk to Jefferson in Virginia.
[03:54:06.525 --> 03:54:08.746]  Welcome, Jefferson.
[03:54:08.746 --> 03:54:09.967]  Hey Alex, great show today.
[03:54:09.967 --> 03:54:12.988]  Thank you.
[03:54:12.988 --> 03:54:22.412]  Joseph from Ireland called in to say that the first priority for Trump should be to make sure that the electronic voting machines are not owned by foreign companies, and I think that's correct.
[03:54:22.412 --> 03:54:24.133]  Yeah, you just saw what happened in Virginia.
[03:54:24.133 --> 03:54:25.454]  I mean, you know they stole that from you.
[03:54:26.579 --> 03:54:41.431]  Right, and the problem is if he makes that public announcement that he won't accept the results of an election that's coming up in 2020, if the machines are owned by foreigners... Sir, what I was saying is, what does he do to bring attention to this?
[03:54:41.431 --> 03:54:53.040]  Well, I asked David Knight six months ago, I said, if the president announced that all ballots had to be on paper and counted by scanning machines rather than by electronic voting machines, would InfoWars support that announcement?
[03:54:53.726 --> 03:54:54.987]  And that policy.
[03:54:54.987 --> 03:54:57.489]  And even David Knight was hesitant to believe.
[03:54:57.489 --> 03:55:04.814]  I know the Scantrons are better than the totally digital because you can tally them at the local level and then post that and then add the tallies up.
[03:55:04.814 --> 03:55:12.719]  So Scantron, as long as it's done locally and then tallied at the precinct level and then sent on, is a lot better than what we currently have.
[03:55:12.719 --> 03:55:17.803]  Right, so the alternative is what we have to come up with because otherwise he's going to get the clarity.
[03:55:17.803 --> 03:55:18.243]  No, I agree.
[03:55:18.243 --> 03:55:22.246]  Scantron paper ballots are a lot better as long as they're tabulated at the local level and then added together.
[03:55:23.203 --> 03:55:23.743]  Alright.
[03:55:23.743 --> 03:55:30.247]  And I think I saw Steph Curry wearing one of your OK Black Hand OK sign hats on television.
[03:55:30.247 --> 03:55:30.868]  And I'm dumb.
[03:55:30.868 --> 03:55:32.509]  Who's Steph Curry?
[03:55:32.509 --> 03:55:34.390]  Steph Curry with the Golden State Warriors.
[03:55:35.575 --> 03:55:36.476]  Oh, interesting.
[03:55:36.476 --> 03:55:37.377]  Well, that's a good hat.
[03:55:37.377 --> 03:55:38.218]  People really like it.
[03:55:38.218 --> 03:55:40.000]  They're trying to destroy symbols.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:42.522]  And now they're saying a tailored suit is Nazi.
[03:55:42.522 --> 03:55:46.146]  Seriously, not just the OK sign, not just the bro fist.
[03:55:46.146 --> 03:55:48.248]  I think black folks invented.
[03:55:48.248 --> 03:55:50.250]  But now a tailored suit, Owen, is a Nazi.
[03:55:50.250 --> 03:55:51.711]  Thank you so much, Jefferson.
[03:55:51.711 --> 03:55:53.473]  OK, real quick, Zach in Missouri.
[03:55:53.473 --> 03:55:54.074]  Zach, thank you.
[03:55:55.200 --> 03:55:56.401]  Alex, how you doing, man?
[03:55:56.401 --> 03:56:01.945]  We here in Missouri are proud of our boy, Owen Schroyer, for calling out Nadler in the Deep State Cup.
[03:56:01.945 --> 03:56:06.429]  I'm telling you, man, the Show Me State, we need more of what's growing.
[03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:09.531]  Owen Schroyer, as I tell you, we're proud of him, aren't you?
[03:56:09.531 --> 03:56:11.973]  We need more Patriots to do this, man.
[03:56:11.973 --> 03:56:17.337]  All that stuff they pulled for Kavanaugh, going to everybody protesting, we need more of that.
[03:56:17.337 --> 03:56:19.399]  Owen Schroyer, we are so proud.
[03:56:19.399 --> 03:56:23.622]  Whatever they've been putting in the water to make the other men soyboys, Owen didn't get enough of it.
[03:56:24.468 --> 03:56:25.849]  Holy moly!
[03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:26.909]  I tell you what, man.
[03:56:26.909 --> 03:56:32.491]  All the products I buy from you, it just makes me the ultimate alpha male and I am ready to go, man.
[03:56:32.491 --> 03:56:34.112]  Oh yeah, these products aren't a game, Zach.
[03:56:34.112 --> 03:56:34.392]  Love you.
[03:56:34.392 --> 03:56:35.473]  I'm gonna get Bobby in at the last.
[03:56:35.473 --> 03:56:36.233]  I apologize.
[03:56:36.233 --> 03:56:37.593]  And I'll be on tonight for you.
[03:56:37.593 --> 03:56:38.934]  6, right through the rally.
[03:56:38.934 --> 03:56:40.935]  Please join us and please spread the word about the feeds.
[03:56:40.935 --> 03:56:42.215]  That's how we go mega viral.
[03:56:42.215 --> 03:56:43.596]  Bobby, in California, real fast.
[03:56:43.596 --> 03:56:44.416]  You be our tail gunner.
[03:56:44.416 --> 03:56:50.579]  Alright, first of all, I challenge all your listeners to get the Bio PCA hair, skin, and nails.
[03:56:51.721 --> 03:56:56.345]  And also your organic peppermint, if they're worried about hair loss.
[03:56:56.345 --> 03:56:59.246]  The peppermint mixed with water, put it in your hair.
[03:56:59.246 --> 03:57:03.549]  But what I was really calling for is hospital infections.
[03:57:03.549 --> 03:57:09.593]  They admit there's over 100,000 hospital infections, but it's more than 20 times that.
[03:57:09.593 --> 03:57:18.259]  And with studies, they found if they replace all the copper, if they replace all the plastic with copper, 95% reduction.
[03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:32.665]  Absolutely, and again, in between the opiates and the hospital diseases, it's killing everybody, and that's what I'm most afraid of for my children, and I just pray to God we get control of all this, because the flesh-eating bacteria and all of it's so deadly.
[03:57:32.665 --> 03:57:33.546]  God bless you, Bobby.
[03:57:33.546 --> 03:57:34.507]  Incredible show.
[03:57:34.507 --> 03:57:41.015]  Took more calls on that show than we've taken in years, and I promise you tonight, after the war room, 6, right through the thing, we're gonna take a ton of calls.
