[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  What did Jonathan Gruber say three years ago on C-Span?
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  He said, thank God the public has no attention span and thank God you're so stupid.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  They know you get busy taking care of your family, paying your bills, getting your car fixed, taking the cat to the vet.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  They know that. The reason they hate InfoWars.com.
[00:50.000 --> 01:01.000]  The reason they hate you and just the listeners and researchers on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else is we remember things and we go back and we get it.
[01:02.000 --> 01:13.000]  And they think we're so dumb that during the campaign, the last four or five months of the campaign, going back a year ago, and right through to the inauguration when he was president-elect,
[01:13.000 --> 01:29.000]  MSM was all over the place. Every newspaper, every control corporate news network saying, we have the wiretaps. You're a Russian agent, Trump.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  And then Trump said, well, that's illegal. And it's also illegal to leak that.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  I'm going to prosecute you. And they went, oh, we never did it. We never did it. It doesn't exist. It's not happening.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  And then they attacked us because they knew full well InfoWars got to the president's desk.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  So did Drudge. So did Breitbart. That's all in an Associated Press article about it.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  And they're so proud of themselves in the AP going back a few months ago. Well, it was caught at the president's desk.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  InfoWars had a screenshot of the New York Times and misrepresented what was entered to the president, but we're stopping that getting to him now.
[02:14.000 --> 02:27.000]  Over and over again about the illegals voting, which they now admit, the carbon taxes, the TPP, all of it, we're right. They're wrong.
[02:30.000 --> 02:39.000]  And so we remembered that they had been saying they were spying on him in hundreds and hundreds of articles and that Obama was transferring all the secret data to the news in the last week.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  So he was in office to make sure Trump couldn't cover up what he'd really done.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  But there was nothing there, just like there was nothing in the Comey memo.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Later they admitted there was no perjury or subordination of perjury or anything.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  Comey said was in the memo. And then we learned he was the one that leaked it, even though he testified that he wasn't the one.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  So a little bird told me that Comey is one millimeter from being indicted.
[03:04.000 --> 03:20.000]  A little bird also told me that two days ago, and one of those little birds is going to join us, Roger Stone, who obviously was former business partners with Manafort, that they were told last week, you are indicted.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  Now, Roger wanted to wait till today to break that.
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  So the Daily Caller halfway scooped it, which is fine with me, saying he's been told that they're bringing an indictment to the grand jury.
[03:31.000 --> 03:44.000]  No, no, no, this is a kept grand jury in the District of Criminals, total swamp things, and Mueller already told him, you better make up some stuff about Trump, you better turn against him, or we're going to burn you.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  We've already got the indictment, is what he was told. We got the indictment.
[03:49.000 --> 03:59.000]  It's not, oh, we're going to get one to the grand jury and ask them to look at inditing. No, no, no, no. They've got the indictment before they ever talked to the grand jury.
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  Mueller pulled out of his rear end, just like everything else he does, covering up the crimes of the Clintons, the Bushes, the Deep State. What a swamp thing.
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  No mama, no mania, no problems. Mueller reportedly plans to indict Manafort. No, they've told him, you are indicted.
[04:16.000 --> 04:30.000]  Let's go out to break with CNN. Oh, Trump may have been right about being spied on. No, he wasn't maybe right. He was right all along because it's a public fact. Here it is.
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  The Justice Department has publicly denied the president's own lines were wire tapped. As you'll recall, he tweeted out months ago that President Obama had his wires tapped.
[04:40.000 --> 04:53.000]  The Justice Department has come out and said, that's not true. But what is possible, Don, is that he was picked up on the Manafort surveillance and we should note that Manafort does have a residence in Trump Tower.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  So now they're trying to cover up.
[04:56.000 --> 05:14.000]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[05:14.000 --> 05:30.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States. Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency? Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people? Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:39.000 --> 05:48.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people. Join the InfoWars.

[08:21.000 --> 08:48.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got some of the biggest crow eating going on by the fake news combine over at Politifact.
[08:48.000 --> 08:57.000]  Fact over at CNN, over at the New York Times, turns out Trump Tower was wire tapped like a Christmas tree.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  And specifically who we said was being wire tapped was wire tapped, Paul Manafort.
[09:04.000 --> 09:14.000]  In his conversations with Roger Stone and the president, just like we told you back in January of this year.
[09:14.000 --> 09:27.000]  And it was all illegal. It was all done politically by the Obama slash Clinton Democratic Party Loretta Lynch, meaning on the tarmac crime syndicate.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  Oh, look, CNN's giving us the exclusive last night. Let's put it back up on screen for TV viewers. Exclusive.
[09:36.000 --> 09:48.000]  U.S. government wire tapped former Trump campaign chairman. We probably wrote 50 articles about that back at the time.
[09:49.000 --> 10:01.000]  Just because it was so flagrant how mainstream media was specifically lying when a month before they were in every paper, every TV show going.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  We've got NSA wiretaps. We got just department wiretaps. We got Trump getting money from the Russians. We got them with foreign banks.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  We've got them totally controlled. We've got wiretaps on stone. We've got wiretaps on Manafort in the January 20th article in the New York Times.
[10:18.000 --> 10:31.000]  Because I was in D.C. for the inauguration that morning reading it over coffee and I interviewed Stone at the inauguration about it. Live.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  And it said we've got wiretaps with Stone getting money and being directed by the Russians.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  Later it came out, ladies and gentlemen, they had zero. Just like the Comey memo had nothing in it, he claimed. Trump didn't do any of the things he said.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  And Comey then told Congress there was nothing in it. But then later told the New York Times when he leaked it that there was stuff there.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  Then he went back to Congress again and said that Trump basically was trying to obstruct. He's all over the map.
[11:02.000 --> 11:16.000]  So now CNN has been forced to come out and just halfway let it slide out that okay, Trump was right because Manafort did have an apartment in Trump Tower in New York.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  And he was being wiretapped because they're getting ready to try to use those wiretaps in the indictment of Manafort.
[11:24.000 --> 11:37.000]  I learned two days ago that Manafort's lawyers talked to our sources and said indeed Manafort has been told you are indicted.
[11:38.000 --> 11:45.000]  Not what we're seeing in the news today that Mueller intends to indict, but he has to do that through a grand jury.
[11:45.000 --> 11:59.000]  He's not judge jury and executioner, but it's a swamp thing, district of criminals creation. I mean the jury's made up of alligators, crocodiles, boa constrictors, and other creatures.
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  There they are, a thoroughbred swamp federal grand jury directly out of the district of criminals, handpicked.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  And so now they've got their evidence of Manafort and it's nothing to do with Russians.
[12:15.000 --> 12:26.000]  Supposedly they found business dealings going back a decade ago that maybe didn't get declared on the right forms because he had some offshore bank accounts which all the globalists have and which they say are legal.
[12:26.000 --> 12:40.000]  But if they find any of your forms filled out wrong, just like your IRS form says, penalty of perjury, you make a $1 mistake. Federal law says seven years in the federal pen you'll serve six and a half.
[12:41.000 --> 12:53.000]  Seven years in the federal pen you get one number wrong and you waive your rights to the Fourth Amendment, you waive your rights to a jury, you waive your rights when you sign that IRS form.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  So that's where they're going and they've told him.
[12:59.000 --> 13:14.000]  You burn Trump and make up stuff and start singing like a canary or we're going to throw you in prison and we're going to chain you up in the back of a federal vehicle and we're going to diesel you until your toes pop, until your hind end comes out.
[13:14.000 --> 13:25.000]  You got hemorrhoids bigger than hot dogs. That's what they do. They've already told him we're going to torture you. You're basically dead if you don't start lying right now.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  That's our loving FBI under the Clinton crime wave.
[13:31.000 --> 13:41.000]  That's these thugs that are openly censoring the internet and openly going after everybody. Then they can push the country and everybody else around forever.
[13:41.000 --> 13:51.000]  When they're so corrupt, when they're so out of control, they're dirtier than Satan's forked tail.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  They're dirtier than while I'm into gross analogies, the Satan's rear end.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  And then they sit there and they look at Trump and all his associates and all the renters and all the golf club members are all being told you're under criminal investigation.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Hoping they dump their memberships, trying to ruin Trump financially, stalking, terrorism, harassment.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  And I get to enjoy it all myself as well. Doesn't intimidate me. It makes me know this is war.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  So again, why are we attacked? Why are we demonized? Why are we hated? Because we're real.
[14:26.000 --> 14:37.000]  And it's true. Info wars, drugs report and Breitbart were all put on Trump's desk.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  And all Breitbart info wars and drugs did was link to pundits, Pelosi, Waters, others before January of this year when they were all going, we got the wiretaps, we got the proof.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  Putin tells him everything. Putin tells him drain the swamp. Putin told him the word crooked Hillary.
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  It's made up. Oh, let me get my call right now. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, yes, Putin. Call it info wars. Oh, okay.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Hillary for prison 2016. Thanks for the idea. Because, you know, I have to read off teleprompters. I'm not an original person.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  I got to have Vladimir Putin. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll get it done right now.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  So they're all saying they did this. Didn't we call their bluff? There's nothing in any of these communiques.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  So now they're having to come out and say, okay, it's true. We were spying on Trump.
[15:23.000 --> 15:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we broke via Sheriff Arpaio's operation a data dump that was brought to the feds and ignored where Obama for eight years was spying on everything Donald Trump did.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  They knew he was planning to run for president. They knew he was a closet conservative patriot. They knew he was a populist.
[15:41.000 --> 15:50.000]  And guess who else is in there? There's thousands of names. Alex Jones. And when I looked at it, it was my old private number I had at my last office.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  They even had that listed on there.
[15:54.000 --> 16:02.000]  Of what was being surveilled 24 hours a day, if agents wanted to then of any agency go into the file and listen to everything I'd done.
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  They had my cell phone, my backup phone, my wife's phone, my office phone, I never even used except for radio interviews.
[16:09.000 --> 16:18.000]  They had Trump's private numbers. I had the Marlargo number to his private apartment would never even dare call it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Never even called it.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  Even though I'd gotten a call off of it, and asked Roger, what's this number? That's his private apartment, buddy. Nobody gets that.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm reading the NSA deal. There's his number to his private apartment. He doesn't have the whole Marlargo area.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  He just got like a three-bedroom apartment.
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.000]  This is the type of garbage that we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen. That article's up on infowars.com.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  The NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  Remember James Comey lied to Congress and said, that's ridiculous. That's crazy, he said.
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  That's when Trump decided to fire him, by the way. He laughed at Trump and said, I'm going to play the clip. That's crazy.
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.000]  That's crazy that anybody spied on Trump ever.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  And then through the campaign, through the last days, remember Obama was in the news saying, we're not going to let him get away,
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  whether we're giving all the secret data to the news and to others, and we're putting a fifth column in government to block him.
[17:20.000 --> 17:28.000]  They admitted their whole plan before they left. They set up law firms to sue everybody. They're suing Sernovich. They're suing Roger Stone.
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  Oh yeah, new stuff with Sernovich, we'll tell you about. They're coming after everybody because they're thugs,
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  and they know they're thugs, and they know they're dirtbags scum.
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  And finally, people are calling their bluff, high noon, out in the square politically.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  So here's CNN, forced to admit Trump may have been right about being wiretapped.
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  They have the big world exclusive CNN reported in a year ago, and it was true.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  Then they think we have no memory months later and say we're crazy. Here's the clip.
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  The Justice Department has publicly denied the president's own lines were wiretapped.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  As you'll recall, he tweeted out months ago that President Obama had his wires tapped.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  The Justice Department has come out and said, that's not true. But what is possible, Don, is that he was picked up on the Manafort surveillance,
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  and we should note that Manafort does have a residence in Trump Tower.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  Okay, so there you go. And then now they're admitting it. All right, there was some wiretapping, and the NSA was spying as well,
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  and basically everybody was spying on him. Now let's go to the next clip here, just as a memory hole.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  This is back in March. CNN, New York Times blame Alex Jones for Trump wiretap claims.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  So see, memory hole. We're going back what Gruber hates, the guy that wrote Obamacare.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  He said, thank God you're dumb. Thank God you have no memory. Well, I know you're not dumb and you do have a memory,
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  but we're going to bring back the clip for everybody. And there's a bunch of these clips of them saying we're insane.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  The New York Times never reported this, even though they did, and you can read their articles.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  But again, they hope you don't go back and look at the article. They don't show the article. They think you're stupid.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  They're betting everything on you being a moron, and they've been proven to be big fat liars yet again. Here it is.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point, because we've said it very clearly, and I said on your show,
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  that that's not what the story said. Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped,
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  which developed on the kind of fringe right wing media.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Yeah, fringe right wing media. There's the New York Times right there.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  After his tweet storm, Infowars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story,
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  is reading our story. And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing Infowars.
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right wing fringe theory,
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  both of which there's no evidence to support.
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.000]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump, correct?
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  Nothing. I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story that we would be rushing.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  I would not be sitting here with you. I'd be at home writing it or out reporting it.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  We said that there were intercepted communications.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  You said there were intercepted communications.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  That was on the NSA and that was illegal as well.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  And Clapper, the former head of all intelligence,
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  who got up in front of Congress years ago and said no one in the U.S. has ever been spied on by the NSA.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  That's like saying no fish has ever swam in a lake or ocean or creek.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  Fish live in the sky and pigs live on the moon and ostriches live on the sun.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  And Hillary Clinton is a beautiful woman and not corrupt.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  And James Cummings is a great guy too.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  And the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus are real.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  So, there you go.
[21:25.000 --> 21:33.000]  It's just simply amazing that they now come out and go, yeah, we're getting ready to indict Manafort.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And behind the scenes, how you say you are indicted.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  You make stuff up or we're going to torture you to death basically.
[21:41.000 --> 21:51.000]  And this is just some random group set up by Hillary and Obama with Mueller just running around, foaming at the mouth, totally corrupt.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  And all of Hillary's legions of crimes, nothing's done about it.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  But boy, we can find a wart on Manafort's elbow.
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.000]  We are going to just absolutely throw him to the wolves until he makes something up, but then he won't.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  See, that's how that works.
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.000]  That's why you guys are up the creek so far and everybody sees what a pack of lying, arrogant conmen you are.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  You look at that New York Times reporter, you look at that CIA operative, and by the way, both of them are CIA.
[22:26.000 --> 22:34.000]  You look at these slimebag blue blood elitist, coastal elites, preying on the audience, thinking they're idiots.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  They don't have an audience of idiots, they have an audience of fellow travelers who are mental patients and feel like they're part of this leftist takeover
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  and who want the talking points to go out and repeat them.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  I mean, let me let CNN know something, your own viewers by and large aren't even conned anymore.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  They're just on board with you.
[22:55.000 --> 23:02.000]  We go out and ask folks and they go, well, we're moving on from the Russian narrative, the racism narrative, and then we're going to go back to the other narrative later.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  And they know it's all bull.
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.000]  Liberals know conservatives and constitutionalist and Christians are very moral and are anti-racist on average.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  That's why they hit us with it all day because they know it's not true.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  They've all got borderline personality disorder, basically, where they project onto you what they are.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  And I finally understand that going out to all these rallies, mainline Democrat rallies, they are conscious scum.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  They know their liars.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  They know capitalism works.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  They don't care.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  They want to wreck stuff and run it.
[23:39.000 --> 23:47.000]  To a man, they're either smug, inbred, elitist sociopaths, psychopaths, or they're just ugly people.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  It's true.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  They're ugly and they love misery and misery loves company.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  That's it.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  Just once you understand that it all makes sense.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  They're bad people.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  They're race baiters.
[24:02.000 --> 24:02.000]  They're racist.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  They use race to control.
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  I've got a clip coming up of one of the top pediatric vaccine controllers in the state at a World UN meeting in Houston saying,
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  we're going to make the public totally submit the vaccines and she goes,
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  the problem's white people and we need to kill all the white people.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  And everybody sits there and nods their head and they're all white.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  You know what I keep telling you, it's weird cults of white people.
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  I've got Green Party Germany, Green Party UK saying soon all the whites will be gone.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  I've got all the U.N. saying it.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  I mean, this is a weird group of people, man.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  This is some whacked out stuff and it's true.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  Anglo-Saxons and Western Europeans have always fought tyranny and have never been able to be conquered by the Romans or anybody else.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  And there's just something about us and they don't like it.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  And it's white people that know that.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  It's a white superclass of controllers and the one of the minions that sit around talking about,
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  don't worry, we're brain damaging all the third world.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  And we're going to get the whites in the end.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  We may have to kill every single one of them.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  They're all sitting there nodding their heads.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  So I told you, they get these doctors in these training meetings.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  We've got the training manuals.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  They say yes, vaccines kill large numbers.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  They cause brain damage.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  They cause type 1 diabetes.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  They cause it all.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  They try to cover it up because it's part of the greater science and the greater good.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  But the statistics show it's not.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  And they know the vaccines are dirty and they know the vaccine makers have protection and they're paid to do it.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And it's eugenics and they know what they're doing.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  And she says, I'm proud to be a minority white person in Houston and I'm proud of the diversity.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  And it's time to kill all the white people.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Videos on infowars.com.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  I'm not exaggerating.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  You see, they're coming out, folks.
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  Every day I've got professors saying genocide all the whites.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  Every day, it's a total plan.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  I told you, in in-game, the eugenicists target who they believe is their number one threat.
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.000]  And they believe western culture and European ethos is the threat.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  It's really wiped out.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  And you go, yeah, but they're almost all white.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  That's the thing.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  They want to wipe everybody out.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  They talk about how good the minorities are and how they want their shots.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  No, they don't.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Then she lies and says, oh, and there's less infectious disease in Mexico than there is here.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  I mean, it's really whacked out.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  But the Mexicans, they love their shots.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  Oh, all little girls get their gargles shot.
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  On the insert says, can sterilize you.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, white, polka-dotted.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  I care about you and love you because I got empathy and we're going to win together.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  And these people are going to fail.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  We're getting their number.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  We're figuring out who they are.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  They're so evil, it's hard to comprehend, I understand.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  But once you just realize they're total evil and study them, it just gets more fantastic.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  I've got them also at one of the same conferences saying blacks have bad gene pools and so do Hispanics.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  They have to be exterminated.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  The vaccines.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  They actually say it on tape.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  That's an in-game.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  They're just like, what the hell?
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  They just want to kill everybody.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  I mean, you got that?
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  Now, she said she wants to kill all the white people.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  I'm going to play the clip.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  But since I mentioned all this, when we come back, Hillary won't rule out overturning the 2016 election.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  That's a new video.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  I told you that's coming.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  She's also demonizing me.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  Coming out saying that it's unbalanced, that there's too much info wars and that mainstream media needs more money and more investment.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  They've got all the Hollywood, all the MSM, all the major comedians, all the news channels, all of it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  And they're saying info wars is dangerous and that she needs more funding and we need to invest because they're outnumbered.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  But by the truth, by memory, dirt bag, that I remember who you are, I know what you've done, I know what you stand for.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  I understand your operation and you can't stand it.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  And we've got more on the bombshell folks and as libertarians and patriots and conservatives and Christians, we don't like to brag, but it didn't brag against an info war.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  We were right about the wiretapping.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  We were right about the whole thing.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  They now have to admit it because they're getting ready to use it in court.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  Illegal political wiretapping that makes Nixon look like a choir boy.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  That's all coming up.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  We've got loaded guests today.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Massive censorship intensifying.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  I mean, the war is on.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  We got Comey lying saying nobody was being spot on.
[28:35.000 --> 28:35.000]  We got everything.
[28:36.000 --> 28:36.000]  We got Clapper.
[28:37.000 --> 28:37.000]  We got Brennan.
[28:38.000 --> 28:38.000]  We got the Justice Department.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  We all got a pack of liars that think they're going to defeat America and they're not because America's better than you scumbags.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  You're a big trophy hunter like these eugenicists racist.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  You don't want to just mount the black people's head on your wall.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  You want to mount the white people's heads on the wall that are virtuous and aren't like you vampires.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  We're going to get you.
[29:03.000 --> 29:03.000]  I know we are.
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  Be angry.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  We're going to break their will.
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  You're not breaking our will.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  They can feel our will.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  That's why they're scared right now.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  You will never break my will.
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  You will never break my will.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  Indeed.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  Yeah.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  Yeah.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  Now
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  It's about to sell out.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  The good news is we get more in next month.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  K-man ultimate Paleo formula.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  Total meal replacement.
[29:35.000 --> 29:35.940]  Chaga Mushroom
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  Concentrated Organic.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Bepawn so much more with the concentrated bone broth.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  Try it for yourself in chocolate and strawberry.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  They're both about to sell out 50% off.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  I'm still keeping it at that info wars live.com.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  We need your support now.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  Commision fund us!
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march!
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  Ah yes!
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  Yes Hillary, feel my dark heart.
[29:56.000 --> 29:58.000]  It's the opposite of that, isn't it?
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights wrote,
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  where in excess of power prevails,
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  property of no sort is duly respected.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  No man is safe in his opinions,
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  in his person, in his faculties,
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  or in his possessions.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  Is there any question that we have in excess of power in Washington?
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  And how do we remove that power,
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  from Washington to our local communities,
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  to the individual?
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  That is the ultimate concern.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  It was why the Anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  to abuse that concentration of power,
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  but as James Madison also pointed out,
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  A people who mean to be their own governors,
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[30:57.000 --> 31:13.000]  FriendForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  like canning or dehydrating,
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  you know like what you get at the grocery store,
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  there is no comparison.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  color, and nutritional value,
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best,
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  most affordable freeze dryer.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  What are you waiting for?
[31:58.000 --> 32:27.000]  FriendForWars.com
[32:28.000 --> 32:41.000]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.000]  Alright, well I'm glad we got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  It just came back in yesterday, LivingDefense.infoWarsLife.com
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:26.000 --> 33:35.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.000]  And when I tell you that Mueller is engaged in criminal activities,
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  even CNN, even the New York Times, even the Washington Post,
[33:42.000 --> 33:49.000]  even Fox News is asking the question whether special counsel Robert Mueller's aggressive tactics are appropriate.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  I've got that on screen right now from Fox News, your radio listener.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  They broke in Manafort's house with a SWAT team,
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  even though he'd already given the committee, they admitted everything they asked for.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  They took out all his clothes, his underwear, his Italian suits, nobody knows this.
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  Roger Stone's basically best friends with him.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  I don't know, Andrew DePaulitano might be his best friend,
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  and then there's Manafort, then there's Trump.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  But boy, did they fight to keep Trump from calling Roger,
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  but they've not been successful so far, I'll just leave it at that.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  And they're flipping out over it, and they went through all his underwear, all his shirts.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  They took photographs of his wife's things.
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  Everything in the house was photographed.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  Everything.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  Because they could find one gift or something that somebody gave them,
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  even if it's $10, but that wasn't put on an IRS form,
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  they're going to take him and drive him around in an 18-wheeler prisoner transfer vehicle
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  until his feet burst, it's called dieseling.
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.000]  They drive you 18 hours every day, take you off for six hours, and then continue the torture.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  They do that to congressmen and other folks like Congressman Hanson.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  It's a special treatment they get, that's why Congress is so scared,
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  it's why people are so scared, is they have special units that carry out the torture.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  And they've told him, we're going to torture you if you don't lie about Trump.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  And Manafort has not lied about Trump.
[35:19.000 --> 35:25.000]  And so Mueller, with using just total criminal activities, admittedly,
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  search warrant said you can find bank statements and emails and anything related to the election.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Going back four years, even though the election wasn't going back that far.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  It doesn't matter. Everything in the house was there.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  They came in with machine guns, cussed at them, pushed them to the ground,
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  sent a real nasty team of liberal communists in.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  They have special hand-picked teams.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Of course, under the Clintons and under Obama, just to shake him up.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  And now there's the threats.
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  You can go scot-free right now, but you give us the goods.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  And what are the goods, may I ask?
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  Donald Trump is a communist and got all his money from the Russians,
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  and you were financed by the Russians.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  And Manafort's like, that's preposterous.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  I've been working for the U.S. government all along,
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  putting in pro-America regimes all over the world, and you know that.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's just like some of the other people they've been put on the news.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  It turns out they're CIA.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  They're like, you were in Russia in 1990 to 1993.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  Yeah, for the CIA keeping Yeltsin in power, and they go, oh, oh, oh.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  Still, we think you were a Russian double agent. What?
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.000]  So that's the level of nasty lying that's going on.
[36:42.000 --> 36:50.000]  I happen to do my homework. I happen to have my sources.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  And that's why they hate us.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's because Pew Research, George Washington Mason University,
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  now Harvard and Yale, came out and said in the 2014 election,
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  5.7 million illegals voted in the names of dead people.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  They just ran the names of dead people from the previous decade
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  who were on voting rolls and then confirmed it was either illegals
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  or people just voting illegally.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  And then now the Democrats are all over the country legalizing it
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  in sanctuary cities for illegals to vote.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  They got, what, 15 cities in California, nine in Illinois,
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  seven in Maryland, as of last week.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  And now it's a domino. So, yes, I covered Pew Research,
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  put an article out, drug linked to it.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  Trump saw it. Trump retweeted it.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  And they go, oh, you're getting your info from Alex Jones.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  Your info from me, yes, studied, focused, dedicated.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  But 99% of our information comes directly from documents
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  or credible news articles or sources.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  And now we know it wasn't 3.5 like Trump thought.
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  That was 2014. The numbers just came out from a Harvard study
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  and it was over 7 million are projected to have voted in 2016 illegally.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  Well, the DEMOC, we have three of the top Democrats on video
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  saying we're going to steal this effing election, screw the public,
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  we're going in, we got each person voting 10 times,
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  nothing can stop us. I mean, they're on the news saying,
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  Obama said go out and vote as many times as you can.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Told illegals it's part of your duty to go vote.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  That's what they're doing.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  Then they look at us and say, we don't have any illegals voting.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  That's insane.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  It's just mind blowing.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  So, we're here studying things.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  We're here trying to tell the truth and doing a darn good job of it.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  The globalists, on the other hand, they don't know what to do
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  because they've lied and lied and lied and it's not working.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  So now they're beyond doubling down.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  They're becoming nothing but disruptive. CNN knows you hate them.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  The New York Times knows you hate them.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  They know the only people reading them are people that know it's a lie
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  and are fellow travelers with the fraud and want talking points
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  to go out and beat people over the head, but they know that doesn't work.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  So now they go, you're a Nazi. You're a white supremacist.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  You're all these things you aren't to try to beat you over the head
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  and the next, you're going to lose your job.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  You're not going to get your pension. You're not going to get a college tuition.
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  You're not going to get a grant.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  People go, man, that bullying is really, really obvious.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  What are we going to do?
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  And they say, well, we'll just totally normalize it.
[39:56.000 --> 40:04.000]  You hit a point in tyranny when it just comes out in the open.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  They can't hide it anymore and they go, you know what?
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  We are thugs. We're going to break your legs if you don't do what we say.
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.000]  At that point, I say, good, let's go.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Because if I do what the thugs say today, what?
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  You want my wife? You want my kids? You want my blood?
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  You want me to bat on and lick your boots?
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Because that's really what you want, isn't it?
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  Because your scumbags, no real man would want people to lick their boots
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  and to live like that. But you scum, you do.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  And you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  and pushing the wrong people.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  You think all your censorship and all your garbage is making us go away?
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  All it's doing is making everybody get 10 times more hardcore.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  And we're kicking your butt politically and intellectually,
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  culturally, economically and spiritually.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm going to get to Hillary Clinton in a moment. This is incredible revelations.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  I told you they're planning to overthrow the election and she said it.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  When they get these fake indictments out of this swamp grand jury
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  that they've already said they've got, they are going to declare,
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  oh my gosh, Trump's removed or Trump died or whatever the case is.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  Because he's a symbol. Even if he tries to sell out what he isn't doing,
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  they're going to destroy him because they've got to destroy that image
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  and they've got to overturn the election, hold new emergency elections,
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  have Homeland Security run it. They've already announced it.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  All 50 attorney generals say that's unconstitutional, including Democrats.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  That's crazy.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  They're going to take control of the election and then have a new one.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  Do you ever think we're going to have a fair election again?
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  This is for all the marbles.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  But the good news is they're captained by a bunch of weirdos like the Podestas
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  and a crazy witch with a big old brain tumor
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.000]  hanging on to life via sheer will and her billion-dollar doctors.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  It's like Dick Cheney holds on.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  Nobody's ever lived more in a year and a half
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  than one of those artificial hearts on the outside of the body.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  Cheney lived almost two.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  He's tough, tough.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  You talk about dark energy will, they got it.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  They got it. Hillary Clinton's had more surgeries than Darth Vader.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  She gets them all the time.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  But our will is stronger than their will.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  Not because we can hang on to life for ourselves.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  We're willing to give up our life for everybody else.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  Because let me tell you, we're not going to live under you trash anymore.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  We're done.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  We're not offering some utopia. We don't have all the answers.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  But we know you're not what we want to be.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  We sure know that, don't we?
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  Yeah, we do.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  So, if you just joined us, I want to recap some of these clips
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  and get to the other clips I haven't covered,
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  but I want to congruently put them all together right now.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  Here it is, CNN forced to admit Trump may have been right about being wiretapped.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Now, that's how they let it out on TV.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  In the news, they're going all right.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  The Justice Department was spying on all of Trump's associates
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  in a Russia investigation directed by Obama.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  We know there was an investigation.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  It was over the Democrats too.
[43:09.000 --> 43:16.000]  Jay Johnson tried to get in 21 times in a Democrat computer.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  That's where it was really going on.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  And Podesta didn't know what to do because it was all coming home to roast,
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  and they were on them.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  Because there were a lot of lawyers in the Justice Department
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  and people that weren't going to be part of a total sellout
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  with her criminal server to the Russians and the Chinese and everybody else.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Because it was going on.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  So, Podesta literally just dreamed the whole thing up,
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  John Podesta, to turn it around and put it on the Republicans
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  and the conservatives and the libertarians
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  who've never been involved with foreign powers
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  and who've never sold the country out.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  Say what you want.
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  It's the Democrats that are known for being needy with the Russians.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  And I'm not going to list all the stuff Podesta or Hillary did
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  and the $100 million from the banks, the $35 million for the uranium
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  and then the Hillary and secret meetings with Putin not once,
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  but three times and her talking about how sexy he was and how powerful he was.
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  I mean, these people are so grasping.
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  One thing, whoever's bigger and more powerful than them,
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  who can actually get stuff done, they really admire it.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  It's sick.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  If you look at Putin, he's the opposite of Hillary.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  He's actually substantive, he's there, he's smart, he's hardworking,
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  he's focused, he does what he says he'll do.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  With Hillary, it's a total black hole of evil.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  Just like Megan Kelly telling me about Putin
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  was all getting excited about him when we were having dinner
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  and I was like, wow, you're really into him.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  She was always intriguing, sort of wiggling around her seat,
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  getting all sexually excited.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  I mean, it's crazy how these witches are into this.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  So, let's go over the clip.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  CNN Enforcement Mitt Trump may have been right about being wiretapped.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  Here it is.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  Justice Department has publicly denied the president's O-lines were wiretapped.
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  As you'll recall, he tweeted out months ago
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  that President Obama had his wires tapped.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  The Justice Department has come out and said,
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  that's not true, but what is possible, Don,
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  is that he was picked up on the Manafort surveillance
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  and we should note that Manafort does have a residence in Trump Tower.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  So what we always said is they were spying on his campaign head and on the campaign.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  So now they're trying to spin it.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  Oh, I guess it was, but it was only Manafort.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  No, it was all of them and we know that
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  because the media reported it beforehand
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  because they were planning to use it.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  But because it was illegally done, they tried to pull back
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  so they can now try to sneak it back into view
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  because they've decided with Mueller, who's such a raging criminal,
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  that they can get away with this.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  Well, the word is, old Comey's about to get indicted
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  because he's been caught perjuring himself lying to Congress.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  He's been caught holding back national security information,
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  caught perjuring himself about that,
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  been caught leaking information illegally.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  That's the big one.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Just open and shut, Comey.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  You got to get your special tall jail cell for, you know, eight foot tall, whatever you are.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  So let's go to this clip.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  FBI Director Comey and NSA Director Rogers,
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  no evidence of Trump wiretapping claim.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  And of course, it was the FBI doing the wiretap for the Justice Department
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  when he was the head of the FBI lying to Congress.
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  Here it is.
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  Director Comey was the President's statement
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  that Obama had his wires tapped in Trump Tower a true statement.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  With respect to the President's tweets about alleged wiretapping
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  directed at him by the prior administration,
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  I have no information that supports those tweets
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  The Department has no information that supports those tweets.
[46:49.000 --> 46:56.000]  The President accused Mr. Obama and presumably the FBI of engaging in McCarthyism.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  As you understand the term McCarthyism,
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  do you think President Obama or the FBI was engaged in such conduct?
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  I'm not going to try and characterize the tweets themselves.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  All I can tell you is we have no information that supports them.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  Were you engaged in McCarthyism, Director Comey?
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  Try very hard not to engage in any isms of any kind, including McCarthyism.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  He's such a good boy.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  President Obama could not unilaterally order a wiretap of anyone.
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  No President could.
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  Now the British allies have called the President's suggestion that they wiretapped him
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  for Obama nonsense and utterly ridiculous.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  Would you agree?
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  Yes, sir.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  Does it do damage to our relationship with one of our closest intelligence partners
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  for the President to make a baseless claim
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  that the British participated in a conspiracy against him?
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  I think it clearly frustrates a key ally of ours.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  Certainly wouldn't endear the British intelligence services to continue working with us, would it?
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  That's enough, folks.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  Months later they admitted, okay, there was NSA spying and they do use
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  the foreign intelligence operations to spy on us and we spy on them.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  Then that gets around domestic laws of your own agency spying on you
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  and then using that for political control domestically.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  That's how that began back during World War II.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  We'll spy on your people, you'll spy on our people.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  And it's totally illegal.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  It's part of the national security state.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  And that's what this is, is the big bloated, corrupt, evil national security state
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  making hundreds of billions of dollars a year off the taxpayers' back
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  to control society and cover up their crimes.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  Well, they claim they're the big super patriots because they served, you know,
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  the country by spying on you and selling you out to the chai comms.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  It's sick.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  Remember Clapper, the head of all intelligence, said no one has ever spied on Americans.
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  This has never happened, which they admit was total perjury.
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.000]  Well, he expanded that lie saying that the NSA was not spying on any other agency
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  on anybody associated with Trump.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Here is that whopper of a lie.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president,
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  Then they show his tweet, oh, Obama's so bad.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  James Clapper of Obama's National Intelligence appeared on Meet the Press.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  If the FBI, for instance, had a FISA court order of some sort for a surveillance,
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  would that be information you would know or not know?
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Yes.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  You would be told this?
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  I would know that.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  If there was a FISA court order on something like this?
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Something like this, absolutely.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  And at this point, you can't confirm or deny whether that exists?
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  I can deny it.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  There is no FISA court order.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  Not to my knowledge.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  Anything at Trump Tower?
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  No.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  As we now know, there was FISA and on top of it, there was Justice Department as well
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  crawling all over Trump.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  I mean, and he's sitting there on Meet the Press talking to a political Democratic Party
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  and the two have all scripted it and they're lying to the public.
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  In fact, let's play a clip of Clapper saying the NSA never spies on the American people on purpose.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  And of course, pigs fly.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  Here it is.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  Okay, no big deal.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  We'll play that clip when we return.
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  When I came in this morning, I got that little juicy lined up because it's amazing to hear
[50:21.000 --> 50:28.000]  Clapper tell the world that there's no spying against the American people, period.
[50:28.000 --> 50:35.000]  And with the same ridiculous level of deception, he sits there and he looks at everybody on
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  the news and says it's not going on.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  None of it's happening.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  Now, they admit, yes, they had the Justice Department, they had the FBI, they had the
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  NSA, they had the British, they had everybody crawling all over Trump at every single level
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  and running all over Russia trying to find some type of connection.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  But Donald Trump Jr. goes and meets with Run Russian to get dirt on Hillary and now he's
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  a Russian agent.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  Hey, Daniel Bremen.

[54:24.000 --> 54:46.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  Well, Hillary Clinton has been communicating through the different globalist publications
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  like the New Yorker magazine Financial Times of London,
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Monthly and other publications
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  for the last eight months, nine months since President Trump's been in office,
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  the last 11 months or so since he won the election.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  Hard to believe it's already been 10 and a half months since that happened.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  And she said, we're going to overthrow the election.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  We're going to say everyone that won, including state houses and governorships,
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  are Russian agents and that we're going to hold new elections for all of these states.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  This is a total political realignment towards Republicans.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  That doesn't mean they're perfect, but folks know that's the opposition party.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  That's the libertarian streak. That's the Tea Party.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  That's where people have been taking over the Republican Party.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  That's our best shot. Trump understood that.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  It's got good American values that aren't ever actually enforced or realized.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  So they know their days are over. They know they're screwed.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  They know they're a coastal elite party with their own people turning against them,
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  even immigrants turning against them. People want prosperity.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  They don't want North Korea or Venezuela or Cuba.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  So they're in trouble. What do they do?
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  Go for broke, overthrow the whole country.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  Say the Russians are the outside enemy. Your opposition works for the Russians.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  Use the Justice Department that you control to go after everybody.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Well, they lost.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  So now, because they were already planning to mop things up and get rid of free speech
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  and go after their political opposition as Russians of Hillary won.
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  But now they've got to even get rid of Trump on top of it.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  So they've got a big, big, big, big problem.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  And they want to overturn the election,
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  Homeland Security under an executive order that Trump hasn't repealed,
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  because his advisors don't tell him to and he's overwhelmed.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  He's spoken out against it. All 50 attorney generals have written letters,
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  said, whatever you do, do not do this.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  This is unconstitutional, including Democrats, but they don't care.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  So they're going to overturn the election, kill Trump, imprison Trump,
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  and then overturn the election, and then put Democrats back in power everywhere.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  And then the Republicans will be made a vestigial party only for ceremonial purposes.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  And the Republican establishment, it appears, is for that,
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  because this group will be paid off and be made new royalty during the period.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  We did find the clip of Clapper I was talking about a few years ago saying,
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  there is no spying. Here it is.
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.000]  No, sir. It does not.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Not wittingly.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect,
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  but not, not wittingly.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  Third is the beautiful charm in life.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  I notice three is always the thing of completion for some reason.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  I'm going to play it with the question here.
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  This will be a great achievement of gravitas on air.
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  Are we ready? Drum roll, please, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  here is Clapper saying they don't spy on you.
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  Friends. And he was asked a question about the NSA surveillance of Americans.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  He replied, and I quote here,
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.000]  the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  is completely false.
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  The reason I'm asking the question is, having served on the committee now for a dozen years,
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  I don't really know what a dossier is in this context.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  So what I wanted to see is, if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question,
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  does the NSA collect any type of data at all
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  No, sir.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  It does not.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Not wittingly.
[58:42.000 --> 58:46.000]  He also, again, just said that no one spied on Trump, all lies.
[58:46.000 --> 59:10.000]  These are known criminal liars.
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver and more,
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.000]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Superblue that is spearmint free.
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Superblue toothpaste and more
[59:44.000 --> 59:49.000]  at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  So I am wound up today.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  I am angry.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  I am focused because total vindication as if we needed it.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Our listeners all remember them on the news saying we spied on Trump.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  We know Putin's got his arm up his rear end and he's a puppet.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  We know Peppy the Frog was invented by Putin.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  We know the drain the swamp was invented by Putin.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  We know Crooked Hillary was invented by Locker up was invented by Putin.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  They actually have said that on CNN and MSNBC as a talking point.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  As if you couldn't say she's a Crooked Hillary.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  And so this is a big deal that they're having to admit this now.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  And now you know why they tried to isolate Trump while they tried to keep the crowds away from him.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  While they tried to keep Breitbart and info wars in his own bodyguard of decades.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  And while they want Bannon out.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  They keep telling him Mr. President we'll get your agenda of tax cuts.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  And we'll get your agenda of securing the sovereignty of the nation and taking care of the veterans.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Just get rid of all the patriots.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  They're the reason there's leaks, sir.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  We never leaked any of the stuff that hurt the president.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  We never released any of it unless the president said I'm upset about this.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Get this out.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Fight hard on this.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Keep doing what you're doing on this.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  I'm not going in to Syria to take out a sod.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I don't care what other people say you can bet on it, Alex.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And then all these people in the White House, they sit there and they leak all this garbage that isn't even true.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  To hurt the president and then they terrorize him.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  And they're saying fine, I'll isolate this down to me talking to two people a day.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And we'll see about the leaks and then they stopped the leak because they want him to think that everything's going to work out that way.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  And then he catches them when he goes to a campaign event keeping the head of the border patrol sector who he's friends with.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  He learns from coming to his event because they've got his cell phone number.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Then he yells at Kelly.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  See, because you can't trust the president to talk to the head of the border patrol section.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  You can't trust them either.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And you know, you got to pull Jack Pesovic's Naval Intelligence clearance because, you know, the president likes him and tweets his tweets.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Yeah, that evil Pesovic, you know, tweeting mainstream news articles about the president being right about illegals voting.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Yeah, can't let that young man be a naval intelligence. The president likes him.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  That's even worse than the Russians. I mean, there's nothing dirtier and nothing worse.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And so now they've got the president isolated.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  I've talked to a couple of people that talked to him recently at night and he was not slurring his words.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  So maybe he's just been exhausted or the aspartame can make you do that.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  So he really needs to lay off the Diet Coke. That stuff will make you go blind.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  You know, the old wives tales, you know, they tell you playing with yourself makes you go blind.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  No, aspartame. You know, I was thinking about that today.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  It's all over mainstream news that aspartame makes you fat, aspartame makes you get diabetes, aspartame makes you go blind.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  That was like in Bloomberg last week. I couldn't believe it. Diet sodas linked to diabetes, blindness, obesity.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  And I was thinking this weekend, why did I make a big victory lap about that?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  I had brain surgeons and scientists on 20 years ago.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  It was in the Searle documents in the 70s that they gave it to baby research monkeys and their mother's milk and it killed about a third of them.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Then they changed it around to some new fake studies in 1980 and got it approved.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  But that's what I mean. 99% of the time, I'm just telling you what's already admitted.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  Diet soda may alter our gut microbes and raise the risk of diabetes.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  I didn't even see that one. It was like a Bloomberg one last week that had the headline.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Maybe it was AP. It was some big establishment deal. It was diet drinks cause diabetes, make you fat and lose eyesight or something.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Everything we already know, that's what what alcohol does, that's what aspartame breaks down into at 87 degrees.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  We never have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage. America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA-2533139.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulars, the chemicals,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  or avoid most of the toxic effects themselves. The general public doesn't.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Paul Joseph Watson will join us from London, the latest on the Islamic terror attack.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Two refugees that came into the country were paid for, didn't have to work, 24-7 welfare, home provided, schooling, everything.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  So they wanted to go kill some people.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  We also have Dr. Jerome Corsi, who first got the secret documents about the NSA spying on Trump,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  and we got it to the president and he went public. We've totally vindicated on that.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  He's coming on with Roger Stone, who has obviously talked directly with Manafort's lawyers.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  We'll just leave it at that and has the full scoop.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  It's not just as the Daily Caller is reporting that they've told him that they're going for an indictment.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  They've told him we have an indictment from the kept kangaroo swamp jury out of the District of Columbia.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  You cannot make that up.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Andrew Torba of GAB starting to challenge Facebook. Well, Google and others are just delisting it and going to the Australian government and others
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  and having the site banned and it's going to be kicked off its domain register and banned to the public.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  And the site is pretty mild. It's like Reddit. They do have free speech though.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  As long as you don't call for violence, you can be an idiot, black supremacist or a moron, white supremacist or whatever you want.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  They have free speech, you know, like the country's supposed to have.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  But Google doesn't just run this monopoly. They're now working to have their competition banned.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Wow.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  And Mike Cernovich got a letter from a big Hillary's official law firm saying,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  we're suing you if you don't stop doing Pepe the Frog videos because our client claims copyright.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  That's like saying Kermit the Frog's copyright for satire or for anything political.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  It's totally protected. So we've got that. Jack Pasobic joins us as well. It's going to be absolutely jam packed coming up.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  We're going to talk to Mark Gonzalez here in just a moment about some really big, important news.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  But if you just joined us, you probably noticed that the New York Times, CNN, ABC, they're having to admit, OK,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  they were tapping Trump Tower and Paul Manafort, like the president said.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  There was a foreign NSA tap. So Clapper and Comey and all of them have gone before Congress and lied and said,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  there was no tapping of anybody involved with Trump or his campaign.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  And CNN is calling in an exclusive U.S. government wiretap former Trump campaign chairman.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Yes, you told us that before Trump even got elected and when he was president-elect.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  Then you realize it was illegal so you said it never happened. But we have all the clips and all the headlines.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  So just next level lying and they think no one has a memory. It's simply incredible.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  But here's the bigger news. We're going to play this clip coming up after our guest leaves us.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  Clinton is saying that she's going to overturn the election still and blames me and says,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  info wars is too powerful that there's not enough mainstream media. I'm not joking. All of Hollywood, all the major comedians,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  all the comedy shows, all the mainstream media, thousands of newspapers, thousands of TV stations.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  Even Fox News is like pro-Hillary now in many cases. All of this.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  And she says info wars, it has too much power. We need to be censored, shut down and that there needs to be more investment countering us by name.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Even though, yeah, during the election we were reaching the week of the election, 85 million people.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Normally we reached about 30 million before the election. Now we reached about 40 million.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  But they've been censoring us and blocking and had some effect dialing it back.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  But people get the Streisand effect now and are fighting back harder.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Now the reason I wanted to get Mark Donzalvez on is he's a great CEO of Nature Brands.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  He's not a sponsor or we're not plugging Nature Brands even though that's who powers Emrex Essentials and the line of toiletries we have.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  We're about to come out with a very affordable, high quality essential oils the next few days.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  So I should have him back on to do an infomercial on that.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  But right now Emrex Essentials, we want to introduce it to you, is 50% off, 25% off when you purchase it off retail.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  And the additional 25% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  This is something you want to reorder every 30 days, 60 days or 90 days, you can cancel any time.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  That's m4store.com.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  But I want to have him back up during the week for the essential oils rollout because I know essential oils have a five times markup.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  I just want to do 100 times, 100 times, 100% 100 times, you have to be like $1,000, whatever.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  I just want to do basically a one markup, not a seven markup.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And that's what they do as well.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  We're coming out with private label of their essential oils that blow away the top brands in the country that they sell for four or five times what we're going to be selling it for.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  So these are really, really, really, really high quality and they'll be available this week at m4store.com.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  But that is not why Mark Gonzalez is joining a CEO of one of the top organic brands in the country.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  His daughter was damaged by vaccines and I had known that privately, but he's willing to talk about it.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  So I wanted to play a clip and have him on and have him respond to it today.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  This story went up on m4store.com over the weekend.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  This is one of the head people over the Texas Health Department.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  She is a medical doctor, Carol J. Baker.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  She says, we'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  And, you know, you could say it was a joke.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  She was not joking and no one, you know, even really questions or shakes their head.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And then another guy on the board, he virtue signals that this UN World Medicine meeting, okay,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  held in Houston International Summit.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  It's almost all white people for some reason.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  And she says, I'm going to play the clip that we need to just get rid of the white people because they're the folks aren't compliant.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Well, actually, that's not true.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  It's higher education doesn't take vaccines county by county because people read the insert.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And it's the only drug out there company that has liability protection.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  So they always have these fact sheets they give you.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  You asked for it to say safe and effective.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  You dig deeper.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  They go, oh, there's a few adverse reactions.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  You read the actual insert under law that comes with the vaccine.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  It says, in any vaccine may kill you, may brain damage you, may cause an arcolepsy, may cause permanent diabetes.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  Type one, pancreatitis.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  I mean, I've got the inserts right here for just a few of the vaccines I'm going to go over.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  So I wanted to raise this because this is the arrogance of these people.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And they think it's a virtue signal.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  She goes, I'm a minority for 20 years in Houston.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  There's a white.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  And I got to say white people are just bad.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  So there's this new thing where you're the Green Party of Germany saying she will get rid of all the white people, whatever.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  It's trying to make the minorities who are the majority of most areas racist.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  It's not really working.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  It's always weird white people and they tell these doctors when they're going through their internship.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  Now, yes, vaccines kill people sometimes, but it's for the greater good because it causes so much more good than it does bad.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Then they blame whites and Christians for not taking vaccines on average and say, we're going to get everybody else sick.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  But if you've already had it, you're supposedly protected, I thought.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  So the truth is vaccines are spreading disease.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  It's not that I don't believe in the science.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  I don't believe in big pharma, caught doing medical experiments, caught doing, you know, sterile into the vaccines.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  You name it.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  The cancer virus is looking up SV 40 and more.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  My grandmother was told she got polio the second shot she got for a new strain live polio.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  They said, Ms. Hammond, you got polio.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  She just died this year.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  She couldn't walk.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  She was in a wheelchair the rest of her life since my mom was five years old.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  They told her, Ms. Hammond, you got polio from the vaccine.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  Her doctor told her back in the 1950s.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  So here is Carol J. Baker.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  I'm going to our guest, Carol J. Baker, just throwing it in your face that white people are the devil.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  And, you know, she's just another elitist, want to be establishment person who gets off on the health departments being founded by the eugenics boards and by the Rockefeller foundations here in the United States at the turn of the last century.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  And so it's the same mentality has been passed down the four sterilizations, all of it.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  They're all forcing you to take a product that has liability protection, then lying to you about what's in it.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  And she talks about how they're bullying the public and how the minorities are bending over, but the evil white people aren't.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Here it is.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  I'm complaining because the average pediatrician or internist has ten minutes for a visit and you want to have them go get media trained.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Excuse me.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  So, so, so different.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  The fight, the battle is being fought.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  One family, one physician, one health center.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  That's why we're doing as well as we are.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  We're talking about the minority and strategies against the minority.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  So I have the solution.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers and not talking about, well, hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  But refusers.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States because this is the most diverse city in the entire United States.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  There's seven Asian language spoken in that city.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  I've been a minority for more than 20 years in the city of Houston.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  And the majority is, we call Hispanic, that is not a race or an ethnicity that is a political designation.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  But a lot of them are from Central, South America, Mexico.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Immigrants.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Part of it.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  That's what made Donald Trump's comment about bringing diseases.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  They were at risk when they come here.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Immigrants.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And they're not going to be vaccinated.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  It is the well-educated.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  In terms of pieces of paper that they put on their wall.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  People that have been here a long time and it's very unfortunate.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  But I think we need not lose the big picture.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  Yeah, the big picture.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  We have strategies against the minority that mainly white people are highly educated don't take it.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  Because, you know, we read it.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  They tell the illegals, you take this at the school or you're going to be deported.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  So they take a population like them.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  They bully them and they know what they're doing.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  So we're going to break syrup.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Apologies it took me so long to build up to this.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  But Mark from naturesbrans.com, thanks for coming on to talk about what happened to you and your family.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Yeah, so they want to take the vaccines or are they being manipulated with the propaganda from the industry to think that they should be taking the vaccines.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  That's really what it comes down to.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  And I don't know where it ends, Alex, but you know, you have one of your contributors, John Rappaport.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  I read his blog every day. He's incredible.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  I don't know if you saw what he wrote last week.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  But in America, we now have over four billion, billion prescriptions written by doctors every year.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  That's 13 prescriptions per man, woman and child.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And I suppose, I guess, illegal immigrants as well.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  All right, Mark, the CEO of Nature Brands, stay there.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  We're going to come back and talk about your personal experience with vaccines.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  Anytime, any place, anywhere, radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  At home, at work, in the car, on smartphones, over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  That makes choosing radio is a place to advertise your business.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  One of the best decisions you can make.

[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  and you want guarantees and you want it all tax free.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  That's a tall order.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  That's true.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  But you can have tax free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  Protevite is nutrition you can feel. Protevite is nutrition that gets in.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  Now folks, if you want to know how frustrated I am,
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  I have loaded guests and I want to have my guests on for 10 hours on vaccines.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  But if you're a TV viewer and you're watching right now,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  here's the chicken pox vaccine from Merkin Co.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  The actual insert that comes with the injection bottle.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  They try to hide this from me, but under law, they've got to do it.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  It says, impairment of fertility.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And then it goes on to say it can cause cancer or sterilize you.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  I mean, I shouldn't laugh and it just goes on to talk about all the things it can do to you.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  The chicken pox vaccine, RISE syndrome.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  Yeah, it's not really aspirin. It's killing kids most of the time.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  It's the vaccine.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  And autoimmune disorders, death.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  And it goes into talking about 18 people out of 100,000.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  You know, we'll basically have brain damage.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  I mean, this is like Russian roulette.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  And this is just in their studies.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Here's the polio virus vaccine.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  I'm missing and give you polio, polio-like effects.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  I mean, I've got to go back to my guests. It's just rude to have me or not.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  I just want to say one thing on that chicken pox vaccine.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  It says diploid cells.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  That is actually aborted baby fetal cells.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  That's what they use to make it.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Yeah, that's what they use to make it.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  And it says it can cause mutations in your baby.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Don't take it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Well, and they say here's one.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Here's the influenza.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  Paralyzed, neon berets, death, cancer.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  We can do one hour on this.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  I've got MMR.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  Here's the MMR.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Here's the MMR right here where it says, dude, I got to go to the guests.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Let's just shoot a video on this this afternoon.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Sounds good.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  I know it makes you upset.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Here it says he can give you type one diabetes here.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  That's the MIRC shot right here.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  Type one diabetes.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  The CEO of Nature Brands, whose daughter got hurt by vaccines, Mark guns, all this.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Please continue, sir.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  So at the end of the day, Alex, people don't know what they don't know.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And the companies bank on this.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  They bank on that.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  So we have to continue to provide the education.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  We're up against a pretty formidable machine, but that's why you and I can get so fired
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  up about this.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  Last time I was on with you, one of my colleagues in the office said, gee Mark, you seem kind
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  of angry.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  You're darn too when I'm angry.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  Where does it end?
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  I just don't get it.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  I really don't get it.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  You know, go back to the chemicals.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  Look what we're doing.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  We use, I think it's 42 billion pounds of chemicals a day in American industry.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  Think about that.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  The 623,000 truckloads, 623,000 trucks a day.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Imagine if you saw him going by, maybe you'd finally stop and say, hey, wait a minute.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Maybe these chemicals are not so good for me.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  And you know, a toxologist would tell you that it's not a one plus one equals two when
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  you have multiple chemicals in a product, including vaccines.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  It becomes much more synergistic than that.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  It becomes a multiplier, a multiplier.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  So, hey, I just hope that people will start to do some homework on these things.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  I heard from people all over the world when I was on with you last time, Alex, and one
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  of them asked, gee Mark, you know, what really kind of started you down the process?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  I understand about your daughter and so on.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  I said, well, it was really interesting.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  I started getting more curious about where we were going.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  So, I picked up another copy of 1984, which I had read way before 1984.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  At the time that I first read George Orwell's 1984, it was before 1984.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  It seemed like such a distant timeline.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  And now, look, what would he, 33 years in the back, in the rearview mirror now.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  But I read George Orwell, 1984, and then my daughter happened to bring home this book.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  It was a book from her high school, Fahrenheit 451.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Then I read Brave New World, and I read them back to back to back.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Every American should do that.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  They'll wake up, if they read, of course, I know reading is not popular.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  It's being systematically taken out of our educational system.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  But think about it.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  Which order would you read those books in, Alex?
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  I know this.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  It's really a Brave New World.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  They're genetically engineering us.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  They admit they are.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  They get white papers on it.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  They know the vaccines are being designed to manipulate our genetics to change our brains.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Bill Gates is coming out with nanotech vaccines.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  They're going to put in the food so you can't escape it.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  It's social control.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And we know of all the secret experimentation that's been declassified.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Of course, it's still going on.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It's going on more than ever, and we've got to have a debate about it.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  And what about the Nuremberg Code?
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Where does this fit in, Alex?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Exactly.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  They're doing secret experimentation or unwitting experimentation on the population.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Exactly.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  And we're the ones that are supposed to feel bad if we're refusers.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  If we're refusers, according to that article, and that woman that was on there, the Janet
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Reno lookalike.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Well, I'm wanting to start a weekly health show that we could tape during the week or
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  do live on the weekend.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  I think you and John Rappaport should do a show together.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  Did you just talk about it?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Well, my wife and I used to do a radio show in Atlanta called The Food Conspiracy.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  And, you know, you talked about a boarded thesis.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  There's a company called Sonomax, or, yeah, Sonomax, I believe it's called, in San Diego,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  that we're using this fetal tissue to create flavoring profiles.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  I remember Pepsi.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Come back.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  I want to talk more about that.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Then we've got Roger Stone with the big breaking news on the upcoming indictment of Manafort,
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  because he won't lie about Trump, Bob Mueller, the criminal.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  We're on the run.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  We're on the run.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  We're on the run.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  We're on the run.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  We're on the run.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  We're on the run.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  We're on the run.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  Well, there's probably 10 big national brands of high quality, respected, organic, toiletries,
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  sunscreen, you name it, bug spray, shampoo, body wash.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  The list goes on and on, essential oils.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And most of those companies are politically correct, and they're scared to work with us.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  That's why it took us years to then finally contact Nature's Brands, which is one of the
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  top three, you see in major stores, super high quality and affordable.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  And to then get them to let us private label.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  And then I began to realize, wait a minute, Mark Gonzalez.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  I know that he's hosted shows before.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  He's aware he's their CEO.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  He's a patriot.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  He really woke up at his daughter, got hurt real bad by vaccines.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  That's why Trump's awake to vaccines, because Baron got hurt pretty bad reportedly from folks I've talked to.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  He's bounced back to God.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  But this will wake you up.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  So he was getting into the fetal tissue used in the flavor testing.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  He was getting into the vaccines.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  I mean, I was showing some of the inserts here where it says a mother shouldn't take vaccines and breastfeed.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  The actual inserts from a scientist say that.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  They're telling you, hey, this can kill you.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  This can give you cancer.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  This Gardasil is linked to lowering fertility.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  This Gardasil is experimental, but they won't say it on the news.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  They go, they're liars.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  Now we're going to go to Roger Stone and others on the huge breaking news with the confirmation that they've been spying on Trump.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  And his entire entourage or Trump land, just as the president said, it's totally illegal.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  This is their waterloo.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  Comey's very close to being indicted.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Trump needs to move before the fake rubber chicken kangaroo court indictment of a gallery of alligators out of the district of Columbia swamp.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  And the word is the indictments already done.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  The jury is just a rubber stamp.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  Man, of course, been told you start making stuff up about Trump.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  We're not just going to put you in prison.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  We're going to torture you real good with some deciling.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  So that's all coming up.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  Huge developments.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Hillary says she intends to overturn the election.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  We told you that was coming.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  So they're moving right now.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  They're making their move right now.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  But Martin's all this of nature's brands putting a plug in here and just finishing up.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  We carry six of the 40 plus products or more that you guys have under EmRick's essentials banner.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  We're already very affordable in stores.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  We're 25% less on average than what it is in stores.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  People sign up for auto ship and additional 25% off, which almost makes these a lost leader.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  But I want people to experience.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  I was already using your products because they're the best organic and low price.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Very affordable previously because they're so respected.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  So it's great to be involved with nature's brands where you're the CEO.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Let's talk about EmRick's essentials, the private label we're going to roll out, essential oils ready later in the week.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Let's talk about knowing what's happening in the corrupt industry versus the moral stuff you're doing.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  The reality of it is, is you have to start to read the labels.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And when you see things on a label that you cannot pronounce, it's probably not good for you.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  And when you see them over and over and over again on the label, then you're just compounding the problem.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  These products are affordable.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  I remember as a kid, what I think was for fram oil filters, the guy would come on the screen and they'd be doing a major engine job.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  And he would put the fram oil filter on there and he would say, you can pay me now or you can pay me later.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  And that's where we are with what's going on in the toxic environment we live in.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Toxins in our body is one of the major contributors to disease.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  You've got toxins, you've got nutritional deficiencies, you've got the electromagnetic chaos.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  The stress, emotional and mental stress, these are the contributors to illness and disease.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  You've got to take care of the toxins.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  This is one area you need to pay attention to in my opinion.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  I really hope that you would.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  And I realize the hardest mind to change is a mind that's made up, Alex.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  The propaganda from the chemical companies is awesome.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  They're using the same defense that the big tobacco guys used, the four dog defense.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  Maybe when we're on together next, we can get into that four dog defense.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  People need to know because once they understand how this four dog defense unfolds, their radar will be up and they won't be fooled as much.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  And again, we have the CDC in 2000.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Even ABC News did their job back then.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  They're so fake now.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  They told us through the sometimes, but I guess they got sued into submission by industry, but they got the documents where they were saying,
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  this brain damage millions, we've got to stop giving this to our grandchildren and we've got to clean this up.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  But there'll be a big public outcry and massive lawsuits.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And so it just got covered up by doubling down and saying, we're not going to mandate 30 shots.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  We're going to mandate 50 shots.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  And it's the same thing with psychotropics.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  It was just in the news last week.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  Major studies, 33% increase in early death when you take a psychotropic drug for more than one year.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Psychotropics are in the hallucinogen class.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  I mean, they literally eat your brain and people wonder what's going on here.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  This is incredible.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  Alex, when it comes to the psychotropics, it's taking a lot of our young people from us.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  You look at all of these mass shootings, look at all of the SSRIs that are pointing back to the perpetrators.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  I don't know when we're going to get outraged, but I really hope that with every broadcast, we touch a few more minds and we're able to at least get them curious.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  If we can get them curious, companies like us will grow.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Big now equals bad.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Big government, big business, big chemicals, big pharma, big medical, big banking.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  If it's big, it's bad by definition.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  I hope the viewers start to go to the smaller companies that have the right intentions, the right motives.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  We'd love to feel that Nature's Brands is one of those companies.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  We've been doing it for 22 years, way before people started thinking about organic and chemical free and the calls started coming in with greater velocity.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Hey, I've got to do something about this.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  I'm chemical intolerant.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  Well, yeah, we can help with that for sure.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  We help a lot of people now that have discovered their intolerance to all these chemicals.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  You've got a great point.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  We need local.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  We need organic.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  When I say big, you're still a small company in the scheme of things, but you're one of the respected organic brands that the organic Nazis, people that really study it, like the soup Nazis and Seinfeld.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  Nature's Brand was something I was already using before we were able to partner with you with Emirates Essentials.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  That's why we're so blessed.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  We're going to talk to you again on Thursday when we break down these issues and more.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  What an amazing guy, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to Roger Stowe and others here in a second.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  But I mean, I did a 30-second plug last hour.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  So that was 90% informational, 10% plug because we've got to fund our operation.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  And if you knew or did the research on what the additives in shampoo do or what the so-called additives in soap do, they're not soap.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  They're not shampoo.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  When you get Emirates Essentials soap or body wash or shampoo or the other products, you're getting something that has eight or nine ingredients in it that are totally organic and certified organic for less than the chemical garbage.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Now, a lot of studies show these chemicals are actually addictive.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  That's why they're putting them in the food, the water, and these other products.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Now, a lot of folks just become allergic to it, but a lot of people get addicted to toxins.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  That's a big secret about poisons, as many of them are addictive.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  So that's kind of the secret sauce secret of these big chemical companies and others.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  But I've gotten aware I just can't use anything that isn't organic because there's just so much garbage in the environment.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  It just builds up and builds up.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  I get sick of I use something that isn't organic.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  I've mitigated all the toxins in the environment, the toxins in the air, the toxins in the food by filtering my water, filtering my air as much as I can,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  and then only using high-quality certified organic products.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  And most of those companies, the average liberal, knows this is going on, so they go out and take care of themselves.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  But they're anti-American companies, not the folks that power Emirates Essentials.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  We have 50% off.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  I said it's going to end this weekend.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  It's going to have to end today because it's still up.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  50% off an M4 is high-quality, swarable food.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  That's 50% off the regular price.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  So that's not like we raise the price and then lowered it.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Knockout, powerful sleep aid with the melatonin, L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and so much more.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  It's 40% off at its regular price of $29, folks.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  It's a great deal.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  It's $17.97 right now.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Just a regular bottle of melatonin of the same dose costs this much or more.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  So this has the same dose of melatonin that they recommend is safe and effective with everything else in it.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  It's amazing.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  When I forget to take it, I'm an idiot.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  It's just better, restful, deep sleep.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  It's amazing.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Especially if you're taking stimulants like coffee and stuff during the day that can deplete your brain.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Not like serotonin rehab to take inhibitors, but it does it.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  So this helps add it back.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  Get your bottle of that.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  That special is going to end today as well.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  Emirates Essentials, 50% off all Emirates Essentials.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  I'm going to go ahead and end that special tomorrow.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  It's time to end that.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  Caveman is about to sell out the bone broth formula.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  50% off amazing product, but it's about to sell out.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  We don't get more until next month.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  So whether it's strawberry or chocolate, take advantage of that and fund an operation having a huge effect.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  50% off all super blue, fluoride free, made in America, high quality products with loyal silver and iodine.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  That's 50% off.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  That is going to end here in the next few days as well.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  Whatever you do, take advantage of these specials today.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139 and listen.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  Where can you say there's an organization being more demonized, more attacked than InfoWars?
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  It's because we have the sources.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  We're fearless.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  We're open to the target because we know you can't sell out to the globalists because they're pure evil.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  But the globalists weren't pure evil.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  They're like Boss Hog.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  I wouldn't be risking my life.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  I'd be trying to be a moral person and change things.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  But I wouldn't be balls to the walls, you know, deathmatch.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  All the stuff they've done to me.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  I tell you, it's been something else.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  But they hadn't brain damaged any of my kids yet because I knew the vaccines were deadly.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  I read the insert.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  Poor Mark, big successful businessman, his daughter almost got killed.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  So listen, I'm not a selfless person.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  I'm selfish.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  I want America.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  I want freedom.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  I want you to be free.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  I don't want a bunch of dirtbag technocracy people running my life.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  So infowarslife.com.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  Thank you all for your support and your prayers and support of local affiliates.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  Now we got a long way to go in a short time to get there with Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  popping in, Andrew Torba.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  Maybe we'll just all ride shotgun with everybody.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  Mike Cernovich, Pesovic, Jack Pesovic, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  It's all coming up.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  Unprecedented censorship has been launched.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  I mean, it's here now.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Google's actually working to shut down other sites outside of their network now.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  I mean, it's here.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  They're trying to shut down Gab right now.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  He's going to be in studio with us.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  He lives here in Austin.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  It's just, it's just incredible.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  But Roger Stone joins us.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  Talk about vindicated.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  They said we were crazy.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  We made it up.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  Nobody was spying on anybody in the Trump campaign.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  Turns out Roger Stone was fized.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  Turns out Clapper lied, coming lied.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Trump was spied on via the NSA.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  Justice Department had criminal stuff open on Trump's campaign head.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  And they lied to Congress and they lied to the public.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  This is incredible.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  Total vindication in triplicate.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Yet again, we are the platinum standard.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Roger, you're the platinum standard of accuracy.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  And that's why they want to shut us down.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  I have a piece up at USA Today, an op-ed piece that they solicited.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  It's kind of hard to explain this in 340 words,
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  but I make the case that the entire rubric,
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  the entire narrative of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign is a falsehood.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  And now we learn that Paul Manafort was in fact under surveillance.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano was absolutely correct.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  In fact, the former director of intelligence,
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  Mr. Clapper, testified before the Senate under questioning from Senator Feinstein,
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  admitted that the British intelligence services were surveilling Trump and his associates.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  This is what allowed Jeff Sessions to say only about a week ago that we quote,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  we are not in possession of evidence that Donald Trump and his associates were surveilled.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  Notice that careful wording.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  Of course, they're not in possession.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  The Brits did this for the U.S. intelligence services in some cases to give deniability.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Sure, they play some manical games.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  This is, as you know, a standard operating procedure.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  But in the case of Manafort specifically,
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  we learned yesterday that he was under surveillance
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  prior to his involvement in the Trump campaign,
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  that he was under surveillance during the inauguration,
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  during the presidential transition.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  That means de facto that my conversations with him, Alex,
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  were being eavesdropped on by the government,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  also his conversations with President-elect Trump,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  and then President Trump were being...
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  Why are they admitting it now? Because they admitted it previously,
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  then Trump pointed out it was illegal,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  so then they said they never did it, now they're back admitting they did,
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  because Mueller is getting ready to use some of this?
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I think because they realize it is going to come out in a trial.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  Manafort has now been formally informed that he will be indicted.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Whether that is an indictment for failure to file properly under FARA,
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  with the allegation that he, while running the campaign in the Ukraine,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  for a legitimate and recognized Democratic political party,
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  in an election in which we recognized the outcome,
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  or whether he is being indicted for money laundering or tax evasion
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  or some other trumped-up charge,
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  the point, of course, is all of this is just leverage.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  In other words, Manafort, we're going to indict you and send you to jail on this trumped-up charge,
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  if you will just admit that you were colluding with the Russians
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  and say Donald Trump knew everything, we'll let you off the hook.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  In other words, they want Paul Manafort to become John Dean.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  They want him to lie.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  They want him to bear false witness against our president
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  and say things happened that never really happened.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  And Alex, I can assure you, Paul Manafort is not going to do that,
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  no matter how hard they squeeze him.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  If you're waiting for the headline, Manafort makes a deal,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  we'll testify against Trump, that day will never come, never.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  Now, let's expand on that.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  What are they going to do?
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Comey's committed all these crimes.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  He's leaked intelligence.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  He's done.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  He's got to be indicted.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  Well, as I told you last night, incredibly,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  when the FBI broke into Manafort's apartment in Alexandria, Virginia,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  at five o'clock in the morning,
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  ostensibly looking for documents and taking away two notebooks of documents,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  which they already had,
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  they went through an extensive operation to photograph
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  his expensive custom-made Italian suits.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  What kind of Mickey Mouse BS is this?
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Are they perhaps going to indict him for taking a business tax evasion,
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  tax credit for the value of his suits?
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  First of all, the IRS has disallowed that long ago.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  The point is, there's total desperation.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Well, let's come back then and we're going to bring in Dr. Corsi.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  We all broke here, not just the NSA spying, but previous NSA spying
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  and the documents, which, notice, the media didn't want to touch,
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  because those are Trump's phone numbers, those are my numbers.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  That's real spying.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  So we need to go after Obama for his criminal activity
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  that makes Nixon look like an angel kick.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  Think about it.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  It's something weird's going on. Suddenly, CNN, ABC News are all reporting that Aspartame causes brain damage, diabetes and makes you obese.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  CNN's reporting fluoride in utero lowers children's IQs, lowers brain sizes and causes 15-point IQ reductions by age 7.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  I mean, it's just everything's coming out.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  It's almost like they're starting to give up, but I don't think that's happened, but it's something weird's going on, Roger Stone.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  You're at your lawyer's office. You're finally testifying in secret next week. We'll have reporters there to cover it.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  But going back to Roger Stone, is there admitting the illegal spying?
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  Trump's been vindicated. USA Day's asking you for big op-eds. Basically admitting you're right. What is going on here?
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  Well, I think they're in retreat because their allegations of rushing collusion are collapsing before your very eyes.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  It's interesting, Alex, that in her book, what happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton, which I have here on me, that she yet again repeats the same three lies.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  She repeats yet again the claim that I knew about the hacking of the Podesta email.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  They knew that I knew about the content of WikiLeaks in October and that my communications with someone alleging to be Goose for 2.0 is completely innocuous and happens long after the fact.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  But it's the big lie technique, whether it's Adam Schiff or whether it's Hillary Clinton, they just continue to promulgate a lie.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  And so I'm going to have an opportunity to clean that up. Believe me, I will make the case in front of the committee that they did wiretap Trump, that they did wiretap Trump Tower, that they did surveil Trump's associates.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  The big lie is about to be exposed.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Boy, I sure hope somebody records that because you know they're going to put out false statements on you as they've done previously with the committee on other people and lie about what you said.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  I mean, Schiff may say that you admit to being a Russian agent, work for the KGB and, you know, violate the secrecy of the committee. That's what they've been doing so far.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  Yeah, look, this guy is a real Schiff head and I think he's capable of just about anything. But I will be prepared and this is not, as you know, our first rodeo.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  So I'm looking for a day of vindication, a day of rebuttal, and we're going to drive this point home.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Donald Trump was spied on by the deep state during his presidential campaign and during his period as president elect.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  And for all we know is still being monitored as president today.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  That's right. And they are so absolutely scared of that coming out because it's illegal and they found nothing and they've got to be panicking right now.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  I think they're in full retreat, Alex. And this notion that you would go try to jack Manafort up on a charge of taking tax deductions for his expensive Italian custom made suits, which by the way, never fit terribly well.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  Anyway, he had a tendency to buy a silhouette that was not right for his physique. That's a whole different program.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  But what kind of Mickey Mouse crap is this? They told us this was about Russian collusion, Russian interference in the election, but they can't find anything of the kind on Manafort.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  So they seek to leverage him with some minor charge to get him to be Judas Iscariot, to turn on his president and make things up.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  They want him to lie. They're trying to induce him to lie. That's not going to happen, in my opinion.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  All right, Roger. We'll be checking in with you throughout the week. And then with next week's hearing, we'll have folks there with the exclusive. Thank you.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  We'll be right back with Dr. Corsi, who broke the news of the whole separate NSA spying. Wow. And then we've got a bunch of guests being censored, unprecedented.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  Google's making its move. Not just censoring you on Google, but going outside Google to censor it.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.

[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  All right, for this segment and part of the next, Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us. And then Google Tech Giants threaten to shut down free speech, social site, outside of Google.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  Google's working to shut down GAB. GAB has filed suit. I mean, it's here. They've been since for a while, but this is like 1000% what it ever been.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  And that's conservative. I mean, this is like 10 times the censorship we've ever seen. They're hitting info wars. They're hitting assault because they know the Democrats are being turned into a regional party.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  They know globalism is in retreat. And so they just want to bring in total tyranny to stop it.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  Now, we stuck our neck out there and got secret NSA documents that have been given to federal law enforcement for years that they've done nothing with it.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  Obama was spying on hundreds of thousands of prominent Americans. I was in there. Michael Savage was in there. So many people are in there.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  Trump, his private phone numbers, his number at Mar-a-Lago. This was NSA. This was a huge law enforcement database of databases of spying.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  Here's the headline, NSA documents, previous surveillance of Donald Trump and his family. This is a short segment, longer segment coming up with Dr. Corsi.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  What do you make of the vindication? What do you make of them starting to retreat right as Mueller prepares the fake indictment? What's going on?
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  Well, I was you're exactly right. I mean, we had authoritative sources. We had the database from a whistleblower Montgomery.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  I had come through Sheriff R. Pyle's office. They had completely validated it. The NSA wire was having really electronic surveillance, which is massive, and Snowden was completely right.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  I mean, I think it's gone on since, you know, for decades. I think it's continuing even today. If you remember, a clapper, the DNI had when he was in that testimony with Congress, was asked if U.S. citizens were being under electronic surveillance.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  He said, not wittingly. Well, I don't know what that answer means, but that means yes. I mean, we are being under surveillance. Maybe they're not listening to it all as they have a reason.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  But we know Donald Trump and you Alex were under massive electronic surveillance, and I don't think it's ever quit.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  And we know they were using it politically. That's criminal. I mean, Comey's been caught perjuring himself, caught leaking classified information.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  The word is folks are looking at indicting coming.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Well, in fact, you know, we also reported on that through the Obama administration with these leaks, the information that was being leaked could only have come from electronic surveillance.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  And now we know that Susan Rice was involved in this unmasking. I mean, we know where is Jeff Sessions. We need to get criminal prosecutions of the NSA for violating its charter ought to be shut down.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  And we were way ahead of this story, Alex, and took a lot of abuse for it. But it turns out we were always correct.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  Why is Mueller so arrogant?
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  Mueller is a political operative and his job is going to be to produce a indictment or charges against Donald Trump of obstruction for justice.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  They've changed it. They don't have the ability to bring the Russian collusion. They won't care.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  And even CNN admits that that Mueller's broken the law, grabbing stuff that wasn't the search warrant, threatening people.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  I mean, Mueller just acts like he's God.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  Well, in fact, we predicted we said that Comey was going to actually say that Hillary was not going to be indicted.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  That was set up. Comey and Mueller have been fixers for the Clintons. They're political operatives.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  And Mueller's job is to produce enough on Donald Trump to force him to step aside.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  And by the way, the waters is met with him and says he's ours. He's going to get him. You watch.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  And the word is they've already got the grand jury ready to assign any indictment.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  That's why they told Manafort last week you better roll over. We are going to indict you.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  So they're admitting this grand jury's completely kangaroo.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  And Mueller is a complete political operative.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  This and his relationship with Comey, the two of them ought to be indicted.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  They ought to be indicted years ago. They're completely fixers and they're crooked.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  And he's going to try to bring Donald Trump down. Mark my word.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  You know, instead in Australia, they call a fake jury a line of kangaroos, and the judge says the jury says this.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  But in this case, it's like alligators out of the swamp all lined up.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  We're going to come back and talk about where is this going next?
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  As Hillary now has made a statement, she intends to overturn the election. You'll see the video coming up.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  Forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  And they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  Where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance. Infowars.com.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.

[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  They're the richest oil country in the world, more than Saudi Arabia,
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  and they can't keep their power on more than a few hours a day because of communism.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  And they have staged elections there.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  And our own media criticizes the president and says, you don't have proof of that.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  Are you kidding? They arrest all the major opposition party leaders
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  and don't even let them run or be on the ballot when polls show they're going to win.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  It's just like the president said he was being spied on.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  It just goes on and on. Everything the president said has been accurate.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  Every, everything we've said has been accurate.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  I mean, sometimes we get like a name wrong or some little point, but in the main,
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  the Democrats all over the country now have cities,
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  7 in Maryland, like 15 in California.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  I can't even keep track of it.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  Major cities where they let illegals vote.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  And then they say, oh, we're not stealing elections.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  And then they say, we want world government.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  We want to force inoculate you. We want this. We want that.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Shut up.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  Fluoride's good for you.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  Really, here's CNN, fluoride exposure in utero, linked to lower IQ and kids.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  Man, wow, the whole thing's collapsing.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  This is just incredible.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  What do you make of even USA Today reaching out to Roger Stone
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  and wanting him to write an op-ed and letting him publish it that the Russian collusion is a delusion?
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  He published it at Info Wars and they asked for it.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  And that it's all fake and that it's made up by Podesta,
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  who really has been a Russian agent.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  I mean, this, I think really shows they realize something we don't know.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  They're really starting to desert Hillary right now.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  I'm going to play this clip at a moment, right as she comes out and says,
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  everything's Info Wars fault and that they need more money to invest to stop us.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  That's a quote. And she also says that she's going to try to block the election
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  and overturn the election, which they admit they're stewing in the background.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  As if they're going to get rid of Trump and have a new election and federalize it
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  when even the Democrat attorney generals unanimously have said that it's unconstitutional.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  All 50 state attorney generals have written letters.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  But they're writing articles admitting we're about to be a minority party
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  only on the coastal elites. The public turned against us.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  We're done if we don't take over.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  The answer is take over and have martial law for a while and have new elections.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  They're even in writing this in Atlantic Monthly like everyone isn't reading it
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  that actually thinks, like the military isn't reading this.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  Like the agencies, the deep state isn't bad.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  It's the shadow government controlling it.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  The shadow government's blocking Trump.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  They've got him surrounded.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  But don't they understand we have them surrounded?
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  Every day our credibility goes up.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  Every day our listeners go up.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  Every day their credibility goes down.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who broke the NSA spying, broke it all.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  I mean, am I sensing a real turning of the tide here?
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  I think the deep state is in deep trouble right at the moment.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  I think what you're going to see is you're going to see Mueller shift ground.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  And when he comes out and indicts or recommends the indictment of Trump, which he will do,
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  it's going to be on the grounds of obstruction of justice.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  Because they're going to drop the Russian collusion in favor of obstruction of justice.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  He's going to be charged with firing Comey in order to protect the presidency.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  The whole goal is for Donald Trump to be forced to recuse himself or to hand over the presidency
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  depends while he defends himself in court or in the House of Representatives on impeachment.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  Of course, Bill Clinton did not step down when he was facing impeachment charges, nor did Richard Nixon.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  But the pressure will be on Trump.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  It will be enormous.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Because Mueller is going to come out and he's going to bring charges against the White House, against Donald Trump himself.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  Confident that's in the works.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  Well, Roger said I can get into some of it. He told me two days ago and then last night and of course we didn't do it.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  And got scooped by Daily Caller, which I don't that that's fine.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  But it's not that they're going they're going for an indictment with the grand jury.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  They said, we've got an indictment. You better do this.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  This is directly from obviously he and Manafort have been business partners 30 years work for Nixon, their best buddies.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  So I can't get into all of it.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  But I mean, Manafort's like there is nothing.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  And all they did was aim machine guns at him, cuss at him.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  Photograph is underwear.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  They just totally tried to intimidate.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  And they're basically intimidating him with prison time and diesel treatment.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  And I know that most of the feds aren't bad people, but they've got these special units of Democrat scumbags.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  And this is like Nazi like behavior, man.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  I'm getting tired of it.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  Well, I agree with Roger. I don't think Manafort will break.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  I'm kind of going deeper.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  I've got, you know, other sources of information which say that already in work within Mueller's office is the plan to abandon the Russian collusion in favor of making it a secondary argument.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  In other words, oh, they've already been saying forever.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  They find a crooked toenail.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  They know that everybody's going to be exactly.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  And what they're going to say is they're going to say that Donald Trump actually tried to obstruct justice by firing.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  Call me, they're going to go after him for obstruction of justice order to end the Russian collusion investigation.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  Now, that's going to be the that's going to be the shift.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  It's going to be how they're going to change ground and hope nobody knows.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  Notices, but that's in the works.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  And you can bet that Mueller is not going to resign or leave until he brings charges against Donald Trump.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  And Trump had better recognize this and better be aware of it.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  It's coming.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  It's going to be in the works.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  And the White House is going to have to face because Mueller can be fired.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  That's the decision to turn the investigation up with, you know, with sessions and begin investigating.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  Sure. Is it the answer going after Comey?
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  I mean, Comey, I know that's what the president thinks.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  I mean, Comey said there's no spying when the president was already president and he has all the details.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  He knows exactly what was going on.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  She's classified.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  He can't release it.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They're spying on everything.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  And now it's come out, as you said, with the foreign court, the FISA, it's come out with the Justice Department.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  They all lied.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  They lied and wrote to Congress.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  Comey, I played the clip earlier, said no, no spying by the Justice Department on Trump.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  He said it was crazy in one interview.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  So that's why Trump said, what is this guy talking about?
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  He knows Comey's a liar.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  So Comey has perjured himself.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  He's given classified material to the New York Times.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  He's full of crap.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  He needs to be put in a prison cell.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  And I don't know what Jeff Sessions is doing, but Trump better call him into the office and say, look, if they're going to come after me like this,
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  well, we're going to go after Barack Obama for the leaking that was done on the NSA and the lying about the NSA taping that was done.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  Snowden's been right all along.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  Well, listen, I guarantee you if Trump went in and told the special forces, you know, command out of Florida, let's just arrest all these people.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  They just do it.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  They call him for martial law, but the Democrats are walking us into martial law, banning conservatism, banning Christians, just saying we're all white supremacists.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  That's the play.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  They're going with that now.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  They already want martial law.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  They want to overturn an election.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  And I just think that if the president can't control this, he's got to call out the special operations command and you just got it.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  The governors are going to back him.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  We just got to arrest a few hundred of these people.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  Just it's a foreign plot, a multinational plot.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  He has to move against them.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  They're never going to leave him alone.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  They're never going to leave us alone.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  Trump is in a coup.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  This is a coup attempt.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  It's a coup attempt that is going to be played out through Mueller.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  The idea is he will be charged with obstruction of justice.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  They'll force impeachment or force him to step down.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  They charge him in a criminal court, which they may well do.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  They may bring criminal charges against Donald Trump.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  Because he pulled out of the trees in his TPP and the carbon taxes and started securing the borders and taking care of the veterans and trying to get the economy going.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  I mean, it'd be one thing if he was a globalist trader and they were trying to put him in jail.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  He hasn't done anything and they're all as dirty as it gets.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  I'm sick of it.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  And Donald Trump's going to have to fight back.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  He's going to have to take control of the power of the presidency, take control of the Department of Justice, clean it out of the Obama people.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  So, fire Mueller, bring Mueller and call me under investigation and bring charges against Barack Obama for massive use of the National NSA in domestic spying and leaking to the press.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  We've had the evidence of it since March.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  We've published it repeatedly.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  I've been trying to get the attention of the American public on this for...
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  Well, you've got the president's attention.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  You talked about how to defund Obamacare and now they admit that exact plan's been followed.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  And look, we also have the president's attention on the Arpaio part.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  I think we have the president's attention...
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  Well, we know that and that's why they say no info wars, no Breitbart in front of the president period, no nothing.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  When the president knows we're the only ones backing him, we're the only ones that aren't complete traders.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  And we're still able to communicate directly to Donald Trump.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  And Donald Trump has to understand that this is a serious mortal game.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  This is the game to the death, the deep state plan.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  Yeah, this is Julius Caesar stuff. They're not going to stop.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  They know they've lost politically. They want martial law. They want civil war.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  They want cop killing. They want to overturn the chessboard.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  There are losers and he has to know that he...
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  Listen, I've never talked like this. I'm anti-police state.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  They're the ones setting up a police state. They're the ones that want a coup over our republic.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  And so the last thing we've got is the American people, the governors and the military.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  Well, and it is not going to stop.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  We've got to understand that this is going to go on right to the bitter end.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  I mean, the next plan is they can't get an indictment they will hold or assassinations the next step that they'll go to.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  I mean, the state is in for the endfall to win or lose this time around.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  But don't think it's not 1963. He killed Trump all day. Nobody's stopping this movement.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  It's not like they're in North Korea or poor Russia kicking a bunch of serfs around.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  We've had a history of freedom and a history of rebelling and they know, they got to know they're going to lose.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  And we've also had a history of deep state revelations. We've had Iran contra. We've had all the revelations.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  Well, that's what scares them because I'm not kissing the deep state's butt, but it was set up to fight the Soviets and for COG.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  There are a lot of good people in the deep state that helped Trump get elected who are the ones that are pissed about what's happening.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  That's got to scare the globalist Corsi to know that there are more patriots in there than in the low level and mid level rooms.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  And we've got a light of fire under Jeff Sessions. If he's not willing to go after Hillary on the emails, Hillary on the foundation.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  You think sessions is compromised?
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  I think I'm beginning to think so. I think we'll make another round attempt to get to sessions.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  And then from there on, my recommendation is going to be to fire sessions.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  I hate to say that I've known Jeff Sessions a long time, but unless Donald Trump has the ability to fight that...
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  If he doesn't have the stomach for a fight, he needs to get out of the game. Thank you, Dr. Corsi. We'll be right back with T-Gas. Stay with us.

[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  We're sending out an SOS.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  Andrew Torbup runs gab.ai, which has become one of the biggest alternative social networks out there, and what are Google and others doing? They're going and lobbying to have it shut down and delisting it.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  So they have that argument, oh, Google's our own company, Facebook's our own company, Twitter's our own company, and then when they're not running slave factories like Apple does, they're trying to shut down everybody's free speech.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  Google tech giants threatened to shut down free speech social site, Jamie White, infowars.com yesterday, and I read the article and followed the links.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  They're publicly calling everyone white supremacists. They're now saying they didn't want to have Spicer go speak at the event the other night, the Hollywood event, the Emmys, because he's a white supremacist.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  See how this works? I mean, it's just crazy how they dehumanize you. Then they take your speech. And then we got Mike Cernivus joining us.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  Hillary's law firm. He posted on his website. We'll pull it up next segment. Hillary's law firm is threatening to sue saying you can't use a green frog.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  You hear that Kermit? I've got a clip here. I'm going to give you guys. It's from South Park. Let's download it off my phone if you can.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  I just randomly, South Park was on last night. They're like, they're throwing a fit and tear up a little green frog. It looks like peppy.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  So they're saying you can't have any green frogs because you're a white supremacist. That's the Bloomberg headline.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  Creator of peppy sues white supremacists. Then who they're suing are hated by white supremacists.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  I know for a fact I'm hated by white supremacists. So is people like our guest, but we allow on our message boards or on his great site, gab, people to have free speech as long as you're not calling for violence or doing stuff.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  It's criminal. That's called living in a free country. There it is. White supremacist, use of peppy the frog, fought by its creator.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  And then if you link to somebody else's cartoon with a frog, they just say, no frogs, period.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  Well, you know what? I copyright the term gay frog and I say peppy's gay. And you got to be pro gay pride as I am.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  Being a little sarcastic here. So peppy belongs to me. But seriously, under free speech, you have total protection under political speech to do whatever you want with peppy the frog.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  It's total intimidation. That's coming up.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  But thank you, Andrew Torba, creator of gab with which they're trying to shut down globally. I mean, it's really here.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  Tell us, in fact, you've sued Google. I forgot to add that point.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex. And we announced this lawsuit actually on Friday. And I find it really interesting that our domain registrar ended up contacting us within 48 hours and saying that you have to find a new registrar.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  We will not support you anymore because in Australia, we don't allow hate speech and you have hate speech on your website.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  Wow. And notice six months, eight months after the transfer to this multinational group, the US created the web, but it always protected domain registry.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  Now everybody's being kicked off their register, being shut down at that liberal.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  Right. Absolutely. And, you know, as an extension, we have dot AI, right? So not many registrars actually support our extension.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  So it's we had very limited choices, but thankfully we did find a registrar to support us.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  We are not going to reveal who that registrar is because what was happening is people on the alt left and people that wanted to see gab go down and people that want to destroy free speech ended up doing mass reporting to this registrar.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  And apparently they caved under this pressure and they call us Nazis.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  When the first thing the Nazis did was grab their political enemies and not let them have commerce.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  Absolutely. And, you know, you were you were speaking about the frog before, you know, we have a cartoon frog and we launched our brand well before the whole hysteria about Hillary and the ADL claiming that a cartoon frog has anything to do with Nazi ism or white supremacy.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  It's just absolutely absurd. And we had the mainstream media painting us as Nazis and as white supremacists and as all this nonsense for well over a year now.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  Finally, we've been able to change the narrative and they're they're saying that we're a free speech site and that we've welcome everybody, which has been consistent with our mission from day one.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  And it shows the bullying, the intimidation to say everybody's Nazis. No one buys that now. So they're trying to delest us. As I've said, I'm getting ready to sue some folks because I'm forced to, you know, Google's banned us from selling my DVD saying the Obama deceptions racist,
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  because criticism of Obama is racist. I mean, this is next level true communist style censorship.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  Absolutely. I mean, we tried to participate in the free market, right? Alex, we operate in good faith. We said we welcome everybody. We want to support freedom of speech and individual liberty for everybody.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  And the free market didn't work because it's rigged. You have two companies, Apple and Google that own and control and dominate 98% of the mobile marketplace.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  And then you come along with something saying, hey, we're not going to censor liberals or conservatives. And as long as it's not illegal, same thing we do at info wars.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Then you've got to be shut down. They are true thugs.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  Absolutely, Alex. And we're going to continue fighting it.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  Well, it's questionable if Google can fire its closeted conservatives. But now it's out on the web. It's in your article. We're going to go over it.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  And Mike Cernovich, Hillary's law firm, we're going to put it on screen. She is saying she's going to sue him for making fun of her with Pepe the Frog.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:02.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show. We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is the War Room.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000]  We're here from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:22.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  This is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:03.000]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000]  It's made in the USA.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Info War.
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:45.000]  The remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  So we've got GAB with its site that's got liberals, conservatives, Christians, gays, everybody on it.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  It's an old fashioned American style site.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  As long as you don't threaten to kill somebody or try to sell drugs or something you're able to be on their post illegal pornography.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  And they're calling it a Nazi site.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  I mean they've gone from just calling Trump a Nazi to saying I'm the unalloyed racist.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  They never show the proof. That's all they've got because they want to ban conservatism, ban Christianity in America.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  That's the amended plan. They know their political systems failed. What do you do when your system fails?
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  You go the Nazi model, you go to the Communist Venezuelan model, you go to the authoritarian model.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  And we have the creator of GAB, the social network here with us.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  We have Mike Cernovich joining us as well.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  I wanted to play a clip for both of them before we get into the story where Mike Cernovich is under attack
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  and where Hillary Clinton's lawyers threatened Mike Cernovich with frivolous Pepe lawsuit.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  They don't even hide the fact that it's her law firm.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  Just like it's Obama's law firm that already sued me once and is suing Roger Stone.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  I mean, folks, you want us to fight? Listen, we're fighting.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  And by the way, we're not bitching and complaining we're under attack.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  It makes us really fight harder and get up earlier in the morning.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  At least it does me. And I was talking to Mike Cernovich last night.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  We'll talk to Andrew Torba of GAB here in a minute and see if it's done that with him.
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  But I mean, it lets you know how real this is.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  I mean, they lie about you. They demonize you. They want to arrest you.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  They try to hype stuff up so people kill you and they dump hot coffee on you.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  And they're just, their kids come up and cuss at your reporters and just scream F you.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  And they all celebrate it. I mean, they're trash.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  They have taken our kindness for weakness.
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  So that's coming up in a moment. But first, I mentioned this earlier, but it's so bombshell.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  Hillary has come out and has said that she needs the same weapons as Fox, Breitbart and Info Wars.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  So we have the same weapons. We need more investment. You have Hollywood.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  You have all the comedy shows. You have all the major newspapers, all the major TV channels.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  Fox is now anti-Trump at the time. You've got 90% of the media or more.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  And then you're wanting to isolate the president from Breitbart and Info Wars,
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  because we'll show you where the Democrats admit they're spying on out of one side of their mouth
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  and then say they aren't the next day.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  And there's another clip. She says she won't rule out questioning 2016 election.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  They're planning. They wrote a white paper. Then they wrote two.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  Then they wrote three, and they didn't publish these in the high school newspaper.
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  They published these in Pentagon Papers. They published these in Atlantic Monthly,
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  New Yorker Magazine, Financial Times of London, and Foreign Affairs.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  I mean, they are walking their plan around.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  And then I get high-level CIA people on. They're like, oh, Alex, they're a bunch of scum.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  They'll never get away with it. We do the killing around here.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  I hear a lot of arrogance out there about people in the deep state that they're winning the Civil War against the globalists.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  That is really pride-goat-before-fall, and I'm sick of the endemic arrogance of people in deep state.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  I'd be ashamed to be involved in all that.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  And the actual bureaucracy. One thing if you were a soldier or something, I'd admire that if you had good morals.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  But it's just incredible. So here's that first clip.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  Hillary saying they have these weapons, but she has nothing.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  Nothing's ever your fault, is it, you monster? Here it is.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  I don't understand why people who share our views aren't more willing to invest in media that can be competitive.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  Because what you've got is a right-wing advocacy propaganda,
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  and you've got a kind of mainstream media that engages in false equivalency.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  So she doesn't think the media leans left. She wants an actual liberal media infrastructure.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  No, no, no. Let's stop right there. As if CNN and MSNBC aren't, and they edited it down in that piece.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  If you read the full quote, it's got the quote from the radio show she was on where it says,
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  we ought to find that from the original podcast, where they say Breitbart in Full Wars.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  They don't even want those names on CNN.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  Brian Stelter, the Humpty Dumpty, with his no viewers, we're talking 100,000 viewers maybe, is up there telling the world
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  that what she wants is a liberal advocacy. That's never existed before.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  No, it's you lying and saying you aren't when 97% of your Trump coverage is negative and you're a bunch of damn liars.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  I mean, this is amazing. Here's the other clip.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  This is a Clinton saying that she wouldn't rule out overturning the election. See? See? They're only getting ready. Here it is.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Would you completely rule out questioning the legitimacy of this election if we learn that the Russian interference in the election is even deeper than we know now?
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  No, I would not. I would say...
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  You're not going to rule it out?
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  No, I wouldn't rule it out, but I also...
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  So what are the means, like, this is totally unprecedented in every way, what would be the means to challenge it if you thought it should be challenged?
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  Basically, I don't believe there are. There are scholars, academics who have arguments that it would be, but I don't...
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  I don't think they're on strong ground, but people are making those arguments.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  I just don't think we have a mechanism. You know, the Kenya election was just overturned.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  And really what's interesting about that, and it might be... I hope somebody writes about it, Teri.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  The Kenyan election was also a project of Cambridge Analytica, the data company owned by the Mercer family that was instrumental in the Brexit vote.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  There's now an investigation going on in the...
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The evil Mercers don't want the Muslims to take over Kenya and blow up the shopping malls.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  The evil Mercers are involved wanting England to have its freedom.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  Oh, my gosh, and an analytic thing to let them target conservative voters and get them out to vote, as if you don't have all that.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  Now, let's go to the founder of GAB, openly being censored.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  And we're going to the great patriot broadcaster and investigative journalist, Mike Cervus, who I've shot down with us, and then Jack Mesobit as well,
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  because we're all vindicated about the spying with the wiretaps.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  What do you make of all this? Where do you go next?
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  And just for new viewers, describe what Google's doing to you.
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  Yeah, so I think it's absolutely absurd what she's saying, being that she has not only the media, not only Wall Street, but also Silicon Valley on her side,
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  and she's still lost.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  What Google has done to us and what Apple has done to us is they have prevented us from actively participating in the marketplace.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  They have exercised anti-competitive behavior and prevented us from getting our mobile apps into their app stores.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  Now, they claim that we have hate speech or objectionable content on our site.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  This, again, is third-party user-generated content.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  It is not content that is generated by GAB.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  And what I would argue is that there is ISIS propaganda, there is child pornography, there is illegal transactions.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  All of this stuff that is far worse than anything you can claim about GAB is happening on Facebook, on Twitter, and everywhere else.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  And under the Digital Millilium Act, you're protected just like they are.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  They're just excluding you in discriminatory action, claiming third parties make you guilty by extension.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  Absolutely, which is why we're suing them, because we tried taking them on in the free market.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  And what we learned is that the free market is not free. It is rigged.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  It is owned and controlled by a duopoly of these two companies who, you know, have 98% of the market under their hand.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  And I agree. I'm not a litigious person, but we have to move against them.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  So they're kicking your apps off just like they did Breitbart.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  They're not letting you have access just like they're starting to do to us.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  Joe Rogan, you know, was basically told they removed his podcast, blocked it.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  The number one when I was on, and they just, you know, basically send the signal,
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  you have Alex Jones on, we'll just ban you.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  Well, if people give into that, it's game over, folks.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  And Joe can say, well, they didn't actually tell me that.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  No, they just didn't let the number one podcast in history be at the top and don't even list it in the top 100
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  and blocked it and wouldn't upload it for two days and all the rest of it.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  No, this is what these dirtbags do, and it's dangerous.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Absolutely. And, you know, the way that they're attacking us now is they're going after domain registrars.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  You know, a lot of people don't understand that to put a website on the Internet,
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  it's just not, you know, you don't click your hands and it happens.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  You need infrastructure. You need a domain registrar.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  You need a hosting provider. You need payment processors.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  And they've hijacked the infrastructure of the infrastructure,
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  since it got handed over to this U.N. King Lombard.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Just like Soros said in the WikiLeaks, they're now doing it.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  Absolutely.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  President Obama signing over ICANN to the U.N. was one of the biggest mistakes in U.S. history.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  We no longer have the First Amendment protection,
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  and ICANN is now, you know, governed by the shadow entity of the U.N.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  And Google and Facebook and Twitter, they all argue, hey,
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  we're under international agreements now, just like Germany, we're banning hate speech.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  Well, that's what's going on, is that the German hate speech laws are being applied to the entire Internet
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  and enforced and imposed upon U.S. citizens who have First Amendment protections.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  Ah, yes, good. Da, I guess Da would be Russian. Yeah.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  I tell you, this is just giving me a headache, because you can see the whole thing happening.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  And the rank-and-file left used to be pretty decent people.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  They now know it's a takeover, and most of them like it and enjoy it,
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  and are living vicariously through the tyranny and getting off on it,
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  even as more and more mainline liberal sites that aren't establishment-owned
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  are being sucked up and censored as well.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  Absolutely. I mean, we've seen liberal support us.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  We've seen centrists, libertarians, obviously folks on the right.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  I think our registrar was a very big wake-up call.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  You know, it's like, wait a minute, this type of stuff has never happened before.
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  A registrar threatening to seize our domain because we have hate speech on a website?
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  It's absurd. There's hate speech all over the Internet.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  Yeah, you can go to YouTube or Google right now and hear Alex Jones as an effing Jewish agent.
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  You know, hope he dies. And, you know, usually that's something left as bot doing it.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  But you're going to ban YouTube because somebody put a comment on there.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  This is selective racketeering. Stay there.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  I want to bring in Jack Pesovic in a few minutes.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  We're going to have a little bit in the next hour with the other guys.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  We're going to let Andrew Torbel leave here soon, but Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  They have a free-for-all discussion where this is going to Mike Sernovich.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  Mike, we've got it up on screen.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  You've got Hillary's law firm threatening to sue you. It's up on your medium website.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  Threatening to sue you for using Pepe the Frog, sharing other people's graphics and articles.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  A pre-control telling you you can't use something because you're a white supremacist.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  That's the number one slander. Number two, under political fair use,
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  you have 100% authorization to use whatever you want.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  You're a lawyer. We talked for an hour last night.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  Your lawyers have confirmed.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  I mean, under the slap statute of California, you've got them.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  What are they thinking?
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  Yeah, this is just a way to go after me for Hillary Clinton's revenge.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  The things that they did that they talked about those Pepe images, I didn't even create them.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  I just commented on them as, hey, look, there's this image at Breitbart.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  It's kind of cool. That was an image, the original image from Breitbart.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  They're saying you can't comment on somebody's image.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  Let's put what you commented on.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  Let's look at the thought crime that they list in the lawsuit, the lawsuit threat.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  Never miss a story and it goes on.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  There's the evil article.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  So I just linked to a Breitbart article, used a Breitbart image.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  And the thing that's weird about it, Alex, and the reason I know this is a Hillary Clinton deep state operation,
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  is I'm not even a Pepe guy.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  I'm not a, you know, Keckistanian.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  I never got into that Keckistan stuff.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  I'm glad that other people are doing it and having fun.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And I think it's kind of amusing.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  But nobody even thinks of me as being a Pepe person.
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  So what's happening, here's what they're finding out.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  I don't do anything illegal.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  I don't do anything shady.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  I don't do anything dodgy.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  So they're going to have to just drum up some frivolous lawsuit and find some way to try to crush me,
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  because they can't do it lawfully.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  But what they have to understand is that lawfare is economic terrorism.
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  Filing a frivolous lawsuit is a death threat,
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  and they're trying to destroy a person's livelihood and destroy that person's family and to kill that family.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  And there are major laws about trying to keep people from the market or shutting down their free speech for their political views.
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  And so they're really going for broke.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  Yeah, again, law, lawfare is terrorism.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  And I'm treating, I treat any frivolous lawsuit threat on me as an act of terrorism as a death threat against me,
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  because that's the only way to understand it is that, hey, you can't actually find me doing something wrong.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  If they take your speech, then they take your life.
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  That always happens.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  Exactly. I've said, where is it going to end?
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  Are people now finally paying attention?
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  They want to murder our children.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  I don't know how many times I have to say it.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  They want to murder our children.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  They want to destroy our lives.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  They want to crush us.
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  And we have to do something about this.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  Did you see this top vaccine lady in Texas over a vaccineing kid saying we want to kill all the white people?
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  And she's a white lady. She actually says it.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  Yeah, I mean, they say that in the open.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  But then if you go and say that they actually want to commit white genocide, they go, aha, we caught you.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  You're actually racist. No, I'm reporting on what other people are saying.
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  It's caught on all the universities that whites are evil.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  I mean, you basically, you got, you got the self-propelled stomach.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  Michael Moore saying it'll be better when all the whites are gone.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  All we're saying is, if you said get rid of all the blacks, we'd be against it.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  It's like, what the hell's going on here?
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  Yeah, I oppose black genocide, Jewish genocide.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  I oppose the Armenian genocide.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  And everybody knows that. Everybody knows the white supremacists don't like you.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  Everybody knows they don't like me.
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  Then why are they saying we're white supremacists?
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  Because my lawyers tell me we're going to win these lawsuits.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  But yeah.
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  Yeah, I might have to sue Bloomberg.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  The thing is, Alex, I don't believe in defamation lawsuits because they're a big time suck.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  They're a big waste of energy.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  There's so many other ways.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  Sure, but when they start trying to keep you from being able to show political speech and violate your civil rights,
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  you've got a really good suit there.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  Yeah, that's the thing. I don't go around threatening people with lawsuits.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:42.000]  And moreover, if this Matt Fury Pepe guy just emailed me and said, hey, dude, I don't like you.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  Would you please never post anybody's Pepe work?
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  I would just ask a human being to say, sure, I don't care that much about it anyway.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  I don't even know. Nobody thinks that.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  Yeah, but you can't do that because we have 100% right to show Kermit the Frog or any other green frog we want in our political show.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  It's not like I start a business and put a frog called Pepe the Frog out, you know, as my business and this guy trademarked it.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  Yeah, I'm not selling Pepe the Frog comic books.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  And again, the image that I did was from Breitbart and it was non-commercial on commenting on an image from another website.
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  And they also talked about the little video you made with Hillary saying Trump was breathing over showing a frog.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  It's funny. It's your speech. It's satire. 100% protected.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  Yeah, and I didn't even make that. And I just posted it because somebody sent it to me as like a fan video.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  Exactly. So they don't have a leg to stand on. What are you planning to do?
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  Because I think you got to, I think this is a very strong slap suit here just for the intimidation, the threatening you, the intent to do harm to you, the intent to cause you anxiety, the attempt to terrorize your speech, the attempt to racketeer and block your speech.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  Yeah, the big thing I'm focused on now is we have to find out why Facebook and Google are opposing the Stop Online Human Trafficking Act.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  So this is actually a big story.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  Exactly. They're supporting people with trafficking, but they want to ban Christians.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  Let's tell folks about that and then we'll get the founder of Gab's take on it.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  Yeah, so this segues perfectly into what we're talking about, which is that Google and Facebook, they want to ban us and censor us and ban us from the internet for political speech.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  But right now Congress is holding hearings on a very important law that would protect children from being molested and raped.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  Google and Facebook have hired lobbyists to fight this law.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  And this just recently, the Washington Post is even fired up. Even the Washington Post published an article, September 18th, I linked to it on my Twitter, where they're going, why are they supporting pedophilia?
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  So I now call Facebook pedo book. They are pedophile and neighbors. Google is pedophile supporters. We need to get the message out.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  Because look, Google and Facebook don't say, well, we support free speech. You can say whatever you want.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  Exactly. We don't have op-eds for underage girls on Info Wars or Gab. Why are they trying to block us when we're when we're doing nothing but promoting the American way of life?
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  Right. So if you want to buy an ad to sell children on Facebook and Google, they say that you should have the right to do that and Congress shouldn't be able to stop that because it's free speech.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  But if you or I want to post a video or a meme or a jiff or a cartoon frog, they go, no, no, no, this is very important. So here's what happened, Alex.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  They have chosen to censor us. That means anything they do not censor, they endorse. Therefore, Google and Facebook support pedophilia and child pornography.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  That's right. They've destroyed their protection of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that said third party stuff's not your problem as long as you respond to the proper agencies.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  But instead, they're blowing away all of that giant frenzy power grab. They've made your miscalculated. Great point. We'll be back.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  So what's your favorite soap?

[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  Google lets people sell Nazi flags but then won't let us sell a DVD exposing Obama.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  Right, absolutely, and you can go on Google and search for anything in the world and find it. You can find hate speech all over the internet.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  And if the planet is threatened by toothless Nazis, we're threatened by big global combines like Apple that own giant slave factories. They're the monsters, they're the scum.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  Yeah, these people are disgusting, Alex. I mean, again, the double standards, the hypocrisy, the lies, it's all on full display for the public and there's nothing they can do to stop it.

[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  I want to finish up with him being threatened to be sued by Hillary's law firm because he linked to a frog over a grave saying GOP.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  Yeah, that's who these thugs are. They think they're going to bully us into submission. Not going to happen. We'll be back with the fourth hour.

[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  You're living through it. Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  Biden Shotgun with us, Jack Pasobic. I had so many guests over there, I'm like 30 minutes behind, so I want to thank all our guests for waiting and you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  What's going on with them readying indictments for Manafort having to admit they've been illegally spying on Trump and everybody else.
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  They want to try to use that in court after denying it. Cumbicott perjuring himself, wall-to-wall insanity, massive Google censorship.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  Just what is going on from your educated, informed view.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  Alex, what we're seeing here is a full court press by Mueller and his team to put pressure on Manafort and not just Manafort, but anyone else who was associated with the Trump campaign and anyone else that's even working in the White House right now.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  They're trying to institute a chilling effect on policy, on Trump supporters, from walking forward, from working with the president, from getting things done.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  What they've done is they've had Paul Manafort under wiretap surveillance. They had it done during the campaign. They had it done during the transition.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  This is information that I reported all the way back in July and I know Alex, you guys have been talking about this.
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  I specifically had the nugget that Manafort was their target during the Trump Tower meetings.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  Put that out. Now, the mainstream media runs around and said, oh, you guys are fake news. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't have real sources.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  Well, two months later, they're now forced to admit it was true because as part of Mueller's new plan, see, they thought they could just get them on the wiretap.
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  They thought they would have evidence on the wiretap and that would be enough.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  And then they wouldn't actually have to disclose it because it would all be covered by FISA and would be considered part of the classified investigation.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  However, now they don't have anything. They actually have to admit it when they go forward because they want to introduce any of this stuff to a potential grand jury later or potentially released out in open court.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  It's all going to come true. So that is why CNN is forced to admit this. That is why CNN is putting out the report now.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Even after Trump, of course, tweeted it out back in March, we reported it back in July that it was Manafort that they were targeting.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  Now the media is forced to come clean because Mueller is going again and again with trying to just these phishing expeditions going out there, has nothing.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  The FISA judge even came back and at one point revoked the FISA warrant because there was a lack of evidence.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  I'm like, did you hear that Mueller? Lack of evidence. You don't have anything.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  He's just trying to make a big stink to make it seems like he has something to get Manafort to cut a deal or to potential shake. What he's trying to do, Alex, is shake the tree.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  No, exactly, but I'm sick of the arrogance and the discernment used in law enforcement where you really, really make a big stink as if you're on to something.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  You're on to people to see if others will come forward. If others will flip on the president and come forward with different things that are out there to go against him.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  Sure, it's just not true. Exactly. We know they're shaking the tree, but they're the crooks.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  They're the ones that have done a thousand times what they claim Trump has done and forget just political tit for tat.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  I'm sick of watching them arrogantly walk around with all those Democrat lawyers when Mueller walks in like he's so powerful, like thugs in high school.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  He goes, yeah, Mueller, yeah, Mueller. Then he goes, oh, it's Mueller. Oh, he's God. He'll get Trump. I'm just sick of these criminals and all the crap.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  They've got child kidnapping and trafficking and Islamic terror and Clinton corruption. They've covered up. I mean, Mueller is one of the most evil people in America.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  No, I agree with your characterization as a school. It kind of reminds me of Animal House and Dean Wormer. It's like it's like he's got Dean Wormer is putting Manafort on double secret probation now.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  And Manafort can't know what's going on. I'm going to put you on probation.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  Even CNN admits that Mueller's done illegal stuff. I mean, just totally dangerous with rampaging around like he's God.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  I just think Mueller is just an idiot. I'm so sick of him coming up to Clinton's. We're going to be right back. We got Jack
[03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:10.000]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth.
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information, and in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing. And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:36.000]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  We've got articles on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com where you can't make this up. They're mad that Trump didn't mention Russia in his UN speech.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  No, he just mentioned sovereignty and respecting nation states and getting back to that. Here's a Kit Daniels article on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  LA Times complains deported illegals overloading Mexican government. It's okay to overload us, but don't overload Mexico with their own people.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  Recently deported illegals are overloading the school systems in Mexico. That's funny. The LA Times is reporting after ignoring the fact that illegals were doing that in the U.S. for years.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  It's like they write this intentional comedy, but it's not. It's unintentional. The total political correctness where they had that finished police chief go, it is good to have terrorists in our schools to teach our children diversity.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  That's a quote. And I'm reading these headlines like, police chief says we need terrorists in our schools. That's a quote. Then there's video of it.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  But again, once your stock comes down, it's like one of the heads of the Texas vaccine program from Baylor. Those whites are evil. We need to kill all the whites.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  They're bad people. They don't comply with government. She's a white lady because whites are the number one group not getting vaccines.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  And she goes, I'm a minority white. I'm proud of it. It's like this thing. I'm anti white. I'm proud of it. Well, just lady. It's okay. You mental patient.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  Maybe you grew up with racist parents. I don't know. So now you've got to go the other direction where you sound like some kind of, you know, UFO cult or something.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  You've gone crazy and you've got a cult of following corporate orders and making us submit no amount of censorship, no amount of any of us going to do it.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  Paul, you got the Russian narrative imploding. Even as Mueller gets ready with his kangaroo indictment from the swamp, from the District of Columbia.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  You've got all this incredible stuff happening. We're totally vindicated on the illegal spying, perjury by Brennan, by Comey, illegal leaking.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  Just, I mean, the amount of news coming out. Pelosi, I haven't played this in a rally where she's saying, Trump's going to do DACA and legalize you all. They go, screw you, white devil.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  I mean, she's like shaking. I'm going to play it in a minute. She goes, but you don't want DACA. I just, I'm a billionaire since I got in office.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  I just want to swindle everybody and get more Botox in my brain. It's a Hispanic hate group. There's nothing you can do to ever make them happy.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  They're a creation of the CIA. They're useful idiots. Just like any white supremacist group. So, Paul, we've entered the vortex here.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  What do you got coming up today? What are you going to be covering before we finish up with Pesovic and Mike Sernovich?
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  Got a ton of stuff to cover, Alex. We've got the Antifa professor who literally says he's a member of Antifa calling for dead cops.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:44.000]  He hasn't even been fired yet, but you're talking about Russian hysteria. The anti-Pelosi protests, the dreamers, you know, heckling Pelosi yesterday, which he covered.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  They had a Democratic Senator come out, Gene Shaheen, come out on CNN today and say that those protests by would be illegal immigrants or at least illegal immigrant supporters were organized by Russia.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  She actually said that those anti-Pelosi protests, which are far from right-wingers protesting her, obviously, that is the work of Vladimir Putin.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  Excuse me, I haven't seen this yet, but I see them putting the Hill newspaper up. You're telling me Pelosi and the Democrats that created the LaRica and Quista Hispanic KKK mental patient chip on the shoulder movement of babies.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:38.000]  You're telling me that this loser group, she's blaming Trump and Russia? I mean, you're kidding.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  No, they should have the clip. I sent them the clip earlier. This is a Democratic Senator Gene Shaheen who said this on CNN today. They've got the clip if you want to play.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  Yeah, we've got it right now. Let's go ahead and play this crazy lady before we go to the clip from yesterday where Pelosi's like, we're going to legalize you, huh? You don't want Dreamer?
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  I mean, it's like, no, lady. It's like, James Bond, do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die. We're a KKK group. We're scum.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  You created us, lady. You gave birth to us there at the toilet bowl. Here's the clip Paul's talking about.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  To believe that we need to do something to protect the Dreamers, and that's what I'm certainly going to continue to work on.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  But again, I'm just confused about why they're holding Nancy Pelosi at fault here. Do they not like that she's working with the president to do this?
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  Listen, you'll have to ask them who knows who's stirring up this kind of animosity. What we know about the Russians and their interference in the 2016 elections is that they tried to increase divisions within this country.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  We saw it again in Charlottesville. So we don't know what's behind this. But what we do know is that we need to take action to protect the Dreamers to allow them to stay in America.
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  This is Paul. We are seeing total mental illness.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  I mean, it's gone absolutely rampant now, this Russian hysteria. Alex, I got one that's even worse. I don't know if you covered this earlier, but I just tweeted it out. They can try and grab it.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  I think it's linked by Investigate Russia, an account on Twitter, which is I think it's linked with the actual Russian investigation. I'll have to check that. But it's Morgan Freeman in a PSA saying we are at war with Russia and that President Trump needs to come out and call out Russia.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  Morgan Freeman? Morgan Freeman, yeah. Guys, grab it off at Prison Planet and then retweet it at Real Alex Jones. This has reached biblical proportions. Let's bring in Jack Masoby here for a final comment on this insanity.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  I got to be honest with you, Jack. In a sick level, this is incredibly entertaining. I mean, I can hardly sleep now watching weirdo, senile dingbats claim Russia attacked Korea.
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  The islands float. They think George Bush is still president, and now the Russians run Mecha and La Raza. No, the Ford Foundation and the CIA do. This is next level, man.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  We saw this as well with whoopie Goldberg on the view not too long ago when she claimed Antifa was really Trump supporters dressing up and attacking themselves to make it look like they were being attacked by the alt left.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  This, in 20 years, Alex, we're going to look back. History will look back at this time period and we'll talk about Muellerism, the way we used to talk about McCarthyism.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  That's what it's becoming. It's getting to be a parody of itself. They are reaching unbefoored, untold, intolerable levels of conspiracy theory hysteria.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  Unfortunately, when you hear that kind of stuff from United States Senators' mouths, that is the mouth of the people that want to put us on a war footing with Russia.
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  That is what this all is leading towards. That is what they want. Regardless of if they want war or not, they want it to spend money so they can buy military supplies and build up the military surplus.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  That is the goal with this. Hopefully, and I pray to God this doesn't happen, that Mike Childs don't see it someday, war between the US and Russia. It would be World War Three.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  What do you make of this new thing? Paul tweeted out at Prison Planet that we're going to play in a minute, Morgan Friedman saying we're now at war with Russia.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  It's one thing to have the failed sportscaster and actor over at Esquire screaming Russians come over and over again, Keith Oberman.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  But Morgan Friedman, who sometimes says some pretty sensible things about all the race-fading.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  It's dangerous. It's very dangerous because if you look at the characters, they have Morgan Friedman play in these movies.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  He always plays a character that's either God or the president or this huge source of reliability.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  So he's seen as this overall authority figure that we should all respect and that we should all listen to.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  That's who Morgan Friedman always plays. That's who people are conditioned to see him as in these films.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  And now when he comes out and you hear the very famous, right, the Morgan Friedman voice, the one we all know and love from Shawshank Redemption,
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  now seeing we're at war with Russia when no shot has been fired from Russia at the United States or vice versa.
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  No war has been declared that I know Muara from Putin on us. It is a stalemate and it should remain a stalemate.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  It is a daytime issue.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  Well, you know what's happening. You know what's happening.
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  But war, that is not something I want to be conditioned to see.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  Globalists have taken the whole world over. There's only a few sovereign countries, the U.S. and Russia and a few others.
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  And so they want to play two final sovereign nations, two so-called Christian nations, still have the seed of Christianity, the potential.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  They want to play us off against each other.
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  Jack Pasobic right there on Twitter and all the great work you do. Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:52.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  All right, we're going to go back to Paul Watson and then Mike Cernovich here in a moment. But first, since Paul brought this up, retweet it.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:04.000]  It is right now at Prison Planet. We're going to get an article up. This is insane.
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  The voice of God, Morgan Friedman, says we are at war with Russia. Russian scum. Here's the clip.
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:18.000]  We have been attacked. We are at war.
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  Imagine this movie script. A former KGB spy, angry at the collapse of his motherland, plots a course for revenge.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  Taking advantage of the chaos, he works his way up through the ranks of a post-Soviet Russia and becomes president.
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  He establishes an authoritarian regime. Then he sets his sights on his sworn enemy, the United States.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  And like the true KGB spy, he tries to get their birth rates up, secure their border, and save their country and promote Christianity.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  Like an evil KGB spy, he tries to defeat ISIS and al-Qaeda, murdering Christians all over the Middle East.
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Like a true KGB spy, he tries to deploy technology to the third world.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  Russia can't even stabilize itself. It's trying to. The globalists are trying to bully it into submission, just like us.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  That's the only Russian connection. Morgan Friedman, look at this guy.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  I mean, what is CIR? Crap Info Royale, committee to investigate Russia.
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  Isn't that the group with the actress that they keep putting on Fox News that it turns out is like an actress?
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:37.000]  It just makes, oh my God. This is what the CIA comes up with.
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  Morgan Friedman, that we're at war with Russia because Trump wants to get the stock market going and build our military.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, but play the rest of the clip. God almighty.
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  He secretly uses cyber warfare to attack democracies around the world.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  No proof.
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:00.000]  Using social media.
[03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  Hillary had Google, Facebook, Twitter, all the other sites, Dig, Reddit, all attacking. They had Hollywood.
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:11.000]  They had all the major networks. They had all the big banks. They had the corrupt Vatican.
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:15.000]  They had the corrupt Saudi Arabians. They had all the EU, all the Mexican government.
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.000]  Everybody gang up and say, you can't have Trump. You can't have a stock market. You can't have jobs.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:29.000]  We sold your jobs off. You sit there and you tag it and you can't be a Christian and we run your kids and families are bad.
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  And now you're telling me it wasn't us that did it, Morgan. It was the Russians. Good lord.
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:39.000]  Man, man, they're making their move. Here it is.
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  The world. Using social media to spread propaganda and false information.
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:48.000]  It confesses people in democratic societies.
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:58.000]  We said it was illegal wiretapping. We've been proven correct. We're not the fake news.
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  I mean, I'm sorry. Finish up with Morgan Freeman. Here it is.
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:12.000]  It is to distrust their media, their political processes, even their neighbors. And he wins.
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:18.000]  Vladimir Putin is that spy and this is no movie script.
[03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  We need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say,
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:38.000]  My fellow Americans, during this past election, we came under attack by the Russian government.
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:50.000]  I've called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  The free world is counting on us for leadership, but 241 years.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  Our democracy has been a shining example to the world of what we can all aspire to.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  And we owe it to the brave people who have fought and died to protect this great nation and save democracy.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  And we owe it to our future generations to continue the fight.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  Join the committee to investigate Russia. Join the fight.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  Wow. I mean, you talk about a load of horsemen.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:30.000]  Paul Watson and Mike Cernovich. Paul, I mean, this is next level.
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  And then we're going to go back to Mike Cernovich. What the hell do you make of this?
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  I mean, this is totally made up, totally insane and just states a bunch of lies as if it's fact.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:45.000]  And Trump even played along and went, OK, maybe Russians did. It's wrong. OK, more sanctions. Russia, you're bad.
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  And then still go in there, repudiate it, say your election's a fraud.
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  That's how Hillary, who admitted today, she wants to overturn the election.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  That's what they're trying to maneuver. I got to give Morgan Friedman and the CIA left us this.
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  They are some bold bastards, Paul.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  Well, this is the truth about this clip, Alex.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  Put out by the committee to investigate Russia. You asked who was behind it.
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  This is a non-partisan group, right? That's what they found on the website.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  Oh, look at the advisory board. It's James Clapper once again.
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  Well, look at the symbol. It's the same as the same font as CFR.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  Oh, they think we're dumb. It's the CFR right there.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  It's the Central Intelligence Republic or whatever. Oh, they think we're dumb.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  Oh, Alex, the first name they list on this advisory board is Max Boot, top CFR globally.
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:42.000]  This is the globalist literally putting out a clip saying we're at war with Russia.
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  And it's James Clapper. And in this clip, they're whining about fake news.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:53.000]  Clapper literally got an NBC with Chuck Todd and said they never surveilled anyone in the Trump administration.
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  He's the genesis of fake news and they say that we're fake news in this clip.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000]  Oh, and by the way, we're at war with Russia.
[03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  How much do you think they paid Morgan Friedman to do this?
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  I don't know at this point. But again, it's like Jack was saying, he's associated with positions of authority.
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  That's why they chose it.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:16.000]  Yeah, they admit Rob Reiner runs this with the CFR just like we thought.
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  Yeah, it's CFR.
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  Hollywood was literally worshipping Russia when it was communist and killing Christians.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  And now they're so pissed that they can't strangle Russians anymore and do ritual magic on their dead children.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  No, it's absolutely ghastly rhetoric, Alex. You've got somebody who's trusted because of course they can't reach people via the news because less and less people are actually watching it.
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  So they have to get a big Hollywood star up there.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  The other organization linked with it is the American Enterprise Institute.
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:53.000]  So again, it's all these never Trump neo-con organizations that are behind this clip.
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  And they're all doing it because they're desperate.
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  I want to get Mike Sertovich to take on this and turn this hour over to Paul, who I want to join me again this week, Paul.
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  Sertovich, what do you make of this next level?
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:06.000]  I think a desperate gambit.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  Yeah, Max Boot wrote an article, the column actually for the LA Times where he defended Susan Rice, even though Susan Rice lied and claimed that she'd never unmasked and spied on people.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  And then when she got caught, she goes, oh, I did it for the good thing.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  This is wartime propaganda.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  And this proves that Hollywood, which by the way, why isn't Morgan Freeman doing a video on pedophilia in Hollywood?
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  Where is Morgan Freeman's video on the abuse in Hollywood of underage people, boys and girls?
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:40.000]  Why is Morgan Freeman not standing up against pedophiles in Hollywood?
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  Every time you look around, they got nothing to say about that.
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  But then they have a lot to say about conspiracy theories involving Russia.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  What I think is really going on here is Putin is actually very anti-pedophile and has done a lot of things to fight.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  Oh, no, that's what it is. There's a global anti-pedophile network.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  And if you're not for the pedophiles, you're against them.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  And that's what it is. And anybody for the deep state is now a pedophile.
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  Deep state is definitely part of the pedophile networks and they are pro-pedophile.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  There's no question about it.
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  Again, in the earlier segment, we talked about how Google and Facebook have literally hired lobbyists to fight.
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  To allow the advertising of enslaved and kidnapped women on the web.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  So if you want to kidnap a child, chain her to a radiator on the house, beat her up with a whip.
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  And let 10 guys rape her a day and give her age, then shoot her in the back of the head and throw her in a lake.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  It's totally liberal. Just like suicide nets at Foxcom with Apple.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  As long as you're liberal, it's loving.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  Well, they want your ad revenue. Not even that.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  But they'll say, hey, if you want to advertise on the web for molesting children, then go right ahead.
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  You have that free speech, right? But Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson,
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  Jack Bussebeck and Andrew Torva of GAB.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  And nobody else has free speech rights.
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  No, no, no. So they're fighting hard to shut us up.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  Because why? What is the common theme, Alex?
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  If we didn't talk about...
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  We're not pedophiles. We're not psychopaths. We're not in the psychopath club.
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  Yeah. If we quit talking about pedophiles and the pedophile rings, then they would leave us alone.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  That's what this is really about.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  And by the way, you had to pop off for 15 minutes with an emergency call. Any big breaking news?
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  Nothing that I can release, but I'll let you know kind of back channel.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  But there is definitely a... It's embargoed right now.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  But yeah, there's definitely a war on anybody who addresses and attacks the pedophile networks.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  Google and Facebook, pro-pedophiles.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  You just came back covering pedophiles. So I guess your call dealt with that.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  Like, just leave the pedophiles alone. Everything will be all right.
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  Well, I was actually told on a certain case...
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  Oh, by the way, I don't know if we ever covered this segment,
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  but I actually filed a lawsuit to unseal records involving pedophile Jeffrey Epstein
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  and one of his accused madams. I spent $25,000 for that.
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  We lost it trial. It went up on appeal.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  And you'll never believe it, but the Reporters' Committee for a Free Press
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  actually filed an amicus curi brief supporting my argument
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  that I'm entitled to these records about these pedophile networks.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  So I put my money where my mouth is. I'm suing to expose these pedophile networks.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  That's why they want to shut us down. That's why they want to crush us.
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  Google and Facebook, we can now declare with absolute certainty our pro-pedophile,
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  they won't respect our free speech rights. They'll kick us off the Internet.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  But if you go after pedophiles or people who advertise...
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:40.000]  Oh, I know. I've been working with folks high level.
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  And let me tell you, it doesn't matter if you're in the government or not,
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  you expose pedophiles, they come after you big time.
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  Mike Cernovich, wow, Hillary's law firm threatened to sue you over pepper the frog.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  That is certainly rich. Thank you so much, Ed Cernovich on Twitter.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  Always a pleasure, Alex. You know, litigation is just the way it is now.
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  So I'm filing lawsuits. I'm getting sued.
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  And when you do, man, that's why I always thank the people for their support.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  We'd be nothing without them.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:12.000]  Absolutely. Ed Cernovich, support us at infowars.com.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  He's right. Paul Watson's taking over straight ahead.
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  We're skipping the next break after this one, so he gets more time.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  I'm going to turn the baton over to Paul Joseph Watson, who's so awesome.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  Everybody should lobby him to come on every day.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  Big specials in today. Please support us at infowars.com today.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:55.000]  While political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:58.000]  the government uses to control public opinion.
[03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:02.000]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda,
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:07.000]  but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others' ripple effect.
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.000]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:13.000]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple,
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:17.000]  and over time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:24.000]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push
[03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:30.000]  until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming, for example.
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  Then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments through their agenda by calling critics
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:44.000]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv,
[03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:55.000]  and our YouTube channel, Resistance News. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:18.000]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:23.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:27.000]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:33.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[03:31:33.000 --> 03:31:36.000]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:40.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:43.000]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:48.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:21.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:30.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:35.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:38.000]  we have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[03:32:38.000 --> 03:32:42.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:47.000]  at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:18.000]  It's Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson from Herbotanic Majesties London.
[03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:22.000]  We are back. It is a port there, Rod the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:27.000]  Got a ton of news to cover in the final 30 minutes of this broadcast.
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:30.000]  Big article we had up on infowars.com yesterday.
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  Actually, before I get into that, let's just preface it with this.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  This is from an article up on infowars.com today.
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  Paul, by the Brookings Institution, finds that one-fifth of students, they polled students
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:49.000]  at four major US universities, one-fifth of students support using violence to shut down free speech.
[03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  Of course, we had the Ben Shapiro event at Berkeley last week.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  We've got the big free speech week potentially coming up next week.
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  They're still trying to block it and call to Steve Bannon, Milo,
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:07.000]  Ian Opless, a bunch of other big speakers set to attend this free speech week,
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  still trying to block it on dodgy grounds of not having the right security.
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  They're still trying to prevent the First Amendment from being exercised.
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  Now, a new poll conducted by the Brookings Institution has found that 19%,
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  that's almost one in five of students, support the use of violence to shut down offensive free speech
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  over half, 51% support the use of heckling to shut down speakers opposed by protesters.
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  So that's basically deplatforming if the special snowflakes are triggered by a controversial offensive speaker.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:46.000]  That's called authoritarianism, Paul, and that, by the way, in Berkeley,
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  they're not letting them have an indoor speech so the police can let them be attacked.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  Talk about scum.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  Exactly. This poll also found that a clear majority of students, 62%,
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  believe it should be legally required for a group to offer a platform to a speaker
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  with an opposing point of view if that on-campus organization is featuring a speaker
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:10.000]  known for making statements that many students consider to be offensive and hurtful
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  because they're hurt by feelings.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  They literally have safe spaces where they get to cuddle puppies and have crayons for coloring in.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  So again, that's the fairness doctrine. That's basically 62% of students,
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  Paul, saying that they want the fairness doctrine by law instituted
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:34.000]  where for every opinion you broadcast, you give a platform to, you have to give an opposing opinion.
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  So again, this is absolutely frightening.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  44% of respondents in this poll compared to 39% were unaware of the fact
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  that the First Amendment, as defined by the Supreme Court, protects hate speech as free speech
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:53.000]  because of now hate, of course, now hate speech is anything right of Karl Marx.
[03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:55.000]  It's literally Hitler.
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  The majority of respondents in this poll were unaware of that fact.
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  Frightening state of understanding and awareness about free speech on US campuses right now.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  And that's because in some cases, the professors are literally members of ANTIFA,
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  a group that violently attacks people over their free speech,
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  a group that burns signs that say free speech.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  So we had this article up on Infowars.com yesterday.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  ANTIFA professor who bragged about teaching future dead cops,
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  those are his own words, future dead cops,
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  complains about receiving threats.
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:38.000]  Let me read some of the tweets that this professor, Michael Isaacson,
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  tweeted back in August, now they're finally getting attention.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  God, look at that loser.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  He looks like reality winner.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  Give that guy a top security clearance.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:55.000]  Alex, you coined the term, really, you popularized the term chicken necked thug.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  This is the epitome of a chicken necked thug.
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  Look at that neck.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  Look at it.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  But this guy, this is serious.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  This guy is a professor who is an admitted open member of ANTIFA
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  who teaches police officers at John Jay College in New York.
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  He teaches cops.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:19.000]  Listen to what he had to say about cops.
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  These were his own tweets over the last few weeks.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  This is Mike Isaacson, the professor, chicken necked thug.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:32.000]  Some of y'all might think it sucks being an anti-fascist teaching at John Jay College,
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  but I think it's a privilege to teach future dead cops.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  That's what he tweeted.
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  He followed it up with this imaginary violent scenario in which one of the cops asks him,
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  quote, weren't you my econ professor?
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  He responds, see, you had the opportunity.
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  Blade drops.
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  So he's literally imagining himself murdering a police officer in the future
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  who attended some of his classes.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  This guy is completely, completely insane, hysterical.
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:07.000]  He's teaching police officers.
[03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  He's a member of ANTIFA.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  Here's another tweet.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:12.000]  August 16th, Mike Isaacson.
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:17.000]  Well, what's even the point of a cop that isn't dead?
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  This guy is teaching police officers.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  Here's another one.
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  I hope somehow a starter comes up in lecture so a student defends her saying she didn't kill a cop.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  So I can say she probably did.
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  And it's good.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  So who is a starter?
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  Well, he's talking about a starter she caught.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:40.000]  The cop killing domestic terrorist who is on the FBI's top most wanted terrorist list
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:44.000]  who is the foundational guru for Black Lives Matter.
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  They literally chant her name at every Black Lives Matter demonstration.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  She killed a police officer.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  She's on the run.
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  She's in exile in Cuba, I think is.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  The domestic terrorist FBI most wanted.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:01.000]  He's saying that it's good that she killed a police officer.
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  Here's another one of Professor Mike Isaacson's tweets.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  This is from April 6th, how to stop war.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  Shut down weapons factories, kill superior officers, overthrow capitalism.
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  So again, he's talking about-
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  That is a standard Bolshevik playbook.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:21.000]  Exactly.
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  This is a guy who teaches police officers.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  They've put him on administrative leave.
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  He's literally publicly calling for the murder of police officers.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  They haven't even properly fired him yet.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  Even de Blasio Alex, who went out to Angus Hamburg a few months ago to support Antifa basically,
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  even de Blasio came out in New York and said that basically this guy needed to go.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  This has only come about in the last few days as a result of this group called Far Left Watch,
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  which dug into his tweets from a month ago, brought them to public attention.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  He's since got crushed in a debate with Tucker Carlson on Fox News.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  He was also on another Fox News show, I think it was the night after.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  But this guy has not been fired as of yet.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  This is the protection that they're affording to some of these Antifa professors.
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:16.000]  Which shows the majority of the faculty supports it,
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  and that's why he's so arrogant to run around in public trying to organize mass murder.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:23.000]  Exactly.
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  You remember the professor back a few months ago, I think he was at Berkeley as well.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  He smashed the guy over the head with a bike lock.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  Again, Antifa member professor.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  And we wonder why university campuses are creating these lists.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:40.000]  We wonder why this big Baylor professor who's involved in the vaccine of kids says,
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  kill all the white people. She's a white lady.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  It's like some lunatic asylum echo chamber.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  No, exactly.
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  I think we've got that clip ready now, Alex.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  I want to go to that clip.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  This is a professor, and this is only, again, came out recently, Carol J. Baker M.D.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  They were talking about vaccines and the fact that the vast majority of people
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  who refuse vaccines for their children are white people.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:07.000]  And she was like, oh, the immigrants are great.
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:08.000]  They're so good.
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:10.000]  They take all their vaccines.
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  If we could just get rid of white people.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  Here's the insidious thing about this.
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:18.000]  She's an infectious disease expert as well.
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  Dr. Eric Pianca, who talked about Ebola wiping out everyone and they all stood up and applauded.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  And he was an expert in infectious.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  I think it was biological warfare or something similar to that.
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:32.000]  Again, in another Texas college, I think it was.
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  But this is Carol J. Baker M.D.
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:38.000]  He said he can't wait till 90-plus percent are dead with a projection of red skulls behind him.
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  He got a crying three-minute standing ovation by the Texas Academy of Scientists.
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  And that was 11 years ago, maybe even 12 years ago.
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  It was 11 years ago.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  Yeah, this shows how far we've gone.
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  Let's go to the clip of Carol J. Baker at the event in Georgia saying we need to get rid of all the white people.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  Here's the clip.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  I'm complaining because the average pediatrician or internist has 10 minutes for a visit
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  and you want to have them go get media trained?
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  Excuse me.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  Look at this wound back.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  The fight, the battle is being fought.
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:20.000]  One family, one physician, one health center.
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  That's why we're doing as well as we are.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  We're talking about the minority and strategies against the minority.
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  So I have the solution.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers,
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  I'm not talking about, well, hesitance.
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  Most of them we can talk into coming to terms with.
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  You can bully others.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  Because this is the most diverse city in the entire United States.
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  There's seven Asian language spoken in that city.
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:56.000]  This is a virtuous signal.
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  I've been a minority for more than 20 years in the city of Houston.
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  Just kind of an argument for getting rid of white people.
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:04.000]  The majority is, we call it Hispanic.
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  That is not a race or an ethnicity.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  That is a political designation.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  But a lot of them are from Central, South America, Mexico.
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  Immigrants.
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  People you control.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  That's what made Donald Trump's comments about bringing diseases.
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:27.000]  Right.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  When they come here.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  Immigrants.
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:30.000]  The better vaccination rates in Mexico.
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  It is well-educated in terms of pieces of paper that they put on their wall.
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:42.000]  People that have been here a long time, and it's very unfortunate.
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  But I think we need not lose the big picture.
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  Yeah, like the Guatemalans.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  I'm sorry, Paul.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  I can't take over and show so good.
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:58.000]  All the Latin Americans they caught giving syphilis to, that was very loving.
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  But again, these are the people who are teaching our kids, Alex,
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  with literal members of Antifa and people who say kill all the white people.
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  No wonder.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  And while I'm talking about this, if they want to go on my Twitter,
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  there's a picture that I posted today of some creature,
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  some gender fluid creature.
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  I don't know what it is, but the line is professor material right here.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:20.000]  That's the tweet.
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  And it's this creature.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  I don't even know if it's a man or a woman wearing a shirt that says white men are terrorists.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  She, she, he, she or whatever the hell it is, is probably a professor at Berkeley.
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  This Carol Baker's a professor.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:43.000]  We've got this Antifa member who's literally fantasizing on Twitter about killing cops while teaching cops.
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  I'm teaching future dead cops.
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  Isn't it great?
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  It's projection.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:50.000]  It's projection.
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:52.000]  These are losers that hate themselves.
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  They're white.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  So they keep projecting.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  And I keep asking, why is it mainly whites saying kill all the whites?
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  Go ahead.
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:00.000]  Take off.
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  Well, it's interesting you should say that, Alex, because if you want to go back to the
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  Antifa professor with the chicken neck, the chicken necked thug,
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:10.000]  people began making memes out of his chicken neck.
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  For example, putting his head on top of a Pez container, which was particularly good one.
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  But he responded.
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  He was obviously triggered by that.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  He said, oh, you sound like the people in my kindergarten who bullied me.
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  So I thought, oh, that's interesting.
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  That might explain where his entire demeanor and attitude comes from.
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.000]  You see the Pez meme right there.
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  He responded to that.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:35.000]  He was like, oh, that's, this is the intellectual level.
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  But show him on Tucker Carlson above, he has a literal ostrich neck.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  What the hell is that?
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:46.000]  I told you, I've been out of these demonstrations.
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  They either look like goblins or chicken necks.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  Exactly.
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:55.000]  But now, Alex, we've got this article and even a liberal studies professor, there are
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:46:00.000]  a few, there are a few actual classical liberals left called Michael Rexendwald.
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  The headline is one person who is, the headline is, sorry, NYU professor calls on John Jay,
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  college president to terminate Mike Isaacson.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  This is out of far left watch because he hasn't been terminated yet.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  This is the letter that he wrote to the college.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  This is a liberal studies professor.
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:20.000]  I'm a full professor at NYU and a concerned educator.
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  I'm not a right winger, an alt-right winger or even a conservative.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  I'm a firm advocate of academic freedom and the intellectual self-determination of
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:30.000]  university and college faculty members.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  I strongly believe in the US Constitution, the rights endowed each and every one of us
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  by virtue of the Constitution and its first ten amendments.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  I am asking you to terminate the employment of Mike Isaacson, not only for what he has said
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  but also for what he advocates, the infringement of others' rights, even their right to live.
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  Isaacson openly advocates the stripping of rights from those with whom he disagrees and
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  keep a stated mission. They aim to silence and destroy their enemies by any means necessary.
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:04.000]  So you've got huge representatives of COP unions coming out.
[03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:09.000]  You've even got people like De Blasio who by no means is a right winger.
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  And the college still won't do it because he's saying what they're pushing.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  They still won't do it. They've put him on administrative leave.
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  This has been raging since last week. They still haven't fired him.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:26.000]  There's a big petition that's gone out today, Alex, calling for him to be fired.
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  Still haven't fired him. They're clinging on to this.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:32.000]  We'll see what happens. But these kind of people are teaching our kids.
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  No surprise, therefore, that we have this behaviour from students.
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  This is now an article out of campus reform.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:44.000]  Pro-antifa students give the finger to victims of communism.
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  Antifa-supporting students from Clemson University recently expressed their political sentiment
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  by openly mocking the victims of communism memorial on social media.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  So they've got this cute little thing where they find memorial statues
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  that haven't yet been torn down that are homages to victims of communism
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:09.000]  and they give them the middle finger and post it on Twitter because that's so brave, isn't it?
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  So it's literally a monument to the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  and to the freedom of those still living under totalitarian regimes,
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  they gave it the finger because that's edgy, because that's cool.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  They're literally communists who advocate totalitarianism.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  So let me ask you this question, Paul. Let's give this break again more time.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  What happens to these people if they don't take over or if they do
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:38.000]  until I've been in here eating my lunch, messing with my hair?
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  But the point is that what happens to the millions of weird mentally ill ne'er-do-wells that have been created?
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  They all go on to work for Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:54.000]  That's what a lot of them do, especially on the West Coast.
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  That's why we see ridiculous levels of censorship now being intensified on social media
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  because they're doing all these, well, they're doing diversity hires for one,
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  which is people who aren't talented or skillful.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  Or they get national security jobs like reality winner.
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  Yeah, so they're doing that.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  And they're also these chicken-necked thugs, literal chicken-neck thugs,
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  are being given censorship jobs within the new Ministry of Truth,
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  which is Facebook, which is Twitter, which is YouTube.
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:23.000]  So that's where they're going.
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  I mean, some of them are going to grow out of it.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  I had idiotic opinions about the world when I was 16.
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  I actually grew up.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  The fact is they're in arrested development and they've got these teachers
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  telling them that they have the moral high ground,
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  that they're literally fighting fascists and they believe it.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  It's a cult.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  So it's whether they can escape the cult.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  The Kool-Aid is pretty tempting at this point because they're being exalted
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  not only by their own professors, but by the media and the political class,
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  of course, who came out vehemently after Charlottesville and backed Antifa.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:00.000]  Now, since then, some of them have had to reverse that and back away.
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  Some of them haven't.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  So again, they're being given the moral high ground.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  They're being pumped full of this righteous indignation.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  They literally think they're fighting Nazis.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  So they're going to continue with this.
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  And they'll just randomly walk up to like any well-dressed woman
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  and hit her in the head with a bike lock or a club.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  And then it turns out it'll be like some liberal lesbian.
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  They almost kill with a subdermal hematoma,
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  but they just don't care because they just want to kill somebody.
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  No, I mean, I predict soon.
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  I mean, this is like a weathermen's style attitude, right?
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  They're going to start bombing police stations soon.
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  You watch, they're going to start kidnapping and killing people.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  That's the next step.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  I mean, it's an absolute miracle that Antifa hasn't killed somebody already.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  They violently assaulted innumerable people, put them in hospital, vicious attacks.
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  I'm predicting there will be some kind of domestic terror attack
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  and it will be the violent hysterical alt-left responsible for it.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  And when it happens, the media will gloss over it as quickly as possible.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  Well, Paul, I want to disagree with you, but Black Lives Matter, Antifa,
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:05.000]  two different arms of the same Soros machine.
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  They all hype each other up.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  There are hundreds of deaths from the knockout game
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  and whites being killed by brainwashed black racist groups.
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:14.000]  And that just gets glossed over.
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  So I think Antifa as agitators that we've seen kind of at Black Lives Matter events
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  like Ferguson kind of running things, I think they have been causing death.
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  No, if you want to include BLM, BLM have directly been responsible for deaths.
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  I mean, you can talk about Ishmael Brinsley, who said his killing of two police officers in New York,
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:36.000]  where he shot them in the head, by the way, one was Hispanic, one was Asian,
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  was a revenge attack for Black Lives Matter.
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  He actually said that.
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  So he was hopped up on this racial hysteria.
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  Of course, he had the Dallas massacre by a guy who went out and said specifically
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  he wanted to kill white people, ended up shooting, I think, at least one black cop as well.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  Again, that was directly attributable to Black Lives Matter rhetoric.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  Their foundational guru, who is also idolized by this Antifa professor,
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  is a cop killing domestic terrorists.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  Well, what could possibly go wrong?
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:07.000]  Are they going to start killing people?
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:12.000]  Well, yeah, in the case of Black Lives Matter, their rhetoric has led to the murder of cops.
[03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:15.000]  So it's going to lead to the same thing with Antifa.
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  This is coming and it's not going to be long.
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  The only positive development Alex was in Berkeley last week.
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  They had, I think it was a new ordinance or a law that was re-opped.
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:31.000]  It was brought back into line where they could arrest anyone who was wearing a mask or had a weapon.
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  So if you have that in every single state at every protest, if you have that enshrined in law,
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:43.000]  if you're covering up your face at a protest or if you're carrying a weapon, you're subject to immediate arrest,
[03:52:43.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  that is going to shut down Antifa completely.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  Because in New Jersey, the feds are treating them as a terrorist movement anyway, so that could spread as well.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:59.000]  Of course, you have the libertarian argument, should any domestic political group be treated as a terrorist group,
[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:05.000]  maybe not, but at least you could have that law in place, which says if you're wearing a mask, you ain't come into this protest.
[03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  You're going home in a paddy wagon or whatever.
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:09.000]  That worked at Berkeley.
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:14.000]  There was no mass riot because beforehand, the cops at Berkeley were told to stand off.
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:16.000]  People got beat up.
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:18.000]  Well, sure, and that's the next setup they've got for next week.
[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  I'm going to ask you about Deadpool.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  But what they do is, if you sign on to a group that says we believe in preemptive violence to shut down other people's speech,
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  you're like the KKK bombing blacks in the 60s or something.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:32.000]  You've gone out of free speech and are now a terrorist organization.
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  So it's the anti-terror laws that have to be used against them.
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  When they're in these meetings organizing this crap, they'll go, yeah, we're going to kill people.
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:39.000]  We're going to stop speech.
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  Boom, they get arrested.
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:47.000]  And then everybody else gets their rights, they lose theirs because they organize a criminal operation.
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:49.000]  Well, that's what a lot of people call it.
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  A lot of people say it's dangerous because then they could use it arbitrarily against any group and it would be abused.
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:53:56.000]  So that debate's ongoing.
[03:53:56.000 --> 03:53:59.000]  But again, I mean, just look what happened.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  They've caused absolute carnage.
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:06.000]  And now the professors are the ones who are leading the violence and calling for more violence.
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:08.000]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  Alex, I want to move on to some other stories now, though, because we've got about five, six minutes left.
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  We were talking earlier about censorship by Facebook and Google.
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  Meanwhile, they're propping up literal child exploitation and pedophilia.
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:23.000]  This is out of the sun.
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  YouTube accused of cashing in on child exploitation clips while cutting payments from a platform that gives abused women a voice.
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  YouTube has been accused of making money out of child exploitation clips and the clip they mention is a clown injecting a traumatized child with a giant needle.
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  This is like bordering on pedophilia stuff.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  It's monetized.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:48.000]  It's not age restricted.
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  It's monetized.
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  That's perfectly fine on YouTube.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  Oh, but I made a video criticizing modern art.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  That was not only demonetized.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  It was age restricted.
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  Can't criticize modern art.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  No, of course, with the age restriction thing, it prevents it from having that viral spread because people have to sign into their YouTube account just to watch the video.
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  A lot of people don't have a YouTube account, so that's one way in which they push through this censorship.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  Again, all but one of my recent videos on YouTube over the past couple of weeks, they've all been demonetized.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  Again, I've cut out completely all the swear words, still demonetized.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  You've got makeup tutorial videos being demonetized.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:30.000]  So it's not even about political targeting anymore.
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  It's about a complete mess.
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  The fact that they bought into this moral panic, this hysteria, which ramped up after Charlottesville.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:39.000]  Now they're just censoring everything.
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  The algorithm is completely broken.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  It's a complete embarrassment.
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  It's affecting people who aren't even political.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  And they just pretend everything's fine and they just get along with it.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  They don't even bring it up.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  There's a problem.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  They don't even acknowledge it.
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  I'm going to move on to some European news now, though.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  This is out of RT.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  Eiffel Tower goes bulletproof.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  Friends up security at iconic site.
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  Now we heard this was coming down the pipe a few months ago.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  Now work has begun on a bulletproof wall of glass along the base of the Eiffel Tower.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  The measure is part of a multimillion euro effort to improve security at the Paris tourist attraction
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:22.000]  amid the country's ongoing state of emergency.
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  OK, so if Europe had proper borders, it wouldn't need hideous internal borders such as this one.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  The great thing about the Eiffel Tower, what made it great in the first place
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  was that whole area was absolutely beautiful because it was wide open.
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:40.000]  No entrance fee, no barriers, no gates.
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  You could just walk in there, look up at the stunning building.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  This icon of Paris was wide open.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  It was brilliant.
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  No longer.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  Because now we've accepted our cultural enrichment, they literally need to build a wall around it.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  But we can't build a wall around our own country.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  Even though Hungary did and it literally stopped illegal immigration by like 98%,
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  no, we can't do that.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  Breitbart reports, French university suspends all courses due to migrant squatters.
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  The University of Rhimes, Champagne or Den has suspended all courses due to security concerns.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  After around 40 migrants began to squat on the campus only days after classes began.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  Now, this is replicated in numerous cities and towns all across France.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  You can go to Paris and see it.
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:32.000]  Many parts of France literally turning into migrant tent cities.
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  They got a lot of heat over the Calais migrant camp.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  They raised it and all the migrants simply moved into the streets.
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:40.000]  There's no solution to this.
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  They won't deport them.
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  More are coming in.
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  It's an absolute mess.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  One of the bombers, one of the London bombers was a Calais migrant, a refugee,
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:56.000]  that got into the country after going through on the European refugee route.
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  His accomplice was also a refugee, a Syrian refugee.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  It's an absolute mess.
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:05.000]  Europe is under assault.
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  And France, areas of France have been turned into giant open air migrant camps.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  It's a total mess.
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  Luckily, in places like Germany, the AFB is rising.
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  There is some form of backlash.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:21.000]  That's going to wrap it up, though, for the Alex Jones show.
[03:58:21.000 --> 03:58:23.000]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
