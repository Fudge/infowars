[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:32.080]  texas alex jones ladies and gentlemen we are guest free on five five this
[00:32.080 --> 00:40.620]  tuesday fifth day of may 2015 worldwide transmission again thank you so much for
[00:40.620 --> 00:45.780]  joining us we are going to have wide open telephones throughout the three
[00:45.780 --> 00:51.500]  hours because I didn't take any phone calls sunday or yesterday on any issue
[00:51.500 --> 00:59.820]  if you agree if you disagree if you hate my guts if you love me if you have a
[00:59.820 --> 01:05.140]  poem you want to read on air you name it it is free for all tuesday it can be
[01:05.140 --> 01:09.380]  free for all wednesday if we announced it but today is free for all tuesday and
[01:09.380 --> 01:13.100]  we will be taking your phone calls throughout the transmission but the
[01:13.100 --> 01:21.340]  first quadrant of the broadcast today the first hour or so we are going to open
[01:21.340 --> 01:28.580]  the phones up to people that disagree if you truly disagree if you legitimately
[01:28.580 --> 01:33.340]  have a beef with this broadcast if you think that we've gotten something wrong
[01:33.340 --> 01:38.420]  or you think I'm making something up or you want to accuse me of being a 14-year
[01:38.420 --> 01:44.420]  old reptoid from the planet pop tart or a Vatican assassin we would love to hear
[01:44.420 --> 01:50.620]  from you it's just totally wide open free for all today but people that
[01:50.620 --> 01:56.500]  disagree legitimately you are welcome to call in first and we're going to keep
[01:56.500 --> 02:01.180]  the phone lines open now that's always a problem because the network only has
[02:01.180 --> 02:08.260]  six phone lines here at my offices we have what is like 20 phone lines and
[02:08.260 --> 02:14.740]  so perhaps we should fire up our internal phone system and but again don't call it
[02:14.740 --> 02:18.100]  unless you disagree in the first hour because we want to actually let those
[02:18.100 --> 02:22.820]  people get through and I don't want to hear a bunch of satire where people
[02:22.820 --> 02:26.300]  call in and act like they disagree with the broadcast like I think smithy's
[02:26.300 --> 02:29.940]  doing I don't think he's for real we've been sending messages on Facebook that
[02:29.940 --> 02:34.500]  hey I'm smithy I'm being a fake who knows that could be fake I want to hear
[02:34.500 --> 02:38.420]  from the real smithy's out there and they've called before I want to
[02:38.420 --> 02:43.820]  understand your mindset like the folks that are accusing me of being a racist
[02:43.820 --> 02:48.300]  because I don't want to have a civil war with the police and then I'm supposedly
[02:48.300 --> 02:52.260]  siding with police brutality when everybody knows I'm not who actually
[02:52.260 --> 02:56.700]  pays attention to what we do I see the Justice Department that's totally
[02:56.700 --> 03:00.980]  wicked I see all these foreign globalist think tanks and front groups
[03:00.980 --> 03:05.940]  by the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL pushing for what Al Sharpton's come
[03:05.940 --> 03:11.460]  out and promoted Al Sharpton reveals federal agenda quote we need the Justice
[03:11.460 --> 03:20.020]  Department to take over policing that video is on info wars.com totally have
[03:20.020 --> 03:24.740]  the feds in the states as we know it that's already basically happened to a
[03:24.740 --> 03:28.700]  great extent they just want to put the nails in the coffin as states begin to
[03:28.700 --> 03:32.700]  move in the direction of sovereignty so when the feds torch Waco who's gonna
[03:32.700 --> 03:37.860]  oversee them well then it's the UN it's the UN saying we're not legalizing
[03:37.860 --> 03:43.380]  enough illegals and paying for all their welfare and having babies and jobs and
[03:43.380 --> 03:47.340]  the rest of it and letting them vote the most spread leg country in the world
[03:47.340 --> 03:53.220]  immigration sorry about that allegory but it's true and it's not enough and the
[03:53.220 --> 04:01.060]  UN is coming out saying that we need a federal police force under UN control so
[04:01.060 --> 04:04.740]  once you federalize you basically globalized and that's what the occupiers
[04:04.740 --> 04:10.420]  of this country want strangely enough though there's a article in the US say
[04:10.420 --> 04:17.580]  today op-ed area by Glenn Harland Reynolds we should get on the show saying
[04:17.580 --> 04:25.020]  wanna lawless police force federalize it yeah you really want lawless the feds
[04:25.020 --> 04:29.300]  are scary because they basically get away with things more than any other
[04:29.300 --> 04:32.900]  police agency are there big problems with state and locals you bet your
[04:32.900 --> 04:37.420]  bottom dollar some departments are excellent I don't just say it cuz I
[04:37.420 --> 04:41.660]  live here compared to other departments Austin is excellent other areas like
[04:41.660 --> 04:48.700]  Albuquerque night marriage night marriage but it's now being reformed it's
[04:48.700 --> 04:53.900]  kind of hit rock bottom we're gonna hit that huge Jade Helm news huge economic
[04:53.900 --> 05:00.660]  news huge military news it's all coming up you've probably heard a lot in the
[05:00.660 --> 05:05.300]  news recently about Jade Helm the army says it's a harmless drill that uses
[05:05.300 --> 05:09.860]  states like Texas to simulate rugged foreign terrain fine let's take that at
[05:09.860 --> 05:13.620]  face value they're training in an area that simulates the locale where they
[05:13.620 --> 05:18.260]  plan to fight got it with that said if they train where they plan to fight then
[05:18.260 --> 05:22.460]  why do we see military drills in downtown Miami Florida what cave in
[05:22.460 --> 05:26.300]  Afghanistan does that resemble why did we see the military team up with the
[05:26.300 --> 05:30.980]  halo core to run a drill in San Diego California what desert in Iraq does that
[05:30.980 --> 05:34.700]  city look like I'm willing to hear these guys out when they say let's train now
[05:34.700 --> 05:38.900]  so we don't bleed later but that opens up a whole new can of worms when they
[05:38.900 --> 05:43.180]  train in facilities like Fort AP Hill a facility that looks like any American
[05:43.180 --> 05:47.500]  city complete with soccer fields churches and street signs in English
[05:47.500 --> 05:51.380]  presenting even more questions that have yet to be answered check out the new

[08:26.500 --> 08:53.480]  Jones
[08:53.480 --> 08:57.160]  that, but those that are needed to be held accountable.
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.160]  Now you heard it.
[08:58.160 --> 09:05.200]  Al Sharpton last night, and this is what I've been telling you, Obama is the closer, like
[09:05.200 --> 09:08.960]  the closing pitcher.
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.240]  He comes in to reignite racial division in the country.
[09:14.240 --> 09:20.080]  He comes in to make the people basically be so confused and fighting with each other that
[09:20.080 --> 09:23.320]  we're not even aware the country's been conquered by outside interests that totally run the
[09:23.320 --> 09:25.380]  federal government.
[09:25.380 --> 09:31.360]  One of the last hopes is to have the states line up and say no to that outside takeover.
[09:31.360 --> 09:32.840]  Are the states perfect?
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  No.
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.840]  And under our federalist system, the states have half the power, the feds had half the
[09:38.840 --> 09:42.220]  power, and they shared the power.
[09:42.220 --> 09:49.040]  And half of the power was shared by the House in the legislative, the other half by the
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.440]  Senate, and the Senate was appointed by the states by the elected legislature when they
[09:56.440 --> 10:02.040]  got rid of that in 1913 with the 17th Amendment and brought in the income tax and the private
[10:02.040 --> 10:09.400]  Federal Reserve, the globalist foreign banking cartel mothership had landed in the district
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.680]  of criminals and British intelligence began to take the country over completely.
[10:14.680 --> 10:23.720]  In 1922, they set up Pratt House in New York with the express aim of anglifying the United
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.720]  States that have been out of British control for 140 years.
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.200]  And 102 years later, they're in control.
[10:32.200 --> 10:38.440]  That doesn't mean the British people, no, it means the corporate financial Rothschild
[10:38.440 --> 10:45.480]  Sachs Coburg gotha elites starting in the 20s, they began to pay for newspaper and magazine
[10:45.480 --> 10:55.760]  ads promoting Anglophile culture, the queen on tea sets, the coolest asters and Vander
[10:55.760 --> 11:03.040]  Belts would have royalty over to their homes and and and be in the silent newsreels.
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.400]  It was the coolest thing in the world, England had a Hollywood before we even had one.
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.880]  And sent in Anglophile pro British Empire propaganda to where you weren't considered
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.760]  part of the elite, unless you took up all the British equestrian activities and affected
[11:20.760 --> 11:30.240]  what they call today an Atlantic accent that is buffooned and lampooned in Gilligan's
[11:30.240 --> 11:38.280]  Island with Thurston Howell, Thurston Howell, the third, oh, lovey Thurston Howell's wife
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.960]  speaks with a British accent.
[11:40.960 --> 11:43.640]  That's what happened to our country.
[11:43.640 --> 11:52.160]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, we are under that system and are now part of that same
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.960]  global philosophy.
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.560]  That's why we follow the exact same policies under the exact same name run by the exact
[12:01.560 --> 12:03.060]  same people.
[12:03.060 --> 12:07.120]  That's why it's the UK and the United States and the Rockefellers that founded the League
[12:07.120 --> 12:16.960]  of Nations, founded the United Nations, founded absolutely everything.
[12:16.960 --> 12:28.480]  Now continuing here today, let's hear that one more time from Al Sharpton.
[12:28.480 --> 12:38.720]  Al Sharpton telling a press conference what the real goal is.
[12:38.720 --> 12:41.320]  In the 60s, we stopped states' rights.
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.840]  Well, no, really, that was Lincoln decided that the states had been conquered.
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.440]  But then that got reversed in Congress decades later.
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.160]  So they say that guns decided that the federal government has total control.
[12:55.160 --> 12:59.240]  Well, I say that's a tyranny.
[12:59.240 --> 13:05.040]  And I say, let's see you try to use guns again to do it.
[13:05.040 --> 13:12.120]  And I say, we peacefully stand up with ideas and say no.
[13:12.120 --> 13:16.000]  But now Al Sharpton says it's going to be the police.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.560]  And that means your local counties and your cities.
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.720]  That means your sheriffs that the feds have been for 50 years trying to fund initiatives
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.960]  at the state level to have your police departments take over your sheriff's departments.
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.160]  That is backwards.
[13:30.160 --> 13:32.800]  The counties are chartered by the state.
[13:32.800 --> 13:34.640]  The sheriffs are elected.
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.280]  If the municipal government, the lowest level of government, wishes to vote for the citizens
[13:41.280 --> 13:49.360]  to raise taxes to create a police force under municipal law, they are allowed to.
[13:49.360 --> 14:15.200]  The sheriffs department.
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.320]  And the only one to do that, the only group to do that is the federal government.
[14:19.320 --> 14:29.320]  It's self openly run by five foreign mega banks that own the private Federal Reserve.
[14:29.320 --> 14:38.840]  The Bank of England consortium, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.280]  And you look at who owns the stock in those.
[14:41.280 --> 14:46.080]  It's the same private families that own the stock in the private 1913 Federal Reserve
[14:46.080 --> 14:47.080]  Charter.
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.560]  The Federal Reserve is just a private holding company with governmental quasi power, but
[14:51.560 --> 14:59.280]  the shareholders are private and it was in the newspapers in 1913 and never again.
[14:59.280 --> 15:01.440]  It's a state secret.
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.640]  How much the Queen of England's worth or how much the Queen of the Netherlands or the
[15:04.640 --> 15:10.560]  King of the Netherlands is worth, it's a state secret.
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.160]  How much money the Federal Reserve's got and who owns it and when Alan Greenspan gets
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.920]  asked about that when he was the head of the Fed, he says, we're above the law.
[15:20.920 --> 15:22.400]  No one can investigate us.
[15:22.400 --> 15:27.160]  In fact, can we pull that clip up Alan Greenspan says the Federal Reserve's above the law
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.120]  for new listeners.
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.600]  Congress makes the laws.
[15:30.600 --> 15:32.080]  Congress raises the taxes.
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.000]  How did we get to a private bank that calls itself the Federal Reserve?
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.880]  I mean, I could open a federal pizzeria and hire some New York Italians to run it.
[15:43.880 --> 15:52.600]  They'd probably have good pizza, but it wouldn't be federal, just like Federal Credit Union
[15:52.600 --> 15:59.160]  isn't federal or Federal Express isn't federal or Federal ammunition isn't federal.
[15:59.160 --> 16:06.640]  In the old days, a federal bank was trusted because you could redeem gold at them.
[16:06.640 --> 16:14.280]  So old-timers in 1913, who were just a few decades out of the last century and riding
[16:14.280 --> 16:17.960]  around on mules in the desert, they thought that sounded really credible.
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.320]  Well, that's a federal bank.
[16:20.320 --> 16:21.680]  That's what we need.
[16:21.680 --> 16:23.180]  It needs to run it.
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.360]  Not all these robber barons who they had running news articles all over the country saying
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.400]  they were against the Federal Reserve to trick the public into supporting it.
[16:32.400 --> 16:34.680]  They still couldn't get the support.
[16:34.680 --> 16:41.800]  You go back and read the newspapers, so they passed it on December 23 at 11.55 at night,
[16:41.800 --> 16:47.000]  a quorum call of three senators.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.160]  You say how'd they do it?
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.960]  That's the committee system.
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.840]  They got their underlings to vote in committee to let them be able to have a quorum call.
[16:54.840 --> 16:58.720]  They did a quorum call and nobody was there at 11 o'clock at night.
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.400]  They'd all gone away for Christmas to eat turkeys and hams.
[17:04.400 --> 17:06.520]  This is the coup over the country.
[17:06.520 --> 17:12.240]  You got Al Sharpton and George Soros and the White House and the Justice Department who
[17:12.240 --> 17:16.680]  shipped thousands of guns into Mexico, killed thousands of people, hundreds here involved
[17:16.680 --> 17:21.680]  in Benghazi, funding ISIS, every crime you can imagine, saying they're taking over the
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.480]  media, internet kill switches, doubling black unemployment, massively increasing funding
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.280]  for black abortions.
[17:30.280 --> 17:32.800]  You talk about decimating the black community, but it doesn't matter.
[17:32.800 --> 17:38.040]  You look it up there and go at every funeral, Obama sends folks or he goes and Trayvon looks
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.560]  like his son and he cares.
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.920]  Talk about manipulation and now the answer is federalize the police and funny, this happened
[17:49.920 --> 17:55.560]  in Baltimore with the mayor who's one of three mayors on that commission on federalizing
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.360]  police with Obama and it happened in a city where the entire city council, except for
[18:00.360 --> 18:05.560]  one person is black.
[18:05.560 --> 18:10.800]  The police chief last time I checked was black, more than half the force is black.
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.480]  Three of the cops that supposedly killed this guy in wrongdoing are black and then last
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.560]  night there was a backfired downtown Baltimore and people started rioting again basically
[18:22.560 --> 18:29.320]  saying that people got out in the streets and got ready to start going crazy because
[18:29.320 --> 18:31.800]  the police said, okay, we think shots are fired by an officer.
[18:31.800 --> 18:38.760]  They believe the mob of people being manipulated who don't speak for most Baltimoreans.
[18:38.760 --> 18:41.640]  You can see the whole plan unfolding.
[18:41.640 --> 18:45.200]  I told you over and over again and now they're saying it and I can't believe it.
[18:45.200 --> 18:53.840]  Even USA Today has an article, want a lawless police force, federalize it and that says
[18:53.840 --> 19:01.560]  it all because if you have a federal government that's been captured run by foreign interest
[19:01.560 --> 19:07.920]  following UN treaties, shutting off the power plants outside of law, opening the borders
[19:07.920 --> 19:14.160]  outside of law, raising taxes Obama says outside of law with executive power and you've got
[19:14.160 --> 19:18.920]  a dictatorial federal government that takes orders from foreign, corporate and governmental
[19:18.920 --> 19:21.920]  interest, are you a conquered nation?
[19:21.920 --> 19:31.680]  We are by the very definition like colonial China or colonialized Africa or Latin America.
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.320]  We have been captured.
[19:33.320 --> 19:34.680]  We have been manipulated.
[19:34.680 --> 19:39.560]  We have been divided and conquered as Martin Luther King warned.
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.040]  This is a protest and this is a riot.
[19:44.040 --> 19:59.600]  If you can't tell the difference then you are part of the problem, infowars.com.

[20:28.240 --> 20:30.360]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[20:30.360 --> 20:34.040]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[20:34.040 --> 20:35.040]  IRAs?
[20:35.040 --> 20:39.000]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.600]  of gold for your retirement.
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.040]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[20:44.040 --> 20:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.560]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[20:58.560 --> 21:01.880]  I want more candy, I want more video games, why, why, why?
[21:01.880 --> 21:07.240]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[21:07.240 --> 21:11.400]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[21:11.400 --> 21:14.120]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[21:14.120 --> 21:19.440]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[21:19.440 --> 21:23.960]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[21:23.960 --> 21:28.240]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.240]  drugs.
[21:29.240 --> 21:33.280]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[21:33.280 --> 21:35.320]  that children would actually like and take.
[21:35.320 --> 21:39.480]  We worked with the lean manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to
[21:39.480 --> 21:43.960]  bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing child
[21:43.960 --> 21:49.400]  ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients

[23:10.240 --> 23:11.240]  Guess what?
[23:11.240 --> 23:12.880]  She actually helped put it together.
[23:12.880 --> 23:14.320]  She built the gun herself.
[23:14.320 --> 23:15.840]  Mark's mom is pretty awesome.

[23:55.760 --> 23:57.760]  Take it.
[23:57.760 --> 24:12.840]  Here's what Alan Greenspan has to say about the private Federal Reserve that has dominated
[24:12.840 --> 24:14.340]  this country through fraud.
[24:14.340 --> 24:16.120]  He says it's above the law.
[24:16.120 --> 24:19.080]  What is the proper relationship?
[24:19.080 --> 24:22.880]  What should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the Fed and a president of
[24:22.880 --> 24:25.720]  the United States?
[24:25.720 --> 24:32.520]  First of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there
[24:32.520 --> 24:40.560]  is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[24:40.560 --> 24:48.160]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress
[24:48.160 --> 24:53.680]  or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate
[24:53.680 --> 24:59.320]  thing, then what the relationships are don't, frankly, matter.
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.040]  And that's done with a straight face by a mild-mannered, well-spoken, friendly little
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.120]  old man who takes his little doggie for walks.
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.320]  He actually headed up the cartel that launders over a trillion dollars in drug money worldwide,
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.440]  500 billion a year in North America alone.
[25:17.440 --> 25:20.120]  Look it up.
[25:20.120 --> 25:21.960]  So understand something.
[25:21.960 --> 25:27.800]  The private Federal Reserve, no oversight from any government agency, not Congress,
[25:27.800 --> 25:28.800]  nothing.
[25:28.800 --> 25:36.120]  It's private, but oh my gosh, we can't have the states have any independence, and we've
[25:36.120 --> 25:41.480]  got to have the world government through the UN who's already telling the Justice Department
[25:41.480 --> 25:49.720]  what to do on guns, you name it, and on borders telling us what to do with our police departments
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.120]  with city councils we elect and we control.
[25:53.120 --> 26:00.040]  Oh, but it's all done to stop racism, right?
[26:00.040 --> 26:04.080]  We talked about it last week and I said I wanted to get it organized and do it.
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.200]  If you want, I'll call the shots, I'll pick the day of the Planned Parenthood, or you
[26:08.200 --> 26:11.840]  guys could, and we need to send out folks and call for folks to join our reporters to
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.520]  hold up signs Black Lives Matter outside of Planned Parenthood.
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.280]  Because Obama says Black communities are basically at a disadvantage.
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.800]  They were actually at an advantage being suppressed that made them stronger.
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.920]  I'm not saying the oppression was good, it just did what Nietzsche said and what Victor
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.640]  Hugo said and what Carl Jung said and every other philosopher and psychologist said that
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.200]  prosperity makes monsters, adversity makes men, but we know now what's happened to a
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.960]  Black community.
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.880]  It's been destroyed and the very same science of control is being deployed now against everyone
[26:47.880 --> 26:49.960]  and you can see it.
[26:49.960 --> 26:56.360]  American culture is dead, the family is pretty much dead, we're in free fall, we're a deader
[26:56.360 --> 27:03.400]  nation with 100 million people on welfare and we now have race, tribal politics and
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.280]  total ignorance and young people, I don't care what color they are, don't even talk
[27:07.280 --> 27:13.160]  to each other, they play video games and play on iPads all day.
[27:13.160 --> 27:18.840]  We are in free fall, fighting with each other down the toilet.
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.560]  Let's go ahead and go to Al Sharpton with the next phase of the conquering of America.
[27:23.560 --> 27:28.920]  We've been fighting all over the country which is why we're going to do this march from here
[27:28.920 --> 27:29.920]  to Washington.
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.480]  We need the justice department to step down and take over the police in this country.
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.040]  In the 20th century, we had to fight states' rights and to get the right to vote, we got
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.400]  to fight states' rights in terms of closing down police cases.
[27:43.400 --> 27:45.400]  Police must be held accountable.
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.040]  I don't think all police are bad, I don't even think most are bad, but those that are
[27:49.040 --> 27:51.120]  need to be held accountable.
[27:51.120 --> 27:55.520]  Now Black unemployment's doubled, the number of Blacks being put in prison has accelerated
[27:55.520 --> 27:58.080]  the last seven years, just looking up to all-time records.
[27:58.080 --> 28:05.800]  Search, Blacks incarcerated all-time high, the social welfare net for inner-city Blacks
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.640]  has been removed partially, but it's okay because Obama's supposedly Black.
[28:10.640 --> 28:15.160]  I guess he is part African, just we're all kind of African at the end of the day, that's
[28:15.160 --> 28:17.600]  where humans they believe originated.
[28:17.600 --> 28:25.800]  But then if you expand on that, the federal prisons are full of Black people, but it's
[28:25.800 --> 28:29.800]  okay because she noticed the last Attorney General was Black and the new Attorney General
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.760]  is Black and a woman, even better, better not criticize her or your sexist too, not
[28:33.760 --> 28:37.560]  just racist, that's a double goodie.
[28:37.560 --> 28:44.160]  It's all about Blacks in the inner-city seeing the feds as the savior, so they'll say federalize,
[28:44.160 --> 28:49.240]  federalize, and the police departments will roll over so they get left alone.
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.080]  If you try to control the border, if you try to arrest drunk drivers or illegals or felons
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.560]  or arsonists like Sheriff Orpio, you get swat teamed and you get federal indictments and
[28:59.560 --> 29:09.320]  federal lawsuits because the feds work for the private run-for-profit federal in-name
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.840]  only reserve that says it's above the law.
[29:12.840 --> 29:21.000]  So the federal reserves above the law, and no one ever dared talk about it, and I guess
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.960]  the president's above the law now, everything is above the law except the Congress and the
[29:25.960 --> 29:27.640]  people and the legislature.
[29:27.640 --> 29:33.640]  See, everything that's actually constitutional, oh, is under attack, it needs to be dismantled.
[29:33.640 --> 29:37.840]  But we better trust the bureaucracy and the foreign interest because Alan Greenspan said
[29:37.840 --> 29:43.960]  so and Al Sharpton, the thug who doesn't even have to pay us taxes, well, of course, he's
[29:43.960 --> 29:48.360]  a made man, he's the Don Carleone of Brooklyn.
[29:48.360 --> 29:54.360]  What's that area of New York City, man, one of those moments?
[29:54.360 --> 29:55.360]  Harlem.
[29:55.360 --> 29:59.440]  He's the Don of America, he's our Lord and Savior.
[29:59.440 --> 30:03.400]  Did you know that the tipping point for global warming started back in the 80s?
[30:03.400 --> 30:07.520]  The UN reported that we were hurtling towards an unstoppable climate shift that would have
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.080]  dire consequences.
[30:09.080 --> 30:14.360]  Fast forward to Prince Charles' warning back in 2009 that we only had 96 months to save
[30:14.360 --> 30:15.360]  the planet.
[30:15.360 --> 30:16.760]  The clock is ticking on that one.
[30:16.760 --> 30:21.680]  And let's not forget Al Gore quoting studies back in 2007 stating that the polar ice caps
[30:21.680 --> 30:24.240]  would be completely gone by now.
[30:24.240 --> 30:29.600]  Earlier this year, we saw articles with headlines like 2014, the hottest year on record.
[30:29.600 --> 30:33.520]  The same articles failed to mention cities like Chicago, Illinois, which saw its coldest
[30:33.520 --> 30:35.840]  weather in over 100 years.
[30:35.840 --> 30:39.480]  No mention of big ice breaking ships getting stuck in ice.
[30:39.480 --> 30:43.680]  So remember when these carbon tax pushers tell you to lessen your carbon footprint,
[30:43.680 --> 30:47.840]  they're about to leap into their multi-vehicle convoy, drive to their private jets, and
[30:47.840 --> 30:50.240]  then go to sleep in one of their many houses.
[30:50.240 --> 30:51.240]  Some by the sea.
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.320]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[32:57.760 --> 33:06.680]  I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.
[33:06.680 --> 33:12.440]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions
[33:12.440 --> 33:18.680]  my administration can take on our own within my existing legal authorities to do what Congress
[33:18.680 --> 33:22.760]  refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[33:22.760 --> 33:29.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[17:05.700 --> 34:21.880]  but the old establishment knew how to keep corruption down to a minimum
[34:21.880 --> 34:24.480]  because it would eat into production and prosperity.
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.240]  Then the globalists fully adopt eugenics, which is really neo-futilism and decided,
[34:29.240 --> 34:36.480]  hey, we'll make everybody pour and dump down, stir them up, make them fight with each other,
[34:36.480 --> 34:43.800]  and we'll build the economy around scarcity instead of a predatory system of oppression,
[34:43.800 --> 34:47.960]  and we'll teach them from school how to be obsessed with what color they are or where
[34:47.960 --> 34:53.120]  they came from instead of what they actually stand for, and we will conquer these people
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.680]  and they will never even know it.
[34:56.680 --> 35:01.400]  And that's exactly what has now happened.
[35:01.400 --> 35:05.560]  I got a bunch of clips I want to get to, a huge trade deal they're ramming through that's
[35:05.560 --> 35:07.200]  not a trade deal at all.
[35:07.200 --> 35:11.160]  It's the North American Union merging with the Pacific Union and the Asian Union, exactly
[35:11.160 --> 35:12.680]  as the Triton-Ineral Commission said they would do.
[35:12.680 --> 35:19.360]  In fact, you guys print me Barry Goldwater's quote from No Apologies in the 70s where he
[35:19.360 --> 35:21.080]  talks about the Trilateral Commission's plan.
[35:21.080 --> 35:22.080]  Thank you.
[35:22.080 --> 35:28.440]  That's the former Senator and presidential candidate who almost beat LBJ and we wouldn't
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.600]  have had the great society and all the things that happened and the nightmare is now unfolded
[35:32.600 --> 35:36.400]  and I'm going to tie that into Obama saying some communities have odds stacked against
[35:36.400 --> 35:38.400]  him.
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.240]  And then big jade helm developments that I'm not going to get to yet, but this is really
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.920]  the anatomy of propaganda that we're going to be dissecting and breaking down here today.
[35:47.920 --> 35:53.320]  But before I go any further, we have the very best.
[35:53.320 --> 36:00.640]  Made in America, Patriot Apparel, Molan Lobby in Latin, come and take it in English, whether
[36:00.640 --> 36:09.640]  it's an M16, AK-47 or a Canon design, Liberty or Death sweatshirts, long sleeve, short sleeve.
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.400]  We've got camouflage, infowars.com, don't tread on me shirts, the long sleeve, Molan
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.680]  Lobbys that are so popular, those are finally back in.
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.400]  We've got the second wave of the new independent design, there's only print 500 to each, those
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.240]  are about to sell out, the Molan Lobby brass and nickel belt buckles.
[36:29.240 --> 36:38.560]  We're almost out of the one time run silver coins and every order gets a free 1776 pin,
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.160]  every order of those coins, people say, what's that mean, you can explain it to them.
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.640]  We've got a limited amount of the M16, Molan Lobby, belt buckles as well, and again, women's
[36:47.640 --> 36:55.880]  gold leaf t-shirts that are cut for a woman, they look fabulous on women.
[36:55.880 --> 37:01.320]  You can see Leon McAdoo there sporting one, and they're very inexpensive for a Made in
[37:01.320 --> 37:02.800]  America shirt.
[37:02.800 --> 37:07.600]  Comparable Made in America gold foil shirts like that would be 60 bucks at the mall, they're
[37:07.600 --> 37:13.440]  4.95, I can tell you right now, Made in America with gold foil, they cost us about $14.00,
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.480]  and so usually in clothing there's a two or three times markup, but hey, you want choices?
[37:18.480 --> 37:25.440]  We have Made in Venezuela, Made in Mexico, Made in China, whole section of t-shirts that
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.360]  are a lot less on the site, a lot of them bought from third parties, a lot less expensive,
[37:32.360 --> 37:38.320]  Molan Lobby, you name it, if that's your choice, we've got them there, we've got the classics,
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.200]  hundreds of shirts I designed, mass murders agree, gun control works with Hitler, Stalin,
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.760]  and Mao, a great conversation maker, hundreds of t-shirts, the Obama Joker limited edition
[37:49.760 --> 37:59.200]  is back, the Army emblem style info wars dot com, in the TSA, Obamacare with the Apple
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.160]  failure sign, one of the best looking shirts I think is the Paul Revere right there, go
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.240]  ahead and click on that Paul Revere there, up one level, there you go, your TV viewer,
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.480]  you can see this, that's one of my favorite, just classy, good looking shirts, and if you
[38:13.480 --> 38:23.600]  click on that you can see the t-shirt in large, Spirit of 1776, infowars.com, and your purchases
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.880]  make this entire transmission possible, we have the water filtration, that's the special
[38:28.880 --> 38:36.760]  we're running right now, ProPure G2 and other systems, 20% off of promo code water20 at checkout,
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.800]  you understand we already have the lowest prices on the certified best quality, there
[38:41.800 --> 38:47.560]  are hundreds of companies out there, and unfortunately I only carry systems from five different companies
[38:47.560 --> 38:51.680]  because they really do have the certifications, they really do have the highest quality, and
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.200]  they don't get returned very often, I'd be carrying all the other brands, some of which
[38:57.200 --> 39:02.760]  we didn't carry, but just as evidence mounted that some of the systems out there aren't that
[39:02.760 --> 39:08.160]  good or didn't have quality control, I didn't sell filters for a couple years, did a bunch
[39:08.160 --> 39:13.800]  of research and brought you what I think is the best, they remove or take down to non-detectable
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.760]  levels or down to 999, you name it, hundreds of different chemicals, it varies per chemical,
[39:18.760 --> 39:27.160]  glyphosates, fluoride, you are insane if you don't filter your water, and your purchase
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.680]  is, you get a great price, the lowest out there, you get really high quality stuff we've
[39:31.680 --> 39:39.760]  researched and you support this broadcast, it's what I call 360 win, infowarstore.com,
[39:39.760 --> 39:47.960]  infowarslife.com, and there is 20% off those systems at infowarstore.com, there are hundreds
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.320]  of books and hundreds of films on every subject to inform yourself, your homeschooling children,
[39:53.320 --> 39:56.720]  or if you're a teacher and allowed to show films, they pretty much take that away with
[39:56.720 --> 40:00.240]  no child left behind, it's all federalized now, where a teacher can't show a particular
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.760]  film if they want to, but you know what, it's just time to start rebelling in these government
[40:03.760 --> 40:16.280]  training camps, we've got it all, infowarstore.com, or 888-253-3139, and we are under massive sustained
[40:16.280 --> 40:22.800]  attack now as you know, the system is coming after the Liberty Movement, there's a big
[40:22.800 --> 40:30.960]  article on infowarstore.com today, Alexa caught fixing ratings to target anti-Obama news
[40:30.960 --> 40:37.280]  sites, and he did a great article, I contributed a small amount, so my name's on it, but I
[40:37.280 --> 40:40.360]  think Paul, you're doing a great job, but you should add that Nielsen's been caught
[40:40.360 --> 40:45.160]  fixing ratings for MSNBC and CNN five years ago, and then again two years ago, just to
[40:45.160 --> 40:52.400]  show the tissue of lies and the MO of these people, I'd also show Arbitron caught manipulating
[40:52.400 --> 40:58.520]  stuff against certain shows, you can look that up, and I would also, we need to get
[40:58.520 --> 41:06.760]  our graphics department to take infowarstore.com October 1st last year, and Alexa side by side
[41:06.760 --> 41:19.080]  and show MSNBC, and on October 1st we go down, they go up, it's the inverse, on that day,
[41:19.080 --> 41:23.200]  and then you see infowarst climbing, though we're down in a pit, Drudge climbing down
[41:23.200 --> 41:28.200]  in a pit, Reitbart climbing down in a pit, the Blaze climbing down in a pit, WorldNet
[41:28.200 --> 41:32.800]  Daily climbing down in a pit, and then we show our Google Analytics right next to it,
[41:32.800 --> 41:40.920]  was a 30% increase, I mean it's a fraud, a stinking giant, and of course the head of
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.760]  Amazon worships Obama, and announced three months ago, he's working with the CIA, letting
[41:45.760 --> 41:55.480]  them put servers inside to take all your data, just Google Alexa and the CIA co-locate servers,
[41:55.480 --> 42:00.880]  October 1st, and we have all those graphs, I want to have our graphics department simply
[42:00.880 --> 42:12.840]  take a screenshot of info wars in the last year, and MSNBC and show them, put them over
[42:12.840 --> 42:19.040]  each other, with them going up, us going down, it makes an X, the exact point October 1st,
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.920]  and then every other site's the same, I mean that's what's powerful, that's what's over
[42:25.920 --> 42:33.440]  the top, absolute proof in your face, now before I get to the dismantling of the country
[42:33.440 --> 42:40.280]  and the evidence of that, I want to play this clip, Obama some communities have odds stacked
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.960]  against them, and you know what, that's actually true, but he's not telling you what's stacked
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.720]  against you, we're going to play this and then come back and break it down, here is
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.280]  who Jamie Foxx calls the Lord and Savior, notice I haven't talked about the Mayweather
[42:56.280 --> 43:04.280]  fight, as funny as $3 bill in my view, people in Washington say it looks fake, and then
[43:04.280 --> 43:09.080]  you got to see Jamie Foxx sing on the national anthem doing a horrible job I'm told, and
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.840]  it's just the elite all ending in their jets to all be seen like a bunch of narcissistic
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.000]  peacocks, I mean I was a billionaire, I'd be broadcasting from like super cool, you
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.080]  know, fabulous destinations, and seeing all the beauty of the world, wouldn't be hanging
[43:25.080 --> 43:33.640]  around like a peacock up on a tree chirping, but I digress off on the Jamie Foxx, here
[43:33.640 --> 43:39.160]  is Obama creating disunity class warfare, here it is.
[43:39.160 --> 43:45.960]  We can't guarantee everybody's success, but we do strive to guarantee an equal shot for
[43:45.960 --> 43:54.320]  everybody who's willing to work for it, but what we've also understood for too long is
[43:54.320 --> 44:00.880]  that some communities have consistently had the odds stacked against them, that there's
[44:00.880 --> 44:10.520]  a tragic history in this country that has made it tougher for some, and folks living
[44:10.520 --> 44:15.040]  in those communities and especially young people living in those communities could use
[44:15.040 --> 44:21.120]  some help to change those odds, it's true of some rural communities where there's chronic
[44:21.120 --> 44:27.760]  poverty, it's true of some manufacturing communities that have suffered after factories they depend
[44:27.760 --> 44:35.240]  on close their doors, it's true for young people of color, especially boys and young
[44:35.240 --> 44:46.160]  men, you all know the numbers, by almost every measure, life chances of the average young
[44:46.160 --> 44:52.920]  man of color is worse than his peers, hit pause.
[44:52.920 --> 44:58.800]  I could spend an hour on why Appalachian whites can't get out of poverty and on why blacks
[44:58.800 --> 45:04.200]  can't get out of poverty on average, it's not really true, blacks are actually coming
[45:04.200 --> 45:09.280]  some of the wealthiest subgroups and largest upper-upper middle-class groups, when it comes
[45:09.280 --> 45:14.760]  to that demographic of upper-upper and nouveau rich, blacks are just exploding, but that's
[45:14.760 --> 45:21.400]  blacks that see through it all and escape it, dynamic, smart, hard-working, competitive,
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.800]  don't have chips on their shoulders, don't make people feel uncomfortable, they go right
[45:26.800 --> 45:35.640]  at the top, right at the top, whether it's journalism or science, corporate sales, CEOs,
[45:35.640 --> 45:40.360]  managers, alpha male black guys who don't have chips on their shoulders make some of
[45:40.360 --> 45:45.680]  the best executives out there, that's well-known in corporate America, but I'm digressing.
[45:45.680 --> 45:49.880]  Massive chips on their shoulders, taught to have chips on their shoulders, taught by MTV
[45:49.880 --> 45:54.480]  and the gangster culture since the 70s and 80s, to go out and join a gang and to hate
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.640]  everybody and to think everybody's out to get you, I know a lot of white yuppies like
[45:59.640 --> 46:05.560]  that and slackers in Austin who won't work, who are trust fund kids, who are spoiled brats
[46:05.560 --> 46:09.960]  and they remind me of growing up in Dallas of black people that had chips on their shoulders
[46:09.960 --> 46:21.000]  I know and thought everybody was talking crap to them.
[46:21.000 --> 46:28.000]  But if you look on the graph of the 1960s, black illegitimacy, black crime rates, black
[46:28.000 --> 46:38.160]  bankruptcy, black suicide, on and on and on, it was as low as the whites or lower because
[46:38.160 --> 46:43.980]  blacks knew that they'd been screwed over and they figured something out that Lewis
[46:43.980 --> 46:44.980]  Farrakhan talks about.
[46:44.980 --> 46:48.280]  I don't know what Lewis Farrakhan talks about but when he says this is true, you want to
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.960]  buy local, you want to build a community, you want to have your own banks, you want to get
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.640]  your clothes cleaned at black owned shops, I mean that's one way if you're going to
[46:58.640 --> 47:01.840]  think whites are all out to get you and do that and back then the whites were in many
[47:01.840 --> 47:09.920]  areas and so black people had lower illegitimacy on average in the 20s and 30s and 40s.
[47:09.920 --> 47:11.160]  Then that all changed.
[47:11.160 --> 47:15.160]  The highest in the world, the highest criminal rate, everything.
[47:15.160 --> 47:19.960]  I mean did white men make gangster rappers always go shoot each other every two days
[47:19.960 --> 47:22.520]  in the nish?
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.240]  Whether it's some hip hop event and people shoot each other or they try to shoot because
[47:26.240 --> 47:28.440]  that's what people see as cool.
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.160]  That's being sold in the white community now.
[47:30.160 --> 47:34.840]  There's like this hip hop rap country now that's all thugged out.
[47:34.840 --> 47:42.560]  We like guys with grills in their teeth and long mullets rapping to country and I mean
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.800]  you can go find areas in the country and suburb white areas where it's like some mutation
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.880]  between thug culture from the blacks and thug white trash culture.
[47:52.880 --> 47:55.760]  It's just unbelievably horrible and I'm supposed to embrace all that.
[47:55.760 --> 47:57.680]  I can't stand a black thug or a white thug.
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.200]  They all act just the same, they're all arrested development, crazed looks in their eyes, little
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.240]  kids, think they're tough, attack you when you start banging their head in the concrete
[48:07.240 --> 48:08.960]  and always cry for their mama.
[48:08.960 --> 48:15.160]  It's like that movie Spring Break with Franco in it or whatever his name is.
[48:15.160 --> 48:22.140]  That's really how that is, it's disgusting and I grew up around it and now it's spreading
[48:22.140 --> 48:26.200]  all over the country and illegitimacy and the imprisonment.
[48:26.200 --> 48:32.680]  We're just converting to absolute animals folks across the board.
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.240]  I mean what does it say that the main civil right leader in this country is not someone
[48:36.240 --> 48:38.880]  like Martin Luther King, it's Al Sharpton.
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.800]  I mean a guy who wore purple leisure suits and weighed 400 pounds and was an FBI informant,
[48:45.800 --> 48:48.800]  coke dealer.
[48:48.800 --> 48:55.240]  I mean what a joke, I mean but just take no responsibility, let me tell you something.
[48:55.240 --> 49:03.360]  These real winners cannot be held down.
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.520]  Now the CIA, you want to talk about what's really holding blacks back, did because it
[49:07.520 --> 49:15.400]  was seen as acceptable by white racists in police departments and the FBI to ship drugs
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.160]  in to black communities and to let prostitution gambling and all in the black community run
[49:20.160 --> 49:27.360]  by Italian, Jewish, Irish and wasp mafias but they would run it in the black communities
[49:27.360 --> 49:35.240]  because whites wouldn't put up with it and they would go into a bad black area, not a
[49:35.240 --> 49:41.640]  big Christian upper class black area but they'd go into the poor black areas and they'd set
[49:41.640 --> 49:42.840]  up shop.
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.640]  So that's where a lot of that seed of that culture came from.
[49:47.640 --> 49:52.440]  So yes, the white man actually did engineer it and is to blame.
[49:52.440 --> 49:55.880]  Here's the news flash, I didn't do anything, I'm not part of it.
[49:55.880 --> 50:00.040]  Most whites were against slavery, we fought a civil war over it, we reversed it, England
[50:00.040 --> 50:04.880]  was the country with Christians that started banning slavery worldwide and invaded parts
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.320]  of Africa and invaded the Middle East to make Arabs stop selling black people.
[50:09.320 --> 50:16.560]  And about bashing Arabs, don't blame them the day, it's just a fact.
[50:16.560 --> 50:23.320]  So that's the reality, Germans weren't freed in some areas of Germany, the Austrian-Hungarian
[50:23.320 --> 50:25.600]  Empire until the 1880s.
[50:25.600 --> 50:32.000]  Do you hear Germans that have a German surname that's linked to that whining, they don't
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  even remember it or know her care?
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.720]  A lot of my ancestors came over here as sharecroppers, do you hear me talking about it?
[50:39.720 --> 50:45.680]  It is a mindless chip on the shoulder, you had fluoride, vaccines, end of the mix, you
[50:45.680 --> 50:49.080]  just have a brain damaged public, I mean it comes out of that.
[50:49.080 --> 50:52.920]  And so this is social engineering and if you go back to the great society, on the graph
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.560]  in the 60s, that's when the decline of the black community and the rest of the country
[50:57.560 --> 50:58.560]  starts.
[50:58.560 --> 51:04.720]  Hey Boomer, I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water, good thing
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.040]  we have the Berke system, it's the cleanest, best water ever.
[51:08.040 --> 51:11.880]  Mom says it's because the Berke's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves
[51:11.880 --> 51:13.800]  only pure, delicious water.
[51:13.800 --> 51:18.640]  I know right, you love it too, yeah I'm thirsty too, let's go get some.

[52:07.520 --> 52:11.560]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[52:11.560 --> 52:15.880]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[52:15.880 --> 52:21.200]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[53:28.480 --> 53:29.480]  This is Dan Pilla.
[53:29.480 --> 53:31.040]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[53:31.040 --> 53:32.600]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[53:32.600 --> 53:35.440]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[53:35.440 --> 53:37.640]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.440]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.440]  case.
[53:42.440 --> 53:46.320]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[53:46.320 --> 53:50.120]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[53:50.120 --> 54:18.720]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[54:20.520 --> 54:21.840]  I said I'd take calls this hour.
[54:21.840 --> 54:25.400]  You notice I haven't because I've got so much news to get to.
[54:25.400 --> 54:29.680]  I will open the phones up for people that disagree with me in the first 30 minutes of
[54:29.680 --> 54:31.560]  the next hour.
[54:31.560 --> 54:39.080]  Then David Knight is joining us with some of the most bomb-shell testimony ever of the
[54:39.080 --> 54:45.400]  most vicious child abuse you can imagine.
[54:45.400 --> 54:48.160]  We've interviewed a nurse and it's on record up until five years ago.
[54:48.160 --> 54:50.320]  They would not give premature babies vaccines.
[54:50.320 --> 54:52.440]  They would not give pregnant women vaccines.
[54:52.440 --> 54:56.760]  Now we have eyewitnesses to where they know that it's basically maiming and killing them
[54:56.760 --> 55:01.080]  and they say get ready to get the trauma unit, the emergency unit in here, get ready to try
[55:01.080 --> 55:02.240]  to save their life.
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.240]  They follow the order.
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.240]  They give them the shots.
[55:04.240 --> 55:07.160]  The baby starts dying on the table in front of them.
[55:07.160 --> 55:08.280]  This is human sacrifice.
[55:08.280 --> 55:12.000]  This is leading children up to idols and throwing them into fiery pits.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.120]  This is following orders unto death.
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.600]  The inserts said until five years ago, do not give it to a pregnant woman.
[55:20.600 --> 55:24.320]  Do not give it to a premature baby.
[55:24.320 --> 55:25.800]  Most of the children go into convulsions.
[55:25.800 --> 55:26.800]  A lot of them die.
[55:26.800 --> 55:31.160]  He'll be joining us bottom of the next hour to break down this and we're going to air
[55:31.160 --> 55:34.560]  part of this interview with a registered nurse exposing it.
[55:34.560 --> 55:40.400]  We're going to do more investigative reports.
[55:40.400 --> 55:44.720]  Because of HIPAA laws, you can get indicted, but there's got to be an investigative loophole
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.280]  to be able to get in because we have sources that want to let us in basically to see the
[55:49.280 --> 55:51.440]  babies dying.
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.800]  And I know it's a conspiracy theory to want to save the babies, but all of you out there
[55:54.800 --> 55:57.960]  that worship the government and are into having faith in it, come on.
[55:57.960 --> 56:00.080]  They just cut the floor right about 50%.
[56:00.080 --> 56:07.200]  They've ordered it removed from pesticide because the proof is it's massacring our brains,
[56:07.200 --> 56:10.960]  our DNA, it's giving us cancer.
[56:10.960 --> 56:11.960]  Evil's running the country.
[56:11.960 --> 56:12.960]  Let's just admit it.
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.640]  Let's see the evil so over the top, people don't want to admit it.
[56:17.640 --> 56:27.760]  Now what else is hurting black folks that are the main test group inside this country?
[56:27.760 --> 56:29.240]  What else is hurting them?
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.840]  It's hurting everybody, but blacks more than anybody in places like Detroit, you name it,
[56:34.840 --> 56:41.440]  former industrial centers are being annihilated by the North American Union, the TPP, the
[56:41.440 --> 56:47.400]  Pacific Union, the NAU because they're all written selectively so that only globalist
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.840]  companies can operate and so they move overseas or the high tech visas come in.
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.200]  By the way, the foreign workers don't have to pay taxes here.
[56:57.200 --> 57:03.040]  Let's go ahead and go to Obama pushing what's really doubling the black unemployment rate.
[57:03.040 --> 57:10.400]  I've been very clear that TPP is good for American businesses and American workers.
[57:10.400 --> 57:12.400]  Just like NASA.
[57:12.400 --> 57:20.320]  Regardless of what China's doing, and we will make the case on the merits as to why it will
[57:20.320 --> 57:26.000]  open up markets for American goods, American exports, and create American jobs.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  We roll Al Gore out again.
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.800]  This is not some offensive agreement.
[57:28.800 --> 57:31.920]  This is something that is going to be part and parcel of our broader.
[57:31.920 --> 57:34.400]  But we're not allowed to see it.
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.400]  The color reserves above the law, the private corporate boards are above the law, only the
[57:39.400 --> 57:42.840]  police, they have to be under federal control.
[57:42.840 --> 57:43.840]  Let's go to Boehner.
[57:43.840 --> 57:47.120]  The Republicans, by the way, are quietly supporting this, but Boehner acting like he's not for
[57:47.120 --> 57:48.400]  it to full constituents.
[57:48.400 --> 57:50.080]  Here's the Speaker of the House.
[57:50.080 --> 57:55.520]  The President needs trade promotion authority to continue to try to get an agreement with
[57:55.520 --> 57:58.240]  the Asians on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.160]  Hillary Clinton was for trade promotion authority.
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.800]  Hillary Clinton is for the trade bill with the Asians.
[58:05.800 --> 58:08.120]  She just won't say so.
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.880]  And the fact is, the President needs her help in order to get Democrat votes in the House
[58:12.880 --> 58:14.120]  and Senate to get this passed.
[58:14.120 --> 58:16.720]  Do you think some House Democrats look at the Spaniards on something?
[58:16.720 --> 58:17.720]  She's on the ballot.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.720]  I bet her.
[58:18.720 --> 58:23.360]  Every Democrat leader in Congress is opposed to the President's position.
[58:23.360 --> 58:28.320]  Now, listen, we've got a majority here in the House and the Senate, but we can't do this
[58:28.320 --> 58:29.320]  by now.
[58:29.320 --> 58:30.320]  How many hookers a week do you think he has?
[58:30.320 --> 58:31.320]  Now, we're going to carry the bulk of the votes.
[58:31.320 --> 58:32.320]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[58:32.320 --> 58:33.320]  Trade promotion authority done for the president.
[58:33.320 --> 58:34.920]  Again, he acts like he's for our jobs.
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.600]  He acts like earlier that he was against it.
[58:36.600 --> 58:37.600]  Now he's for it.
[58:37.600 --> 58:39.200]  I mean, here they come.
[58:39.200 --> 58:41.320]  Both parties screwing us over.
[58:41.320 --> 58:43.960]  Let's just have a race war instead, huh?
[58:43.960 --> 58:44.960]  That's what they're pushing.
[58:44.960 --> 58:49.440]  Big second hour coming up.
[58:49.440 --> 58:54.200]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems, introducing
[58:54.200 --> 58:57.880]  the new infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[58:57.880 --> 59:02.880]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market,
[59:02.880 --> 59:07.520]  extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[59:07.520 --> 59:10.960]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[59:10.960 --> 59:14.480]  Now available in our limited first run at infowarslife.com.
[59:14.480 --> 59:19.080]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:19.080 --> 59:20.080]  Alex Jones here.
[59:20.080 --> 59:24.400]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[59:24.400 --> 59:29.960]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.
[59:29.960 --> 59:35.440]  Using the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend, experience the benefits of combining
[59:35.440 --> 59:41.800]  over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[59:41.800 --> 59:46.800]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[59:46.800 --> 59:51.840]  That's infowarslife.com.
[59:51.840 --> 01:00:05.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:29.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:37.120]  We're now into our number two, Vayner, who acts like he's four jobs and against shipping
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:46.360]  jobs overseas, has come out and basically said Hillary Clinton isn't going quick enough
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:54.320]  to start promoting the open borders that come along with these agreements to all these foreign
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.600]  goods so they don't have to basically have any tariffs put on them, even though China
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:04.400]  and India and Mexico and others put their own internal illegal tariffs on our goods.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.680]  And that's what's hurting communities across this country regardless of what color you are.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.440]  I want to open the phones up in the next 30 minutes and get to other news as well.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.360]  Big development on Jane Helm, I haven't hit yet.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.640]  And I want to hear from people that disagree.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.920]  Now, in the second half and into the next hour, we can talk to folks that are on any
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.240]  subject, agree, disagree, have a question, have a comment.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:39.120]  But I want to hear from those of you out there that legitimately disagree with me.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:49.600]  Now, again, if you're calling on some other subject, we're not going to put you on air
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.240]  because it's hard to get to the callers that disagree because so many hundreds of calls
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.640]  come in with folks just don't listen to what I'm saying.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:06.280]  If you disagree, we're only taking those calls at first, 800-259-9231.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.720]  And I really want to hear from you.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.040]  I see one there that disagrees on Jane Helm.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.920]  We'll see what the person has to say on that front.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.160]  I wonder if they'll actually disagree with what I've said or with a strawman.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.360]  Now there's a bunch of news articles on Jane Helm today, over 100.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]  I couldn't read them all.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.800]  But if you go to Google and type in Jane Helm, there's hundreds.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.600]  And type in Alex Jones, there's about 80 today.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.920]  But there might be more now, and I'll check that.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:42.160]  John Stuart mocks Lone Star lunatics, which is an anti-Western or anti-Southerner.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.760]  People say Texas isn't the South.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.720]  The Left that's always embarrassed about Texas Southern roots always is ashamed of the fact
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:57.120]  that Texas was part of the Confederacy and that Texas was the gateway to the West.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.840]  So it's kind of a quasi-Western slash South.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.520]  But just like Missouri's part of the South, and just like Louisiana's part of the South
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:14.160]  or Alabama or Tennessee, Texas was founded by people out of Tennessee, Alabama, and other
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]  areas.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.400]  That's the original Texans were from Tennessee, Alabama, and South Carolina.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.240]  That's where almost all my family's from, except for my mother's side that were the
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:32.720]  big Texas founders, a bunch on my dad's side too, but my mom's side just everywhere.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720]  You name it.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  I'm not bragging or anything.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.800]  It's just kind of ridiculous.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:43.080]  David Ayers, William Ayers, the guys that stirred it all up and brought in the Bibles
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.680]  and the printing presses and got stuff going in Washington on the Brazos, put to you this
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]  way.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.760]  He was going to be the first treasurer of the Republic, but he was so obsessed with not
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.000]  being corrupt that he would refuse to even touch the money, and then that's when Colonel
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.920]  Travis dropped his son off with when he went to the Alamo.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.480]  But I digress.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.560]  There's this demonization of Texas by folks in New York and other areas, and when I meet
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.200]  people from New York, they go, man, I had no idea Texas had all these laboratories and
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.040]  science and everybody's so cool, and I really thought you rode to work on horses.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:23.400]  Yeah, down at NASA in Houston, in the giant refineries, and the laboratories where they
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:28.400]  have invented things like most of the cancer research and heart surgery, because when the
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.760]  Queen of England comes to Houston to have medical procedures done, or when her dad did,
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.040]  it's because we're so backwards.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.760]  We actually drag our knuckles when we walk.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.920]  That's why you're all, I'm not knocking New Yorkers people, I'm talking about the young
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.400]  people that don't know what's going on.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.040]  John Stewart plays into that, and basically calls us all a bunch of trailer trash, because
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.760]  our state's concerned about federalization, we're going to play that coming up as well.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:59.400]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.480]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.200]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.000]  But modern feminists, well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.720]  they want to ban words, shirts, and man spreading.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:21.600]  Come on, that's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.080]  oppressing women and not the state.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.840]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.200]  It's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.080]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.080]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism, and not because they
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:48.160]  had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.960]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.640]  traditional family structure destroyed.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:25.600]  Leigh Ann McAdder reporting for infowars.com.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.400]  We have listed infowarslife.com, whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force,
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.560]  super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.920]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.560]  of other customers that have visited infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:03.200]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.720]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.680]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.480]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.160]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.040]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.320]  New filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:31.200]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.160]  Fluoride is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.840]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.360]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.720]  It's time to take action.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.640]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.280]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.480]  I was just telling a story about some of my family that was involved in the founding
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:19.120]  of Texas on my mother's side and my dad texted me, so I was talking about how Texas was mainly
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:27.440]  founded by Tennesseans, Alabamans, South Carolinians, Virginians, and my dad texted me because I'd
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.960]  forgotten to add, that's why I was talking about David Ayers, that he was from New York.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:38.200]  So folks were from all over that founded Texas, but it's so frustrating to see people like
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:47.560]  John Stewart and just folks from California and also the East Coast, kind of with a stereotype
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:55.760]  or a bigoted worldview, think that if someone speaks with a Texas or Western accent or New
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.720]  York accent, we're stupid.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.600]  When test scores, recruiting, you name it, shows that people in Texas and in other Western
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:12.120]  states are just as smart or smarter than anybody else.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:18.320]  In fact, when it comes to corporate recruiting, you name it, Texas has some of the highest
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.960]  numbers worldwide, but beyond that, why is everybody from the Northeast, Southwest, you
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.240]  name it, moving to Texas?
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.040]  They're moving here because Texans are smart enough to try to keep taxes low compared to
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]  the rest of the country.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:47.200]  They're still high historically compared to say what we had under Kennedy who was a Democrat.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.680]  It's just incredible to see everybody move here and then badmouth it.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.640]  And then John Stewart, that's not even his real name, his family is one of the most powerful
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.520]  in the country in the Federal Reserve, part of the central bank, part of the ruling class,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:11.440]  and John Stewart's brother runs the New York Stock Exchange, look it up.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.360]  Just Google, John Stewart's brother runs the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.760]  You can find out all about him.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:23.300]  And he plays this anti-establishment role that he's there exposing the Republicans
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:28.400]  and the Democrats when the guy is anti-gun, pro-open border globalist, and I'm on your
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.480]  phone calls, Frank, Chris, John, Josh, Mike, and others, callers that disagree when he
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:40.160]  comes out, the videos on InfoWars.com, John Stewart mocks Lone Star lunatics over Jade
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:49.960]  Helm concerns, and he builds the straw man, just like the newspapers do every day, whacked
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:59.080]  out crazy Texans, Lone Star lunatics, and A-holes, as he calls us, believe Obama's gonna invade.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.960]  He goes, hey, let me give you a little news flash.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.360]  You already been taken over by the feds.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.760]  I know, I know, John, or whatever your real name is.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.560]  And Mr. Stewart, it goes further than that.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.960]  And you know that.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.520]  The feds have been taken over by the globalists.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.440]  And Al Sharpton, in fact, let's play that first.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.120]  Al Sharpton, in a press conference last night, said we need to federalize the police.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.960]  That's the new movement.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.280]  No states, no states' rights, no checks and balances on the out of control government.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.200]  And the USA Today wrote an article, want a lawless police force, federalize it.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.560]  But we're run by a federal reserve that says it's above the law and can't be audited and
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  is God.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.480]  Well, we're gonna call that bluff.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.560]  I played that clip last hour.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:51.920]  We're run by foreign families whose wealth is global state secrets.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:57.640]  And you want to federalize the police using a few hundred suspicious police shootings
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.640]  a year and make it racial when crazy cops are shooting all sorts of people.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.960]  And so are the feds.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.200]  And it's the feds giving them the training and giving them the armored vehicles.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.720]  And it was a federally trained run department, black run as well, that supposedly, you know,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.240]  broke this guy's spine.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.640]  And they've been indicted.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:26.480]  So we got to have a crusade, not a crusade to stop the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.200]  it'll kill our jobs even more.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.400]  Not a partnership to start having the CIA ship drugs in the black communities.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400]  Not a partnership.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400]  No, no, no.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.240]  It's a partnership to screw everybody over.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.480]  But it feels good to get manipulated, doesn't it?
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.040]  Let's go ahead and go to Al Sharpton.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.680]  They've been frightening us all over the country, which is why we're gonna do this march from
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.680]  here to Washington.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.680]  We need the justice department to step down and take over the police in this country.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.680]  We're gonna essentially have to fight states' rights and to get the right to vote.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.400]  We're gonna have to fight states' rights in terms of closing down police cases.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.400]  Police must be accountable.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400]  No, fight states' rights.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400]  I don't think all police is bad.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]  I don't think most of them.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  They've got to be federalized.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]  I mean, that's it.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.280]  That's why the Justice Department and George Soros are funding this.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.800]  People are like, well, why don't you get on board?
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800]  We hate the cops.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800]  Not just black people.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.080]  And I'm like, don't you see we've all been manipulated, we're all being screwed over.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.880]  We can reform the police from the elected level.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.360]  It's never gonna be perfect.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.320]  Instead, they're gonna become totally federalized, and then the feds will wave a magic wand, as
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.560]  USA Today admits, and give them carte blanche to whatever they want.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.880]  I mean, the FBI admits they've basically been framing people for 40 years at their crime
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.080]  lab, blowing up Waco, Ruby Ridge, 98% conviction rate in federal trials.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.960]  I mean, you want the feds run by the New World Order in control with nobody to call them?
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.320]  Man, Katie bar the door.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.040]  You don't ever see state grand juries indict feds anymore, do you?
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.720]  Because they're too scared.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.880]  And the feds are globalist run.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.320]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.400]  John disagrees on Jade Helm.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.440]  Chris disagrees from George on taxes.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.440]  Frank disagrees.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.800]  Says Alex has a double standard from North Carolina.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.680]  Joss disagrees with Alex, sensationalism.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680]  You know what?
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:16.400]  And Alex Jones quote, reality is beyond sensational.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.360]  Mike in Canada says, Alex is losing the edge.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.600]  I want to hear these calls, and we'll go to him before David Knight joins us in studio.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.760]  He'll come in the middle way about 40 after he'll be here waiting in the wings, but I'm
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.280]  gonna get to your calls first, at least the first few rounds.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.360]  But first, let's, let's analyze John Stewart, and this is what they do in the Dallas Morning
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.360]  News and Austin American Statesman and the New York Times, they ridicule and go, crazy
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  Alex Jones thinks Obama's gonna invade and take over Texas and kill everybody.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:50.760]  No, we said it's more conditioning, more federalization, like the MRAPS, and the military admits their
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.920]  main enemy's the Tea Party, and we're gonna force a national debate about it.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.280]  But you don't want to debate the sensible stuff we said, or what Governor Abbott said
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.120]  when he said, we're gonna, you know, watch our people's rights.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.040]  You're going to create a distortion.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.120]  Or go, we've already had a bunch of drills, so it's okay, see they're setting the present.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.520]  We've been having abortion for 41 years, what's the big deal?
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.960]  You know, Hitler's been putting people in death camps for a long time, so it's okay.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.880]  Hey slaves, we're slaves for thousands of years, so what's wrong with slavery?
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.960]  It's an appeal to precedent, and I'm gonna skip this network break so we have more time
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.120]  to take calls, but right now let's go to John Stewart.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.640]  The question, of course, was yesterday's attack in Texas an isolated incident, or part of
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.120]  a more menacing trend, because we've been hearing about this fictionally for a while
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120]  now.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.360]  At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.560]  ISIS knocking on our Texas border?
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.800]  Oh, that's easy, just don't answer.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.120]  If ISIS knocks, just shut the lights out and lie there.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.000]  What's going on is, they know the borders are wide open, so their narrative about terror
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.120]  or give your rights up doesn't make sense, so they don't want to discuss that and just
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.760]  gear up to attack the Tea Party with Homeland Security, who they admits their main enemy.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.680]  And so ISIS is coming across, because they're recruiting in the U.S. as well, they're a
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.920]  globalist army, but they can blow back and attack us.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:14.560]  So Stewart's been saying that doesn't exist, so now he's gotta make a joke about the fact
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560]  that we're right.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  Let's go to the next clip.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.480]  But never fear, Uncle Sam's not gonna let ISIS ring and run ya, Texas.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.160]  In fact, not only is the U.S. military conducting training ops right now for missions against
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.360]  ISIS-like groups, guess where they're doing them?
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.200]  Texas is one of seven states where the exercise is to be held.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.440]  During the Special Forces Training Operation, it's called Jade Helm 15.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440]  Ah!
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  Jade Helm 15!
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]  I have that issue.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  It's, uh...
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]  It's, uh...
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440]  Is she...
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.000]  It's a comic book, he makes a joke.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.920]  The President's Captain American, Jadeopolis, I think.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.520]  Rest easy, Texas.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.160]  Good guys with guns, or on the case.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.840]  Conspiracy theories are running wild tonight about the army's plan for a multi-state training
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.840]  exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.080]  Well, the military says it's just training soldiers for the...
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:03.080]  They had one five years ago in four states around Tennessee where they ran checkpoints
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.680]  on the highway and searched everybody.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.760]  I mean, these things end up going live, we've got the footage, everybody knows it, but again,
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.080]  they just make jokes.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080]  Let's continue.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.040]  The realities of war, critics say the army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.640]  Some are calling it a Texas takeover...
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.760]  Deposit.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.360]  They edited Fox News down to make it sound like they were agreeing with it.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.120]  Fox News detectives like Stuart did.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.160]  So it's deception upon deception upon deception.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]  Let's continue.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.880]  You know who's calling it a Texas takeover?
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:33.880]  Long-star lunatics.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.880]  Yeah, we know your brother...
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.880]  No, it's the Houston assholes.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880]  Texas!
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.680]  There's no Texas takeover.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.680]  The United States government already controls...
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.000]  Back that up five seconds.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.280]  No, the U.S. government doesn't.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:52.720]  The private Federal Reserve that your brother works for does, and you know that.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.520]  You are our conqueror, Stuart, but not for long.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]  Make me sick.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.480]  Let's go back to the clips.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.640]  Texas!
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.960]  There's no Texas takeover.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.000]  The United States government already controls...
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Let's pause.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.440]  Again, we never said it was a takeover.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.960]  We already said you took over.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.120]  And we're going to expose the foreign interests that have taken over, and they're trying to
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.840]  dismantle what little freedom and economy and family rights are left.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.520]  You push too far.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.320]  And notice, you're getting upset because none of your propaganda works.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:32.480]  Now let's be ridiculed more by the man up on the hill, just like Rachel Maddow, the authority,
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480]  the Michael Mores.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.960]  They tell us what to do.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:42.000]  Since like the 1840s, and then he left, and he came back, and just borrow a textbook from
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  a neighboring state.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  It's all in there.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Right, boss.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.520]  Implying we're all ignorant and scum, that's what MSNBC does.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:54.960]  All Republicans are libertarians or dumb, that's why we just make more money on average
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.440]  and start companies and hire people.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.440]  It's all about a cult of how they're smart and patriots aren't.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.880]  Though we have hundreds of manuals and training manuals where the Army is training to take
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.600]  on veterans, gun owners, and the Tea Party.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.760]  And then goes out and does gun confiscation drills from California to Iowa.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.360]  See, our listeners read all those local news articles, going, isn't it wonderful the Army
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.200]  is here training to take the guns?
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.600]  You know, we saw Katrina too, Stuart.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.400]  I know you got bodyguards and don't want me to have guns to protect myself, but it's
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.800]  game over.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.360]  We're waking up the sleeping giant.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  Let's go back to Stuart.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:38.920]  Here's how un-belligerent the U.S. military is towards Texas.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:44.240]  They sent a Lieutenant Colonel to a local Texas town hall to waste his time.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.360]  All we want to do is make sure that our guys are trained for combat overseas.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.520]  It is a preparation for martial law.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.600]  That's because it's not a preparation for martial law, sir.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.600]  That's what you say.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.600]  It was.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.960]  Yeah, let's make fun of the old combat vet who knows what he's talking about.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.440]  A lot of these combat vets from Vietnam and Korea, folks ran operations like this in countries
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.560]  rounding people up.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.040]  They know what's going on.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.960]  I mean, I can show you 15 mainstream news articles submitting the Army's main mission
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.800]  as the Tea Party and veterans and gun owners.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.760]  I mean, I'm not even going to even show it.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:19.760]  You know what?
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.600]  For the Stuart people, pull up Forbes, how the Army would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.120]  Army War College trains to take on veterans.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.600]  Homeland Security says veterans, number one threat, number one terror group.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.120]  Founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in the military, blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.240]  Don't try it.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.440]  We're putting it on screen.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  Radio listeners, look it up.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.320]  Brigade, homeland, Army times, all of it.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.200]  Let's go back to the clip and then your phone calls.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.440]  They're getting really, truly wants to see you.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.440]  Is that right there?
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.440]  Right there?
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440]  Yeah, those are these weird Obama supporters.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.440]  Someone realizing they're not getting around to public comments on the plans parking a
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.440]  lot down by Kroger's.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440]  Not kidding.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.440]  Good pause.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:03.080]  No, those were Obama supporters, the only two there who our people were behind who would
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.560]  sit there and write everybody's name down and take photos of everybody.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.480]  Everybody on some federal contract.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.480]  And then they had the news say half the public wanted Jade Helm lying because the media has
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.720]  turned into an enemy propaganda arm.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.640]  Don't you think the 300, 400 people that were there all went and watched the news that night
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.320]  and heard that half the people supported Jade Helm, even though no one spoke in favor?
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:32.040]  Don't you think they know they're in trouble and they're not in America anymore?
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:39.920]  See, your big fat lies and your slicky pants, Federal Reserve, New York, Wall Street, Flim
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.320]  Flam, doesn't work forever.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.240]  And it doesn't work on Texans, boy.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.640]  Oh, you don't like it.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.680]  We talk like that, do you?
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.040]  You just want everybody from Texas to fill up the military to work for the Federal Reserve
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.480]  and take over the planet for you.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.480]  You want our strength.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]  You want our will.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.800]  And in the end, you're scared of us once you take over or want to make us the enemy.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.320]  Now let's go ahead and go back to the clip.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.880]  Not in this meeting, but come on, crazy people attend local town hall meeting, isn't a Texas
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]  specific story?
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.920]  I think the Constitution says you can't hold a town hall meeting without crazy people.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.680]  I think it's in there.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:17.040]  It's not like this is being taken seriously by anyone who holds actual power.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:22.760]  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor military personnel
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:28.080]  movements and training exercise schedules and ensure that safety and constitutional
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.080]  rights of Texans were not being violated.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080]  Oh, dear Lord.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]  Good pause.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.520]  I want Rob Dude to take this and take clips from my police tape films where they blow
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.120]  up a school, scare people, folks have heart attacks, a helicopter crashes.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.160]  The military attacks two sheriff's deputies.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.120]  They shoot and kill one, wound the other.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:50.680]  This is in previous drills where they tried to bribe the police chief, show the Associated
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.520]  Press where the military is doing hits.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.320]  Let's see, Stewart knows his audience is never in the military.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.440]  They don't know that they're doing dirty tricks training for America and other legitimate
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.440]  missions nestled within it.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.680]  He just is preying on his moron, trendy audience.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.080]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.120]  You had another waste of Texas funds that could have been spent on actual threats like
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.960]  your infamous chainsaw massacre.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.200]  There was an actual chainsaw massacre showing his ignorance.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.920]  Now let's expand on that.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:35.800]  Governor Abbott knows that Obama has shut down half of the coal power plants in Texas in
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.080]  six years, devastating our economy, devastating it.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:46.040]  We're not, we haven't, it's like Helter Skelter, we're coming down fast but miles above you.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.760]  We're not falling as fast as the rest of the country, but we're falling.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.760]  He knows they're shutting everything down.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.400]  He knows that the borders are wide open outside of law.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.360]  And so you've got the biggest military training exercise pretty much ever, different than
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360]  a lot of the others.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.880]  They're saying they're going to be simulating illegal activities in cities.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.560]  And so Abbott says, okay, I'll have the state guard where they're running their drill out
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.800]  of Camp Swift, the state guard's based.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.560]  We will monitor it.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.600]  A reasonable statement just like Ted Cruz and they misrepresent it like he's crazy.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.800]  This is what these enemies of America do, preying on the public.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.960]  Here it is, Texas.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.280]  It's not as if I don't find it adorable that your governor thinks your state guard could
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.760]  take on the United States military.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.440]  It's like a little dog growling it.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.400]  Let me tell you something Stuart, and I'm sure you know this, because I know you're
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:45.320]  a Psyop operative on record, like Anderson Cooper, you're above CIA, your Federal Reserve.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.960]  The U.S. Army is the reason we know everything.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:54.880]  The government is hopping mad that I get the training manual saying the founders are bad
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:01.200]  and men are bad, and the military's racist, and Hillary Clinton's our Messiah, and home
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.920]  schooling's bad, and Christians are bad, and the Tea Party's bad, and that the military's
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.520]  trained to take on gun owners.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.680]  I mean, who do you think gives us that?
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:20.120]  The Army, the federal marshals, the sheriffs, so again, this is also meant to manipulate
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.040]  Army members who watch this to go, that's right, I can beat up Texas.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:31.560]  See within it is this anti-state animus, the same thing being pushed by Albert Sharpton,
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.280]  and Albert Gore, and the rest of these scallywags, so see, everything he says is written as Psy
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.880]  War, it's disinfo.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.200]  Our military, though there are a lot of brave men and women, couldn't hold all the Baghdad
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.080]  against a few thousand fighters.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:26:00.520]  So yeah, if Texas actually gets up on its hind legs with 30 million people, and probably
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:05.480]  five million veterans, I don't know, can 100,000 U.S. trips beat five million veterans?
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.040]  Oh, who's the big dog now, you little punk?
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.760]  Now let's go back to the clip.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:20.200]  Oh, growling at a big dog, or an eight-year-old picking a fight with the predator.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.040]  But enough of the fear-mongering, you know these types of exercises have been going on
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.040]  in Texas for years, right?
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:42.920]  He cuts the video of an Apache helicopter blowing up old tanks.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.880]  Hey, I tell you what, if the military wants to go out in West Texas on private property
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.560]  and blow up tanks with helicopters, that's what they're supposed to do.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.400]  They're not doing that, they're trying to take on gun owners and veterans.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.280]  Get a slack-jawed, carnival-barker con man, piece of crap, Stuart.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.800]  Why don't you use your real name, Stuart?
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.400]  Are you ashamed to use your family name?
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  Your family might get ashamed.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.640]  And what a piece of crap you are?
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.280]  He's now retiring to float off and make movies.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.880]  He doesn't like to work every day.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:22.120]  Like his brother over there running the insider trading stuff at the Federal Reserve over
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.520]  there at the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.560]  The whole thing's an insider trading scam.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:32.000]  I'm tired of people like across between a carnival-barker and Ken Lay lecturing me all day and making
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  fun of my state.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.560]  Why is everybody evacuating New York and New Jersey to come here to get away from people
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560]  like you?
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.040]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.680]  As in fact, the 2001 roving sans operation was the largest exercise of its kind in history.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:52.760]  But did then pre-oops Governor Rick Perry start spreading fear about a Texas takeover?
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.520]  He did not.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:00.600]  Texas was fine with the concept of widespread military operations in their state in the 2000
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.600]  aughts.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.440]  So they used an appeal to Republicans to make it look like moderate Republicans went for
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.440]  it.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.440]  Oh, it's all because of Obama.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  Yeah, that's what-
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.560]  America elected a brutal socialist, Muslim, Kenyan, ineffective Harvard-schooled constitutional
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.560]  professor, agitator Warlock.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:23.880]  Well, all of that's true except the Kenyan parties from Hawaii.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.040]  It appears you are on the verge of being taken over by ISIS or the United States of America.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040]  No, it's not the United States of America.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  So you have a choice to make.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:38.560]  And when you make it, just remind yourself, and I never thought I'd be saying this, what
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  would Rick Perry do?
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.560]  So it's all a deception, all a sigh up against you and your family.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.560]  All right.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.760]  I'm going to move David Knight back to the start of the next hour to get into this bombshell
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.000]  how they're killing and maiming babies by design in the hospitals knowingly incredible
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.680]  hardcore eugenics, incredible breaking news at eight after next hour.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.680]  Then we're going to get Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs to pop in for part of a segment
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.720]  to talk about their experiences in Baltimore, Maryland, and then their take on the other
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720]  things that are happening.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.720]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.720]  We're going to go directly to John, Frank, Chris, Josh, and Mike when we hit the other
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.720]  side of this break.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  I'm not going to plug or anything first.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.400]  I'm going to go right to your calls in T minus three minutes, 10 seconds as we go out to
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.400]  break right here.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.800]  There's a lot of other breaking news at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that's off the
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  chart.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.960]  The enemy's trying to suppress us.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.960]  You see that.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.160]  Don't take these sites for granted, promote these stories.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.320]  He's getting us.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.760]  This is so important.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.120]  Get them out to everybody.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.600]  This is so important.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.600]  Get them out to everybody.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:52.440]  You know, now shove it down the throat of people like John, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:30:00.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:06.800]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now, and if you're wondering
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:12.440]  how on earth we ever got in this situation, well, I'll tell you how, when the Democrats
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:17.680]  showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.160]  Then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.520]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.840]  were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:40.480]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.160]  different results.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.400]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up America and break the matrix.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:55.520]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv and the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:02.400]  mind.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.840]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.080]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.800]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:20.200]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.720]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.120]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120]  drugs.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.200]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.240]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.800]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.400]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:49.840]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.160]  nutrients that taste great, obtain your child ease today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:59.360]  That's child ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:04.240]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.920]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:13.720]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder available through
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.920]  InfoWarsLife was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.120]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:29.160]  ingredients, often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:33.960]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.800]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:45.120]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:51.880]  With the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology, go to InfoWarsLife.com
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:33:21.720]  or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:41.520]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:34:05.520]  you are the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:14.320]  Go to InfoWars.com or PresidentPlanet.com.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.120]  White people don't dare talk about another story.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:23.480]  Parents shocked their 5-year-old, handcuffed and shackled by police, was a special-need
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:30.820]  student, washed him post, laments that Pamela Geller offers no apology after terrorists
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:33.560]  attacked her event in free speech.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.840]  They're running up the white flag on free speech by design to use the threat of terror
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.680]  as an excuse to shut down free speech.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.960]  He's saying, you endanger people when you have free speech, therefore we shut it down.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.360]  Alex had caught fixing ratings to target anti-Obama news sites.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.800]  We show the graphics and the proof in our internal numbers that show our ratings are
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.400]  going up, but they say they've gone down 70% or so.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:01.960]  I had our graphics guy, and we're going to add him to Watson's article right now, take
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:06.440]  Drudge, InfoWars, WorldNet Daily, and show this a little bit later after I take calls
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.200]  because we're adding the graphics now, they just finished him.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.920]  We take it off Alex.com on by Amazon, basically run by the Obama administration on record,
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.760]  and we lay them over each other showing October 1st is the date they engaged in this behavior.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.120]  So we're going to be adding those.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.680]  The graphs are already there, but we've overlaid them.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.960]  It's stunning October 1st last year, and we've seen all manner of other dirty tricks
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  going on.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.960]  I mean, this is big.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:37.520]  This is, again, preying on their customers, preying on people that go there to get accurate
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.800]  info on where to advertise.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:48.760]  This is, in my view, and the evidence is there, organized fraud, organized unfair trade practices.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.920]  It's like they always announce, Drudge has viruses, and then it's not true.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.120]  Different companies will go advertise their website on Drudge and then have a virus on
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:03.800]  their site, hoping you click through and then saying Drudge is getting people viruses.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.600]  I mean, there's no end to them.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.360]  They've tried it on us, different groups.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.640]  These people won't stop.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.520]  They want to shut us down.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.640]  Do not take infowars.com for granted.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.480]  Do not take prisonplanet.com for granted.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.640]  Do not take this news organization for granted.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.480]  It is a miracle that we're still on air.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.600]  All right, without further ado, drumroll please.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.360]  We are going to your phone calls.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.520]  John from Texas Disagrees on Jane Helm, Josh and Dakota Disagrees with Alex on Sensationalism.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.640]  Well, I mean, reality is sensational.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.800]  Obama opening the borders without law is sensational.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.640]  Mike in Canada says, I'm losing my edge.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.680]  Frank in North Carolina, I have double standards.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.480]  Chris Disagrees on taxes.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.920]  You don't have to preface it that you like me or this or that.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.960]  Just tell me where you disagree, and I'll give each one of you about a minute and a
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.480]  half, then I will rebut and go to the next person.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:01.360]  So, John in Texas, the former state of Texas, now female region six, occupied as John Stewart
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.720]  said by the globalist, he celebrated it.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.320]  Welcome John, you're on the air.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.320]  Hi Alex.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320]  Go ahead.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:14.520]  I noticed Jane Helm, I think more has to do with attacking another country than what
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.800]  it does with us.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:20.960]  If there's a heavy Caucasian element that is training exercise, they may be wanting to
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.800]  do something in Eastern Europe, maybe even attack Russia because Russia stands in the
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800]  way in the Middle East.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.600]  They can't finish the side off, they can't attack Iran, they got to deal with Russia
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]  first.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.640]  I actually totally agree with you.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:40.000]  This is having joint applications for Eastern European deployments, NATO admits they're
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.920]  preparing for that and wargaming, they're wargaming off Alaska, they're wargaming off
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.920]  Nova Scotia.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:51.360]  I've said from the start that I'm not mad at you John, but that's a straw man because
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:57.040]  it has dual training, but they are also doing infiltration of local government training.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.400]  You notice they said working with people on their farms, that'll be operatives they've
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.360]  got on the border with Russia.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.120]  So I totally agree with you that it has dual purposes, but the overall reason is to condition
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.720]  the public by doing these drills out of the open.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.120]  The matter how you look at this exercise Alex, what is to do with us or a foreign invasion
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.280]  or attack is evil, either way you look at it is evil.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.960]  Well sure, but they're having riot control drills from Tennessee to California that they
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.200]  won't let us into, but we shoot through the fence and then it's, I'm with a tea party,
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.280]  I'm a sovereign, you can't have my guns.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.480]  I mean I went to a Marine Corps drill with 3,000 Marines and over 2,000 foreign troops
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.840]  and they kept saying it's for Macedonia, it's for Macedonia.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.680]  Well yeah, they had a joint mission, but they had role-players screaming, I'm an American,
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  don't take my guns.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:56.960]  No, not the camp, and they had overhead satellite tracking and they were training to fight militias
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.360]  and they would catch, they let me in, but then their PR guy kept throwing me out, but
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.440]  we sent in people posing as citizens for a tour, they were cordon off streets, it was
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:13.360]  in the city of San Francisco and what's the town there, Oakland, I mean it's a two-hour
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.080]  film, people can watch it, so it was dual use.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:23.440]  But then I had Marines, two non-commissioned officers, who were friends with some folks
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:35.120]  that I knew, show up a year later at Access Television in 1999, this was 2000 then, they're
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.040]  like Alex we like your show, you have no idea what was really going on, and they were simulating
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:46.520]  terrorists attacking by water and the terrorists were patriots, and they were simulating and
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:55.160]  then they had drones up and it's video, they're going death star, death star, we're in control,
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.200]  we've got them moving and they were just going to show you a minute of this, and then they
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:04.280]  showed us coming out of the hotel, the Marriott, and me throwing coffee on the ground that
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:09.600]  had been left in the car, and peeing up against a tree and stuff like that, because I don't
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.360]  want to go back in, you've got to pee and you're going to get in the car, and it was
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.200]  ridiculous, and I said please let me show the public, oh no we'd be arrested, in fact
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.840]  don't talk about this for years, and then they left, and then my friends wouldn't even
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  tell me who they were, they just go out of their family, but I mean they used us in the
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:32.400]  simulation like we were added role players and we didn't even know it, so believe me
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:37.160]  I know all about these exercises, I've covered personally more than 30 of them, go ahead
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:43.800]  anything else Sean? Well I think maybe you can just cheat on exercise Alex, maybe everybody
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.680]  is sexist out of open carry, because everybody just don't get threatened, don't do, everybody
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.120]  carry their stuff with you, that sort of send them a message right there. It's going to
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.920]  be like the sage event they've been in for 50 years, which is legitimate except that
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.640]  it gets violent, people don't know what's going on, they've had people killed I think
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:08.320]  three times, twice by citizens once by cops, because you see people breaking into a warehouse
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.280]  and they've got guns, I mean you know the average person pulls a gun out and says hit
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.480]  the ground, the jade helm guys think you're part of a drill and then they point the gun
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:27.280]  at you, you shoot them, I mean this has happened three times outside Fort Bragg, because they
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.320]  operate 30-40 miles out, I mean what are the cops supposed to do when they see somebody
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.840]  aim, somebody else at gunpoint, they just shoot you, it's what you're supposed to do
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.120]  and that's why people are really concerned, in fact since you said this and I'm going
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.960]  to Mike, Josh, Chris, Frank don't hang up, these clips are short, here is Thomas Mead
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:49.880]  who actually runs with a private contractor, this giant multi-thousand special forces,
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.600]  you got 10-1 support, tens of thousands of trips, private contractors, here he is in
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.840]  another Texas town admitting that they're going to be getting in people's cars, doing
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.760]  simulating illegal stuff and then we have the colonel, I'll put this in a report by
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.200]  the way, saying none of that's true and that we're liars, two weeks later, so see they're
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:16.680]  lying to us, their own jade helm handout says the things we've said and then they tell the
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.880]  media it doesn't exist, thank you caller, John, well let's go to that short clip, here
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.880]  it is.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:29.680]  Within the cities you won't see most of this, I would tell you, for example increased aircraft
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.240]  in the area at night, you'll see that out in the rural area, we have a resupply, an
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:41.120]  aerial drop that will occur and then some paratroopers as well will jump into Martin
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:50.600]  County in early August, it won't happen within the city limits, and there's another clip
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:57.640]  we should play, let's go ahead and roll that one, one of the things that we do as well,
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:04.320]  they will be carrying weapons but it won't be live ammunition, it will all be blank ammunition.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.680]  Just to correct one thing that was in the newspaper on Sunday that I read was they'll
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:17.280]  have blank ammunition but there will not be any explosions, we won't be setting off live
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:24.640]  demolition out here, the guys will be wearing civilian attire or a mixed uniform, they may
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:34.200]  be wearing fatigue bottoms and a t-shirt, but that's not the thing that's at the ordinary
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:41.320]  in West Texas from what I've seen, especially during the season, and they may be driving
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.000]  civilian vehicles throughout the area, so really within the city limits if you notice
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  my guys, they're probably really doing something wrong.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.560]  Then they came to Austin and Bastropin said none of this was true and they never said
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.680]  it and laughed at us, should we play the clip, we've got that cut out right where he says
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.120]  the colonel with this guy behind him puppeting him says no we're not going to be in the town,
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.520]  we're not going to be in plain clothes, that's ridiculous, it's just crazy, we should call
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.520]  it the lies of Jade Helm.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.760]  Mike in Canada says I'm losing my edge, go ahead Mike and then we'll go to Chris and
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:19.760]  others, go ahead.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:26.920]  Hey Alex, so what I wanted to hit on was you could break the news tomorrow that America
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:34.280]  is being invaded and America would just continue on like normally, but when you have debates
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.960]  and you come out on top of those debates, you'll notice that Pierce Morgan, look what
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:45.520]  happened, I missed those, you had a little bit with St. Eugir, also you had some good
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.840]  debates with Max Kaiser.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.680]  Well here's the deal, here's the deal, my show's big but it's my audience, they won't
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:56.080]  let me on TV because I take over, I dominate, I break the news and then the people's ratings
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.840]  go down, I destroy people, because I break the matrix, I go look it's all a trance,
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:06.920]  it's fake, you're a foreigner, you're wanting our guns, this is crazy, get out Redcove because
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:13.560]  I don't have it within their false paradigm, I circumvent John Stuart, they've tried to
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:19.400]  set me up on The Daily Show with John Stuart, let me not exaggerate, since it started back
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.920]  in 2000 or whatever it was, or 99, I don't know how long it's been around, I have been
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:31.000]  called by them, let me not exaggerate, 20 times, they've even bought the tickets before
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.320]  and then it always gets cancelled, so I don't even respond when they call now, they've attacked
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:43.000]  me on there probably 20 times, that and also on the co-bear cat litter report, okay, so
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.200]  that's what these people do, they won't get in a ring with me, they'd rather buy the radio
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.600]  stations I'm on to kick me off the air or put out ratings that I have no listeners and
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:59.040]  play games, okay, this is what these skellywags do, sorry, go ahead.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.400]  Yeah, you know, I've been watching quite a bit of videos of you back in the day being
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.400]  on RT, being on Fox, and I mean some of them, there was one where there was a woman who
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:20.160]  was asking you about your big planes and for proof, and you went off on the Vietnam, that
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.160] ...
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:26.000]  They asked, they asked, when, it was Fox News, they said, when was there, it was the
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.680]  Royal Rivera, he told me I'm banned from there, not by him, by the executives, he said, oh
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.800]  they love you when you come on, the people do, but not others, and other people told
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:39.240]  me I'm banned, that's all fine, Fox asked me to come do a trailer up there years ago,
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:47.640]  and basically meet with their executives, and I just said, you know what, okay, and
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.160]  I told the other person that wanted me to come, I said, now watch, they're gonna cancel
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:57.480]  it, and sure enough they did, the next time they invited me, I didn't go do it, I mean
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:02.800]  I've flown to New York to be on Fox News like 10 years ago, and they didn't put me on, and
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.960]  they go, oh, go enjoy the day, here's a gift certificate to a steakhouse, okay, I've been
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.600]  through it, they won't get in the ring with me, they won't get on the racetrack with
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:19.280]  me, I will smoke them, and it's not that I'm anything special, I mean I was debating these
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.520]  ladies on there, they're like, oh come on, our government's never staged something, and
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:32.840]  I went, the main Operation Ajax in 53, Gulf of Tonkin, 1964, declassified, staged events,
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.880]  Operation Northwoods, and the Royal Rivera looks at him and goes, well that is true,
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:40.720]  so yes, they won't let me on because I have facts, God bless you Mike, I appreciate your
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:47.640]  call, but you say you disagree, I'm losing my edge, they won't put me in the arena, they're
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.720]  coming at, look I don't want to whine because I'm not, I expect flak, but I expect to be
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:56.520]  backed, they're coming out of the woodwork against us folks, I'm attacked by hundreds
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:01.960]  of newspapers a day, CBS News, NBC, ABC, all of them, all of them attacked me on the nightly
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:08.920]  news last night, and last week, I mean do you understand folks, they didn't all attack
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.000]  me last night, it was last week they all attacked me, this is going on, why do you think, because
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.040]  I've got them, I've studied them, I'm willing to be put in prison or killed, I just, I don't
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.880]  look forward to it, but I mean I'm not worried about it, because I'm not backing down, I'm
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:30.680]  never going to sell out to these people, and I'm in a fight, and that's why I'm so aggressive,
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:36.320]  is because this is life or death, I'm in a death battle people, I am in a death battle,
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:43.160]  I am in a death battle, a death battle, we have been usurped by criminals that put poison
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:48.640]  in vaccines and kill babies on purpose, they're killing babies all over the country, euthanizing
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:55.640]  them with vaccines, newborn, premature babies, that's coming up in the next hour, eyewitnesses,
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:02.040]  their convulsions, the deaths, it's a death battle, the only reason I'm still alive is
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:06.140]  the grace of God, and the fact that they don't want to make me a martyr, but they're killing
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:11.640]  my name first, so they can then physically set me up, do you understand that, I don't
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.680]  care, because the transmission's being sent, and they can kill me an individual, but they
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:21.800]  will never shut down that message, they'll only gain credibility as it all unfolds, and
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.960]  that's another reason they haven't killed me, because they know I will rise again like
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.480]  the phoenix long after I'm dead, and that's what I'm all about, that's what I want, in
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.920]  fact they know secretly that I dare them to come after me, I'm not worried about it, and
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.560]  I hate to use a cheesy Obi-Wan Kenobi thing, but I'm telling you they were coming at me,
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.720]  I might just stand there and take it, in fact I've already thought about it, the only thing
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:52.720]  that keeps me doing it is my children, the only thing that keeps me from not putting myself
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.280]  in positions where I know the enemy will take me out is my children, I want to stay here
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:01.280]  for them, I need to take care of my children, that's the only fear I've got, I am committed,
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.720]  and that's a strength they don't have, they don't have any will, they're not honorable,
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.240]  these people are crap, excuse me, let's go ahead and talk to Chris and Georgia, go ahead.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:18.720]  Alex, hey, hey, I want to take issue with you on taxes, but since you start talking
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.080]  about Texas history, I want to take issue with you on that, can you hear me okay?
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:27.960]  Yeah, we're going to break, I'm sorry I wouldn't pay attention to the breaks, go ahead and
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.880]  make your point on taxes, I'll come back to you.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:34.600]  Alright, well now, I'm switching to Texas history because I think you got a couple
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.600]  things wrong.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.880]  Well, of course I get a lot of stuff wrong, I'm just going with a gestalt, you can nitpick
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.460]  anything I said, I'm going to come back to you, okay fine, we're going to disagree on
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:48.840]  Texas history, when we return, I can't wait to hear this, we're going to go to break,
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:55.800]  and then we're going to come back to you, we're going to go to Josh, Frank, Joshua,

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.240]  of behavior that's starting to do the research, I think it's that type of behavior that's
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:41.480]  starting to do the research, I think it's that type of behavior, I think it's that

[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:47.180]  You know, there's so much to get into here. I just briefly want to show this on screen as I ask for it. It's being added to the article. Alexa caught fixing ratings that target anti-Obama news sites. We have the untouched graphics in there proving it, but what's stunning is if you take InfoWars.com and MSNBC or Drudge Report and MSNBC or Drudge Report and the other sites are world-net daily, on October 1st exactly last year,
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:55:03.180]  they lower all of us and turbocharge these other sites. So if the graph was in reality, you just keep it going and then the spikes you see, it would have been flat and then spiking, going up about 25-30%.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:14.180]  So in truth, Fox News is plunging. Oh yeah, Fox News got their thing cooked too. But then Fox News is going back up.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:24.180]  So in reality, Fox News is going up. They've got them going down. In reality, Daily Cost is going down. They've got them going up. I mean, this is just incredible.
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:32.180]  They go to one of the major rating services and cook it and don't even phase it in over a few months. They do it October 1st.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:41.180]  And I guarantee you when they get sued or whatever, they're going to go, well, we just changed our algorithm, really, to where anybody that doesn't hate the country.
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:52.180]  I mean, look at infowars. They really hate us. They dropped us by almost 80%. And then when you look at our Google, we're up 30.
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:56:03.180]  PBS is up 200%. We're down massively. I mean, it's just MSNBC is up 200%. We're down 80%. I mean, it's just media matters run by the White House. Why? Look at that.
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:12.180]  Look at all that's kind of like Michelle Obama's fake Twitter accounts. They said, what, 96% of them were fake or something? Just it's all fake. It's all fraud.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:23.180]  My listeners are all there. Our viewers are all there. But let's make them really angry. Let's tell everybody about the show today. Send out email out Facebook, Twitter, on their platforms, our videos, our articles, get them out every day.
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:28.180]  Make the commitment I salute you. Okay, Chris and Georgia, go ahead. What do you disagree with?
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:36.180]  Okay, Alex, you know, you got to keep in mind, I greatly appreciate... No, no, no. Don't preface. Don't preface. Don't preface. Tell me where I'm wrong.
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:56.180]  Okay. I know you know Texas history better than I do. Not that good. You also know this. You also know this as well. When Lee and Grant, U.S. Grant and Robert E. Lee were junior officers in the Mexican-American war, they both went home protesting the atrocities that the U.S. Army was committing against Mexicans.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:06.180]  Up to 40% of U.S. troops defected. Have you ever heard during the Mexican-American war because they were so demoralized?
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:10.180]  Less because our troops were moral compared to a lot of their armies. It's absolutely true.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:13.180]  Have you ever heard of the St. Patrick's Battalion?
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:19.180]  Yeah, that was Catholics made up of U.S. and Irish.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:30.180]  Irish soldiers that defected and joined the Mexican side. And I'm not saying that makes the cause of Texas today tainted or anything. I greatly appreciate the example of Texas.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:41.180]  Yeah, but I mean, Mexico had Santa Ana and others committing horrible atrocities. So bad in Guatemala, they broke off. I didn't ever... What does the Mexican-American war have to do with Texas?
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:47.180]  The Mexicans were coming all the way up in Oklahoma, killing anybody they found, the Mexican Army. They were committing atrocities.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:56.180]  Hell, there were atrocities in World War I with Blackjack Pershing when the Mexicans attacked Texas, so he went and committed atrocities back.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:03.180]  No one's... These are all strawmen, Chris. I never said that there weren't atrocities committed in the invasion of Mexico.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:15.180]  All I'm saying is that I haven't heard you illustrate that side of it yet, and it just purifies your discussions when you show more of a balanced point of view.
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:21.180]  Now, I told you, I greatly appreciate the example of Texas there at my daughter's graduation in Austin last year.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:29.180]  You know, I saw more three times as many Texas flags as I did U.S. flags in Shuckold. It's just the opposite here in Georgia.
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:36.180]  That's what we need is stage rights. God bless you. I appreciate your point. That is a legitimate criticism as I should get to more angles of history like that.
[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:42.180]  Plus, it's super interesting. I'm just going to think of a parallel. Look, when they attack the American people, you're going to see the whole military defect.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:48.180]  They probably want to go to robots. The globalists can be pushed over. I'm telling you, they're a joke.
[01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:56.180]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties. What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:59.180]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:07.180]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.180]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:15.180]  A few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:21.180]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:25.180]  Fluoride is a tea. It's a coffee. It's a water. It's a bread. It's a toothpaste.
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:29.180]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:32.180]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:17.180]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:24.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:29.180]  Frank in North Carolina, then Josh in others. We're talking to collars that disagree today. It's very interesting.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:34.180]  They're making some good points, but not really attacking me direct on.
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:41.180]  More knows or plenty to disagree with. I hear my show rebroadcast and think, I didn't say that correctly or I'm wrong about that.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:47.180]  It's hard to think on your feet and not have a teleprompter. But again, it's even harder to be a slave.
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:51.180]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:57.180]  Alex, man, I'll get into the ring with you any day, man. Just send out the call and promise me you'll do that.
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:03.180]  Well, you haven't made me mad, but you might beat me up. I'm sure I can beat John Stewart.
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:07.180]  So I don't want to get in the ring with you. Plus, I mean, when I get super famous,
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:13.180]  I mean, would help me get the word out to get in the ring with Pierce Morgan or somebody like John Stewart.
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:17.180]  I mean, I don't actually like fighting. So I mean, what would I get from fighting?
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:21.180]  I'm not famous. I probably couldn't make famous. I know a guy down here that's famous, though.
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:24.180]  He's one of your bigger supporters, Keith Larson at WBT Radio.
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:30.180]  He's been promoting your show for so many years. Every opportunity, he's always talking about infowords.com.
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:34.180]  Well, he's awesome. I don't know who he is, but maybe I've been on a show. I can't keep track.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.180]  So go ahead. What do you disagree with?
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:38.180]  I don't know if you've ever been on there. He's always talking about you.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:42.180]  But you know, I've seen the 9-11 Truth Movement. I've been watching it for about 10 years,
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.180]  and the fire seems to have gone out of it some years ago to me.
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:52.180]  I know this. I've become aware of this woman. She was a flight attendant for 30 years,
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:57.180]  and she just woke up a couple years ago, and she's written a book,
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:04.180]  and I'd really wish you'd get her on there, but I think this will reignite the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:09.180]  She's become very prolific. She's on a lot of radio shows out there. People are waking up.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:13.180]  Airline, commercial airline pilots are ordering her book by the truckload.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.180]  Okay, what's her name?
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.180]  They're like, how come we didn't ever saw this before?
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:23.180]  Her name is Rebecca Roth, and the title of her book is Methodical Illusion.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:27.180]  But you know, I call it in about the double standard.
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:31.180]  I feel like you have, Wayne Madsen, I give you a lot of credit for having him on.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:35.180]  I've heard him for about 10 years on your show, and I think he's pretty good.
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:39.180]  He's pretty hardcore. He's a little bit too far to the left, perhaps, for me,
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:44.180]  but I notice over the years, more and more, you've been becoming more and more comfortable
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:50.180]  and kind of buddy-buddying up with the kind of neocon, kind of fake conservative,
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:56.180]  or a scientist wing of, you know, of the political element.
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:59.180]  Well, that's because I work for them.
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:05.180]  That's because I get direct orders from Tel Aviv every day, man.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:09.180]  Yeah, well, I don't know about that, but it's just something I've noticed.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.180]  You know, you woke me up. You were on George Norris' show one night.
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:14.180]  I think it was in December of 2000.
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:19.180]  Listen, listen, you made your statement. I appreciate it, but let me be serious with you, okay?
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.180]  I've been very critical of many of the policies in Israel.
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:26.180]  There's a leftist UN move to destroy Israel.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:30.180]  It's part of a larger global government plan, just like I don't agree with the police,
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:36.180]  but I don't want to have a civil war with them, okay, on many fronts.
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:39.180]  The same thing with Israel. I'm not obsessed with Israel.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.180]  I'm sick of hearing about it.
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:45.180]  I'm trying to promote a culture of liberty, free market, family, and due process,
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:49.180]  and choice, like on vaccines.
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:56.180]  So I don't try to get into bashing Catholics, bashing Jews, bashing this, bashing that.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:02.180]  And I've had the anti-Israel crowd make up outrageous things about me.
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:06.180]  So I've got to say the folks that are bashing Israel,
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.180]  I bet a lot of them actually work for some of the Israeli lobby,
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:14.180]  because that's what Cassensee said they do, to discredit legitimate criticism of Israel.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.180]  You know, you've got these professors exposing five years ago
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:20.180]  that Israel lobbies manipulating our internal operations. I don't like that.
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:22.180]  I don't like any foreign government doing that.
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:27.180]  That said, though, it doesn't mean I didn't embrace the whole anti-Israel crowd,
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:31.180]  who a lot of them are just big losers who want to say they're big men
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:34.180]  and just say, I work for Israel.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:39.180]  But then they'll say, Alex Jones woke most people up, but man, he works for the Israelis.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.180]  I mean, it's just not real.
[02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:46.180]  And so there is no double standard.
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:53.180]  I am not a Israel file, but because either way, I don't worship Israel.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:55.180]  I don't obsess on Israel.
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:05:24.180]  I'm going to let you finish up when we come back. Stay there.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:32.180]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:58.180]  More reports on infowars.com.
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:28.180]  Call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.180]  Call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:27.180]  Call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.180]  Call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:05.180]  We're not going to take it. No!
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:08.180]  We're not going to take it.
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:11.180]  Hell, we ain't going to take it.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:17.180]  We're not going to take it anymore.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:22.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:24.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:34.180]  It came out last week in Australia a week after the Prime Minister called for forced inoculations
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:40.180]  or that tax refunds would be withheld, basically, from the general population of the country.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:46.180]  The tax exemption where you get some money back for the number of children you have, similar to US law,
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:54.180]  but if you didn't take the vaccine, upwards of $15,000 to $20,000 in Australian would be held back each year.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:09:00.180]  Then a 2006 interview came out when he was in the general government, not Prime Minister,
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:05.180]  where he said, I will not give my daughters the Gardasil shot because of the problems with it.
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:11.180]  He's now mandating Gardasil for girls, even though the insert says doesn't protect you from human papillomavirus,
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:18.180]  even though it's been banned in places like Japan and India.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:25.180]  What we're about to cover is over the top, and I want people to very quietly just focus for a moment
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:31.180]  and center yourselves, myself included, so that what we're about to cover doesn't just get lost in transmission
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:38.180]  because the group of stories David Knight's about to cover in our eye witness we're going to play a clip from
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:40.180]  gives you the entire picture.
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:44.180]  We're under what I call soft kill, actually Colonel Alexander calls it that,
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:50.180]  silent weapons for quiet wars, where you're hit with radiation, you're hit with chemicals, you're hit with biologicals,
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:57.180]  it kills you 30 years later, it debilitates you first and puts pressure on the population.
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:04.180]  The 223 round developed for Vietnam in the Colt M16 was actually a great weapon.
[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:16.180]  It's been perfected now, had its problems, but it was designed to maim and to debilitate and to hit bone at high speed
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:21.180]  2500 feet a second or faster and break up.
[02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:26.180]  And that's what happens when you shoot wild hogs, deer, you name it, but I've shot telephone books with them,
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:31.180]  you name it, with full metal jacket or hollow point, they fragment.
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:40.180]  Other rounds don't do that anywhere near the same extent, 308, 50 cal, other rounds used by NATO.
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:44.180]  That is a soft kill weapon and Colonel Alexander in his paper talks about it.
[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:50.180]  And then when you study soft kill, you look around you and you realize it's what they call unconventional warfare.
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:55.180]  And David's going to break down from the Army War College their definition that's on Wikipedia.
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:11:02.180]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex, you know, when we talked about unconventional warfare and that's the way the military talks about Jade Helm,
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:06.180]  some of the reporters I've talked to would say, well, they report it.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:09.180]  This is unconventional, but it's realistic military training.
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:16.180]  And it's like, you have to understand that unconventional warfare is a very specific term, just like asymmetric warfare.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.180]  If you go to Wikipedia, you'll see this.
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:23.180]  Now there's a DOD Wikipedia entry that doesn't really get to the heart of the matter.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:26.180]  The other one is far better because it's got quotes from John F. Kennedy and others.
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:35.180]  But they say this, the general objective of unconventional warfare is to instill a belief that peace and security are not possible without compromise or concession.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:42.180]  Specific objectives include war awareness, curtailment of standard of living, taking away civil liberties.
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.180]  Where have we seen all this before?
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:45.180]  And of course, that's the essence of it.
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:48.180]  And so we are living under an unconventional warfare.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:52.180]  And one of the aspects of it, Alex, is medical tyranny.
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:12:04.180]  And the reason I don't get a lot into those specifics with the nurses, it's so painful when you actually talk to them and you learn they're withholding food and water from old people that can walk under fine but are wards of the state.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:09.180]  That was even the Wall Street Journal with the Wesley Smith series of articles.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:13.180]  Then we discover years ago that there's don't treat list in the VA.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:21.180]  It breaks last year and it goes from premeditated Watson computers from IBM deciding not to treat people that are treatable.
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.180]  Young and old, male and female, black and white, horrible, slow deaths.
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.180]  They won't give Joe Big surgery, won't help him.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:28.180]  Same deal.
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:29.180]  He's on a don't treat list.
[02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:30.180]  He's been there like 50 times.
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:31.180]  They won't help him.
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:35.180]  And we know you do what you're told you're put on a don't treat list.
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:39.180]  We hear about how we love veterans all day, but they're killing them right in front of us.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:46.180]  Well, what about 70% of foster children being on psychotropic and on average seven national average?
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:47.180]  Same average in Texas.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:54.180]  You can pull up those headlines 70% of foster children on antidepressants and on average seven drugs.
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:59.180]  And medical doctors have gone public in Texas and said, I used to be for this, but we put them on seven drugs.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:00.180]  Next, they have convulsions.
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:01.180]  Next, they're dead.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:03.180]  These were healthy kids in two years.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:04.180]  They're dead.
[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:07.180]  It's soft kill and they're testing to see what they can get away with.
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:08.180]  You had a nurse on.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:11.180]  We're going to play clips of this and you have these incredible quotes.
[02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:13.180]  I'm going to give you the floor here for the next five minutes, David.
[02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:17.180]  I just hope the listeners realize how over the top this is.
[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:28.180]  And I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:34.180]  Do you really want to be part of euthanizing troops and little babies and be careful.
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:41.180]  Those of you that have never been in a fight, never been in a big car wreck, never been kidnapped, never been hurt, never been through pain, never been in combat.
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:44.180]  You sit there in your soft position going, yeah, go ahead.
[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:45.180]  I don't care.
[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:49.180]  You will have hell visited on you, not by us.
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:55.180]  Even if they don't believe in God, the universe has a way of what comes around, goes around.
[02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:56.180]  I'm God fearing.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.180]  I can feel the will of the universe.
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:13:59.180]  I want to call it that.
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:05.180]  And I can feel when I even think about the stuff you're doing, how much my soul shakes.
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:08.180]  So you think before you make jokes about what we're about to cover here.
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.180]  David, I want to drill into this.
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:12.180]  I want to get more nurses, more whistleblowers.
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:14.180]  I know this is going on.
[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:20.180]  Five years ago, they changed, or now six years ago, the inserts that said, never get a pregnant woman in the shot.
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:23.180]  Never give a newborn baby or a premature baby this.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:29.180]  Never give a baby that's already sick or has autoimmune problems with shots because they knew it would exacerbate it and kill them.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:31.180]  And they're settling lawsuits about this.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:35.180]  But they're setting it up to see if the nurses will sit there and kill the kids.
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:39.180]  You have incredible testimony, break down her quotes, then play the clip.
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:41.180]  Absolutely. This is Michelle Rodin.
[02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:43.180]  She's with nurses against mandatory vaccines.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:45.180]  It's an organization.
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:54.180]  She is a neonatal nurse practitioner for people who don't know that is training and clinical beyond a registered nurse.
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:55.180]  It's a lady expert.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.180]  Exactly.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:02.180]  We talked to her for quite a while because, of course, the title of the interview was first they came for the nurses.
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:09.180]  We know that they're using these same kinds of pressure points against the nurses just as they have, as you mentioned, in Australia.
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.180]  They threaten you.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:12.180]  Say, you can't have your kid in school.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.180]  We're going to come after you because the kid is going to be...
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:15.180]  Pure totalitarianism.
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:16.180]  Exactly. Or take away benefits.
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:18.180]  Well, they've been doing this for a long time to nurses.
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:22.180]  And, of course, the government is putting the pressure on the hospitals financially.
[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:24.180]  So the hospitals put the pressure on the nurses.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:27.180]  So we talked about that, Alex, for, I guess, about three quarters of the interview.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:37.180]  And then she made this amazing recount of what she had seen in neonatal care where they gave vaccines to young babies,
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:39.180]  even though they knew they weren't in physical condition,
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:43.180]  even though they knew that they were going to have a massive reaction to it.
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:45.180]  They just kind of laughed and said, get the beds ready.
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:47.180]  Here's that quote from her.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:49.180]  I think we are doing them too young.
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:55.180]  I think we are doing way too many at once if you just look at how fast the schedule has grown.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:16:00.180]  I think what a lot of people don't realize in a closed space like in NICU,
[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:04.180]  is they've decided that we need to vaccinate these babies on time.
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:07.180]  Two months after they're born, bam, there it goes.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:14.180]  Is this baby could be four months early and still supposed to be inside their mother and weighing three or four pounds?
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:15.180]  Oh, that's a good point.
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:27.180]  The amount of vaccine as a 200-pound man and you, and I've sat in a room with all of our on-call staff, physicians and practitioners,
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:34.180]  like, oh, wow, this is so embarrassing, this 25-week or never actually required a breathing tube and going on the vent,
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.180]  you know, after he was born, he was so strong.
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:39.180]  But we gave him his two-month vaccinations and he got intubated last night.
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:41.180]  Ha, ha, ha, oops, how embarrassing.
[02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:42.180]  Like, it's funny.
[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:44.180]  Oh, he can't breathe now.
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:50.180]  The staff down units are calling the NICU saying, hey, we're going to go ahead and give these four babies their two-month shots today.
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:58.180]  Make sure you have beds ready because we all know they're going to have increased breathing difficulty, feeding and digestion difficulty,
[02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:01.180]  apnea, you know, forgetting to breathe and brain and cardio.
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:03.180]  This is what goes on.
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:11.180]  So the whole medical ethic of first-do-no-harm just goes out the door so they can follow the vaccine company's schedule.
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:18.180]  Somehow, it's just everybody's on this straight, they're marching the line of this is what we need to do.
[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:27.180]  And so now that I'm in private practice in the clinics, you just see these kids, they are so sick and they come in sick.
[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:28.180]  For life.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:37.180]  And a lot of pediatricians are giving them vaccines while they're sick, even though that is a contraindication and they're just getting kicked while they're down over and over and over again.
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:39.180]  Kicked while they're down.
[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:46.180]  You want to know what 1984 is, the future is Winston, a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:49.180]  We're going to come back to David Knight after this break and give him the floor.
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.180]  In fact, I'm going to let you host the next segment so you can really focus for six minutes entirely on this.
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.180]  And I'm going to have my lunch and watch in the control room and let you finish up.
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:17:59.180]  But this is what tears my guts out.
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:02.180]  This is a beautiful, smart woman with like five degrees.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:04.180]  We had them on screen.
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.180]  She goes, I don't know what's going on.
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:07.180]  I don't understand.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:11.180]  And then they all make jokes because they're so uncomfortable.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.180]  They want to hurt and kill these kids.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:15.180]  The kids stop breathing.
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:24.180]  They're killing them and then keeping them alive to have a life of hell, autistic brain damage, cancer.
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:26.180]  You shoot the enemy with a two, two, three.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:28.180]  It takes 10 people to take care of them.
[02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:31.180]  You shoot a child when they're down.
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:38.180]  And now they're going to be in diapers till they're 45 and attack a police officer on the side of the highway screaming mommy.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:42.180]  45 year olds in diapers running around totally insane.
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.180]  You wait.
[02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:47.180]  Autism has gone from one in 30,000 to like one in a couple, you know, 56.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:52.180]  Imagine those kids are all going to be 20, 30, 40 strongest hell.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:54.180]  And they're all going to be out there.
[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:57.180]  Giant armies ensued by 2025.
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:59.180]  One in 10.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:01.180]  That's mainstream news.
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:03.180]  MIT said that two weeks ago.
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.180]  One in 10 will not know what planet they're on.
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:07.180]  But nothing's happening.
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:09.180]  Alex is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:10.180]  Love the government.
[02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:12.180]  Hand over your firearms.
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:14.180]  We're going to go to break.
[02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:17.180]  Let our guest host in here take over.
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:23.180]  I'm going to come back and go to Josh who disagrees and Malik and Casey and Joshua and Truth Raider and everybody else.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:25.180]  And then I'll hit some other news as well.
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:26.180]  But I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:27.180]  I was so busy battling.
[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:29.180]  If you believe in what we're doing, spread the word.
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:30.180]  Tell your friends and family.
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.180]  Send them links to the videos, the audio feed, infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:35.180]  I'm fighting back.
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.180]  I'm not submitting in the ditch.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:42.180]  I'm standing up for these babies because I don't want to be treated like that or my kids be treated like that.
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:44.180]  I have empathy for them.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.180]  Where is your humanity?
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:48.180]  Spread the word now in the enemy's attack.
[02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:54.180]  Pray for us and go to infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com and check out the amazing products and shop with the good guys.
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:56.180]  But most importantly, pray for us.
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:59.180]  We'll be back with the execution of babies.
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:32.180]  The values of our founding fathers are central to the GCN network.

[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:38.180]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:44.180]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience.
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:50.180]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:08.180]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:16.180]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:23.180]  People say that you folks have an amazing product. I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:26.180]  I've suffered with thoughts and contemplations most of my life.
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:30.180]  Within a few days of taking one world away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:34.180]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:38.180]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:42.180]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain is gone.
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:47.180]  I'm finishing up a five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more. I love your product. Thank you.

[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:13.180]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I'll be hosting this segment.
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:19.180]  Alex wanted me to talk a little bit more about this interview that we had last week with Michelle Rodin.
[02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:28.180]  I'm sorry, of the nurses against mandatory vaccines. She had a bombshell admission of what she had seen in hospitals
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:34.180]  where knowing that these premature babies were not in physical condition to deal with the vaccines,
[02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:38.180]  they were going to give them anyway, even to the extent that they would say,
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:44.180]  get the extra beds ready because we know that they're going to have problems with increased breathing difficulties,
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:50.180]  with feeding and digestion difficulties, with apnea, with bradycardia, and it goes on, she says,
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:55.180]  kicking the kids while they're down, giving it to sick children over and over again.
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:25:00.180]  And of course, we just got this news break in. This is about the Nepal quake.
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:07.180]  They're now going to use this as an opportunity to vaccinate 500,000 children.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:11.180]  They haven't got enough to deal with, so they're going to gift them the vaccines.
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:15.180]  This is going to be done by UNICEF and the World Health Organizations.
[02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:21.180]  And here's what they're telling everybody. Measles are very contagious and can potentially be deadly.
[02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:29.180]  So we have an opportunity in Nepal after this earthquake to vaccinate all these kids and save them from measles.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:37.180]  That is not the agenda, as Alex Jones pointed out in the last segment, drawing parallels to real unconventional warfare,
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:44.180]  drawing parallels to the guns and the ammunition rounds that were not designed to kill but designed to maim.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:47.180]  We've seen militaries do that. We've done that. We've engaged in that.
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:54.180]  And of course, unconventional warfare is at its heart about destroying the will of the people.
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:59.180]  Alex made a brilliant analogy when he said, if you get one of these kids' damage for life with vaccines,
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:04.180]  and of course, that happens, the damage for life, you not only take them out of the game,
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:10.180]  but you take down their family as well. You take them out of the game because now they are caregivers for life.
[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:17.180]  And then after the parents die, the children become a ward of the state, a burden to the other people to take care of.
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.180]  Why? Because they gave them these vaccines knowing the damage that it would do.
[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:27.180]  Now, again, going back to unconventional warfare, because Alex was talking about just before we came in here with the vaccines,
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:33.180]  he was talking about Jade Helm. And at the center of Jade Helm is unconventional warfare.
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:39.180]  If you look at the center of that logo, there is a shoe. The military has described that as a sable,
[02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:42.180]  a wooden shoe that was used by the French to sabotage machinery.
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:47.180]  So that's a symbol of sabotage. That is essentially what unconventional warfare is.
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:53.180]  And that is essentially what has been happening by our federal government to our economy,
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:59.180]  to our civil liberties for decades. It is a war of sabotage, an unconventional war.
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:07.180]  And let me read to you again. The purpose of unconventional warfare is to make people believe that they cannot succeed,
[02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:11.180]  to destroy their heart, to destroy their economy, to destroy their civil liberties,
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:17.180]  doing it in the name of greater security demands, saying that there's going to be economic hardship
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:22.180]  because it's linked to the cost of war, hopelessness to defend against assaults, terror, depression,
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:29.180]  and a disintegration of morale. That is what this trade agreement that is being negotiated and secret is about.
[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:37.180]  And quite frankly, when I look at the Jade Helm exercises here, why are we being considered to be hostile
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.180]  when we merely want information about what's going on?
[02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:47.180]  We have a government that writes laws in secret, a government that writes trade negotiations in secret.
[02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:53.180]  We have a government that spies on us in secret. And of course, the military, whenever we question them,
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:56.180]  gets an attitude, you should never question what we do.
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:02.180]  If you notice on the Jade Helm map, everybody is either permissive or hostile.
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:08.180]  We have to ask ourselves if it is hostile to the military for our elected officials
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:13.180]  or for the people to question what they're doing, to question the wisdom of their mission.
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:16.180]  Are we already ruled by a military dictatorship?
[02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:18.180]  Let me read this quote to you from JFK.
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:23.180]  He said, there's another new type of warfare, new in its intensity, ancient in origin,
[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:29.180]  war by guerrillas, subversives, insurgents, assassins, war by ambush instead of by combat,
[02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:35.180]  by infiltration instead of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:39.180]  instead of engaging him at praise upon unrest.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:45.180]  The ultimate goal of this type of warfare is to motivate an enemy to stop attacking, to stop resisting,
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:50.180]  even if you have the ability to continue the fight.
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:56.180]  We want to understand and we want you to understand that we do have the ability to continue the fight.
[02:28:56.180 --> 02:29:01.180]  We do live under a government that believes that everything should be secret,
[02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:03.180]  that they should know everything about us.
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:06.180]  They should have all knowledge of us and we should have no knowledge of what they're doing.
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:12.180]  And unfortunately, we have a lot of people in America who don't even want to know what the government is doing.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:15.180]  They just want to look at the latest entertainment or sports event.
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:17.180]  They don't want to be bothered with it.
[02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:25.180]  I wonder how many people in Baltimore that are outriding could even mention or even knew the names of their elected officials
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:27.180]  who even understood the process.
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:29.180]  We have to understand the process.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:33.180]  We have to understand the medical tyranny as well as the other forms of tyranny.
[02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:38.180]  If they can force, vaccinate us at any time they want, then we have lost.
[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:43.180]  If they remove our informed consent by calling it a personal belief exemption, we have lost.
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:45.180]  But we're not going to let them.
[02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:48.180]  We are going to continue fighting. We're going to continue resisting.
[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:50.180]  Stay with us, Alex, we'll be right back.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:55.180]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:24.180]  We're stating that the polar ice caps would be completely gone by now.
[02:30:24.180 --> 02:30:29.180]  Earlier this year, we saw articles with headlines like 2014, the hottest year on record.
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:35.180]  The same articles failed to mention cities like Chicago, Illinois, which saw it's coldest weather in over 100 years.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:39.180]  No mention of big ice breaking ships getting stuck in ice.
[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:43.180]  So remember when these carbon tax pushers tell you to lessen your carbon footprint,
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:47.180]  they're about to leap into their multi-vehicle convoy, drive to their private jets,
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:50.180]  and then go to sleep in one of their many houses.
[02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:55.180]  Some by the sea. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:59.180]  Check out the new videos on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[02:30:59.180 --> 02:31:00.180]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:01.180]  Good, brother.
[02:31:01.180 --> 02:31:04.180]  I just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:08.180]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:11.180]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation.
[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:13.180]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:19.180]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:21.180]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:21.180 --> 02:31:24.180]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:26.180]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:30.180]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a statement, a ton of money there.
[02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:35.180]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet,
[02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:38.180]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:43.180]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:45.180]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:49.180]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:51.180]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:55.180]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality
[02:31:55.180 --> 02:32:19.180]  and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.

[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:32.180]  Now, I promise that we're going to go to Josh,
[02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:36.180]  who's been holding an epic amount of time, a legendary amount of time,
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:45.180]  and Truth Raider and Casey and Kato and Malik before this show ends today.
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:49.180]  But I do have Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in studio.
[02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:52.180]  They got back yesterday, or guess they got back Sunday,
[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:54.180]  but they took off yesterday, rightfully so.
[02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:58.180]  So they're here on the Tuesday edition to get their take on Al Sharpton coming out,
[02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:00.180]  saying let's federalize the police.
[02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:02.180]  I mean, we knew that's where this was going.
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:04.180]  But this is so transparent.
[02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:08.180]  Also, Jon Stewart attacking us over Jade Helm implying, again,
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:10.180]  that we said that a physical invasion was happening,
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:12.180]  and that we'd all be in FEMA camps.
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:15.180]  No, we said it's just all part of that long incremental march.
[02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:17.180]  I want to get their take on a host of issues.
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:21.180]  Plus, at Cinco de Mayo today, we can get a wide shot here.
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:23.180]  Last year, Joe Biggs had a report on it.
[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:28.180]  A judge ruled this year that it is hateful to have the American flag if people don't like it.
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:31.180]  So public schools are banning it, the display of it.
[02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:33.180]  Not just on Cinco de Mayo, but other times.
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:38.180]  So Joe ordered, that's a good-looking sports jacket, actually,
[02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:41.180]  for what you said you paid for it, from his custom place.
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:43.180]  I want him as a sponsor. I want to plug it.
[02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:45.180]  It's a good-looking sports jacket, $99.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:47.180]  It's customized, American flag.
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:53.180]  The socialist, and I'm not kidding, I saw it from my friend's balcony window.
[02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:55.180]  That time I got down there, they had already marched back.
[02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.180]  We got some footage. We're burning an American flag.
[02:34:57.180 --> 02:35:02.180]  They had communist hammer and sickle flags on May Day, Friday.
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:06.180]  And it's Friday night, so that's what we saw.
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:08.180]  So I guess if they saw you, they want to walk on you.
[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.180]  Yeah, they'd have a hard time, Alex, trying to walk on me.
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:13.180]  I'm not just going to lay there.
[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:16.180]  Well, you're a bad person, then. You should lay down and let the system do that.
[02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:19.180]  We'll talk to you guys here in just a moment, then go to those calls.
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.180]  And if you're a radio listener, you want to go to infowars.com,
[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:26.180]  forward slash show, you can see the free feed that we put out every day for three hours.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:30.180]  And you should be spreading the word about our local MNF and affiliates.
[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:33.180]  You should also be sending the web links to friends and family
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:36.180]  that don't have local affiliates in their area.
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:37.180]  This is an all-out war.
[02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:39.180]  You notice I've been pushing that harder than ever,
[02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:41.180]  that we have millions and millions of listeners.
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:44.180]  If you'll just wake other people up, that's how you found the show,
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:47.180]  pay it forward, we need to explode in the face of the enemy.
[02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:51.180]  With the massive rating censorship we've proven with Alexa and others,
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:53.180]  I mean, they are coming out of the woodwork.
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:55.180]  They're attacking us all over the news.
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:57.180]  They're lying about us.
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:02.180]  They have government groups and others coming and offering to advertise
[02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:03.180]  if stations will take us off.
[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:07.180]  I mean, they're coming after us because they know the American people know.
[02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:09.180]  No nonsense, teleprompter-free.
[02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:11.180]  And I make like a maniac sometimes,
[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:14.180]  people look up what I say and they know I'm for real.
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:20.180]  At a base level, people connect and know that I really believe what I'm saying
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:22.180]  and I prove it.
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:25.180]  And we also need your financial support.
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:27.180]  We don't get money like I've said a thousand times, literally.
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:32.180]  NPR or PBS are always up with government funding or citizen funding by donations.
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:35.180]  We're funded by selling high-quality t-shirts, books, videos,
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:39.180]  non-GMO heirloom, high-quality seeds, the biggest selection out there.
[02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:41.180]  And I'm free market.
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:48.180]  So we're super competitive on every front with the seed center,
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:53.180]  widest selection, highest quality, best prices, lowest prices.
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:56.180]  Sometimes people go below the agreed-upon lowest price.
[02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:58.180]  So sometimes you can find somebody reselling them lower.
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:01.180]  But the point is, I got to sign contracts and get in trouble when I go too low.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:06.180]  I mean, we really are the lowest on the water filters, 20% off right now.
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:10.180]  We only do that one other time, 20% off promo code WATER20.

[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:36.180]  And I want to thank all of you, since the attack has intensified on us.
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:40.180]  In the last week, I've been saying, I need to get satellite uplinks.
[02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:43.180]  I need to get all the stuff, which I'm weeks away from signing a deal.
[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:46.180]  They all want two, three-year deals. It's expensive.
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:48.180]  There's a lot of agreements, but we're there.
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:51.180]  We're lining up all the cable systems, TV stations.
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:55.180]  Quite frankly, it's like standing on a 300-foot bridge by jumping off the water.
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:58.180]  I'm hesitating, because I say I'm ready to fight some old order.
[02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:02.180]  This is really, I got to use the allegory just to be truthful.
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:05.180]  It's like slapping them in the face. Well, it's worse than that.
[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:07.180]  It's like pissing them.
[02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:10.180]  I'm sorry. The point is, is that we're going to the next level here,
[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:15.180]  and we need your support just by the books, the videos, the products.
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:17.180]  Spread the word about the transmission.
[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:19.180]  And you've done it.
[02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:22.180]  There's usually a dead part of the year for anybody in retail sales.
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:25.180]  That's how we fund ourselves, old-fashioned free market.
[02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:29.180]  So you got to have quality, you got to have dependability, you got to have customer service,
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:32.180]  and your customer's got to like you. That's how we fund the operation.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:34.180]  You still don't even try to make money, because I wanted to stay small.
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:36.180]  Then they tried to destroy me, came after me, and I said,
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:39.180]  you know how I'm going to get big? Because big fish eat little fish.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:41.180]  And big fish survive. So we've grown.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:44.180]  We've gone from being 100 feet long to about 500 feet long.
[02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:46.180]  I want to go to 3,000 feet long, folks.
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:50.180]  There's a lot of bands out there that I know that are on tour right now across America.
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:52.180]  They all take supermail vitality.
[02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:56.180]  I'm dead serious. When I go to these shows, they bring their bottles and pull it out to show me.
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:59.180]  That's crazy. You've sent me photos. You've got to tweak those.
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:02.180]  You randomly show up pretty popular bands, and they've got it.
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:05.180]  Yeah, when we were in Baltimore, there were fans out there, people who listened daily,
[02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:08.180]  coming out and showing us that they had gotten the products.
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:16.180]  When I forget to take it, let's just say the feminine equation that doesn't notice us.
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:24.180]  Sorry. I forgot you have all those photos of bands with. That's crazy.
[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:30.180]  Yeah, I go out all the time. I've got a really good friend who manages all these big bands across the country.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:34.180]  I mean, from all these celebrities, and I go out and he gives me backstage passes,
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:37.180]  like I'm going to go see Slayer, and I take him stuff, give him stuff.
[02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:41.180]  Very Christian, Joe. You are a Slayer, though, aren't you?
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:44.180]  You are something else. People can see him right now in the South Fed.
[02:39:44.180 --> 02:39:49.180]  So, anyways, please support us. All right, gentlemen, let's cover single to mile first.
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:53.180]  For folks that think we're joking, a judge did say you can ban the American flag if it's offensive.
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:56.180]  That's the new political correctness. They've banned Halloween at most colleges,
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:59.180]  because they say it might offend somebody if somebody's a gay sugar roll,
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:03.180]  or whatever fraternities have been banned from having fiestas,
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:06.180]  because, again, only Hispanics can have those.
[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:08.180]  I eat Mexican food today. Does that mean I'm racist?
[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:10.180]  I mean, this has reached a mind control level.
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:13.180]  I want your take on it, Joe, and then your take, Jakari.
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:16.180]  I mean, it's a crazy world that we're living in when you go out,
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:19.180]  and there are people trying to kick you out of apartment complexes
[02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:24.180]  for hanging the American flag, for a child to wear an American flag T-shirt,
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.180]  and be told he can't come into school that day, because that's racist.
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:32.180]  Someone might find that offensive. I find that offensive that in our own country,
[02:40:32.180 --> 02:40:36.180]  we can't sport our American flag, and that's why I decided to play with the flag.
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:39.180]  Well, even if you hate what the flag's been used for, still the idea of Belarus's Constitution,
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:44.180]  private property's a great one. We're taking the flag back, but it could be the Nazi flag,
[02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:46.180]  which I really don't like, or the Communist flag, which I don't like.
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:48.180]  Still, I'd say, no, you've got a right to have that.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:51.180]  I mean, they're saying the American flag we can't have.
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:55.180]  I mean, what's next? Round bags? Oh, I'm sorry, they're already banned, though.
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:56.180]  Sorry.
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:40:59.180]  Well, I'd like to see someone try to step on me today, so that's not going to happen.
[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:02.180]  I'm going to go out and we'll go through Austin and see what happens with that.
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:03.180]  That's what I love about you, Joe.
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:05.180]  I'm like, you ought to go out to interviews, like I'm already doing it.
[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:07.180]  Of course, we think I'm in the south at four.
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:09.180]  Just keep going. What else are you going to say?
[02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:12.180]  Oh, no, that was it. I mean, I've got some interesting stuff to tell you about Jade Helm,
[02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:16.180]  as well, that I found out over the weekend, but we can get your car's take on them.
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:20.180]  Oh, yeah. The flag thing, I mean, we went out and did the interviews last year
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:23.180]  and talking to people about how they say it's racist and discriminatory
[02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:25.180]  to have the American flag in the United States.
[02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:28.180]  I can't imagine, you know, going to someplace like Russia,
[02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:30.180]  like your flag is offensive. Take it down.
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:31.180]  Yeah.
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:32.180]  Probably, yeah.
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:36.180]  Only in this country, only in America can your own flag be considered racist.
[02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:38.180]  Can it be considered horrible?
[02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:40.180]  I mean, this is what our country is coming to.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:42.180]  I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:47.180]  Well, I mean, the political left, the social engineers, what Ted Cruz calls the fascist left,
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:52.180]  they want to ban outrageous things, you know, things that are not outrageous.
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:54.180]  So it's outrageous to set the precedent.
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:56.180]  We tell you to jump. We tell you how high.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:57.180]  Jacari?
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.180]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:02.180]  Like, I guess we have to switch that TSA flag of the guy getting his genitals punched
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:05.180]  because I guess that's the only thing that's acceptable now in the United States of America.
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:08.180]  Or an ostrich sticking its head in its own, you know what?
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:09.180]  Yeah.
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:13.180]  That should be the new, can we make a new American flag that is just an ostrich with its head,
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:17.180]  not in the sand, but in its hillary?
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:18.180]  Yeah.
[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:20.180]  I like that term.
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:22.180]  You should get a coin with that.
[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:24.180]  Well, that's what we call, okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:27.180]  Okay, I'm out of control. I apologize.
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:30.180]  Let's get into Jay Helm from both your perspectives because you went out and covered it.
[02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:35.180]  What are the new developments we know as, I'm not exaggerating, every major news channel,
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:41.180]  hundreds of local stations around the country running the hoax that, A, we hate the troops.
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:44.180]  They have Republican leaders going, I'm sure, sad they hate the troops.
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:46.180]  They don't deserve to be spit on like Vietnam.
[02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:50.180]  That was an actual quote from the former Lieutenant Governor on KV locally.
[02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:52.180]  So people think I want to spit on the troops now.
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:56.180]  And then we see an imminent invasion happen when we just set as part of the conditioning.
[02:42:56.180 --> 02:43:00.180]  I mean, all the troops I come across are, you know, pretty pro info wars.
[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:03.180]  That's why they're telling them we hate them hoping that they believe that.
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.180]  Well, it's interesting, this Sunday I was at another concert,
[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:10.180]  and this buddy of mine who put the concert on the Lone Star Jam,
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:12.180]  he had one of his special forces buddies who was in town.
[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:15.180]  And he goes, oh, yeah, I know who you are.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:17.180]  He's like, you guys are a little out of control of this Jade Helm thing.
[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:19.180]  And I was like, well, let me get your take on it.
[02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:23.180]  And he goes, you know, we've been running Jade Helm for 10 years in Germany.
[02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:25.180]  He said it's been going on in Germany for 10 years.
[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:26.180]  It's about a country.
[02:43:26.180 --> 02:43:27.180]  Yeah.
[02:43:27.180 --> 02:43:29.180]  He says, we've been over there operating that.
[02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:32.180]  And he says, the reason we can't do it in Germany anymore is quite frankly,
[02:43:32.180 --> 02:43:35.180]  the Obama administration just won't give us the money to go over there anymore.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:36.180]  That's a big angle.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:40.180]  He says, we have to come here to America to do it now because they won't fund us.
[02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:42.180]  They won't give us the proper money that we do to go over there.
[02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:46.180]  And I said, well, why do you think a lot of people are upset?
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:50.180]  He's like, well, I guess someone up at the top made a mistake by labeling Texas's hostile.
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:52.180]  He said, we haven't got any good feedback.
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:54.180]  And I very seriously doubt we'll ever do this again here.
[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:59.180]  Well, if they did it to fight tanks or something like the drills at Fort Bliss,
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:03.180]  because Stuart shows a Fort Bliss thing and it shows tanks being blown up.
[02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:05.180]  Well, that's legitimate training.
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:09.180]  I've been, well, I mean, did you explain to him that we have the Army manuals
[02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:11.180]  where they're trained to take on veterans and stuff?
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:12.180]  Yeah.
[02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:13.180]  Well, I mean, I asked him too.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.180]  I was like, have you heard about the asymmetric warfare training area called Fort AP Hill in Virginia?
[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:21.180]  And I said, why does that look just like an everyday American city?
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:22.180]  It's labeled DC.
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.180]  Yeah.
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:28.180]  I mean, why do our special forces troops need to train in that environment
[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:32.180]  unless they're planning on doing something here?
[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:33.180]  Yeah.
[02:44:33.180 --> 02:44:34.180]  What do you say?
[02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:37.180]  I think it goes beyond Jade Hill because we talk a lot about Jade Hill
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.180]  because it's in the news, obviously.
[02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:41.180]  But you know, you guys know how they've run drills in Miami.
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:44.180]  They've run drills in California with the Halo Corporation.
[02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:49.180]  And so if you have this argument, we're training in Texas because the rugged terrain
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:53.180]  identifies as something as Middle Eastern or whatever, the why are you running drills
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:54.180]  in downtown Miami, Florida?
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:56.180]  It doesn't look like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.180]  Well, and then the people are screaming, I'm a patriot.
[02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:00.180]  I have rights.
[02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:01.180]  I mean, they're training for here.
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:03.180]  And sure, part of the training is other stuff.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:05.180]  So they can point to that and say we lie.
[02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:09.180]  Well, the biggest thing too, though, is when you listen to Thomas Mead explain the entire exercise,
[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:13.180]  but then you go and you hear Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lestoria down in Bastrop
[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:15.180]  when Jakar and I were there, two conflicting reports.
[02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:16.180]  Yeah.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:18.180]  Mead, who's the head civilian running at all.
[02:45:18.180 --> 02:45:19.180]  He mentions global.
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:21.180]  He says, yeah, we might work with foreign troops down the road.
[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:22.180]  Yeah, we're going to have some stuff.
[02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:23.180]  Yeah, we're going to be in your streets.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:24.180]  Yeah, we're going to be in plain clothes.
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:25.180]  And we talked to the colonel.
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:27.180]  He's like, no, none of that's happened.
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:29.180]  Well, it was damage control as far as I can make out from it.
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:30.180]  I mean, what do you think?
[02:45:30.180 --> 02:45:31.180]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:32.180]  Exactly damage control.
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:36.180]  Because I mean, just basic stuff that everybody kept asking because it didn't add up.
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:40.180]  He's saying we're running this drill so we can mingle in with the population and be able
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:41.180]  to move around.
[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:43.180]  And people ask a very basic question.
[02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:46.180]  How do you plan to interact with the crowd if you're on private property at two o'clock
[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:47.180]  in the morning?
[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:48.180]  You know, basic stuff like that.
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:52.180]  And he's saying they're going to bring in $100,000 or whatever the number is into the
[02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:53.180]  local economy.
[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:55.820]  And people say, well, how are you going to bring in that much money if you have 60 guys
[02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:58.180]  coming in for a short period of time?
[02:45:58.180 --> 02:46:01.780]  And even if they were going to bring in that much money, the majority of the people who
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:05.300]  were there, you wouldn't know this if you watch the local news reports, they just lied
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:06.300]  about it.
[02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:08.500]  But the majority of people there were not in favor of the drill.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:11.700]  Yeah, it doesn't mean they're, it wasn't mean they were absolutely against it.
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:15.020]  They were just saying, can you guys take your training someplace else and not do it here
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:17.700]  in Bastrop?
[02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:18.700]  I mean, the people are speaking.
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:22.460]  I mean, they keep going back and using this whole narrative, oh, we've been doing this
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:23.460]  forever.
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:27.900]  You know, we did the training in North Carolina for years and years and years, and no one
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:28.900]  ever cared.
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:29.900]  Robin Sage is what it's called.
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:30.900]  Robin Sage.
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:34.100]  Now they'll be saying, we gave him raps to people for years and we set up checkpoints
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:35.100]  for years.
[02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:38.140]  This is the first time there's been a massive awakening to what's going on.
[02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:42.340]  People are getting the fax, the information about these training exercises and it's pissing
[02:46:42.340 --> 02:46:43.340]  them off.
[02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:44.340]  Well, that's what Ted Cruz said.
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:48.100]  100 years ago, this would have already, we've already had these discussions years ago, but
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:49.100]  they've been lying to people.
[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:50.100]  They've been hiding.
[02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:51.660]  They say, oh, there's no black helicopters.
[02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:55.900]  What about how they freak out with the governor saying, yeah, I'm going to watch what's happening.
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:47:00.140]  And then the senator from Texas, Ted Cruz says, no, people don't trust the government.
[02:47:00.140 --> 02:47:01.140]  This is legitimate.
[02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:04.340]  I mean, Obama illegally shut off half our power plants.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:08.340]  I mean, do anybody understand without any law, I just did it.
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:10.060]  People realize how much trouble we're in down here.
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:14.180]  Yeah, it does it all, all the time at midnight somewhere where there's no one, no cameras around,
[02:47:14.180 --> 02:47:15.180]  nothing like that.
[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:17.780]  He sneaks somewhere and he goes somewhere and does it.
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:22.260]  Anything that has to be hidden in the cover of darkness like that by our government is
[02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:23.260]  just out of control.
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:24.260]  Well, it's like the bipartisan treaty.
[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:25.260]  The Republicans are supporting it.
[02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:26.500]  Hands over all our rights.
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:28.020]  We got one subsection of 30.
[02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:32.620]  It totally takes over the internet and they're fighting that Congress not get a copy of that.
[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:35.740]  I mean, I was going on in California.
[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:39.260]  They tell us in Richmond, California, oh, this is a dirty bomb drill negative.
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:44.060]  The reason you didn't want us to come there is because what you're really doing was practicing
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:48.660]  to take on constitutionalists, patriots, and they got the footage and they lied to it.
[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:49.660]  Exactly.
[02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:50.660]  You lied to us 500 times.
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:52.660]  I mean, we'd be crazy to listen to you guys.
[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:53.660]  You got a great job.
[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:55.780]  I know you're going to go out and shoot some videos today.
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:56.780]  One day was enough off.
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:01.500]  You're doing amazing job breakdown in hindsight, what it was like in Baltimore.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:05.700]  And now God forbid they set it up this summer where if anybody gets shot by the police and
[02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:08.940]  Lord knows there's some bad cops, all hell is going to break loose.
[02:48:08.940 --> 02:48:13.980]  96% of people in a major poll believe that there could be quote race war coming this
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:14.980]  summer.
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:15.980]  I mean, I don't think it's that.
[02:48:15.980 --> 02:48:17.540]  I think they're just trying to hype civil unrest.
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:18.540]  What do you see this going?
[02:48:18.540 --> 02:48:25.780]  Well, I feel that the prosecutor Marilyn Mosby came out a little premature, a little early.
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:32.700]  I think it was done to almost kind of quieten or calm down the citizens out there who thought
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:34.580]  that, you know, they weren't going to get justice.
[02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:39.060]  I think it was a political move by them to do this to calm people down and then months
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:43.700]  down the road when it comes out that they might put one of the guys in jail or something.
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:46.260]  I was going to get mad because not everyone got what they wanted.
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:50.940]  You know, no one knows what they're, they're definitely they were too quickly and overcharged
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:53.260]  to botch it on purpose.
[02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:57.260]  I mean, I think that they just came out to quiet everyone down and then the real chaos
[02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.580]  is going to happen when they actually have to come out.
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:00.580]  It goes.
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:01.980]  What do folks think that half the cops are black?
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:02.980]  Joe Garry.
[02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:04.540]  They really didn't come up as an issue.
[02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:09.140]  You know, they were just against these, well, not the shooting, but the incident that happened
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:10.140]  to them in general.
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:12.100]  So how do you, you were there.
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:13.860]  How are the cops in Baltimore?
[02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:17.860]  Honestly, I didn't have half the issue with these cops we had with the cops in Ferguson.
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:18.860]  So I can't.
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:19.860]  The cops were pretty bad.
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:20.860]  Yeah.
[02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:21.860]  They were pretty bad.
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:25.100]  I don't know if it was because they had Ferguson to look to as a what not to do, but the people
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.940]  out there, even the National Guardsmen, I didn't interact with a lot of them.
[02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:29.580]  But the ones I met, they were very polite.
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:30.580]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:32.060]  The guy even gave me a bottle of water.
[02:49:32.060 --> 02:49:34.580]  So they were much better behaved than what we saw in Ferguson.
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:37.620]  But at the same time, they treated you guys like humans and didn't shoot rubber bullets
[02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:38.620]  again.
[02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:42.220]  Yeah, they shot a guy right next to it, this guy was riding his bike, I saw the video.
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:44.820]  He was like, just started whaling on him.
[02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:45.820]  Why?
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.820]  Because he was riding around and I'm not going to go home for a curtain.
[02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:48.820]  Yeah, it was pretty ridiculous.
[02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:50.780]  I mean, he wasn't threatening the guys that I could tell.
[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:54.460]  He wasn't throwing anything at them that I could tell or not, not that I saw.
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.860]  And he was just riding around in a circle and cops go home and they shot him in the
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:57.860]  butt with a rubber bullet.
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:49:59.740]  They said, he said, stop occupying my town.
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:00.740]  Yeah.
[02:50:00.740 --> 02:50:01.740]  Stop occupying our city.
[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:02.740]  Get out of here.
[02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:03.740]  We don't need you here.
[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:06.220]  And the thing about it was they weren't too keen on arresting people, at least the first
[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:07.220]  night we were there.
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:11.340]  I think on Tuesday, Wednesday, and they would more or less shoot you with a rubber bullet
[02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:12.340]  to kind of scare you off.
[02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:14.780]  They didn't rush out and arrest you and take you home.
[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:18.060]  Now we did, of course, see the footage of them snatching that guy and pulling them off
[02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:20.820]  in the MRAP or the Humvee and just driving off.
[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:22.420]  I guess that's a rare occurrence.
[02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:28.020]  I didn't see too much of that going on, but by and large, the cops were better behaved.
[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:29.260]  I mean, the people were too.
[02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:33.220]  I mean, all in all, I mean, you know, in Ferguson, people were saying, you know, screw this
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.220]  FU.
[02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:35.220]  I'm not going home.
[02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:38.820]  I'm grown, and they would stay out there and tussle and rustle with the cops.
[02:50:38.820 --> 02:50:42.420]  You know, in Baltimore, you'd hear people right up and down the street playing that
[02:50:42.420 --> 02:50:43.420]  song F the Polies.
[02:50:43.420 --> 02:50:47.940]  But as soon as 959 came, you didn't hear that song anymore, and there was no one on the streets
[02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:49.940]  except for Marshall Law USA.
[02:50:49.940 --> 02:50:52.140]  You guys are veterans of the Info War now.
[02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:54.820]  We've got a chronic, all the stuff you've done with the rest of the team.
[02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:59.220]  Great job calls coming up on House Jones.
[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:02.860]  Why use dial up when you can use broadband?
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:04.980]  Why travel with this?
[02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:10.180]  When you can use this, and why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver?
[02:51:10.180 --> 02:51:15.700]  When you can use supernatural silver, supernatural silver is state of the art and it's been clinically
[02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:20.020]  proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:24.780]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:25.780]  and fungus.
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:30.700]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically, and you'll never again deal
[02:51:30.700 --> 02:51:34.580]  with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:39.060]  Reports of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals and research institutions
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:45.500]  have all shown supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.

[02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:32.100]  took a stand for freedom.
[02:53:32.100 --> 02:53:36.740]  New Mana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:41.820]  While others stood down, New Mana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at

[02:54:15.580 --> 02:54:20.940]  What happens if you defy curfew, a shocking 90 second video from the streets of Baltimore
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:26.940]  and I am against these curfews for adults and children, but it ends up being for everybody.
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:30.300]  That's why I'm against them and that's why they stood down to get the crisis going to
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:31.300]  set the precedent.
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:35.140]  This is all run by the White House so they can then get some police brutality on tape
[02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:37.740]  and then come in and federalize them.
[02:54:37.740 --> 02:54:40.740]  Here's the video of your TV viewer, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[02:54:40.740 --> 02:54:42.740]  The guys out there, it's exactly 10 o'clock at night.
[02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:47.180]  They walk over, shoot a whole bottle of chemical pepper spray on his face and then jump on top
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:51.740]  up and take him to jail when there's no reason he's not resisting, but see standard police
[02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:54.420]  training I think is abusive.
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:55:01.260]  So here it is, boom, spray right in the face, he's standing there and then he's wearing
[02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:06.340]  an F the police shirt and then now, boom, slammer to the ground, how about we break his tailbone
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:07.340]  for no reason.
[02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:12.380]  Now when you do use excessive force, that all just comes back on you and now they jump
[02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:16.140]  on top of him and this is just ridiculous.
[02:55:16.140 --> 02:55:19.860]  But that's what a police state looks like, but oh, there's no militarization of police,
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:23.740]  oh, there's no curfew, there's no MRAP, there's not a problem in America.
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:28.100]  And the White House is there stirring the whole thing up.
[02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:32.220]  I don't like what the police are doing, but I'm not playing into the whole mind game of
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.060]  the Civil War so we can be federalized and give the UN takeover.
[02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:41.660]  Joseph, and then we'll talk to truth raider than Casey, Anthony and Malaki.
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:45.260]  Malaki, go ahead, Josh, thanks for holding so long you're on the ear.
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:51.340]  Hey, Alex, there's several things I disagree with you on, but the one thing I was talking
[02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:56.940]  about when I said sensationalism is just this idea that there's going to be an economic
[02:55:56.940 --> 02:55:59.820]  collapse and there's going to be a civil war against the police.
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:01.780]  I just don't see that happening, man.
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:06.260]  Even if there was an economic collapse, I really don't see the American people having
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:08.300]  enough energy to do anything.
[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:13.460]  The only people that hate police are inner city teenagers and I mean, there isn't going
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:15.660]  to be any of that stuff happening, man.
[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:16.660]  That's what I think.
[02:56:16.660 --> 02:56:17.660]  Really?
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:18.660]  The White House is stirring it up.
[02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:23.660]  And if you get where the bread lines aren't full anymore, 50 million people on bread lines,
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:27.300]  they're just digital, you're going to have all hell break loose.
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:28.860]  The globalists have done this in other countries.
[02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:32.940]  It's in an IMF plan that got leaked in 2002.
[02:56:32.940 --> 02:56:34.180]  It's in my book, Sent to Terrany.
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:37.940]  It's free online, but it was in the London Guarding and they're planning to destabilize
[02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:39.900]  countries with economic collapse.
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:44.500]  It's called Cloward and Pivens, one program of many.
[02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:48.620]  And it's impossible to ever pay off all these debts.
[02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:51.600]  They've signed us on to all these derivatives.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:53.100]  They're creating social unrest.
[02:56:53.100 --> 02:57:00.780]  I mean, when I say civil war, I mean in pockets around the country, a slow burn civil war.
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:07.260]  The thing I wanted to say was something that you had mentioned earlier in the show probably
[02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:10.220]  about an hour ago, right before you went to one of the breaks.
[02:57:10.220 --> 02:57:15.300]  You said that these military guys, they're not going to follow orders to take guns and
[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:17.780]  they're not going to fire on the American people.
[02:57:17.780 --> 02:57:19.020]  I disagree with that.
[02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:22.900]  There's a lot of these military guys that I've known in my life.
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:25.540]  I was 18 years old when 9-11 happened.
[02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:29.540]  So I have to do what I grew up with, where military I wasn't.
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:36.340]  But a lot of these guys, they don't understand that gun rack, apple pie, free range America.
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:37.460]  They don't understand it.
[02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:39.700]  They really do view it as being terrorist.
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:43.980]  And if they're ordered to fire on the American people, I guarantee you they will.
[02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:44.980]  Sure.
[02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:45.980]  Sure.
[02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:49.900]  We're talking about a lot of Americans that was like more like 20%, the colors said 40%,
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:54.460]  that defected with atrocities the U.S. committed inside Mexico, because the U.S. didn't just
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:56.540]  kick Mexico out of Oklahoma and Texas.
[02:57:56.540 --> 02:57:59.540]  They marched all the way down to Mexico City, the halls of Montezuma.
[02:57:59.540 --> 02:58:01.060]  They just slaughtered.
[02:58:01.060 --> 02:58:06.300]  They smashed four or five armies and then just started raping and killing.
[02:58:06.300 --> 02:58:08.420]  And that's what a lot of armies do.
[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:10.900]  And then a bunch of people defected and fought that.
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:12.340]  That's what the guy was talking about.
[02:58:12.340 --> 02:58:14.660]  And so I wasn't saying they'd all defect.
[02:58:14.660 --> 02:58:18.660]  But I know the military and I know the ones that actually engaged in the combat.
[02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:21.860]  Now there is a lot of gang infiltration, white supremacist, black supremacist, you name
[02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:22.860]  it, the military.
[02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:23.860]  Military is in trouble.
[02:58:23.860 --> 02:58:27.620]  But I don't think the military is going to go along with all this.
[02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:31.780]  That's why they're shifting to drones and robots and autonomous vehicles to take out
[02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:32.780]  the people.
[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:35.180]  And that's when we're really in trouble 10 years down the road.
[02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:37.940]  We're going to go to break them up with Truth Raider Anthony and Casey.
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:38.940]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.940 --> 02:58:39.940]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:40.940]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:41.940]  Spread the word.
[02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:42.940]  Don't take the show for granted.
[02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:43.940]  They pray for us.
[02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:44.940]  They want to shut us down.
[02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:45.940]  Radio Network.
[02:58:45.940 --> 02:58:52.660]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:58:52.660 --> 02:58:57.620]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the
[02:58:57.620 --> 02:58:59.420]  planet for more than a decade.
[02:58:59.420 --> 02:59:03.460]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas
[02:59:03.460 --> 02:59:06.580]  farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:06.580 --> 02:59:11.900]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:18.300]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:23.420]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:25.540]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:27.180]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:59:27.180 --> 02:59:32.580]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:37.260]  Stop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:40.340]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:40.340 --> 02:59:45.220]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:46.980]  my favorite coffee.
[02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:51.860]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:59:51.860 --> 03:00:02.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.020 --> 03:00:08.580]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[03:00:08.580 --> 03:00:11.420]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.420 --> 03:00:17.780]  All right, we're in that little dessert portion, the Spamoni Transmission Area.
[03:00:17.780 --> 03:00:21.620]  This Spamoni ice cream will be good.
[03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:24.380]  Let's go ahead and talk to Truth Raider, Truth Raider, thanks for holding her on the
[03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:25.380]  ear.
[03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:26.380]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:00:26.380 --> 03:00:27.380]  Just 10 seconds.
[03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:28.740]  Let me get this out to America.
[03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:33.180]  If you live in a garden apartment complex and you have multi-level family housing people
[03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:34.980]  there, they can violate all the rules you want.
[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:36.700]  You can make all the complaints that you want.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:39.820]  At the end of your lease, you will be thrown out in the street.
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:41.620]  It's, thank you, Alex.
[03:00:41.620 --> 03:00:43.460]  Okay, we'll have to delay that out.
[03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:47.260]  I don't know, we're going to let Truth Raider on for a while now for doing that.
[03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:51.100]  Guys have been calling in for 10 years.
[03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:55.020]  Yeah, let's talk to Casey in Oregon.
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:56.020]  Go ahead.
[03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:00.580]  Hey there, I've got breaking news on the AARP Subliminal.
[03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:08.540]  If you go to the AARP YouTube channel page, they rolled out a three-part natural disaster
[03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:12.100]  set of videos with this video with the subliminal on it.
[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:17.820]  Now, if you go there, they're pushing a preparedness app from the government and they do a PSA showing
[03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:22.060]  a guy putting his family into an underground bunker, taking a smart phone in there, which
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:23.060]  is a big no-no.
[03:01:23.060 --> 03:01:26.620]  Now, they're also pushing a ready.gov website.
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:34.380]  I go there and you hover over the be informed portion, click on Shelter, scroll down to
[03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:40.460]  the bottom of the page, and there's a box about mass care shelters, these FEMA camps.
[03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:43.180]  It tells you how to behave in the FEMA camp and to-
[03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:44.180]  Oh my God, this is huge.
[03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:45.180]  We need this on the night.
[03:01:45.180 --> 03:01:46.180]  I knew this tonight.
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:52.100]  So again, where do you go to hover over to talk about mass care?
[03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:56.500]  Hover over be informed and click on Shelter and scroll down to the bottom.
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:59.420]  I covered this on Breaking the Conditioning is my YouTube channel.
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:00.420]  Good.
[03:02:00.420 --> 03:02:01.420]  I covered the whole thing on there in depth.
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:02.420]  All right, guys.
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:06.420]  Let's get his video, look at it if it's good, which I'm sure it is, link to it on infowars.com.
[03:02:06.420 --> 03:02:08.860]  Because I don't want to just put out our own report on this.
[03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:12.660]  I want to promote grassroots people stuff because who knows what will happen to us.
[03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:15.100]  I mean, I just wanted to beat the enemy.
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:16.100]  All right, Casey, anything else?
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:17.460]  Thanks for holding to tell us that.
[03:02:17.460 --> 03:02:19.620]  Anything else you want to tell us about this?
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:23.300]  I just thought we made that up and we showed the subliminal, but I guess they now admit
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:24.300]  it all, huh?
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:25.300]  It's true.
[03:02:25.300 --> 03:02:27.100]  They are admitting it all.
[03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:30.700]  I actually just read the right-wing extremist paper.
[03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:33.340]  I read the white papers about how to Psyops.
[03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:35.260]  I mean, I've just been reading all these white papers.
[03:02:35.260 --> 03:02:36.580]  I recommend everybody do that.
[03:02:36.580 --> 03:02:37.580]  You can find them all on Google.
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:38.580]  They're all on Psyops.
[03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:39.580]  No, they're going to put us in camps.
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:41.140]  How they're going to take our kids from us?
[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:42.140]  Yeah.
[03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:43.140]  And this isn't that.
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:45.380]  Just get in the comments and keep jamming the transmission.
[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:47.740]  Well, something else they're going to do in FEMA camps.
[03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:48.740]  This is admitted.
[03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:49.740]  They're going to take our trips.
[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:52.860]  They'll just keep inoculating you and then say, oh, the records are lost.
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:54.860]  Give you 300 shots till you die.
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:56.660]  And then just stand around going, oh, look, you died.
[03:02:56.660 --> 03:02:57.660]  We're liberal.
[03:02:57.660 --> 03:02:58.660]  Ah, liberal, liberal.
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:02.940]  I mean, it's all because they, again, these people are sick.
[03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:07.580]  We've been overrun by absolute psycho criminals and the Republican Party's working with them.
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:10.700]  We are just, it is just over the top.
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:12.100]  Anthony in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:13.100]  Go ahead.
[03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:14.100]  Hello?
[03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:15.100]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:16.100]  Go ahead.
[03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:21.340]  Well, yeah, I'd just like to say that, um, as far as this racial stuff is concerned, it's
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:26.300]  definitely manufactured because of the fact that if you think about it, I mean, they say
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.380]  oh, they, they, they suffered 400 years.
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:29.380]  Well, you know what?
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:35.060]  The Irish suffered 700 years of brutal occupation at the hands of the, of the British.
[03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:39.940]  And yet they were able to rise above that and especially to not just that one during
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:41.740]  in the early 19th century.
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:45.300]  Well, that's true, but, but, but they didn't have different colors, skin completely.
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:46.900]  So it was assimilation was easier.
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:51.020]  There are real problems, but it's never going to get fixed with the social engineers throwing
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:52.420]  gasoline on it.
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:55.940]  I mean, that's the problem is they're there doing it.
[03:03:55.940 --> 03:03:58.820]  And then like you said to, um, what do you call it?
[03:03:58.820 --> 03:04:00.460]  They, um, what do you call it?
[03:04:00.460 --> 03:04:01.460]  I don't remember.
[03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:05.180]  In the early 19th century, when the large, when the country was largely white Anglo-Saxon
[03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:10.140]  Protestants, they were still kept on and yet they didn't, and yet they, they were able
[03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:16.140]  to go into the inner city, they became the first major urban, um, ethnic group to experience
[03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:17.140]  their urban experience.
[03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:21.140]  So it's like African-Americans are now, and it's like, you know, they didn't say, oh,
[03:04:21.140 --> 03:04:22.140]  I feel sorry.
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:24.980]  Don't feel sorry for me because I suffered a guilt chip.
[03:04:24.980 --> 03:04:26.980]  Well, they were the above all of that.
[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:27.980]  Exactly.
[03:04:27.980 --> 03:04:30.700]  They, they pulled themselves up and they, they fought back.
[03:04:30.700 --> 03:04:33.980]  Well, the Irish certainly did, but they were leaving something really bad.
[03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:39.420]  I mean, you look at the stuff the Irish went through in Ireland with the British occupation.
[03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:40.420]  It was bad.
[03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:44.980]  That concentration camps were invented by the British for the Scots and the Irish, then
[03:04:44.980 --> 03:04:47.980]  adopted here against Native Americans, and it doesn't mean these countries haven't done
[03:04:47.980 --> 03:04:48.980]  evil bad things.
[03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:50.980]  Let's not re-experience it now.
[03:04:50.980 --> 03:04:51.980]  All right.
[03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:54.660]  I'm sorry to, uh, Malik calling back tomorrow.
[03:04:54.660 --> 03:04:56.380]  I'll go to Yicato and Joshua.
[03:04:56.380 --> 03:04:57.500]  We got it in the transmission.
[03:04:57.500 --> 03:05:09.620]  Malik Newsnight, 7 o'clock.
