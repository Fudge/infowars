[00:00.000 --> 00:18.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, October 8th of the year is 2021.
[00:18.040 --> 00:24.400]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we had a reporter on a few weeks ago from Australia, the Aussie
[00:24.400 --> 00:35.360]  Cossack, Simeon Boykov, and he has been arrested in his own home for free speech, saying he's
[00:35.360 --> 00:36.360]  against a lock-down.
[00:36.360 --> 00:37.600]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:37.600 --> 00:43.200]  There's the interview, Australian citizen issues, major SOS to the world.
[00:43.200 --> 00:47.120]  He called for us to have peacefully protest at the embassies to point out that they'd
[00:47.120 --> 00:52.320]  become like North Korea, and just like North Korea or China, they came and arrested him.
[00:52.320 --> 00:56.200]  He had a woman on who's facing several years in prison for peacefully protesting.
[00:56.200 --> 00:59.640]  She was out on bail after 20-plus days.
[00:59.640 --> 01:00.640]  So this is incredible, Terry.
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.120]  It's coming up next segment.
[01:02.120 --> 01:07.200]  And I've been asking Senator Paul, the other people I know personally, I've known Senator
[01:07.200 --> 01:10.320]  Paul since he was in college.
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.080]  He would come on for his dad when his dad was running for Congress in 1995, he'd get
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.400]  elected in 1996 to get back in Congress.
[01:17.400 --> 01:23.240]  He'd been there for one term in the 80s with Reagan.
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.560]  And I know Rand Paul's the real deal, and I can tell you that people like Josh Hawley
[01:28.560 --> 01:33.120]  are the real deal, and Ted Cruz is the real deal.
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.240]  He can be a jerk sometimes, but he's a good guy.
[01:35.240 --> 01:36.240]  He cares about the country.
[01:36.240 --> 01:37.240]  He doesn't like communists.
[01:37.240 --> 01:39.360]  He doesn't like the globalists.
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.280]  But they all know what's going on, and they need to come out and say, this is the great
[01:43.280 --> 01:48.960]  reset, wow, she created the virus on purpose, they have all the evidence, DASIC, they launched
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.320]  it, they've controlled the whole thing.
[01:52.320 --> 01:54.600]  Because of course, the people that release a bio weapon are going to be the ones that
[01:54.600 --> 01:57.760]  are controlled the media, the ones that are controlled the testing, the ones that are
[01:57.760 --> 02:03.280]  controlled of the medical system, because if they weren't, they'd start a world war.
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.560]  So they had to be in charge to be able to cover the whole damn thing up.
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.280]  And if you don't address them as the criminals they are, and address them for the plan they're
[02:10.280 --> 02:18.600]  carrying out in Klaus Schwab's own words in COVID-19, the great reset, then we don't have
[02:18.600 --> 02:19.880]  any hope.
[02:19.880 --> 02:22.560]  So they need to be addressed as an enemy group.
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.400]  Democrats are the collaborators working with the globalist to destroy America because they
[02:27.400 --> 02:28.600]  want worldwide tyranny.
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.480]  They don't want the example of gun ownership and private property and families and wealth.
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.760]  They want a giant poor class with no leadership they can exterminate.
[02:36.760 --> 02:43.200]  Here's part of what Senator Paul had to say last night, DOJ weaponized to push left's
[02:43.200 --> 02:44.200]  agenda.
[02:44.200 --> 02:45.640]  He says, be afraid of your government.
[02:45.640 --> 02:47.800]  He says, watch the list of the senators.
[02:47.800 --> 02:48.800]  Already exists.
[02:48.800 --> 02:50.680]  Well, I would say, don't be afraid.
[02:50.680 --> 02:52.720]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.280]  When the government is in charge and dominating and enslaving the people, there is tyranny.
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.040]  The actual Thomas Jefferson quote is, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[03:02.040 --> 03:04.560]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.600]  So here's what Senator Paul, part of what he had to say.
[03:07.600 --> 03:08.600]  I'm very, very concerned.
[03:08.600 --> 03:11.240]  And I'm sure that there are people across the country who are concerned that if they
[03:11.240 --> 03:15.400]  go to their local school board and say the wrong thing, that they're going to end up
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.040]  on some list that Merrick Garland goes after.
[03:18.040 --> 03:20.160]  What would you say to those people today?
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.440]  I would say, be afraid.
[03:21.440 --> 03:22.600]  Be afraid of your government.
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.960]  And that's a sad thing from someone in the government to say, but the thing is, is those
[03:26.960 --> 03:28.760]  lists already exist.
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.280]  For example, people in Northern Virginia that have gone to have been then sought out by
[03:33.280 --> 03:38.960]  the school council, by the members of the school board and retaliated in a sort of legalistic
[03:38.960 --> 03:44.080]  way to try to put them on some sort of list and chill their speech by letting them know
[03:44.080 --> 03:46.400]  there'll be a penalty for showing up and protesting.
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.000]  Look, there are all kinds of laws about decorum and there ought to be.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.720]  The idiot woman that goes in the bathroom filming Senator Sinema in a bathroom, that
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.200]  is illegal according to every local ordinance and you should punish that person.
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.320]  If you go to a school board meeting and you're disruptive and you don't obey the rules of
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.600]  the school board meeting, then there will be local punishment, but it has nothing to
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.200]  do with the federal law, has nothing to do with the Department of Justice.
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.280]  What Merrick Garland did is he's attempting to stifle dissent and he's attempting to say,
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.920]  beware or big brothers coming after you if you speak out against my policies or against
[04:21.920 --> 04:23.200]  the Biden policies.
[04:23.200 --> 04:27.920]  And that is designed to shut up everyone who isn't willing to sacrifice everything that
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.560]  they have in order to make that argument.
[04:30.560 --> 04:54.160]  Thank you so much for joining me tonight Senator Paul.
[05:01.560 --> 05:06.000]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's very, very simple, but the most of all don't know.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.720]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[05:15.720 --> 05:22.280]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[05:22.280 --> 05:25.280]  property, energy.
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.280]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of
[05:30.280 --> 05:34.320]  trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets, but they never allowed
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.360]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[05:39.360 --> 05:43.920]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.840]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[05:49.840 --> 05:54.360]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things
[05:54.360 --> 05:55.360]  left standing.
[05:55.360 --> 05:59.360]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now, warn everyone, it's the only way to stop
[05:59.360 --> 06:00.360]  it.
[06:00.360 --> 06:11.360]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:11.360 --> 06:20.360]  You keep saying you've got something for me, something you call love, but confess.
[06:20.360 --> 06:29.640]  You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin' and now someone else
[06:29.640 --> 06:34.320]  is gettin' all your best.
[06:34.320 --> 06:39.160]  These boots are made for walkin' where that's just what they'll do.
[06:39.160 --> 06:45.160]  October 8th, 2021.
[06:45.160 --> 06:47.320]  Welcome back to the broadcast.
[06:47.320 --> 06:50.640]  We are in an occupied country, we are under globalist control.
[06:50.640 --> 06:54.200]  They brag about it at the UN, they brag about it at the Davos Group, the head of the Boulder
[06:54.200 --> 06:55.200]  Bird Group does.
[06:55.200 --> 06:59.440]  They're comin' after our families, they're creating world IDs, they're saying our churches
[06:59.440 --> 07:05.040]  and our businesses are non-essential, they're bringing in a permanent tyranny.
[07:05.040 --> 07:11.320]  Next segment I've got Jim Socky saying, yeah, we can lower your gas prices, but we're not
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.320]  going to.
[07:12.320 --> 07:18.520]  It's for the earth, explain that, and I'm gonna tie that into this censored video of
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.960]  Trump from Hannity, where he said they're flooding us with prisoners out of Central
[07:24.960 --> 07:28.000]  and South America, which is true, they're emptying their prisons.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.200]  That's very, very hard to find now, but we have it.
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.600]  This is just an incredible time to be alive, and the UN now admits replacement migration
[07:37.600 --> 07:40.320]  to bring in third-world populations with no history of freedom.
[07:40.320 --> 07:42.880]  They can control, that's in the Financial Times of London.
[07:42.880 --> 07:48.120]  Again, that's all coming up today, and so much more, Drew Hernandez is a great investigative
[07:48.120 --> 07:55.800]  journalist with Real America's voice, just a great organization, and that's comin' up
[07:55.800 --> 08:02.920]  with what he's been witnessing with the protest against the vaccine mandates, and travel can't
[08:02.920 --> 08:08.360]  go in businesses, can't get on a subway without the deadly injections, and we've got big news
[08:08.360 --> 08:13.800]  on that front, just a massive Friday transmission lined up for you today, and Owen Schreuer
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.120]  was just in court where they're trying to put him in jail for several years, for peacefully
[08:17.120 --> 08:24.040]  being a reporter covering the demonstrations on January 6th, that a small portion of people
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.160]  got out of hand on, he never went in the Capitol, but they're charging him for, quote, breaking
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.160]  into the Capitol.
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.800]  That actually says it on there, and in his court filing, his lawyers point out this is
[08:33.800 --> 08:38.480]  criminal lying by the Justice Department, which I guess is just part of the court now,
[08:38.480 --> 08:40.920]  so that's all coming up.
[08:40.920 --> 08:48.720]  But the first thing I want to get to is Biden, yesterday, last night, making fun of, quote,
[08:48.720 --> 08:50.240]  hundreds of people that have been fired.
[08:50.240 --> 08:56.080]  No, it's hundreds of thousands of people around the country, by select big hospitals and other
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.760]  systems that want subservience, that want people to bow to their illegal experimental
[09:00.760 --> 09:01.760]  injection.
[09:01.760 --> 09:08.040]  Now, remember, Biden's exempt, his staff's exempt, the White House is exempt, the Congress
[09:08.040 --> 09:15.200]  is exempt, the CDC is exempt, the NIH is exempt, and they can have him with photo ops getting
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.920]  saline injections all day in the fake Oval Office set they have across the street, even
[09:20.920 --> 09:27.760]  when Reuters says it's not true, they show it's a set, it's all fake, they can do that
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.920]  all day, but we know it's not safe and effective, and I've got some of John Hopkins statistics
[09:32.920 --> 09:36.880]  put together by a British firm, we've checked the numbers, they're accurate, but it's been
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.760]  put together in a graph showing the worldwide devastation of people after they take these
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.200]  so-called COVID-19 vaccines.
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.320]  But here's the amazing statement of how good it is to fire people, even if they have natural
[09:50.320 --> 09:54.840]  immunity, or even if they have an illness where they can't take shots, just one size
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.920]  fits all, even under their tyrannical system that's outrageous, and he's just up there
[09:59.920 --> 10:07.160]  celebrating how we're getting used to persecuting large groups of people that make Hitler proud.
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.800]  These requirements work, and as the Business Roundtable others told me when I announced
[10:11.800 --> 10:15.960]  the first requirement, that encouraged businesses to feel they could come in and demand the
[10:15.960 --> 10:18.520]  same thing of their employees.
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.480]  More people are getting vaccinated, more lives are being saved, let's be clear, when you
[10:22.480 --> 10:28.560]  see headlines and reports of mass firings and hundreds of people losing their jobs,
[10:28.560 --> 10:30.120]  look at the bigger story.
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.920]  I've spoken with Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, who's here today.
[10:34.920 --> 10:41.520]  United went from 59% of their employees to 99% of their employees in less than two months
[10:41.520 --> 10:44.000]  after implementing the requirement, 99%.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.040]  Oh, and now they admit the shot doesn't work, even on CNN, so there's more shots, but it
[10:49.040 --> 10:54.040]  does work in attacking your ovaries and attacking your cornea and attacking your liver and your
[10:54.040 --> 10:55.040]  heart and your brain.
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.200]  I mean, you ever wanted a CD population, you wondered how they'd do it, they said they
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.480]  would through a vaccine, Operation Lockstep, not like I just said this 20 months ago, 21
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.960]  months ago when this all started, it's not like I just said it six months ago, I said
[11:08.960 --> 11:15.440]  it 20 years ago, I said it 15 years ago in in-game, because it's their damn plan.
[11:15.440 --> 11:21.360]  And we keep putting up with it, I guess it's their world and we're just dying in it.
[11:21.360 --> 11:22.600]  So there's that incredible footage.
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.520]  Now look at this, I have seen in the last few months at least 10 of these articles in
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.800]  the US, I've seen it in France, I've seen it in Germany, I've seen it in the UK, and
[11:33.800 --> 11:39.440]  now we see it at one of the most prestigious universities out there when it comes to their
[11:39.440 --> 11:47.040]  medical school, UC Irvine director of medical ethics placed on investor story leave under
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.280]  investigation over challenge to vaccine mandate.
[11:51.280 --> 11:57.160]  So he's the ethics head, they hired many years ago to make sure they follow laws and just
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.320]  proper ethics.
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.880]  So it'd be kind of like the top referee in the NFL.
[12:04.880 --> 12:13.000]  And then the other team in a game openly cheats and he says, okay, you know, 10 yard
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.200]  penalty first down and they say, nope, you're fired.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.440]  Everybody sees that the vaccine's killing people.
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.280]  Everybody sees it isn't a vaccine.
[12:20.280 --> 12:22.160]  Everybody sees the liability protection.
[12:22.160 --> 12:23.720]  Everybody sees the world ID.
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.720]  Everybody sees Fauci cooking it up with Dazik under Bill Gates control and admitting they
[12:27.720 --> 12:33.760]  made it and wanted to release it open air and create the exact virus.
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.600]  And still, oh, your sensor, oh, still, you're fired, oh, still, your own investigation leave,
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.840]  your own investigatory leave University of California Irvine has placed their director
[12:45.840 --> 12:54.040]  of medical ethics, Dr. Aaron Carlady on investigatory leave after he challenged the constitutionality
[12:54.040 --> 13:01.440]  of the UC vaccine mandate and it goes on from there.
[13:01.440 --> 13:03.880]  He needs to be on Joe Rogan's show.
[13:03.880 --> 13:04.880]  He needs to be here.
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.640]  He needs to get out there, but there he is putting his money and life in the line because
[13:10.640 --> 13:13.200]  he knows the evil's gotten too great.
[13:13.200 --> 13:15.920]  But they're creating their army of people that will follow orders.
[13:15.920 --> 13:16.920]  They're purging the military.
[13:16.920 --> 13:17.920]  They're purging the police.
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.520]  They're purging the whole system and putting their useful idiots in there.
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.400]  I've just got hundreds of such articles here.
[13:27.400 --> 13:32.600]  Pfizer officially announces it's coming for your children, key article with videos on
[13:32.600 --> 13:38.040]  infowars.com, despite the fact that the younger you are, they've done studies and tried to
[13:38.040 --> 13:39.040]  cover them up.
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.000]  It's coming out of two-year-olds and five-year-olds, massive heart attacks, deaths, and they suppress
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  the deaths.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.920]  It's all going to be coming out soon, folks.
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.280]  I've talked to the lawyers involved.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.480]  Let me just leave it at that.
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.000]  I've seen the documentation, but it's actually coming out that they suppress the trials
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.120]  even already.
[13:56.120 --> 14:03.640]  Very important story, and Los Angeles County Sheriff refuses to enforce vaccine mandate.
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.720]  But just like Biden just said, globalism is corporate tyranny.
[14:07.720 --> 14:09.800]  And the corporations lobby the government.
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.640]  They want governmental power, so they have the executive give the order, the executive
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.800]  gets the heat, he's just a puppet, and then big tech and big media and the airlines, all
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.520]  of them are the big banks, they can do whatever they want.
[14:23.520 --> 14:25.880]  And so even in New South Wales, the worst police state on earth.
[14:25.880 --> 14:29.160]  The police don't enforce the not going in businesses, though.
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.480]  You've seen some footage of them beating people in grocery stores who didn't have vaccine
[14:32.480 --> 14:33.720]  passports.
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.560]  It's beyond some dystopian sci-fi nightmare situation.
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.120]  Now, let's get to this video.
[14:42.120 --> 14:49.040]  Go ahead and roll the video of the graph, and I'll go ahead and narrate it for everybody.
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.080]  Video illustrates how COVID vaccines have totally backfired.
[14:52.080 --> 14:56.600]  Well, they didn't backfire, it's like saying, grabbing a bomb on Hiroshima or Nagasaki with
[14:56.600 --> 14:57.600]  the A-bombs backfired.
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.600]  Now, they were meant to detonate kill people, and you can see the worldwide deaths from all
[15:02.600 --> 15:03.600]  over the world.
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.800]  Burma, Brazil, Cambodia, they're just going in two minutes in this video that's on infowars.com
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.440]  with the countries, and it's all the same.
[15:13.440 --> 15:14.440]  It's incredible.
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.800]  You take the shot, and in a few weeks, it just explodes, if not within a few days.
[15:20.800 --> 15:25.960]  Now, because it generates the very virus in your body, makes the spike protein, the shell
[15:25.960 --> 15:31.280]  of virus makes you sick, and you have the biggest spikes ever seen, doesn't matter.
[15:31.280 --> 15:42.680]  Israel, Gibraltar, Singapore, England, the United States, Jordan, Malaysia, and it's
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.720]  all right there.
[15:46.720 --> 16:03.120]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.800]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.800 --> 16:08.800]  Here's why.
[16:08.800 --> 16:12.800]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.800 --> 16:18.080]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most, and unlike
[16:18.080 --> 16:24.080]  gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless
[16:24.080 --> 16:26.880]  supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.880 --> 16:30.820]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:30.820 --> 16:35.560]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.560 --> 16:41.560]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-grid bonuses too.
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.520]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:47.480 --> 16:52.080]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[16:52.080 --> 16:55.960]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:55.960 --> 16:58.760]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:58.760 --> 16:59.760]  Hey everybody.
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.640]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:04.640 --> 17:05.640]  news.
[17:05.640 --> 17:07.760]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.760]  Here's the thing.
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.280]  We just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.560]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:19.560 --> 17:22.360]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.360]  The best part?
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.600]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are
[17:28.600 --> 17:33.840]  coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:33.840 --> 17:38.560]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.800]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:43.800 --> 17:44.800]  world, period.
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.240]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:51.240 --> 18:00.560]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.200]  Back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[18:04.200 --> 18:05.400]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[18:05.400 --> 18:09.360]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at infowarstore.com.
[18:09.360 --> 18:11.720]  This one has been very popular, it's sold off the shelves.
[18:11.720 --> 18:15.680]  It's back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[18:15.680 --> 18:21.400]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.760]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes in pill form.
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.040]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[18:30.040 --> 18:31.920]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.880]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge,
[18:36.880 --> 18:38.880]  what are you waiting for now is the time.
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.400]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality, Living Defense Plus, and the Organic Greens Fiber
[18:44.400 --> 18:45.400]  Caps.
[18:45.400 --> 18:49.480]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can
[18:49.480 --> 18:50.480]  order a new batch.
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.080]  It was very popular, the Organic Greens Fiber Caps, but we have all kinds of other great
[18:54.080 --> 19:00.160]  supplements that are great for so many different things, take advantage of those.
[19:00.160 --> 19:04.600]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioProse and how they're creating amazing products.
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.320]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products,
[19:10.320 --> 19:13.560]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.680]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[19:17.680 --> 19:23.400]  The BioProse are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.560]  healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[19:26.560 --> 19:33.040]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[19:33.040 --> 19:39.320]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black grey holding tanks, sewer hoses
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.320]  and plumbing.
[19:40.320 --> 19:42.360]  It is also human and animal safe.
[19:42.360 --> 19:46.600]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[19:46.600 --> 19:52.000]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup and odor, guaranteed.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.120]  Just pour and add water, it's that simple.
[19:54.120 --> 20:03.040]  Visit thebioprose.com and see for yourself.
[20:03.040 --> 20:33.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.000 --> 20:51.640]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones show.
[20:51.640 --> 20:55.640]  Owen Schreuer, trying to put him in prison, he just got out of court, he'll be here with
[20:55.640 --> 20:58.280]  us in the middle of the next hour, stay tuned for that.
[20:58.280 --> 21:06.720]  Let me go ahead right now and hit this really, really important big news that we've got.
[21:06.720 --> 21:11.120]  I saw this clip this morning when I got up at 5am, I sent it to the producers, I said
[21:11.120 --> 21:15.440]  I want to play this on the show and when I got here this morning, they've been looking
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.440]  for hours.
[21:16.440 --> 21:21.560]  It had been expunged everywhere, so we had to go to Sean Hannity's show itself on the
[21:21.560 --> 21:23.880]  Fox site and find the video there.
[21:23.880 --> 21:25.480]  They do not want this video out.
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.800]  Now, part of the show is everywhere, Trump saying a lot of these Haitians have HIV and
[21:29.800 --> 21:32.360]  AIDS, which is true.
[21:32.360 --> 21:35.120]  So the Democrats are all, they have a law passed in California, you can give somebody
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.320]  HIV or hepatitis, it's okay.
[21:38.320 --> 21:42.720]  But oh my gosh, COVID-19, even the fear of it, we're all guilty, we're all bad and that's
[21:42.720 --> 21:46.880]  how the Nazis took control, it's first saying all these groups were dirty and had to be
[21:46.880 --> 21:47.880]  locked up.
[21:47.880 --> 21:53.040]  So we've seen this medical tyranny before and none of it makes sense unless you realize
[21:53.040 --> 21:57.600]  it's all about a power grab.
[21:57.600 --> 22:03.800]  So here is the censored clip that we've also re-uploaded to Band-Aut Video and put back
[22:03.800 --> 22:06.800]  in the article, but this is a story in and of itself.
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.600]  Trump warned Central American countries are emptying their prisons into the United States
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.440]  because that's so true, it's like 90% men coming in and boy, when they find out their
[22:17.440 --> 22:19.760]  names from the countries, it's scary.
[22:19.760 --> 22:26.040]  And Mexico has been warning, this is majority hardened criminals, rapist, murderers, mentally
[22:26.040 --> 22:32.560]  ill people, handicaps, I mean, we're just, we're having the homeless dumped on us as
[22:32.560 --> 22:35.600]  if we don't have enough, it's all clout and pebbin.
[22:35.600 --> 22:38.440]  So here's the clip, they're really afraid of.
[22:38.440 --> 22:44.320]  There's something wrong, you wouldn't believe you could even say this, but somebody doesn't
[22:44.320 --> 22:45.640]  love our country.
[22:45.640 --> 22:51.960]  And they allow this to happen to our country, we have hundreds of thousands of people pouring
[22:51.960 --> 22:57.200]  in every two weeks, hundreds of thousands, and coming from countries we don't even know
[22:57.200 --> 23:01.600]  from where they're coming in, they're emptying out many countries.
[23:01.600 --> 23:09.400]  I used to say the three, Guatemala, you could add Mexico, Honduras, you could add El Salvador,
[23:09.400 --> 23:13.640]  but I used to say three or four countries, I hear it's 50 countries, they're emptying
[23:13.640 --> 23:18.520]  out their prisons into the United States, their jail, some of the toughest people on
[23:18.520 --> 23:23.320]  earth are being dumped into the United States because they don't want them, they don't want
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.920]  to take care of them for the next 40 years.
[23:25.920 --> 23:32.600]  So these people that are the roughest prisoners there are anywhere are being dumped into the
[23:32.600 --> 23:36.800]  United States for us to take care of them.
[23:36.800 --> 23:44.920]  So they try to downsize the police by 50% in the blue cities to then only put SJW anti-fuck
[23:44.920 --> 23:47.560]  people in uniform, that's happening.
[23:47.560 --> 23:51.520]  So you can see this is the destabilization collapse of the country, a giant client group
[23:51.520 --> 23:55.920]  that will never get jobs in Europe, people the UN brought in 10 years later on average,
[23:55.920 --> 24:02.560]  90% are still on welfare, they live in ghettos, they rob, they kill, it's a plan and I'm going
[24:02.560 --> 24:05.040]  to show you part of that plan in a moment.
[24:05.040 --> 24:08.480]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, yeah, there's awesome police announced, they'll no longer
[24:08.480 --> 24:14.920]  respond to 911 calls and up in Dallas, the young man that shot three people, they released
[24:14.920 --> 24:21.680]  him less than 24 hours later on personal recognizance bond.
[24:21.680 --> 24:22.840]  Did you hear me?
[24:22.840 --> 24:29.160]  Because he's black and oh, we can't be black, I mean, we can't be racist, so we have to
[24:29.160 --> 24:34.880]  let black people out that shoot black people, I'm sure black folks really love that.
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.040]  So see, this is all of the destabilization campaign of the country.
[24:38.040 --> 24:43.760]  Here is Trump pointing out the high levels of HIV and AIDS out of the Clinton-ravaged,
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.480]  UN-ravaged Haiti, also being brought here by the hundreds of thousands per month.
[24:48.480 --> 24:49.480]  Here it is.
[24:49.480 --> 24:52.380]  And you know, there's one other thing that nobody talks about.
[24:52.380 --> 24:57.080]  So we have hundreds of thousands of people flowing in from Haiti.
[24:57.080 --> 25:00.520]  Haiti has a tremendous AIDS problem.
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.920]  AIDS is a step beyond, AIDS is a real bad problem.
[25:05.920 --> 25:09.920]  So hundreds of thousands of people are coming into our country.
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.240]  And then if you look at the stats, if you look at the numbers, if you look at just take
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.560]  a look at what's happening in Haiti, a tremendous problem with AIDS.
[25:20.560 --> 25:25.600]  Many of those people will probably have AIDS and they're coming into our country and we
[25:25.600 --> 25:27.240]  don't do anything about it.
[25:27.240 --> 25:28.880]  We let everybody come in.
[25:28.880 --> 25:31.520]  Sean, it's like a death wish.
[25:31.520 --> 25:33.680]  It's like a death wish for our country.
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.440]  Well, yeah, it's called the UN, Clard and Piven collapse the nation state, blame it
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.960]  on the politicians you own, and then bring in a world corporate tyranny, technocracy,
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.840]  tracking and tracing everyone to protect the wealthy population from the hordes they brought
[25:47.840 --> 25:48.840]  in.
[25:48.840 --> 25:52.960]  That's how the ultra-rich controllers absorb their real enemy, the nouveau riche.
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.920]  It's all about targeting new wealth and competition of the globalist.
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.680]  And then getting the nouveau riche to join the globalist finally in the eradication of
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.560]  the third world out of self-preservation, which I do not sign on this plan, but I have been
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.080]  offered to join them in front of witnesses at work here before I'm going to leave it
[26:11.080 --> 26:12.080]  at that.
[26:12.080 --> 26:14.640]  That's why they hate my ass because they tried to get me to join them.
[26:14.640 --> 26:15.640]  They thought I would not.
[26:15.640 --> 26:16.640]  I didn't.
[26:16.640 --> 26:17.640]  And I guess they're pretty smart.
[26:17.640 --> 26:18.640]  Aren't they?
[26:18.640 --> 26:19.640]  Except they're missing God.
[26:19.640 --> 26:20.640]  They're missing the Holy Spirit.
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.560]  They're smart enough to try to hire me 15 years ago, hire me 10 years ago.
[26:24.560 --> 26:25.800]  They haven't tried in a while.
[26:25.800 --> 26:28.240]  They just want to destroy us, but that shows you who they are.
[26:28.240 --> 26:29.840]  Now, let's look at what's really behind this.
[26:29.840 --> 26:36.640]  Why did Sacha Bear Cohen two December's ago, almost two years ago, say at the ADL awards
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.240]  ceremony, arrest Alex Jones and arrest people that talk about replacement migration when
[26:41.240 --> 26:43.200]  that's on the UN Zone website?
[26:43.200 --> 26:44.200]  And here it is.
[26:44.200 --> 26:45.200]  Revealed.
[26:45.200 --> 26:48.240]  UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[26:48.240 --> 26:50.040]  That's from 2018.
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.040]  Paul Joseph Watson article.
[26:51.040 --> 26:52.960]  It got attacked everywhere by the fact checkers.
[26:52.960 --> 26:54.680]  It's from the UN Zone website.
[26:54.680 --> 26:55.920]  Well, guess what?
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.000]  Now, the Financial Times of London came out yesterday and says Europeans should be prepared
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.080]  for demographic replacement by Arabs and Asians and of course, North Africans saying
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.120]  because of climate change, a billion of them are going to be here by 2050.
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.120]  Oh, sorry.
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.000]  600 million for North America.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.760]  That's Mexico's going to get flooded too.
[27:12.760 --> 27:15.280]  The richest first world, the third world country in the world.
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.800]  And Europe's going to have 200 million per major nation.
[27:18.800 --> 27:24.120]  That's all in the report from the Financial Times of London.
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.400]  But don't talk bad about it or Sasha Burke Owen will have you arrested.
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.200]  Meanwhile, whoopee Goldberg can't bring herself to say the word white because whites are so
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.200]  bad.
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.600]  I mean, this is all just total racial division garbage and don't criticize Biden.
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.600]  That's racist too.
[27:40.600 --> 27:43.040]  Because if you don't support Biden, you ain't black.
[27:43.040 --> 27:44.040]  That's a new article.
[27:44.040 --> 27:47.360]  Karen claims it's racist for whites to hate Biden.
[27:47.360 --> 27:48.360]  All right.
[27:48.360 --> 27:50.320]  I've got a lot more coming up.
[27:50.320 --> 27:54.760]  We got Drew Hernandez coming on from New York with big news about the pushback against
[27:54.760 --> 27:55.760]  the globalist there.
[27:55.760 --> 27:58.760]  As we go to break, it's back in stock DNA Force Plus.
[27:58.760 --> 27:59.760]  It funds our operation.
[27:59.760 --> 28:01.000]  Plus it's amazing for your body.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.640]  The best thing you can do for your immune system, your telomeres, your cells, your nerves.
[28:05.640 --> 28:07.640]  Every time I forget to take it for just a few weeks, I feel it.

[28:59.560 --> 29:00.560]  Hey, everybody.
[29:00.560 --> 29:03.560]  You used about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:03.560 --> 29:04.560]  Me too.
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.720]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:08.720 --> 29:11.440]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.840]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.560]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.560 --> 29:18.760]  I certainly do.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.760]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.120]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:24.120 --> 29:28.200]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.200 --> 29:34.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.520]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.000]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.560]  support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[29:44.560 --> 29:48.520]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.520 --> 29:52.160]  supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today.

[30:00.440 --> 30:05.520]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[30:05.520 --> 30:12.480]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[30:12.480 --> 30:14.480]  It's called PQQ or BiopQQ.
[30:14.480 --> 30:18.800]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.560]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[30:23.560 --> 30:25.560]  longer in the space of the same thing.
[30:25.560 --> 30:28.760]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[30:28.760 --> 30:32.520]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[30:32.520 --> 30:37.400]  It's back in stock, the highest quality PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more.
[30:37.400 --> 30:42.320]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your body last longer
[30:42.320 --> 30:44.960]  and that is so incredibly important.
[30:44.960 --> 30:50.840]  We have it at 40% off despite the fact it's been sold out for six months at infowarstore.com.
[30:50.840 --> 30:51.840]  It's amazing.
[30:51.840 --> 30:54.840]  If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus, you really should and for those of you that love it,
[30:54.840 --> 31:00.760]  it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com, DNA Force Plus.
[31:00.760 --> 31:05.020]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[31:05.020 --> 31:09.320]  of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[31:09.320 --> 31:14.320]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[31:14.320 --> 31:17.440]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[31:17.440 --> 31:20.800]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[31:20.800 --> 31:22.320]  That taxes the heart.
[31:22.320 --> 31:27.800]  It taxes the lungs and we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with
[31:27.800 --> 31:35.080]  their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[31:35.080 --> 31:37.280]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[31:37.280 --> 31:39.200]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[31:39.200 --> 31:43.080]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up
[31:43.080 --> 31:48.160]  to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[31:48.160 --> 31:50.800]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[31:50.800 --> 31:54.960]  But the only way the real science comes out of the public is if we tell them, get your
[31:54.960 --> 31:57.960]  copy today of COVIDland and expose them.
[31:57.960 --> 31:59.240]  It's covidland.com.
[31:59.240 --> 32:01.240]  Go there now.
[32:01.240 --> 32:08.160]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[32:08.160 --> 32:13.760]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.400]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[32:17.400 --> 32:19.160]  That's done by design.
[32:19.160 --> 32:25.160]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[32:25.160 --> 32:30.040]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[32:30.040 --> 32:35.200]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[32:35.200 --> 32:39.800]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[32:39.800 --> 32:40.800]  exist.
[32:40.800 --> 32:45.200]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, still on the steering committee,
[32:45.200 --> 32:49.880]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[32:49.880 --> 32:54.680]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about
[32:54.680 --> 32:58.680]  the fact that there are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[32:58.680 --> 32:59.680]  We do expose them.
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.040]  We can beat them easily.
[33:04.040 --> 33:14.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.240 --> 33:24.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[33:24.760 --> 33:25.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.760 --> 33:26.760]  Well, we certainly live in epic times.
[33:26.760 --> 33:36.960]  Thank you for joining us again as we're now 30 plus minutes into this Friday worldwide
[33:36.960 --> 33:44.800]  transmission, October 8, 2021, coming up later in the next hour, Owen Schreuer will be in
[33:44.800 --> 33:45.800]  studio.
[33:45.800 --> 33:51.480]  He's in court right now via Zoom into D.C. They're trying to put him in jail for two
[33:51.480 --> 33:56.400]  years for peacefully covering what happened on January 6.
[33:56.400 --> 34:02.480]  They also falsely charged him with entering the Capitol and forcing his way in.
[34:02.480 --> 34:07.640]  And it's in his filing that we're going to be posting on infowars.com when he comes on
[34:07.640 --> 34:13.040]  later, where his lawyers actually accused the judge's department of criminal fraud lying
[34:13.040 --> 34:19.920]  to the court, which they've done in the arrest warrant and reason for his arrest.
[34:19.920 --> 34:25.800]  So that just shows the incredibly dangerous climate that we're in right now and how that
[34:25.800 --> 34:33.800]  ties into what Senator Rand Paul came out and said last night that the federal government's
[34:33.800 --> 34:38.520]  been captured by the Democrats who are multinational criminals, they're creating list of all Americans
[34:38.520 --> 34:41.840]  and they intend to never have another free election in this country and they are just
[34:41.840 --> 34:43.920]  criminally taking over.
[34:43.920 --> 34:48.920]  That's how we need to start addressing these individuals as an outside globalist threat.
[34:48.920 --> 34:54.000]  Remember, Saki said, yeah, we can lower gas prices, but we raise them so you'll use less
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.240]  to save the earth, but they all have their own private jet airplanes and actually you're
[34:58.240 --> 35:05.080]  making money off gouging you for the gasoline while you can barely put food on your family's
[35:05.080 --> 35:06.080]  table.
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.880]  Now, he hadn't been on in probably four or five months, seems like a million years,
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.480]  also like five minutes ago, just really dogged investigative journalist, you know him from
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.800]  Kenosha, Wisconsin, you know him from the Texas border, the California border, Drew Hernandez
[35:19.800 --> 35:26.040]  joins us and he's been up in New York where the teachers unions and others have had the
[35:26.040 --> 35:32.280]  Supreme Court, so to my or override even the appeals court and say, no, you're fired if
[35:32.280 --> 35:36.840]  you don't take your injections and we've got Biden, of course, in the video that just came
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.120]  out last night defending mass firings and saying hundreds of people losing their jobs
[35:41.120 --> 35:45.400]  over his unconstitutional vax mandates is a good thing.
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.920]  And meanwhile, the White House and Congress are exempt along with the Postal Service and
[35:50.920 --> 35:51.920]  the FBI.
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.400]  And I mean, this is truly a superclass discriminating against us with medical tyranny, but we're
[35:57.400 --> 36:01.920]  so obsessed on race and color and the rest of it that we're distracted by that and that's
[36:01.920 --> 36:02.920]  all done by design.
[36:02.920 --> 36:09.200]  So, Drew Hernandez joins us, thank you so much for coming on, Drew, wow incredible footage
[36:09.200 --> 36:13.120]  and reports you've been shooting, great to have you here, give us your view on what's
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.720]  really happening in New York City, because I know the demonstrations against this tyranny
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.800]  are being are being basically blacked out.
[36:19.800 --> 36:24.120]  Well, it's good to see you guys again, man, hey, what's going on in New York when you're
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.280]  speaking to teachers on the ground, the main concern and you're seeing this common threat
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.720]  happen across the board with the defund the police movement with medical health care professionals
[36:33.720 --> 36:34.920]  being removed.
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.360]  You're seeing a reinstallment when they remove these people, they quickly want to reinstall
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.440]  them with people that will bow down to the regime that won't ask any questions.
[36:43.440 --> 36:46.520]  The teachers right now, thousands of them that are being put out on the street because
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.680]  they refuse to take a jab.
[36:48.680 --> 36:51.000]  My body, my choice that went out the window.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.040]  Their main concern is who's going to replace us.
[36:53.040 --> 36:54.040]  Even parents.
[36:54.040 --> 36:57.400]  I talked to so many parents, Alex, that are asking the same questions.
[36:57.400 --> 37:02.480]  Who are going to replace these teachers that have personal relationships with our kids,
[37:02.480 --> 37:04.000]  decades long relationships.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.560]  Some of these kids, I mean, think about it, Alex, you have such a personal relationship
[37:07.560 --> 37:08.560]  with your teacher.
[37:08.560 --> 37:12.680]  You have such a big impact on your life, whether negatively or positively.
[37:12.680 --> 37:16.760]  But those that have a positive impact are going to be disconnected from their teachers.
[37:16.760 --> 37:19.840]  And that's going to have a pretty serious impact, a negative impact on some of these
[37:19.840 --> 37:20.840]  kids.
[37:20.840 --> 37:24.600]  Now, what they're concerned about is who's going to replace them, particularly in New
[37:24.600 --> 37:25.600]  York and Brooklyn.
[37:25.600 --> 37:28.520]  They were protesting out front of the department of education.
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.960]  Now what they were complaining about was obviously the unconstitutional mandates to
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.080]  take the jab, but also they want to know who's going to replace us.
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.120]  Are there people in the DOE that may be licensed to teach, but they hate kids?
[37:42.120 --> 37:43.640]  Who are the people that are going to replace us?
[37:43.640 --> 37:47.000]  Are they actually going to have the heart because it's not it's not some everyday average
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.200]  person that is able and equipped to deal with children.
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.480]  Even the special ed kids, Alex, I was talking to special ed teachers that were crying because
[37:55.480 --> 37:59.920]  it takes a special kind of person to go down that type of career path because you have
[37:59.920 --> 38:02.240]  to deal with them very specifically.
[38:02.240 --> 38:04.720]  So a lot of these teachers are asking some genuine questions.
[38:04.720 --> 38:07.120]  Yes, they're opposing the authoritarian policy.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.720]  But at the same time, we're going to see a reinstallment.
[38:09.720 --> 38:11.680]  You're seeing it with the defund the police, Alex.
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.320]  Every time they want to remove the police department or anyone that disagrees with the
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.800]  regime, they immediately reinstall them with people that aren't going to ask any questions,
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.880]  that aren't going to question the regime, that aren't going to push back or protest
[38:24.880 --> 38:27.400]  for their own autonomy or their own freedom.
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.160]  You're seeing it with the medical health care professionals as well.
[38:30.160 --> 38:32.400]  In New York, what did the governor come out and say?
[38:32.400 --> 38:35.480]  All of these people that we're going to put out on the street, we're going to replace you
[38:35.480 --> 38:38.960]  guys with people that are going to obey us or even the National Guard.
[38:38.960 --> 38:42.040]  They want to reinstall people because they want a controllable class.
[38:42.040 --> 38:43.040]  That's right.
[38:43.040 --> 38:44.040]  This is a purge.
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.080]  And this is multinational corporations in the UN through the fear of the virus that
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.360]  they themselves released now on record, purging the police, the fire department, the hospitals,
[38:54.360 --> 39:00.280]  the nurses, the doctors and the military with critical race theory, the first purge.
[39:00.280 --> 39:04.960]  If you think that hating America and saying whites are inherently evil is wrong, well,
[39:04.960 --> 39:06.160]  then you're purged.
[39:06.160 --> 39:10.040]  Or if you think Americans have a right to question elections, you're purged.
[39:10.040 --> 39:11.960]  If you question lockdowns, you're purged.
[39:11.960 --> 39:16.800]  Hell, they say in the official prospectus, as you know, but out in June, the new terrorism
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.120]  platform, that it's people that question lockdowns are the main terrorists.
[39:21.120 --> 39:28.440]  So this is a way for the system to declare war on people that know their basic rights.
[39:28.440 --> 39:34.320]  For Alex, domestic terrorists are now parents that oppose critical race theory.
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.440]  What's happening here is they're targeting the next generation.
[39:37.440 --> 39:43.000]  Listen, Alex, if America holds the line right now, if we hold our own and we literally survive
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.780]  this authoritarian power grab and freedom reigns, they're still targeting the next generation.
[39:48.780 --> 39:51.440]  That's why they're slapping them with masks over their face.
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.280]  That's why all these kids are being trained and groomed to bow the knee in order to gain
[39:55.280 --> 40:00.240]  access into anything, they're training the next generation to accept totalitarian global
[40:00.240 --> 40:01.240]  control.
[40:01.240 --> 40:02.600]  That's what they're doing with these children.
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.920]  They want to replace everybody.
[40:04.920 --> 40:07.220]  That's why they're designating parents.
[40:07.220 --> 40:12.120]  Anyone that opposes critical race theory, communism, Marxism as domestic terrorists,
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.320]  and they're sickening the FBI on them, the federal government, because they want to disconnect
[40:16.320 --> 40:17.960]  the children from the parents.
[40:17.960 --> 40:22.480]  They want to train the next generation, Alex, to be controlled by a big brother.
[40:22.480 --> 40:26.520]  Absolutely, and they're moving quick, and people say, well, this is hard to believe.
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.000]  It's incremental, but soon the flame is on high, and now they've turned the flame up
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  slowly.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  Now it's on high.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.600]  Now the frog is starting to bowl in the pot, and they admit this is their revolution,
[40:36.600 --> 40:39.720]  and they've got all the people online who get to go along with it.
[40:39.720 --> 40:41.360]  They don't get censored.
[40:41.360 --> 40:43.040]  They call themselves the liberals.
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.360]  They call themselves anti-establishment, Drew, but as you know, this is the establishment
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.520]  literally destroying and breaking this country and getting rid of the middle class while
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.240]  imploding the third world with ongoing lockdowns and then flooding us with those populations.
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.280]  Alex, let's just call it for what it is.
[40:59.280 --> 41:04.280]  The infrastructure for the mark of the beast is being set in place.
[41:04.280 --> 41:06.200]  I'm not saying the vaccine is the mark of the beast.
[41:06.200 --> 41:07.200]  I totally agree with you.
[41:07.200 --> 41:08.200]  No, no, say that.
[41:08.200 --> 41:09.200]  I mean, it is.
[41:09.200 --> 41:11.400]  Klaus Schwab says next is an implantable chip.
[41:11.400 --> 41:12.400]  You're...
[41:12.400 --> 41:13.400]  Keep telling us.
[41:13.400 --> 41:15.960]  Yeah, Alex, the infrastructure is being set in place.
[41:15.960 --> 41:16.960]  Think about it.
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.400]  Revelation 13 makes it very clear when the Antichrist comes, people are going to have
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.920]  to get a mark either on their foreheads or their hand, and it's going to give them access
[41:25.920 --> 41:27.520]  into the economy.
[41:27.520 --> 41:28.520]  That's what we're seeing.
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.120]  The infrastructure being set in place, not just in America, Alex, worldwide.
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.400]  We've never seen anything like this in world history, but now the technology, the infrastructure,
[41:38.400 --> 41:45.520]  the fear, OK, the ability to actually convince people to do something like this worldwide.
[41:45.520 --> 41:48.080]  The infrastructure is now set in place.
[41:48.080 --> 41:49.440]  I mean, think about it, Alex.
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.400]  You have the governor of New York coming out in a church, in a pulpit, telling people,
[41:54.400 --> 41:55.880]  God is not pleased with you.
[41:55.880 --> 41:59.320]  If you don't get vexed and if you get vexed, God will be pleased with you.
[41:59.320 --> 42:03.400]  And I need you guys to be my apostles and go out there and evangelize the world with
[42:03.400 --> 42:06.800]  this message, the false, vax cult gospel.
[42:06.800 --> 42:08.400]  We're living in the end times, Alex.
[42:08.400 --> 42:09.400]  This is it.
[42:09.400 --> 42:10.400]  It's not coming.
[42:10.400 --> 42:11.400]  We're here.
[42:11.400 --> 42:12.400]  It's now.
[42:12.400 --> 42:13.920]  It's not happening in the next few years.
[42:13.920 --> 42:14.920]  It's happening now.
[42:14.920 --> 42:17.680]  I'm not saying right now is the advent of the Antichrist.
[42:17.680 --> 42:20.480]  What I'm saying is the infrastructure is in place.
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.520]  When you read the book of Luke, one of the identifying factors of the last days in Luke
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.560]  chapter twenty one, verse twenty six is that men's heart will fail from fear.
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.960]  The world is being controlled through fear through the virus, Alex.
[42:33.960 --> 42:34.960]  We all know this.
[42:34.960 --> 42:37.080]  It's not a conspiracy theory any longer.
[42:37.080 --> 42:43.320]  It's not some far out QAnon thing that someone read on some message board on the Internet.
[42:43.320 --> 42:45.040]  This is happening in real time.
[42:45.040 --> 42:48.240]  Look at Australia, look at what's happening across the world.
[42:48.240 --> 42:49.760]  Look at the United States of America.
[42:49.760 --> 42:50.760]  And what do they want, Alex?
[42:50.760 --> 42:52.360]  You and I both know the truth.
[42:52.360 --> 42:53.680]  They want a controllable class.
[42:53.680 --> 42:54.680]  You're right.
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.680]  Stay there.
[42:55.680 --> 42:56.680]  Driven in.
[42:56.680 --> 43:06.840]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the
[43:06.840 --> 43:07.840]  new world order.
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.320]  And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[43:12.320 --> 43:18.120]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[43:18.120 --> 43:19.120]  through the U.N.
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.320]  And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want, and to
[43:23.320 --> 43:29.960]  have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of
[43:29.960 --> 43:32.120]  their new world ID.
[43:32.120 --> 43:36.960]  And now their puppet body has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.120]  to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.440]  This is criminal and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve
[43:45.440 --> 43:46.440]  it.
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.920]  They say that's a 20, 25, maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization.
[43:49.920 --> 43:53.320]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[43:53.320 --> 43:57.040]  Well, you live to see an absolute new world order world government.
[43:57.040 --> 43:59.520]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[43:59.520 --> 44:05.120]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.640]  other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[44:09.640 --> 44:11.680]  We don't have them long term.
[44:11.680 --> 44:12.680]  We die.
[44:12.680 --> 44:16.760]  But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that
[44:16.760 --> 44:22.960]  are recommended, if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep, your body will fall apart even
[44:22.960 --> 44:23.960]  faster.
[44:23.960 --> 44:27.800]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.840]  and life, it's hard to settle down.
[44:29.840 --> 44:30.840]  It's hard to relax.
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.240]  Well, let me tell you something right now.
[44:32.240 --> 44:35.360]  Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound.
[44:35.360 --> 44:40.440]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep, and it's
[44:40.440 --> 44:41.440]  such a game changer.
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.680]  So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out, available
[44:45.680 --> 44:49.640]  again at m4warstore.com for 50% off.
[44:49.640 --> 44:50.640]  And you know what?
[44:50.640 --> 44:53.640]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out, even though we've already sold out a
[44:53.640 --> 44:57.000]  half of it in just the last month, and we probably aren't going to have more for about
[44:57.000 --> 45:23.480]  five months.
[45:23.480 --> 45:39.040]  Okay?
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.320]  m4store.com. We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit
[45:44.320 --> 45:50.800]  m4store.com. Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones.

[45:56.480 --> 46:04.080]  your privacy today and support the m4. At m4store.com. In late August, m4 saw an explosion
[46:04.080 --> 46:11.520]  of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by
[46:11.520 --> 46:18.000]  design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to have. It's a checkbox that
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.040]  everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a
[46:27.040 --> 46:32.560]  relationship with God. But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in. Now
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.960]  we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.280]  cost at m4store.com. Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.760]  going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place. So lock in your storeable
[46:47.760 --> 46:55.360]  food now at a lower price and fund the m4store.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being
[46:55.360 --> 47:04.160]  self-sufficient and not under their control. So get prepared now at m4store.com. You're listening
[47:04.160 --> 47:23.680]  to the Alex Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen, we covered it earlier with the Aussie Cossack.
[47:23.680 --> 47:34.320]  We had on the broadcast his great-grandparents fled Russia from the Bolsheviks in 1918.
[47:36.080 --> 47:43.840]  And now he has been arrested for coming on my show, which he predicted might happen.
[47:45.360 --> 47:50.160]  And we played that footage earlier, but that's what's coming here. That's what's happening all over
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.800]  Australia as they establish martial law. And now they're saying third and fourth jabs.
[47:55.920 --> 48:01.120]  This is absolutely, again, a global corporate criminal takeover with the vaccine as the pretext
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.360]  to do it. And they're doing psychological profiles and hiring police that will follow the
[48:05.360 --> 48:10.640]  directives. And that's what Drew Hernandez, investigative reporter, was just saying earlier
[48:11.760 --> 48:15.600]  is that they're purging the military and police all over the world with the same program.
[48:15.600 --> 48:19.600]  They've already done the purges earlier in Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. So they're
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.640]  moving ahead. This is the universal great reset plan. Drew Hernandez, as you were saying, they
[48:24.640 --> 48:31.520]  want subservient slaves. And the evidence is clear to carry out their depopulation of most people.
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.280]  And folks will get in such fear of the system that they'll go ahead and adopt it and take
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.080]  into their bodies wherever the system wants. And then as they get sick and die, well,
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.360]  it'll be a thought crime on your social credit score. And you'll be thrown out on the street as
[48:45.360 --> 48:54.400]  homeless to be killed by, you know, crazy gangs of zombie like hordes. If you complain about your
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.400]  friends or family getting sick and dying. So you've been there, your reports are incredible.
[48:58.400 --> 49:01.440]  I know you've worked for a lot of different groups. I love the reporting you're doing for
[49:01.440 --> 49:07.360]  Real America's Voice. The logos and stuff look like that's Epoch Times. Is that what you're
[49:07.360 --> 49:13.440]  working with now? Yes, sir. I'm with Real America's Voice. And what we want to do is just bring the
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.480]  truth to the world and bring the truth to the public. And like I was saying at the end of the
[49:18.480 --> 49:24.160]  last segment is this is what they really want, Alex. They want to control through fear. If you
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.720]  can have someone afraid of you or a virus or something coming, people will throw their freedoms
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.200]  right out the window. That's what we've seen all of 2020. And that's what we're seeing now. And it
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.880]  continues on. Like I said earlier in Luke chapter 21 verse 26, one of the identifying factors of
[49:40.880 --> 49:47.280]  the last days is men's hearts failing from fear. That's what we're seeing across the board. People
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.200]  are scared of the virus. They're scared of the federal government. They're scared of something
[49:51.200 --> 49:56.560]  coming. They're scared of anything. We saw it post 9 11. Everyone was scared and they were angry
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.280]  and they were willing to give up freedoms because of fear. You could get people to do anything if
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.680]  they're afraid of you. They want a controllable class, Alex. Look at the border. They're importing
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.640]  millions, millions and they continue because what do they want? They want desperate people. They
[50:10.640 --> 50:15.360]  want a controllable class that aren't going to stand up for the Constitution that are illiterate
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.440]  of the Constitution that don't even know what freedoms are. They want a controllable class
[50:19.440 --> 50:22.960]  that's not going to stand up for anything. That's not going to take to the streets. That's not
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.840]  going to take to the streets to protest against authoritarian policies that aren't going to say
[50:27.840 --> 50:32.320]  my body, my choice. They don't want that. They want a controllable class that's desperate. They
[50:32.320 --> 50:36.880]  want to import the third world. They want a two class system, two tier. That's it, Alex. You
[50:36.880 --> 50:40.640]  and I know this. They want the elites at the top and the peasants at the bottom that they could
[50:40.640 --> 50:44.640]  control. That's all they want. And that's what they want to turn the United States of America
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.280]  into because that's what you see in China. That's where Australia is going. The authoritarian regime
[50:49.280 --> 50:53.920]  is being installed right now across the entire world. And people were called conspiracy theorists.
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.720]  People were called alt right wingers saying these types of things. But I mean, when I was in New
[50:58.720 --> 51:02.960]  York, Alex, you're seeing all people. I'm seeing people that support BLM. I'm seeing liberals.
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.800]  I'm seeing people that are waking up that were once siding with the Democrat party that are
[51:06.800 --> 51:11.680]  finally opening up their eyes to realize that there's an authoritarian deep state out there
[51:11.680 --> 51:16.080]  that's destroying everybody's lives. I mean, people really need to think about it. Last year's
[51:16.080 --> 51:22.080]  heroes are now this year's villains, today's villains, literally the medical health care
[51:22.080 --> 51:25.520]  professionals. I'm talking to so many of them, Alex. And then I talk to people on the street.
[51:25.520 --> 51:31.440]  I'm like, I ask you this, if this is such a conspiracy theory, then why the hell, Alex,
[51:31.440 --> 51:35.760]  why the hell am I talking to professional doctors, medical health care professionals,
[51:35.760 --> 51:41.520]  our ends. And they're telling me, you know what, this vaccine is too soon. It's too soon for us.
[51:41.520 --> 51:46.320]  And the public lean, the public needs to be well educated that this could be too dangerous for
[51:46.320 --> 51:51.200]  people to take. Because normally we wait about five to 10 years before we actually roll something
[51:51.200 --> 51:55.840]  like this out. And then I ask people on the street, are you smarter than these people? These are the
[51:55.840 --> 52:00.960]  people that you would trust in a life or death situation to take care of you or save your life.
[52:00.960 --> 52:06.080]  Now, all of a sudden, are they stupid conspiracy theorists? Alex, this is how we have to explain
[52:06.080 --> 52:12.640]  it to people because they're the hive mind has been so saturated to believe Fauci. Fauci is the
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.080]  Lord and savior. Fauci is the authoritarian centerpiece. He's the one that they listen to.
[52:18.080 --> 52:23.840]  He's the source of truth. We have to seriously show people that there are now medical health care
[52:23.840 --> 52:28.560]  professionals that are coming out and saying, this is wrong. Something's not right here. But
[52:28.560 --> 52:34.320]  even at that, Alex, it's hard to reach minds that have been so warped. But we can't stop trying
[52:34.320 --> 52:38.560]  because we know right now this is the time to move. This is the time to move because people
[52:38.560 --> 52:43.120]  are waking up and even shout out, shout out to covid land, man. My wife and I watched that thing
[52:43.120 --> 52:47.600]  last night, Alex. And one of the best documentaries I've seen, I cannot wait for the next parts to
[52:47.600 --> 52:52.000]  come out. It is seriously, I recommend anybody watching it right now that hasn't watched it.
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.040]  Don't only watch it. Go cop your own DVD. But at the same time, just post it anywhere you could
[52:57.040 --> 53:02.320]  post a link. Don't be afraid because this is the history that they want to erase. They don't want
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.720]  the world to see what happened in the United States of America and worldwide. They want to
[53:06.720 --> 53:11.280]  erase it all. So I encourage everybody not only to watch it, but put it everywhere they can where
[53:11.280 --> 53:16.800]  they could post the link. Absolutely. And it's almost two hours long. It cost them over two
[53:16.800 --> 53:22.640]  million dollars to shoot the five films. And then they're still doing more interviews, adding more
[53:22.640 --> 53:27.040]  to part two. Part two is now going to DVD and then going to be out in about a month. And we're
[53:27.040 --> 53:32.160]  going to offer it for free at Band-Aid video. But this is being put out to listeners that want to
[53:32.160 --> 53:37.680]  buy the DVD to then fund us to be able to make future films. People really wanted us to make
[53:37.680 --> 53:42.560]  films again. They wanted us to produce films. So we're partnering with filmmakers to do it.
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.720]  And then we sell the DVDs. People can have a hard copy to make copies from. But we're also posting
[53:46.720 --> 53:52.960]  the films for free to everybody. All we ask listeners to do is fight back and get it and send
[53:52.960 --> 53:58.720]  the link from Band-Aid video to your email list, to your text messages, and to tell people at work
[53:58.720 --> 54:05.120]  about it, to take them to Band-Aid video and say, hey, here's this film at Band-Aid video. Now you
[54:05.120 --> 54:11.360]  can't share the URL. Most places Band-Aid video. It's banned. But you can share freeworldnews.tv.
[54:11.360 --> 54:16.160]  Freeworldnews.tv. You're going to leave us here in a few minutes, Drew. But I'd like to get you back
[54:16.160 --> 54:21.760]  on soon. Next segment, I'm going to play part of your amazing report. You just have been doing a
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.280]  great job for years, but it just gets more and more amazing to see you pop up all around the
[54:25.280 --> 54:29.760]  country and all around the world. But spend a few minutes more talking about this incredibly
[54:29.760 --> 54:33.760]  diverse crowds of people that are out there demonstrating against this medical tyranny,
[54:33.760 --> 54:39.600]  this totally un-American garbage that violates the Constitution, Bill of Rights. It's just
[54:39.600 --> 54:44.640]  completely being forced on us. Rape is what's happening. And your predictions on where this
[54:44.640 --> 54:51.360]  is all going to go. Well, I'll tell you this. When I was in New York this past weekend and I covered
[54:52.160 --> 54:57.200]  the truth about COVID-19 conference put on by the American King Foundation,
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.000]  Angela Stanton King, the black community attempting to reach the black community,
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.400]  not only in Brooklyn, New York, they go to Atlanta. They're doing Los Angeles next. But
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.720]  one of the things that I keep hearing over and over again is that this is very familiar. And
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.360]  I'm talking about the vaccine mandates that's being rolled out in New York and Los Angeles.
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.000]  One thing I keep hearing them say is this reminds us a lot of the Jim Crow laws.
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.360]  They have a history with dealing with racism, the civil rights movement. We saw this not
[55:27.360 --> 55:31.440]  too long ago, a few decades ago, that was real and the black community had to deal with it.
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.000]  So this hits a little closer to home for them when, I mean, I was walking around New York,
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.960]  Alex, and I'm going to businesses and I see signs outside of restaurants that say no
[55:40.960 --> 55:46.640]  vaccine, no service. I see signs that say New York requires you to be fully vaccine in order
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.600]  to attain service or to come inside of this building. It's medical discrimination. So when
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.600]  you hear the black community come out, it's a little more personal for them because when you
[55:55.600 --> 56:01.040]  tell them, hey, if you don't have a vaccine, if you're unclean, you're not clean, you don't get
[56:01.040 --> 56:05.520]  any service. So they're pissed, Alex. I'm not saying the entire black community in New York,
[56:05.520 --> 56:09.360]  but the majority of them because the majority of them don't want to be vaxxed. And there's a lot
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.040]  of reasons why they don't trust the federal government because they've been experimented with
[56:13.040 --> 56:17.760]  before. We all know this. Well, that's right. Joy Bayard came out and said, don't worry blacks.
[56:17.760 --> 56:23.520]  We tested on the white people and giggled about it as if black people want to hurt white people
[56:23.520 --> 56:29.040]  on average and think, oh, good. It was tested on them like whites or rats. So now to give it to
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.120]  me, you know, black folks know about Tuskegee and other events that they're not stupid. And just
[56:33.120 --> 56:37.600]  like all these big NBA players have come out and said, man, look, this stuff's experimental. I don't
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.600]  trust a damn thing you're saying. You're suppressing the real scientists. So I think they've jumped
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.200]  the shark. But regardless, they're going to keep pushing. This is the globalist big move. They've
[56:45.200 --> 56:51.040]  been preparing this for decades. Absolutely, Alex. And I'll say this, here's the red pill for the
[56:51.040 --> 56:56.480]  viewers. And people might want to share this later. The big thing that's waking people up is this.
[56:57.120 --> 57:01.280]  We're hearing the federal government. We're healing. We're hearing sake. We're hearing Fauci.
[57:01.280 --> 57:07.600]  We're hearing all these so-called authoritative sources, right? Come out and say this. We just
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.960]  want you guys to be educated and informed, right? They tell the black community. They tell all
[57:12.960 --> 57:16.800]  community. They're telling everybody, we just want you guys to be educated and informed when it
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.960]  comes to the vaccine. But here's the red pill. They only want us to hear the good things that
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.960]  they want us to hear. But if anybody on YouTube, social media, the mainstream media, if you come
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.320]  out and you list the negative side effects, the potential harm that this thing can do to you,
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.960]  you get silenced on big tech, you could lose your entire account, you get slandered in the
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.000]  mainstream media, you get suppressed, you get made to look like a crazy person, a conspiracy
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.760]  theorist, even if you are a medical healthcare professional or a doctor. That's right. That's
[57:47.760 --> 57:54.000]  the key, Drew Hernandez. Amazing job. I want to explain something that is absolutely seed
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.960]  understanding our world. It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know. The privately owned
[57:58.960 --> 58:05.440]  central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[58:05.440 --> 58:12.000]  and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property,
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.280]  energy. They're using it to buy people, to buy influence. And in the past, they created thousands
[58:19.280 --> 58:23.680]  of trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.880]  money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone
[58:28.880 --> 58:34.160]  ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything,
[58:34.720 --> 58:39.760]  not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of
[58:39.760 --> 58:44.960]  civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left standing. This is the great
[58:44.960 --> 58:48.640]  reset. This is what's happening now. Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[58:48.640 --> 58:55.760]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[58:55.760 --> 59:02.720]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts. It's
[59:02.720 --> 59:09.440]  called PQQ or Bio PQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things. It actually
[59:09.440 --> 59:14.400]  makes your telomeres last longer. Doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer, the space
[59:14.400 --> 59:19.440]  for the same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get. Well,
[59:19.440 --> 59:25.680]  DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months. It's back in stock, the highest quality, PQQ,
[59:25.680 --> 59:31.200]  CoQ10 and so much more. This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:11.360]  last hour of you just joined us and he works with the Epic Times, Epoch Times, one of the best
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:16.080]  independent organizations in the world, if not the best for a major organization. They come out of
[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:21.200]  the folks that fled China and witness mass murder of Buddhist Christians and others. And so they're
[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:25.600]  just doing a great job to watch our own corporate media attack them, let you know which side corporate
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:32.640]  media is with. But investigative reporter, ladies and gentlemen, with Real America's Voice,
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:36.960]  and he joins us. Drew, you're making a great point about how you've got your speech as long as you
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.120]  go along with the lies, which they all admit are lies, very poisonous shot, doesn't protect you,
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:45.920]  destroys your immune system. But if you're a real expert, they silence you and that just shows
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:51.200]  you were supposedly going to trust these doctors and nurses that are such heroes. And a lot of
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:55.200]  our great people, why aren't we listening to them now about the horrible things they've seen
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:01.280]  inside these hospitals and clinics and nursing homes? Absolutely. It's an abusive mentality
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:05.760]  that these people have. And the point I was making before the break is this. And the red pill
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:09.920]  moment I want people to ask themselves whether you're on the left or you're on the right is this,
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:16.560]  OK? If you're a free, autonomous human being and you believe in making your own choices yourself,
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:21.600]  I want to ask you this. Why is the federal government? Why are all the so called trust
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:26.720]  sources? Why are all these people that come out and say, we just want you to be educated?
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.560]  We want you to know what you're doing when you're putting something into your body. We want you
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:35.040]  to be informed, right? You hear the governor of New York come out and say, it's the smart people
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:39.520]  that are getting back. But those that aren't smart, they're not yet. So we need you to go out there
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:43.920]  and evangelize them. It's the same narrative you're hearing across the board. So I want people
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:49.360]  to ask themselves is this, if these people really want you to be educated and they want you to be
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:55.680]  informed, then why is it that they censor on big tech anytime a doctor or a medical healthcare
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:01.360]  professional comes out and lists the negative side effects or speaks out against the vaccine
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.400]  or speaks on something that could potentially that could be bad for you? If you take this,
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.160]  why do they get censored? Why do they get suppressed? And in the mainstream media,
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.920]  they get painted as insane or crazy. Well, here's a perfect example. They've had to have at least
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:22.880]  10 major bioethics, ethics professors that are over the ethics of the university's medical systems.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:29.280]  Okay. I mean, that means like they're the expert. And another top one was just basically forced out
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:34.880]  because he said, this is violates the Nuremberg code. You're saying people with natural immunity.
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:39.600]  It's no good. That can kill them to take any vaccine once you have naturally immunity. You
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:45.680]  can have an autoimmune response. You see Irvine director of medical ethics placed on investigative
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:51.360]  leave over challenged a vaccine mandate. That's what's going on. So read that article on info
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:55.680]  wars.com. And folks, the only way it gets out is you sharing on your email, sharing on your text
[1:02:55.680 --> 1:03:00.320]  message and word of mouth. This is a total war. Drew, I want to invite you back very soon. I want
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:04.400]  to go to the border with you again. But there's my favor, please keep me in mind. I've been wanting
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:09.600]  to come to New York. I've been wanting to come protest with the people very soon. And I just
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:14.080]  haven't done the right time or the right place. So I hope you could be my guide up there, maybe in
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:19.280]  two, three weeks. And because I also promised to go protest at the UN and at the embassy there
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:24.560]  from Australia for Australians being arrested for even speaking out against lockdowns online.
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:28.960]  And the man that asked me to do it on air two weeks ago has now been arrested. We covered
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:34.640]  that before you came on last hour. And so I promised to do this. So will you tell me the
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:39.600]  best time or place to come up to New York, please, sir? Absolutely, Alex. Now is the time. It's
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:43.840]  now or never, Alex, because right now there are thousands of people that are bidding being put
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:49.440]  out on the street with these unconstitutional authoritarian vax mandates, nurses, medical
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:54.240]  health care, training us like Hitler did or the communists did to persecute certain groups
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:57.280]  because they haven't done what the government wants. That's that's illegal.
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:02.160]  Insane. Drew, I'm so excited that you are with the Epoch Times. I can't think of better people in
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:06.000]  the world. I mean, I mean, they're right up there with Tucker Carlson or, you know, right up there
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.960]  with some of the more amazing people out there. Joe Rogan's totally awake now. Beautiful things
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:14.560]  are happening. But but tell me about your show and how and where people can find it.
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:21.040]  Yeah, well, people could follow me on Twitter, Drew H live. I actually worked for Real America's
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:27.360]  Voice. I don't think they're in connection with Epoch Times, but I worked for Real America's Voice.
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:30.720]  Well, if I make her and I'm sorry, I just see them promoting it and pushing it on there. So
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:35.600]  so maybe I'm I think it's affiliated somehow. But you worked. You probably know more than I do.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:40.000]  Real America's Voice, Alex. So I'm constantly going out, traveling, covering what the mainstream
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:47.360]  media won't cover. Obviously, last year, 2020, I was covering the race riots with BLM, Antifa,
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:50.880]  but move to the border. I'm just we got to cover. I'm trying to cover everything, Alex. And you
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:56.080]  know how it is. It's impossible. You're amazing. Drew H live. I'm going to see you in New York
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:02.240]  soon. God bless you, brother. Thank you. Could you imagine a year ago, walking into a bank
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:06.400]  with your face covered? Could you imagine even going into the grocery store? Do you think they
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:10.240]  would like you in? Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:16.880]  you weren't going to be shoplifting? Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going
[1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:21.360]  inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:26.000]  would get you? Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with it with a shield that
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:34.480]  looks like a space alien? Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:39.200]  human interaction. The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity,
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:45.120]  only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us. And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:49.280]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes major
[1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:54.080]  medical issues and it's dehumanizing. And the film COVID land does that. Secure your copy now
[1:05:54.080 --> 1:06:02.720]  at covidland.com and get a free copy of in game. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:18.960]  World Order. It's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and into our number two.
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:25.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I want to get back into just the incredible tyranny we're living
[1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:30.000]  under and how we're being gaslit and how the system with the corporations and all the governments
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.800]  linked up through the UN and through the whole system that the Rockefellers set up and Klaus Schwab
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:39.520]  runs and Bill Gates administers to tell us we're coming into your house, we're coming into your
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:44.240]  body, we're going to arrest you, we're going to take control of your life, we're going to persecute
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:50.880]  you if you don't submit to us. So I want to go to a clip I forgot to get to last hour of Simeon
[1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:58.400]  Boykov known as the Aussie Cossack. His great grandparents came from Russia in 1918, one year
[1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:03.120]  after the Bolsheviks took over because they were going to be slaughtered and he's a very successful
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:13.280]  businessman there in Australia and so the police just yesterday came to his office that's by his
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:19.680]  home two weeks after he was on our show for incitement for coming on my show with another
[1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:23.760]  woman who'd been released from jail for 20 plus days for having a peaceful protest as well
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:28.960]  and saying it's incitement he said I may be arrested coming on your show but we need Americans to
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:36.320]  peacefully protest at the embassies in New York in DC and I promise to do that and I'm setting it
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:43.520]  up now. He sent out an SOS and it's got a million 400,000 views on Banda video breaking Australians
[1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:53.440]  issue emergency SOS to the world and ladies and gentlemen he got arrested yesterday so here
[1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:59.280]  is the footage of North Korean style police and this is actually happening with a virus the UN
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:04.800]  cooked up with Fauci on record confirmed now they released it they had the motive they could control
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:09.440]  it they could do the lockdown they could have the cover up and then great reset all admits that they
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:13.920]  did it and they've taken control using it and that this is for carbon taxes and controlling us
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.400]  and then we've got we'll play the clip I forgot to get to last hour as well of
[1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:24.320]  sake saying yeah we can lower your gas prices but we're cutting it off because of the earth
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:27.600]  I mean no they're cutting it off because they're shutting America down China and
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:32.000]  India and everybody else just have all the energy they want this is incredible folks here's
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:38.560]  1984 becomes a reality in Australia. The guys got the police at the door so how can I help you?
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:46.400]  Do you want to come in? No come in. Well do you want to come inside?
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:53.200]  Well we have to do we prefer you come to the door. Who just come to the door mate?
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:09:02.080]  No you come inside, come inside. Stand up, stand up, you're under arrest. You're under arrest,
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:07.600]  stand up, move away from the move away from the death. You're under arrest stand up, I cannot be
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:12.320]  any further. So what do you want to do? You want to arrest me? Stand up and move away from the table
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.840]  I'm formally placing you under arrest. My name is Leadingston, you're Constable Kingston from
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:19.920]  Bournemouth High Patrol. I'll let you know right now that this conversation is being recorded on
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.920]  the body wall camera do you understand that? Do you understand this being recorded on the body wall
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:30.160]  camera? I can understand that. So what do you arrest me for? So you are under arrest all right?
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:34.640]  You're under arrest because of the defence committed at 5.25. Can I get everyone to introduce
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:40.560]  themselves? I don't know if you're police or not. Who are you sorry? So Jang, can I see a badge?
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.400]  Yeah you've got a badge there. What's your name? Sergeant Portia Cheney from Bournemouth Police.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:52.000]  And Kingston, now you've been making threats against me and you've said you're going to get me.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.880]  I'm not going to entertain you. Is this what you're doing? Is this your
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:58.160]  following through on the threat? Listen you are under arrest at the moment
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:02.000]  for an alleged breach of the Public Health Act that occurred at 5.25 p.m. Monday the 4th of
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.800]  October 2021. That's in the vicinity of Timberall Park Road point okay. I'm going to remind you
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:13.600]  you do not have to say or do anything if you don't want to. Anything you do say or do he's
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:17.120]  been recorded and this recording may be used in court as evidence. Do you understand that?
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.760]  Yeah so you're going to give are you going to try and get violent with me now or what are you
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.560]  going to do? Come on let's go. Do you want to cuff me or what? So this is the reality of what's
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:30.240]  happening around the world and it's now happening in Canada. We had the pastor on yesterday it's now
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:38.400]  happening in areas of New York City. This is all UN directive. This is a UN globalist
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:43.680]  invasion in our face and then again she's all over the news. There's no need to play it. You've
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:53.280]  you've seen Saki come out and say we could give you cheaper fuel. Fuel's basically doubled under
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:59.120]  Biden but that's good for the earth for that to happen. No bankrupting you and shutting down
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:02.720]  our businesses is not good. They've already shipped our jobs overseas. They've already
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.960]  flooded us with third world populations and now they've cut off most our coal power plants
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:13.440]  while China opens new ones every week and while we ship our coal to China. This is just such
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:18.720]  a massive deliberate campaign but I want to show you one more video that I showed last hour
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  that is so important. It's on info wars.com. It's a John Hopkins illustration with their data.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.320]  Video illustrates how COVID vaccines have totally backfired. No my friends it's not backfired. There
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:39.760]  it is on screen. Everywhere in the world when the vaccine starts when the injection starts it
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:46.720]  then skyrockets to all time record highs. This out of all the videos we've seen is the video to
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.000]  send your neighbors your friends your family. A lot of them already taken the shots. They don't
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.680]  want to admit they were conned. They don't want to admit they were wrong but this will wake them
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:58.800]  up. These are real numbers from John Hopkins all over the world and I think I'm going to change
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:02.400]  the headline. Kellan McBring did a great job. He says video illustrates how COVID vaccines
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:11.040]  have totally backfired. John Hopkins illustration proves COVID shots causing illness and death.
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.280]  Causing majority of illness and death. I mean that's what it proves. Well you're not a scientist.
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.280]  Well I shoot you in the head with a gun and blow your brains out. It kills you. I'm also not a
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.800]  ballistics expert but I know I just blew your head off. There it is. This is depopulation out in the
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:33.040]  open but they hide it in the bureaucracy. I've got another video I'll have to get to later once
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:38.320]  Owen gets in the studio where this tragic grieving uncle eulogizes vaccine murdered niece. Jessica
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:44.000]  died as a direct result of an experimental vaccine. They're all just saying they can get away with it
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.840]  and all trying to censor that important information. But let me just stop right here and talk about
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.320]  something that's also important and it's the fact that we can fight back and you can get
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:58.320]  angry and upset. You can share the live feed of the show and you can share articles and videos
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.320]  and you can start your own shows. You can go speak at city council and school board.
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:06.400]  They would be trying to sick the FBI on you going to school board saying I don't want mask. I don't
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:11.360]  want shots. I don't want white kids taught they're the devil. It's going to create racial division
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.880]  because they're weak. They're wrong. Foreign corporations are running this attack on America.
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.360]  That's what the new world order is and they feel shielded that they can cause a civil war here or
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:27.760]  war in China and that that won't affect them. It will affect them. It's time to identify the UN
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:32.480]  and Klaus Schwab and the globalists and the people behind this. They keep trying to put out UN propaganda
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:36.800]  and Klaus Schwab great reset about how wonderful this is and how they did the lockdowns to save
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:42.400]  the earth. They pulled those videos because you rejected it. These psychos think they're going
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.960]  to win. They're not. The question is how bad is it going to get before we do something.
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:53.280]  The other good news is you can fund this operation. This has been in for a month. We've gotten all
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:59.040]  these five star reviews. I've been so busy. I haven't plugged it yet. So let me tell you right now.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:07.200]  There are now five different types of bio pros and the bio pros dot com the bio pros dot com.
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:16.240]  This is the industrial system for porta potties for sewage lines for every other system you
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:23.440]  can imagine everywhere. It's just absolutely incredible. It works in septic tanks. It just
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:32.240]  goes on and on and on and on. And we are really, really proud of this system, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:36.800]  And I worked with the big oil company, people that develop this and the scientists have had
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.480]  20 years to get this through a company they set up to you because it works so good. It's not
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.720]  enzymes in your septic tank. It's not enzymes in your boat or RV or trailer or in your outhouse,
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:55.520]  your one holer. This is a system that uses bacteria that live in there and it says goes six
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.800]  months to a year. That's because we're being conservative. It goes for years, ladies and
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:04.000]  gentlemen, and even lives through freezes. You name it. So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:12.320]  the bio pros dot com. There is now bio drain bio RV bio marine pro and bio porta pro ladies and
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:17.760]  gentlemen, all available at the bio pros dot com. And they're going to be adding a page soon to
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:21.680]  show you some of the amazing reviews. This is trailblazing stuff. And we're excited about it.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:27.680]  And then separately 30 seconds on this silent pocket, silent pocket, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:33.200]  gentlemen, these are incredible systems next level gins. It's a company here in America. They've
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:38.560]  got very compliant. The military buys these from them. They have a whole made in America line
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:43.760]  that's now available at info war store dot com. And these Faraday cages are super,
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:47.680]  super nice. No reviews yet, because we just started offering them. And I'll tell you more

[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:04.880]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:10.480]  into the retail consumer market. Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago,
[1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:19.520]  they come out with four new products. BioDrain Pro, BioRV Pro, Biomarine Pro and BioPorta Pro.
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:26.400]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented,
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:33.760]  naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:39.600]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are. The BioProse system is light years
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:45.440]  better than traditional enzymes that only work once. These bacteria begin to breed and live
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:51.120]  in your septic tank. And now it's available for the general public's use for the first time on
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:59.760]  the retail market, exclusively available at thebioprose.com. People ask me all the time,
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:05.280]  Alex, the last three months or so, you've had explosive energy on top of your already very
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:09.280]  intense level of energy. What's happening? Well, it's the things that are happening in the world
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:13.760]  right now. That's got my blood up. But also, I've gotten back in the groove of religiously
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:19.600]  taking three products every single day. DNA Force Plus, that's back in stock. Also,
[1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:25.200]  X2, Deep Earth Crystal Ionine, that's essential for your immune system, your whole body. And,
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:31.200]  of course, at nighttime, down and out sleep aid that makes me have deeper, cleaner, restful sleep
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:36.320]  that, again, boosts my immune system and is good for every cell in my body and great for the spirit.
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.520]  All three of these products are in stock right now. They are 40% off in the case of DNA Force Plus
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:47.280]  and 50% off for one week only on Survival Shield X2. And, yes, until supplies last,
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:53.760]  we have down and out 50% off at mfoldwarestore.com. This is their trifecta. I suggest you check it
[1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:56.400]  out and experience what this does for your body today.
[1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:35.280]  You know how the CIA takes over confidence. You know how they do it. A bunch of Ivy League
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:39.040]  Blue Bloods get together and they go in for decades and study the cultures of where they're
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:43.680]  going. Then they come in and divide the groups against each other. So the Roman Empire control
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:48.560]  people, divide and conquer. Well, Professor Thomas Sowell is one of my favorite historians. He really
[1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:53.920]  does his research. He's dead on accurate. And I watch his stuff almost every day. I mean, he's very
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:00.160]  prolific. But here's just a short seven-minute clip about the true history of the South and Blacks
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:05.200]  and the Left's relationship to it. It's a very, very important clip. And I suggest you go to places
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:09.440]  like YouTube while still available and watch his other lectures or read some of his books. In fact,
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:13.840]  I've had him on several times. I think it's time to try to get him back on the broadcast again.
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.640]  So here is Thomas Sowell breaking down some amazing history. And if you're interested in
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:24.320]  history, I would suggest you just start researching the South itself. It's intriguing like all other
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:28.720]  major history is. Now, we're going to play this report. We're going to come back and Owen Schroyer
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:32.800]  is going to be in studio to tell us what happened in his court hearing today. We're trying to put
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:37.600]  him in prison for two years for thought crime. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:42.960]  infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for Mayor
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:48.800]  Trump and you ain't black, I had to remind him that he was a black person. So he can't vote for
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:54.560]  Donald Trump and that he shouldn't be influencing an entire swath of people who may listen to him
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:57.200]  because he's worried about his own personal pocketbook.
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.440]  So Dr. Ben Carson, you may be familiar with him. He's an up and coming African American in the
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:14.880]  Republican Party. Anyway, he's being taken to tax task tonight after making some controversial
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:21.760]  comments on Mark Levin's conservative radio show. Here it is. You're attacked also in many
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:26.560]  respects because of your race, because you're not supposed to think like this and talk like this.
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:31.200]  A lot of white liberals just don't like it, do they? Well, I, you know, they're the most racist
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:36.240]  people there are because, you know, they put you in a little category, a little box, you have to
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:43.680]  think this way. How could you dare come off the plantation? From my standpoint, as a black American,
[1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:51.360]  as far as I'm concerned, it is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:59.280]  for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas. And it is a message that unless
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:07.760]  you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed,
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:15.440]  caricatured by a committee of the US, US Senate, rather than hung from a tree.
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:21.840]  Booker T Washington, his message, his story, his success, the generation that came out of slavery,
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:28.000]  their successes, that's an inconvenient truth for the political left. So yes,
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.480]  hide Booker T Washington, hide all those blacks who were successful, hide all the success that
[1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:39.440]  took place before affirmative action. Just hide it, pretend it didn't happen, and then you can
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.640]  believe that blacks are inferior and that only white people can save them. Black people have never
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:49.440]  supported, for example, affirmative action, potas, anything of that sort. Wherever polls have been
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:54.000]  taken a black opinion on such matters, or should people be paid equally, or should there be this
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:58.800]  or that, black people have never taken a position that you described. So it is not a question of
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:03.280]  what black people chose to do. It's what you choose to put in the mouths of black people,
[1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:07.280]  it's what you choose to project. It is not what any black people have ever said,
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:10.400]  anywhere that you can put your finger on. It's what you choose to put into the mouth of the
[1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:15.200]  pollsters, as far as I can see. The leadership of the black community. Like most people, I have
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:21.040]  never seen a pollster. If you look at the leadership of the black... Intellectuals in the 1960s began
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:26.640]  promoting the idea that those blacks who exhibited a culture different from the ghetto or black red
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:32.880]  net culture were not really authentic blacks. This issue was strikingly demonstrated in a
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:39.520]  controversy between Irving Howe and Ralph Ellison, growing out of Howe's 1963 article criticizing
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.800]  such black writers as Ellison, whom Howe considered insufficiently authentic or militant.
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:50.800]  For Howe, the central character in Richard Wright's novel, Native Son, a ghetto black
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:56.400]  epitomizing the black red net culture was authentic, and the more sophisticated central
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:02.800]  character in Ellison's novel, Invisible Man, was not. Ellison rejected and derided the idea
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:08.240]  of a white man defining what a black man should be and attempting to confine individual blacks
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.160]  to that stereotype. The notion that the ghetto black was the authentic black not only spread
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:18.960]  among both white and black intellectuals, it had social repercussions far beyond the
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:24.880]  intellectual community. Rooting black identity in a counterproductive culture not only reduced
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:30.320]  incentives to move beyond that culture, it cut off those within that culture from other blacks
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.440]  who had advanced beyond it, who might otherwise have been sources of examples, knowledge, and
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:41.360]  experience that could have been useful to those less fortunate. But more successful blacks were
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:46.000]  increasingly depicted as either irrelevant non-members of the black community or even as
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:52.640]  traders to it. In turn, this meant that many blacks who had a wider cultural exposure and
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:58.560]  greater socioeconomic success felt a need to conform, to some degree or another, to a more
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:04.320]  narrow ghetto view of the world, perhaps using ghetto language in order to prove their identity
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:10.960]  with their own race. Such social pressures become especially acute for young blacks in the schools
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:17.120]  and colleges. One consequence of this has been that counterproductive attitudes toward education
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:21.600]  have filtered upward into black middle-class young people raised in racially integrated
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:26.720]  middle-class communities such as Shaker Heights, who spend less time on their studies than their
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:32.400]  white or Asian-American classmates, under the overhanging threat of being accused of acting white
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:37.440]  if they devote themselves to their studies instead of to various social activities in which other
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:44.480]  black students indulge. The painful irony is that those who make this accusation are themselves
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:50.800]  acting white when they perpetuate a redneck culture from a bygone era. Even such a modern
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:57.680]  ghetto creation as gangster rap echoes the violence, arrogance, loose sexuality, and self-dramatization
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:03.680]  common for centuries in white redneck culture, and speaks in exaggerated cadences common in the
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:09.440]  oratory of rednecks in both the antebellum south and those parts of Britain from which their ancestors
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:15.040]  came. It is not only the cultural peculiarities of the black ghetto culture which has been
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:21.280]  perpetuated by the identity fetish developed in the post 1960s era. What has also been promoted
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:26.400]  has been a conformity of beliefs and affirmations among blacks, with those with different viewpoints
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:32.480]  being banished from consideration intellectually and ostracized socially, at least insofar as
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:38.320]  identity advocates succeed in imposing their straight jacket on others. Not only behavioral
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:44.880]  litmus tests but ideological litmus tests have been used by those promoting a black identity fetish,
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:49.760]  with those who do not pass such litmus tests being dismissed as not really black.
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:56.960]  This post 1960s black identity intolerance, promoted by white intellectuals as well as
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:28:03.280]  black leaders and activists, is a painful parallel to the post 1830s intolerance among
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:09.600]  white southerners against anyone who questioned slavery in any way. Maintaining what has been
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.960]  aptly called an intellectual blockade against ideas differing from those prevailing in the south,
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:20.400]  antebellum southerners not only insulated themselves from ideas and viewpoints originating
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:27.120]  outside the region, but at the same time in effect drove out of the south independent minded people
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:33.280]  who would not march in lockstep. The resulting narrow and unquestioning conformity of that era
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:39.120]  led the south into the blind alley of a civil war that devastated wide sections of the region
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:45.920]  and left a legacy of bitterness that lasted for generations. It can only be hoped that today's
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:52.000]  narrow intolerance promoted by a black identity fetish will not lead into similarly disastrous
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  blind alleys. Attention radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:07.360]  November elections, this will be an extremely important message. Here's why, no matter what
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:14.000]  the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility. Here's why
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.280]  this is important. Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:24.880]  uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable currencies, but did you know that there's been
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:31.200]  times in the past during times of extreme hardship when Americans put another store of value above
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:36.800]  even silver and gold? It's true, open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:42.560]  ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead. Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom

[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:06.560]  It's been out of stock for a while. It's one of three sleep aids we have at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:11.520]  This one has been very popular. It's sold off the shelves. It's back in stock, down and out,
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:19.520]  liquid sleep support. This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:25.520]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes in pill form. This is the liquid tincture and I think
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:31.280]  this is probably the most powerful one. Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine. This is, if you haven't
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.760]  done an iodine challenge yet, have you haven't done the iodine challenge? What are you waiting for?
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:42.000]  Now is the time. Super male and super female vitality. Living Defense Plus and the organic
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.360]  greens fiber caps. We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.600]  so we can order a new batch. It was very popular. The organic greens fiber caps, but we have all
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:57.680]  kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things. Take advantage of
[1:30:57.680 --> 1:31:02.800]  those. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on
[1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:07.360]  there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the new world
[1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:11.840]  orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:16.640]  doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the air and
[1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:21.920]  please support the local station you're listening to as well. At the same time, go to infowarstore.com
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:27.600]  while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:33.680]  that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now.
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:39.360]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us. So pray for us,
[1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:43.920]  word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great products that

[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:33.760]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:42.240]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:51.040]  I own, profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of

[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:03.600]  of your miserable lives. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:33.520]  And now your host, Owen Shroyer. All right, we're back live in the info wars world.
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:41.360]  Headquarters here in Austin, Texas. And wow, there is so much breaking as I prepare to host
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:47.920]  the next hour and a half of the Alex Jones show. And then I'll be back hosting the war room three
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:52.640]  to six. And I mean, seriously, there's just so much breaking. And I've got a lot of great guests.
[1:33:53.520 --> 1:34:00.640]  They're going to be coming up as well. But it's tough to even decide where to begin on this.
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:05.600]  I mean, I think what's incredible is what I'm not seeing in the news. And that's some of the
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:14.400]  geopolitical strife. It's it's actually kinetic now. It is actually going on. It just got reported
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:20.640]  by I forget the gentleman's name covering the border for Fox News. I think it's Bill Menjolin
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:30.480]  or something like that. And so now the cartels. I'm not sure guys did it yet. And it clipped 12.
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:38.960]  Just just roll the B roll. The cartels are firing machine guns across the southern border into the
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.520]  United States. And it's been determined by the border patrol down there that he stationed with
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:49.280]  that they're basically warning shots because they're buzzing over the heads of the headquarters
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:54.400]  the headquarters down there border patrol and their and their stations. And so this is just
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:59.760]  the video you can see the tracer rounds going over the heads of a border patrol facility there.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.320]  And and I can't play the audio because it's basically like what the F. Oh my F. Holy F.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:13.440]  So there's yeah, Bill Menjolin. We witnessed tracer rounds from a suspected cartel machine
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:18.560]  gun being fired from Mexico into the US early this morning while we were embedded with the
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:24.640]  Texas National Guard in Roma, Texas. Soldiers tell us rounds when above their observation posts. Now
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:33.200]  you had I guess it was Tuesday or Wednesday about a dozen governors down at the southern border
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:41.280]  addressing this issue. And think about how bad it is. Think about how corrupt our government is
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:50.080]  is when you have live rounds being fired off from Mexico into the United States of America.
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:57.840]  And it's not even news. And it's not even a big enough event, I guess, in the eyes of the White
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:04.880]  House that hey, the southern border is under serious duress. The southern border is a war zone.
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:11.680]  You see you see dead bodies hanging from trees. You see kids being dumped over walls. You see
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.920]  U-Haul trucks with hundreds of people stuffed in. I mean just all the scenes that we've seen.
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:23.200]  Not to mention the millions of illegal immigrants that have come across.
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:32.640]  And Mellogen here is just continuing to report on all the chaos. But but bullets live rounds,
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:39.680]  trace rounds being fired into the United States from the Mexican border. And we get nothing
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:44.960]  out of the White House. Still we have a wide open border. I mean that's like that's like emergency
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:54.800]  stuff. And it's just barely even a blip on the radar. And that's just one example. Did you know
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:59.200]  there was a massive bombing last night in Afghanistan? In fact, I mean seriously, I'll
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:03.040]  ask the crew. Did you know that cameraman? Did you know that? No? Any of the crew know that?
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:07.280]  Did anybody know that? Anybody hear about that? So most of the crew, one person said they heard
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:10.880]  about it. Most of the crew did not hear about it. And I mean this is the most informed crew you're
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:16.960]  going to find in news folks. Shia mosque bombing kills dozens. It's actually hundreds is the number
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:27.200]  now in Afghan city of Kanduz. So the destabilization of Afghanistan continues to go into chaos.
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:34.800]  And look, I think it's sad what happens in the Middle East with all the chaos. Can the US do
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.320]  anything about it? Probably not. Maybe we tried. Maybe we could have helped. Maybe we did help.
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:46.000]  There was a lot of death. It cost us a lot of treasure. And we just left it as now it's a bigger
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.600]  disaster zone than ever. And they're just back to just killing hundreds of people all the time.
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:54.640]  And they're claiming it was the Islamic State. Where did they get the bombs? Where did they get
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:38:00.400]  the weapons? But I guess we know the answer to that, don't we? The Obama administration
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:06.240]  was arming these terrorists. They called them moderate rebels. In fact, guys, you should pull
[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:12.000]  that up just for context and brevity if you can. Just search Obama arms or Obama funds,
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.560]  moderate rebels, and you should pull up a dozen or so stories. These are the moderate,
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:20.800]  quote unquote, moderate rebels that he was funding at the time. He was funding him and
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.560]  arming him in Syria as well. These are all CIA proxy wars. It's kind of like what just came
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:32.560]  out the other day this week, where they admitted that the CIA had a proxy group in Afghanistan
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:36.960]  that they were running, which was really just this rogue group that's now gone rogue and just
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:45.280]  mass murdering and enslaving people again. So where do you think the weapons came from?
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:49.280]  At least 100 worshipers have been killed or injured in a suicide bombing that targeted a
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:54.000]  packed Shia mosque in Afghanistan during Friday prayers. What do you think the suicide bomber
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:01.520]  got this? Did he make it himself? The speculation is the attack was carried out by the Islamic
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:08.080]  state, which has a long history of attacking Afghanistan Shia minority. So hundreds dead
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:15.760]  from a alleged ISIS or IS suicide bomber, and it doesn't even make the news anymore.
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:23.440]  Not even, not even a story. And all I do is sit there and watch news. It's kind of
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:27.920]  maybe a bit of a sad existence, quite frankly. That's all I do. Nobody covered it.
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:34.320]  I just happened to see it when I was doing my news aggregation on the internet. So
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.560]  rounds being fired into the United States from Mexico across the southern border
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:47.680]  barely makes the news. Suicide bomber in Afghanistan kills hundreds of people in a mosque,
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:49.680]  barely makes the news. We're not even done yet.
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:56.400]  Did you know China invaded India yesterday? How about that one crew? Did anybody hear about that
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:04.560]  one? Nope. No. China tried to invade India last night. Did you know that India and China face off
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:12.960]  along the line of actual control in the Arunachal Paradesh sector? I'm probably butchering that,
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:18.240]  but there it is. And so China tried to invade. They racially, they racially held off is what
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:23.360]  happened. They sent the military force in there, kind of a small contingent. They sent it in there
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:31.360]  to cross the border and go in through the line of actual control. And the Indian army that was
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:37.360]  there basically staved them off and they had to retreat. So China is getting real aggressive
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:45.440]  because of the weak leadership of the United States. Afghanistan is going into complete chaos
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:48.720]  and death and destruction because of the weak leadership of the United States.
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.120]  Rounds are being fired from Mexico across the southern border into the United States because
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:58.640]  of the weak leadership in the United States. And the media doesn't even cover it. Still not done.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:07.200]  And by the way, you think all this development with China going into Taiwan, China encroaching
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:11.680]  on Hong Kong, China moving into India, you think this is all coincidence with this story now that
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:18.480]  we've seen? Attack submarine USS Connecticut suffers underwater collision in South China Sea.
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:26.240]  So yet another example of the Navy completely flubbing up. I'm telling you, something is sour
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:33.040]  at the Navy. And I hate to admit this, but I really question the leadership of the Navy. I
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:38.400]  question people that come out of the Navy and end up, you know, on TV or whatever. But
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:44.240]  hey, look, I had grandparents that served in the Navy. I'm not an anti-Navy guy.
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:48.560]  I'm a pro-Navy guy. I don't like, well, how is it that the Navy can't control to keep their
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:53.040]  submarines from crashing into one another and crashing into rocks and docking
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:58.640]  when China is invading the South China Sea? It all seems coincidental. And now they just,
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:03.040]  oh, submarine just, oh, we just hit a random object in the South China Sea. We don't know
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:09.200]  what's happening. And so now this major naval station, this major naval submarine
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:13.600]  in the South China Sea is basically, they say, oh, we didn't suffer much. But I mean,
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:17.520]  you know, it's not a normal commission. And what is China doing? China is trying to invade India.
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.680]  China is trying to invade Taiwan. China is trying to invade Hong Kong. And now our naval vessel
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:25.440]  in the South China Sea just, oh, it just hit an object. We don't know what happened. I just hit
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:32.880]  an object with all the technology. Eleven sailors injured after Navy submarine struck
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:40.640]  object in Indo-Pacific region in the South China Sea. And the U.S. has now is now deploying troops
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:44.880]  into Taiwan. Apparently they've been there for a while, but they're now apparently going to be
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:50.560]  there permanently. So what is going on in the South China Sea? What is going on with the Navy?
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.560]  What is going on with India? What is going on in Afghanistan? What is going on on our southern
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.520]  border? Ask Biden. He doesn't have a clue. The average person on the face of this incredible
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:06.080]  planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:10.640]  and the globalist on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:14.560]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK,
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:18.960]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:23.120]  That's why they launched their great recess. And their program after collapsing us
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:31.040]  have built back better. This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:35.760]  economy. And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left,
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.760]  which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:48.000]  weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  They can't maybe because of our free speech and our guns. So the global corporate
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.880]  combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:02.640]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:09.360]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:15.760]  It's called PQQ or bio PQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:20.640]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer. It doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:24.960]  longer in the space for the same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:31.520]  to get. Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months. It's back in stock, the highest quality

[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:03.840]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:09.440]  enslavement. In that documentary, I predicted the globalist would establish world government
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:15.040]  a releasing of virus, demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering a
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:20.640]  collapse of our industrial society. And now they've done it. How did I know they would do it? Because
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.760]  they wrote books and white papers, and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:30.960]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab,
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:35.440]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were at need planning to launch
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:40.400]  this great reset. Well, we're now living in it. The purposeful collapse of the third world and the
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:45.440]  first world, not attached to the tyrannical corporate world government, the total censorship,
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:50.800]  no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally more and more deadly
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:56.640]  injections of poison, masquerading as vaccines to poisonous and depopulated. This is what info
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:02.720]  wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future. So the placebo that they have used that the FDA
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:09.680]  has allowed them to use has often been another vaccine, a vaccine with a known adverse reaction
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:17.360]  profile that's causing death and damage in its own right. That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:23.840]  the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin, a known poison in human beings that is in the
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:30.640]  supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate. This is not good science. It is not science at all.
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:36.720]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to the vaccines so that they can get
[1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:43.680]  through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market. That is the only
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:49.840]  concern. Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, COVIDland. Secure your copy

[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:35.120]  We're back live on the Alex Jones show. Owen Schreuer sitting in here and Rand Paul warns Americans
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:42.800]  be afraid of your government says watch list of dissenters already exists. Absolutely. And isn't
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:48.960]  that sad that we have to fear our government? I believe it was Thomas Jefferson that said
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:55.520]  when the people fear the government, there's tyranny. When the government fears the people,
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:02.240]  there's freedom. Well, which side of the spectrum are we on with that famous quote right now? Well,
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:08.640]  Rand Paul understands it. I think a lot of people in this audience probably understand it a little
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:16.000]  too well. And we're kind of in this holding pattern right now of, you know, not really sure
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:19.760]  of how to even respond to it or react to it. We've never seen a government this corrupt,
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:26.880]  this out of control, this authoritarian, this totalitarian in US history, being aimed against
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:31.520]  the people, being weaponized against the people, our tax dollars being weaponized against us,
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:37.200]  our government being weaponized against us. And something's going to have to give because either
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:41.680]  the Republican leadership or leadership that doesn't want to see America go into full tyranny
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:46.240]  is going to have to kick it into high gear, or this country is done for all its intensive purposes.
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:53.280]  Rob Schneider gets it, one of the few Hollywood actors who's not a total sellout. White House says
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:57.360]  turning this country into something similar to the former Soviet Union is not off the table.
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:08.320]  Now we're already there, actually. And it's only getting worse, actually. And see people like Rick
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:13.680]  Wilson are angry. And I haven't really looked further into this. I just saw this tweet that he
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:20.160]  put out. He is really upset. He says this is horrible news. He says the January 6 Commission
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:26.400]  is dead and will not enforce any subpoenas. And he says that's because that is a victory for Trump.
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:30.640]  No, that's a victory for America. That's a victory against tyranny. But let me move on.
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:35.520]  I shouldn't even get into this. It's just it shows you
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:40.800]  where these people come from. And apparently the government says they're afraid of First Amendment
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:47.360]  applications and this or implications, excuse me, and this upsets Rick Wilson. And then he
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:52.400]  talks about January 6, like it was some sort of violent mob killing people or burning things to
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:58.240]  the ground. He must have that confused. I think Rick Wilson has January 6 confused with the summer
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:04.080]  of 2020. When thousands of police officers were hospitalized, dozens of people were murdered,
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:10.000]  and two billion dollars of property damage was done. No calls or a commission, no investigation.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.240]  In fact, the FBI and Merrick Garland came out this week and said, no, we're not investigating
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:17.920]  those groups. We're not investigating any of the crimes or any of the murder or any of the looting
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:22.400]  or any of the arson that happened in the summer of 2020. No, we're not investigating any of that.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:29.360]  No. So Rick Wilson must have the summer of 2020 confused with January 6. No, Rick Wilson knows
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:37.200]  exactly what's going on. He's a fraud. He's a liar. He's Rick Wilson. He's a Democrat.
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:45.120]  And I guess Brett Baer is upset to hear this too. Brett Baer went on with Stephen Colbert,
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:51.520]  and he talked about how bad January 6 was, and he sold his new book that was supposed to be about
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:59.840]  Ulysses S. Grant's life, former president, but it turned out just to be about January 6. So that's
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:07.600]  Brett Baer of Fox News. Heard he plays good golf though. By the way, Trump, this is kind of a
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:12.480]  week. Honestly, I didn't really like what Molly Hemingway did with her piece. She apparently
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:16.800]  did an interview with Trump for basically three days on and off at Mar-a-Lago, spending hours with
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:22.480]  him. And as far as the information is concerned, it really delivers very little. Now I have to warn
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:28.800]  you, this is like a 30-page article. And guys, I don't even remember the headline. It's Molly
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:33.360]  Hemingway on the Federalist. It's like a 30-page article. I mean, it took me a while to read all
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:39.600]  of it. There's very little information even conveyed. It's almost her just writing a novel about
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:44.880]  what Mar-a-Lago and Trump is like, which, you know, there's some interest there. But you do get a
[1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:50.480]  little bit into Trump's head on some of these issues about the 2020 election and about Mitch
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:55.360]  McConnell. He basically called him a dumb F. And so there's some little, there's some little stuff
[1:51:55.360 --> 1:51:59.040]  in that, but you got to dig through this thing, man. It's like a needle in a haystack. I mean,
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:03.520]  she wrote a book. And you'd think there would have been more information on it, but it's more
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:08.880]  just a relishing of her time at Mar-a-Lago and what that was like. So there's maybe something
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:17.360]  there for you if you want to check that out. But figured I'd let you know about that. But hey,
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:23.200]  Biden is continuing to destabilize not just the planet. Maybe he, maybe he has something to do
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:27.280]  with that. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe he just is totally out of control of everything.
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:34.560]  But he is collapsing our economy. In fact, here's the new story. And then I'll play the clip, guys,
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:42.880]  of the CNBC reacting to these numbers live on air. It's yeah, September's job, September's jobs report
[1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:51.040]  badly misses expectations with payrolls increasing by just 194,000. So yeah, all they had these big
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:55.280]  pipe frames of the economy coming back and Biden fixing the economy and he's going to save
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:00.320]  and everything. And it's been a complete disaster. Consumer price index continues to skyrocket.
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:05.200]  The price of energy continues to skyrocket. You can't even, they're not, they're not even
[1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:12.400]  manufacturing stuff anymore. Cargo ships, oil ships still sitting in the, in the bays and in the,
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:17.120]  in the gulfs and off the, off the coasts waiting to be delivered. And the Biden administration
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:21.520]  won't allow it because of all the COVID regulations. And who knows if Biden even has a clue of any of
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:27.680]  this. So here is in clip one, the CNBC panel reacting to this awful jobs report.
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:33.040]  Things are coming down pretty rapidly. We just have this jobs report. Steve, what do you see?
[1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:43.920]  194. Whoa. I see 194,000. That is real low. And then as he's reading it, the stock market is tanking
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:50.720]  as the jobs report comes out, literally the stock market tanks. It's actually funny. It was up all
[1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:59.840]  day. The jobs report comes out and it drops like a water slide straight down. So that's what you're
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:07.520]  going to get there. But hey, if you work in big pharma, you're doing great, man. You are just
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:18.000]  doing great. Moderna's founders debut on Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans. Wow. How did
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:29.440]  they do that? Who could have seen that coming? Mandating vaccines and Biden buying billions of
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:33.680]  vaccines before we even know if they work and then some of them get recalled and then you're told you
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:39.520]  have to get three and four. Oh, and now the big pharmaceutical founders of Moderna are the richest
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:45.440]  people in America. Who could have seen that coming? Who could have seen Pfizer stock skyrocketing and
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:52.800]  Pfizer making billions of dollars during the COVID? Scandemic. Who could have seen any of this coming?
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:55:00.080]  That's some shocking stuff right there. Elizabeth Warren, believe it or not, is one of the few that
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.400]  actually gets this issue. It's kind of a separate side of the issue, but it's still the same.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:10.960]  It's the same coin. The American people have a right to know that leaders in Washington are
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:16.720]  making decisions in the country's interest, not their own financial interest. It's long past
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:21.200]  time to ban members of Congress, cabinet secretaries, federal judges, and other top officials from
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:28.160]  trading stocks. And I would add, and also lobbying. Lobbying should almost be illegal,
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:36.240]  but I'm a free market absolutist, so I wouldn't do that. But that's also part of the corruption,
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:41.600]  too, is the lobbying. But so Elizabeth Warren gets it. And actually, in Molly Hemingway's
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:45.040]  article about Trump, Trump was actually praising Elizabeth Warren for a couple things. He said
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:48.480]  he liked her better than Warren, or excuse me, better than, he liked Elizabeth Warren better
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:57.760]  than McConnell. So that's all going on, ladies and gentlemen. And in a thumb your nose to Elon
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:02.880]  Musk, the government of California basically told Elon Musk to get bent because, you know,
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:08.080]  he's not a good communist. So he said, okay, and he's up and now moved Tesla headquarters to
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:13.600]  Austin, Texas. So Elon Musk has completely abandoned the sinking hellhole of Democrat run
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:19.600]  communist California. And he's now got SpaceX and Tesla in Texas, SpaceX, by the way, I think
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:27.200]  just got reported worth $100 billion today. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a brand new product
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:33.200]  that we are excited about. It's going to be up at info wars store.com. Now we've sold privacy
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:40.800]  pockets for a long time. You've seen them. And they're great. They work. But what we like to do
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:45.200]  is have the best on the market. And the problem is, we've never really been able to source out the
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:49.920]  best privacy pockets or Faraday cages for your phone on the market, because it's hard to find
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:55.360]  everything that's made in America. So just out of a rush, we low, we put our label on the privacy
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:59.600]  pouches that we have that work great. And they're fine. But they're kind of a little more, they're
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:03.120]  not the, they're not the best on the market. Let's just put it that way. It works. It's fine.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:07.440]  It's got our logo on it. It's about 20 bucks. It's cheap. But it's not the best on the market.
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:15.600]  Well, we've now done it. We now have the best cell phone or laptop or tablet,
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:25.600]  tablet, Faraday enclosures for your cell phone on the market. It is the silent pocket right here.
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:32.720]  And it is now on sale at info wars store.com. So many different options now. So we'll still sell
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:37.120]  the old privacy pouches that we sold, but they're not as high quality as this. This is, and by the
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:43.200]  way, 100% made in America. This is every, every piece of this, everything that puts it together,
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:47.040]  100% made in America, the new privacy pocket at info wars store.com.
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:57.120]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:02.800]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:09.680]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge. It is the
[1:58:09.680 --> 1:58:16.160]  symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:24.320]  of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:31.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:36.560]  upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:42.160]  of the world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:49.360]  better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance. You'd have to be
[1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:55.600]  hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and other essential vitamins
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:00.960]  and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems. We don't have them. Long term,
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:06.240]  we die. But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:13.440]  are recommended, if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep, your body will fall apart even faster.
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:18.000]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture and life,
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.880]  it's hard to settle down. It's hard to relax. Well, let me tell you something right now.
[1:59:21.440 --> 1:59:26.880]  Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound. It's got over eight compounds in it
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:31.440]  that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep. And it's such a game changer. So with all the vitamins
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:38.800]  and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out available again at m4worshore.com for 50%
[1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:42.640]  off. And you know what? I'm going to keep it 50% off until it sells out, even though we've already
[1:59:42.640 --> 2:00:01.840]  sold out a half of it in just the last month. And we probably are going to have more for about five months.
[2:00:01.840 --> 2:00:13.280]  Third hour of the Alex Jones show, we're about to be joined in studio by a very special guest
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:17.200]  doctor to talk about some of the latest with the COVID madness and the vaccines. But first,
[2:00:17.200 --> 2:00:23.200]  I want to play this clip from Representative Biggs. He had a Maricopa County official who was,
[2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:31.440]  well, let's just say not cooperating with the election audit and said a lot of things
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:37.040]  before he was in front of Congress, said a lot of things on Twitter. But now that he's under
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:42.640]  oath in Congress, his tune has changed all of a sudden. And some pretty big revelations here,
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:46.480]  as more Republicans are starting to realize that there was a lot of shady business that went on
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:51.440]  in the 2020 election. Trump is very akin to it as well. You could tell that in the Molly Hemingway
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:55.680]  article. I think that she could have, maybe she's saving actually some of the juice from that for
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:01:01.120]  another story. But here's Representative Biggs grilling a Maricopa County official on his
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:04.960]  double speak when it came to the 2020 election audit. Here it is.
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:07.760]  Let's start with Mr. Bennett and then we'll go, we'll try to work on that so everybody can get
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:13.520]  there. Is it standard practice to delete files off a server after an election, Mr. Bennett?
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:19.440]  I hope not. So Mr. Gates, will you agree with that?
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:28.240]  I would say that it is appropriate to maintain files. And that's exactly what we did. We deleted
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:34.400]  the deleted files that have been discussed. They were archived. So you admit that you guys did
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:40.400]  delete, Maricopa County did delete files off the server after the election. That are archived?
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:50.560]  Yeah. And so when you released these servers and this information to the auditors to begin with,
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:54.880]  they didn't have access to those archived files at first. Is that fair to say?
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:02:02.480]  They did not subpoena those. That's correct. Okay. So you didn't feel obligated to turn that over
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:08.080]  then to them? We responded to the subpoena. Okay. Mr. Bennett, your response to that?
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:17.600]  I find it frankly laughable to suggest that a county in response to a subpoena
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:25.120]  could say we will delete files from the hard drives and materials that we give to the auditors
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:32.640]  because we have those files archived on data that we did not give to the auditors when the
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:37.520]  subpoena said turn over all the records related to the election. Yes. See, that's the way I read
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:45.600]  the subpoena. It's more broadly than the county read it for sure. So your Twitter account mentions
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:50.480]  that the purging of the 2020 election database in the beginning of February is a standard practice.
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:54.720]  Can you please confirm for me that that's what you do for all elections after all elections
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:58.800]  that you do that? I cannot confirm that for you today, but we can certainly get you that answer,
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:03.280]  Congressman. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, can you confirm that today or not?
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:12.160]  I really can't confirm that either today. I just know that because there is limited space on these
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:18.160]  servers, when you have to run another election, then you have to make room for the additional
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:26.880]  election data. So was there additional, was there still, well, let me just rephrase this.
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:31.920]  If that is the standard practice, which is kind of, I don't think you guys are saying that you
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:36.880]  know for sure, but you're, the Chairman just intimated that that's the case. Can you explain
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:41.760]  to me why data was still present for prior elections on the databases in and of itself?
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:49.360]  Yeah, again, I don't have any answer to that question, but we'll certainly get you an answer
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:55.600]  for it, Congressman. Okay. All right. I would appreciate if you would give me that information.
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:04:02.000]  And I do think that it's important that our recorder has suggested that he will be answering
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:09.840]  every question in a timely fashion. That's the same recorder that campaigned that Adrian Fontes
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:15.200]  was incompetent and called him a criminal. And he was the guy that was running the 2020 election,
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:20.560]  and that's, and you actually hired someone to oversee Mr. Fontes because you guys didn't
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:24.160]  trust Mr. Fontes as well. Is that the same guy? Is that same Stephen Richard?
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:32.480]  Yeah, I wouldn't put it, I wouldn't put it that way exactly, but what we did was we did have
[2:04:32.480 --> 2:04:37.600]  statutory in boards, as you know, Congressman boards of supervisors have responsibility for
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:43.120]  election day operations. And we took that back so that we would have four Republicans and two
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:46.160]  Democrats overseeing the 2020 election we thought.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.800]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world. It's very, very
[2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:07.600]  simple, but the most people don't know. The privately owned central banks of the world
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:15.040]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using
[2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:22.400]  them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy. They're using it to buy people,
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:28.640]  to buy influence. And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage
[2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:33.280]  that manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:38.400]  or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:43.680]  every sector of the world economy buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:48.880]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:53.760]  they do fund the only things left standing. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:59.200]  Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:14.960]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host,
[2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:16.320]  Owen Troyer.
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:24.560]  And I am joined in studio by Lynn Davenport, who is going to be breaking some news right now.
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:29.760]  A lot of people may or may not be asking, but it's a pretty much a fundamental question. When
[2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:34.400]  you hear the talk about mandatory vaccines, well, how is this going to be implemented? How is this
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:39.520]  going to be rolled out? How can we accept this? And then how can it actually be put into practice?
[2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:44.720]  And so Lynn is here to break some of that down. And there's kind of already some hints out there
[2:06:44.720 --> 2:06:53.120]  about it with the patent 0202060606 talking about using implantable blockchain technology
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:57.200]  into humans, working that in with vaccines, working that in with the social credit system,
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:02.640]  working that in with the digital currency. So I guess perhaps that is the plan. But what can
[2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:09.200]  you tell us about how blockchain technology is a potential implication when it comes to
[2:07:09.200 --> 2:07:15.360]  mandatory COVID vaccines or vaccine passports? Well, I think the the greatest threat is that
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:21.680]  we are going to be on blockchain. So we talk about it as a vehicle to hold our currency.
[2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:25.440]  But when you think about it in terms of our children being on blockchain,
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:30.320]  and they'll do it through the public school system. So in Texas, Texas is a target because
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:36.320]  we educate one tenth of America's kids. And so think about it in terms of numbers across the
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:45.360]  country. So in Dallas, we have this is a blockchain contract that was set up through Dallas ISD,
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:50.560]  through the Education Service Centers, which they're all across the state. And that's how they
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:56.160]  implement resources. And really, that's another way that the teachers are indoctrinated is through
[2:07:56.160 --> 2:08:01.360]  the Education Service Centers. Then you have the Dallas Community College District. But it's not
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:07.360]  just the Dallas College District, you'll see it across community colleges across the state. So
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:15.760]  it's pitched as this convenient way to store your transcript, to access your transcripts.
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:23.280]  And your diploma and your credentials, you can also store your health data on there. So they will
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:28.640]  be storing children's mental health data. So the contract was done through Greenlight Credentials.
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:33.040]  And that was a, it's a for profit company. So when they pitch blockchain, they'll talk about it
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:39.520]  being this open source deal, you own your own data, and you will be in charge of your data,
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:45.360]  you own it. So therefore, no one can have access to it unless you get a grant them authority.
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:51.200]  Well, that's if this is a, it's not an open source deal. It was a deal done behind the scenes,
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:09:00.240]  a no bid deal done in Dallas with this, it's really an ecosystem of players that are all connected
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:05.280]  in different ways. Now you say no big contracts. A lot of people understand that, but some people
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:11.440]  don't explain why that's so key. Well, because there's no competition, there's no open bidding.
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:17.120]  And so basically you can steer a contract. Now sometimes they can get around that by saying,
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:21.040]  okay, sure, we'll open it up to all these, but they already know who they're gonna, they've already
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:24.800]  established, but they're not even going through that dog and pony show anymore. They're just
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:28.720]  saying, yeah, we're just going to give it to our cronies. Yeah. And then they can charge whatever
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:34.720]  they want. They can do that because so if you, if you look at, and this is bipartisan, so I think
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:40.560]  that's important for the listeners to understand is that you can't pin this on one party or the
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:45.600]  other. So we've got Governor Greg Abbott, who signed two bills in the legislature on blockchain.
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:49.200]  Yay, we're going to bring blockchain. Texas is going to be, Texas is going to be a leader in
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:55.360]  blockchain. And so he signed two bills that were done by conservative legislators. I saw
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:10:00.800]  Tan Parker at the blockchain conference here in Austin just earlier this morning, he was speaking.
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:06.160]  And Ted Cruz is speaking at this event. And so they talk about, you know, we want to be on the
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:10.560]  cutting edge here and this is going to be, you know, we're, Texas is going to be a leader,
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:15.120]  but they don't understand that when Governor Abbott also signed a bill saying that we're not
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:21.200]  going to, or we're going to punish businesses who bring in blockchain, I mean, who bring in vaccine
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:25.200]  passports, but that's going to be done on blockchain. So it's really an empty platitude,
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:30.080]  if you think about it. So that seems to be kind of the, that's like, that should be Abbott's slogan,
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:34.800]  actually, maybe empty platitudes, empty platitudes. And you know, here's what, because I'm not a
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:39.920]  Luddite. I'm more of a conservative when it comes to technological advancements. I like to see them
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:44.720]  rolled out. I may not want to take part in it until I see, you know, how it goes. But you know,
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:50.000]  I can see the benefits of blockchain and I can see the pitfalls of it as well. And when you talk
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.640]  about the vaccine passports being done on blockchain and then putting other health records in there,
[2:10:54.640 --> 2:10:57.600]  or I guess you're talking about educational records too, I guess, you know, you could put a
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:02.560]  report card in there, a diploma or whatever. Now there's no privacy. There's no, there's no refusal
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:06.160]  is what it is. So you think, oh, this is convenient. They sell it as a convenience.
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:11.360]  But really what it, what it equals is no privacy, no refusal, because someone will always,
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:15.600]  everybody says, oh, no, everything's private. It'll be private folks. Get real. Okay. Let's
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:20.480]  live in the real world here. Nothing is a perfect system. So blockchain, it will be hackable. It
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:25.840]  will be, you know, there will be pitfalls of it. And now you'll be there and you won't be able to
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.040]  refuse it because it'll all be digital. So you say, Hey, you can't, I don't want you to access
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:33.920]  that. Well, too bad it's all digital. I have access to it. Right. It's pitched as this immutable,
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:39.360]  unhackable. It's the panacea. It's, it's this utopia. So you don't have to deal with the bursar's
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:45.920]  office and the, the, the school office or losing paperwork or, you know, so, oh gosh, that just
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:50.320]  clunky stuff that you have to carry. That's so obnoxious and privacy, privacy is obnoxious to
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:56.640]  the government too. Well, exactly. And I do a lot of research on student data and privacy. And
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:12:03.520]  that's being violated all over the place. But so if you think about your right to informed consent,
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:08.480]  let's talk about conformed consent, there is none. So you're basically entered into this system.
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:13.440]  And you don't, you're not given the full picture here. And, and the fact that it's a for-profit
[2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:19.920]  company and that you have the, the, you have the guy that the, the TEA commissioner appointed to
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:24.720]  the education service center, who is the founder of this company blockchain and this green light
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:30.320]  credential. But you know what, let's, let's actually lay the groundwork here because, so, so how
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:34.800]  exactly is this going to be implemented in schools? Like what, what is, what is the presentation?
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:41.120]  What is the actual execution of this in schools? Well, so the deal done with Dallas ISD. So it,
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:46.960]  it is pitched as, okay, you, now you can access your transcripts easily through green light.
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.440]  And so you go onto the website. So that's just like a website with a cloud of information,
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:57.360]  basically. Correct. Okay. Yes. And so it's, they call it a locker. And, and so this is your digital
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:02.080]  locker. Well, of course it's your locker. Okay. Yeah. That sounds like, you know, I had a locker
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:07.280]  in school. Sure. Modern school. That's cool. And then you've got your digital wallet. So I think,
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:15.280]  so if you look at how the data will be stored, they want to be, these schools want to be
[2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:23.360]  a central vaccination distribution center. So they tried to incentivize the teachers by paying
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:28.480]  them, bribing them to get the vaccine. They're also doing that with the students, they're bribing
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:33.040]  them in Dallas ISD. By the way, I have this story right here. The mayor of Austin, somewhere in my
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:40.480]  stack, is now bribing people $50 to get the vaccine. Come get the vaccine. You can give $50,
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:46.160]  but hold out folks might be 100 next week, just saying, right, bread and circuses. So
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:50.160]  you can get people to do just about anything by dangling the money, but especially when you've
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:53.360]  told them they can't work or have a business anymore, then then, you know, then they're desperate.
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:57.120]  You can't go to a concert either. And so they're already doing that with vaccines
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:02.720]  and the concerts. You have to show proof. So that is, so basically the threat is,
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:06.720]  they put the kids and all their information on blockchain. You will not be able to access
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:11.680]  the public schools. You will not be able to go to concerts. You will not be able to work
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:15.520]  and buy and sell and trade. And I guess, I guess, I guess the difference here is,
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:19.360]  because that's what I'm trying. I want people to really understand the real flavor of this,
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:24.160]  because even when I was in school, we had, we had digital platforms and stuff, but this is
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:29.680]  centralized, but this is centralized. Like this is all centralized. Like when I was doing it,
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:34.320]  it was a private school and all your stuff was on that one server. The private school ran the
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:37.520]  server and they did what they wanted with that information and you were in control of your
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:43.520]  account. This is a centralized system that the whole state, at least in this level, at this
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:47.040]  point would have access to. Eventually the goal is obviously the whole planet.
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.760]  Yeah. And they'll do it through these, these longitudinal data systems, which they're not
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:57.280]  supposed to be connecting those state by state. That's actually a violation of your privacy,
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:02.720]  but that's where they're headed. And so that data is, is being stored. I mean, Texas has
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:09.120]  mined more student data than any other state. We are, I mean, we are our ground zero here.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:14.480]  And see, of course, now this company can sell that data, just like Facebook sells their data or
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.360]  your data, I guess I should say, Twitter sells your data, Google sells your data. Now this,
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:24.480]  they'll also be able to sell your data. Oh yeah, student data, that's a hot commodity. And, and
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:33.120]  if you look at, it was under Obama, executive order 12866, they basically gutted FERPA, which is
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:39.600]  Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. And so now any, any entity under, in the name of
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:45.200]  education research can now have access to private student data. And this one is how convenient.
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:49.440]  Yeah. And the, all right, so we got to go to a break, but the government wants you to have a
[2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:54.640]  digital locker now so they can reach into it and get anything they want out of it at any time. Nice.
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:15:59.360]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:04.800]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:10.400]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:16.240]  provide life-saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:22.800]  run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:27.520]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:32.880]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. Even better, all this week,
[2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:39.840]  radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:45.520]  more and check availability. That's mysolarbackup.com. Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:51.840]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.

[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:02.320]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate a compound
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:10.000]  that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts. It's called PQQ,
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:15.600]  or biopQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things. It actually makes your
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:20.640]  telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer, the space for the same
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:26.160]  thing. So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get. Well, DNA Force Plus has
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:33.280]  been sold out for six months. It's back in stock, the highest quality PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:38.960]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your body last longer, and that
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:44.800]  is so incredibly important. We have it at 40% off, despite the fact it's been sold out for six months

[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:03.920]  God created each and every one of us with free will. When we look at the world system now,
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:09.520]  openly announcing the Mark of the Beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:15.680]  rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:23.600]  productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them. They want control of
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:28.960]  procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women. They want to bring a form
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:36.000]  of living death to our society and our civilization. All of us were formed and made in God's mind,
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:41.440]  in God's image, and given free will. And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:46.800]  God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:20:12.080]  and stand against evil. And then for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:27.280]  All right, this is amazing. Just during the break, kind of off topic, talking to Lynn Davenport,
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:32.320]  my guest here, just about the indoctrination that's going on at schools. And we're going to get back
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:39.760]  into the topic of discussion, but it really is amazing. As you said, I think for the first time,
[2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:44.000]  at least in my lifetime, I don't know if it's ever been like this before, parents are looking at the
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:50.720]  public school situation. And for the first time, like leaning on the side of, I don't want my kids
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:55.200]  ever in public schools. I don't think that that's ever been the case before like it is now. I could
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:21:00.560]  be wrong about that. But it seems to me like that is seemingly the case. And so when it comes to this
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:07.520]  blockchain technology, is this something that you could also avoid when it comes to data mining and
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:12.720]  having your students or your kids' information being in the centralized hub of information on
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:17.280]  the blockchain? Is this something where, again, like pulling them out of public schools or putting
[2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:22.800]  them into private school, that could be an out to this? Sure. I mean, the best way to stop this is
[2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:27.520]  to starve the beast. So you could pull your kids out. And I mean, because all they really care
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:33.040]  about is the butts in the seat funding. They get money for every child that's in the classroom.
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:36.320]  And then they get more money when they sell the data for every child, too.
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:41.840]  Absolutely. And so, yes, you can starve the beast by that. And you can also opt out of,
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:46.000]  I mean, there are options to opt out. There are a lot of parents in my district. I'm in Richardson,
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:50.960]  ISD, even though I live in Dallas. The parents are opting out of social emotional learning
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:22:00.400]  lessons and social and emotional learning technologies. So you can do that, too. So there
[2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:07.360]  are ways of just asking, okay, I'm not endorsing that. I don't condone that. And you can opt out.
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:12.720]  Now, in the private schools, I think there's this misconception that the private schools are
[2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:20.960]  a viable alternative. But they are also being included in all of this education technology
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:26.880]  that is targeting their emotions. They will also go for the convenient blockchain wallets.
[2:22:28.080 --> 2:22:32.080]  Well, now that I think about it, it almost makes more sense for the private schools to adopt it
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:37.840]  first simply because they can spend the money and sell the data easier than the public school
[2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:41.680]  probably could because they have to jump through more red tape and more hoops. But getting back
[2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:46.480]  to the issue, so it's basically a centralized locker, if you will, for high school students or
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:50.960]  college students, where all their records are there on a blockchain and they sell it as convenient.
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:55.840]  But it's like centralizing any activity on the internet that then that company can sell.
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:23:01.760]  And this is what they want to do. What are your biggest concerns about this as it's being rolled
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:06.800]  out here in Texas and presented here in Texas? Your kids are going to be perhaps even part of
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:10.320]  this blockchain system if they implement it. What are your biggest concerns about this?
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:18.800]  Well, I think that they will be able to control us if we are not allowed to participate in things.
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:24.080]  So it's, you know, you want to opt your kid out of this if that is the situation, but it's not
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:30.000]  just going to happen in the public schools. And so I'm trying to sound the alarm that we don't want
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:38.880]  blockchain technologies without a full discussion of the unintended consequences. So fine, if you,
[2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:43.120]  you know, I met a bunch of people last night at the conference, the blockchain conference here in
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:49.440]  Austin, where they have these this couple and they're Bitcoin miners. Well, they know nothing
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:54.000]  about this stuff. And they've never even thought about it. They just know cryptocurrency. Yes.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:24:00.400]  And so we need to understand the full picture here. And I think they don't understand that.
[2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:06.480]  Also, how are they going to impose the global currency? Or, you know, if you want to be able
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:12.560]  to travel to a foreign country, all of that is going to be done through one digital, one system
[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:19.440]  that is blocked, I mean, blockchains it, that's how they're going to do it. So how do we move into
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  the future and stay innovative while also protecting ourselves? I don't know that we can really do this
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:35.680]  without the unintended consequences. I can't see it working. This is how they will do it.
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:42.000]  Well, that's kind of my biggest fear with anything is centralization of power, because it removes
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:47.040]  the personal experience between, say, where you might have an issue, you go right to the
[2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:51.440]  principle of a school or whatever, to now it's, well, you know, I'm going to an issue with this
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:55.040]  blockchain or something. And the person you're supposed to go talk to is on the other side of
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.280]  the planet. And you got to make 10 phone calls just to get ahold of them. And maybe you're lucky
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:03.920]  if you can leave a voicemail that ever gets read. So it kind of takes that personal, you know,
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:07.680]  peer to peer experience out of the schooling system, which we've seen in so many other cases.
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:13.360]  It takes that localized experience makes it now on a planetary scale. And it just makes it more
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:17.840]  difficult to operate. And so like you said, you are forced to go through your forced to walk in
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:22.720]  the straight line. If you if you if you go sideways, you're either out and there's no repercussion
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:27.920]  for the people that are running the system. Well, and it's pitched as decentralization.
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:33.840]  So that's the ironic piece of it. Yeah, I don't see that. It's the most centralized thing you
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:39.920]  could imagine a digital locker for all students. That's the irony. And so I think there are those
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:46.640]  who like I talked to the leader of the conference last night, we went to a barbecue dinner. And
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:53.440]  and she said, wait a minute. So, you know, we're trying to do we're trying to decentralize and
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:26:00.480]  put you in charge of your own data. But with a for profit deal that's done in the public schools
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:07.040]  for blockchain for the kids, that is not decentralization. That is actually a captive
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:14.000]  market. And they will, they will turn a profit on this deal. And it's, it's massive. So it's
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.840]  scaled across the state and then the country, it's massive. What happened to the old saying,
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:21.840]  if it ain't broke, don't fix it. It sounds like we're fixing something that's not broke here.
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:26.560]  Well, they would say it is broke, because like I mentioned before, so you have to carry around
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:31.120]  and like, what if you lose your social security card? Or what if you lose your ID? Now you can
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.680]  just have it. And well, before it's embedded in our skin, it's going to be a cure. Yeah, that's
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:41.440]  the ultimate goal. Right. And so they'll, you know, I thought, okay, I get called a 10 full hat
[2:26:41.440 --> 2:26:45.920]  conspiracy theorists all the time. And so I thought, where better to go share this information?
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:51.920]  You know, because you, you all get called that all the time. That's that it is, it is absolutely
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:57.280]  going to happen. They're already doing it. And so we're all we're doing is calling into light.
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:03.280]  What is they tell us what they're doing? So in your eyes, this is part of the larger
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:08.400]  global plan to get all humans into this digital system of the currency and the social credit
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:13.200]  score and the vaccine passports. But you're focusing on this approach, you're focused
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.360]  focusing on this penetration of our privacy and our freedoms in the schools. Because I guess
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:22.000]  that's true. I mean, it has to be an all out assault on all aspects of civilization if they
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.560]  really want to pull this off. Yes. And so they have to start at the local level. And so this,
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:32.000]  so I wanted you to be able to see what is a concrete example of how it's going to come in
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:37.120]  and at the local level. And, and, you know, I just happened to be here in Austin. It's perfect
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:45.200]  timing for this whole blockchain push, Ted Cruz, the Wyoming Senator Cynthia Loomis, she's a big
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:52.320]  blockchain proponent. So Texas and Wyoming are two of the biggest champions and they're the leaders
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:58.640]  in blockchain. So, but, but so parents, I mean, you know, politics is local. And although you
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:05.200]  do a great job here on this show talking about global issues, and you in particular talk about
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:10.880]  more of the local stuff. So I think being able to see these contracts coming in through the school
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:16.080]  districts, the contracts, the data sharing agreements, the memorandums of understanding, if you,
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:19.680]  you know, everyone's focusing on school boards right now. Well, and let's get to the,
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:22.960]  let's get to the vaccine passports angle. But this is why I think it's so important what you're
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:28.400]  doing. And it's not even if you fail, there is no failure in this, because at some point,
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:31.200]  you're going to look back and you're going to try to figure out how did all this happen? Well,
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:34.640]  you're laying it all out right now. I'm going to tell you, it's right here. So that's why, you know,
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:37.920]  when it gets to this point, and you're like, wait, the school system is all messed up, digital
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:42.800]  locker, passwords, you're selling my data, my kid can't go to class because he has a fever,
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:46.640]  like what in the heck is going on? This is how they're building it right now. So,
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:50.560]  so let's lay it all out tied in with the vaccine passport when we come back with Lynn Davenport.
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:56.640]  This is the Alex Jones show on infowars.com and band.video. If you're concerned about the power
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:01.680]  grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity, this will be the most
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:07.520]  important message you'll hear this year. Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:12.800]  back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide a life saving backup power when you
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:19.040]  need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes,
[2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:24.480]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:29.280]  weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through

[2:30:56.400 --> 2:31:01.680]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:06.880]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on
[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:11.680]  your show and I listened to it. So, the first one I got was the original Survival Shield X1. And
[2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:16.080]  it worked pretty good. And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with X2. You had, you know, with a
[2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:20.560]  deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So, I took it and then in two weeks,
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:26.560]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think
[2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:32.000]  again. I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.960]  health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing
[2:31:36.960 --> 2:31:41.600]  supplements. The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:46.320]  It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break
[2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:51.120]  free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:57.840]  hand. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed. So, if you understand
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:04.320]  that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental. It's never been given to human
[2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:11.840]  beings before. Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human
[2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:18.560]  beings before. There are no long term studies. We don't know what's going to happen inside your body
[2:32:18.560 --> 2:32:25.120]  somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection or four to six months or even two years.
[2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:30.960]  We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer,
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:36.160]  how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be. My conclusion after looking at this for a long
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:40.800]  time and listening to the arguments for these masks, I determined that if you believe, if you're a
[2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:46.080]  medical doctor or a scientist that is spouting using these masks, you're either being played or you're
[2:32:46.080 --> 2:32:52.560]  being paid. Secure your copy of Covidland today at covidland.com. If you order by October 6th,

[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:29.440]  and now your host, Owen Troyer. So you know, I guess I was a little bit wrong when I said if it
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:33.920]  ain't broke, don't fix it. And I guess record keeping, I don't think is broke, but the school
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:39.600]  system is broke in many ways. And that's because they're failing to educate students. There's
[2:33:39.600 --> 2:33:43.920]  probably a lot of different reasons you could point to is why the education factor of our
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:50.080]  education system is failing. But as my guest here, Lynn was explaining to me in the break,
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:53.200]  and I want you to read that paragraph that you're reading too, because I think it kind of,
[2:33:53.200 --> 2:33:57.280]  it explains a little bit better to the audience that may still try to understand what's going on.
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:04.000]  But it's basically like, well, the schools are failing as education centers right now.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:11.360]  Absolutely. And so what can we do to make schools relevant again? And what can we do to carry on
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:15.440]  this tradition of American schools and make it relevant and feasible for the government,
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:20.560]  the world government to still want to adapt it? And this is how they're doing it. It's by saying,
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:24.160]  hey, look, don't worry, we'll indoctrinate the kids. Yeah, they don't know math. They don't
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:28.640]  know history. They can barely read. Who cares about that anyway? That'll just make them more
[2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:32.320]  of a threat to the government if they can think for themselves. So let's just indoctrinate them
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:37.840]  and give them some free stuff, put them on, get them used to the digital currencies, get them
[2:34:37.840 --> 2:34:43.600]  used to the digital passports, the digital world. So when they come out of it, we already pretty
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:49.920]  much own them and control their fate. So talk about that. Yeah, well, in my district, 52% more
[2:34:49.920 --> 2:34:54.640]  than half the kids don't read on grade level. And I'll say don't because they could if they were
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:35:01.200]  taught properly, but they've abandoned their primary role in education is that that's academics.
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:07.040]  Keep the kids safe and educate them. They're not doing that. And so they're really focusing on
[2:35:07.040 --> 2:35:14.880]  social emotional learning, anything but education. But but they want to be this this community center
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:21.600]  rather than being known for academics, they want to be a hub for a place where you go for your
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:27.280]  mental health services, your vaccines, my superintendent, Dr. Jeannie Stone, she is pushing
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:33.120]  vaccines big time on the teachers and eventually the students are and were there any deaths from
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:38.720]  COVID in the school? So coincidentally, right before our school board meeting on Monday,
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:44.960]  we had they announced a death of a teacher who's had not two vaccines, but also had the third booster
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:50.400]  three vaccines. Yes. And she died. Sometimes it takes three. And by the way, I've got the
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:53.520]  same story here. I don't know if it's the same district that you're talking about.
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:59.440]  Where a teacher and a student died. See the Connelly Independent School District. Are you
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:04.560]  familiar with that? So this so this is a different district than Texas teen fourth from school
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:09.360]  district to dive COVID 19. And I looked into all these cases. And they and they say in each one
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:14.880]  vaccinating stat vaccination status unknown. That's a lie. They're all vaccinated. If they
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:19.120]  were not vaccinated, it would have been the headline. Unvaccinated people die. So so they were
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.400]  all vaccinated. They've all died. There was no outbreak in schools till post vaccine. But but
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:29.040]  I'm getting off topic because the vaccine's the variant. And that's a whole other show. Yeah.
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:35.440]  So okay, so back to this. So basically, this with green light, I'll just read you their words
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:40.560]  because I want to and this is IBM, by the way. Well, no, it's not IBM, but IBM will be doing
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:45.600]  blockchain. This is just a company that Oh, okay, got you a piece of blockchain. Got you.
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:52.560]  But IBM is another. Anyway, it's a green light locker eliminates multiple copies of transcripts,
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:57.360]  vaccination records or other documents. And that was from the founder Manage Cutty.
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:06.400]  And then the other the co founder is Eric Reeves. And Eric Reeves is on the board. That's the one
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:10.960]  I was saying that Mike Murath, the commissioner of education appointed to the board of the
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.200]  education service centers, where a lot of these contracts come through little conflict of interest
[2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:21.600]  there. Yes. And then there's vital six, which is the mental health records of green light
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:27.600]  locker. So that is where the health and the mental health data will be stored. So that is where I
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:35.040]  believe the vaccine passports will take root is through the health side of green light credentials.
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:38.480]  So you've got your academic piece, you've got your your health care piece.
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:45.920]  But in talking about how those schools, they want to be since they failed at their job of
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:50.240]  educating kids, now they're like, okay, we'll then we'll just be will be food distribution
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:56.080]  centers. We will be the the central place where parents and children can get their vaccines.
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:01.280]  It will be where they get their feminine products. I mean, everything will be distributed through
[2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:07.120]  the schools. And in my district, 60% of our kids are on free and reduced lunch. We also are a
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:14.720]  this is where a large number of the refugees are being resettled is in the DFW area. And so we have
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:21.760]  a ton of kids with serious needs. And so they're just going to abandon academics altogether,
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:27.280]  because yeah, in that department, this is actually a really key topic that a lot of people don't
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:31.680]  comprehend. And I just understand this a little bit better, because I worked in urban development
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:38.320]  in St. Louis and some schools there. So many, and maybe not in some of the more well off areas,
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:43.760]  but in the big population density areas, so many parents rely on the schools
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:48.640]  for everything basically for the kids to eat, for the kids have a place to go, they might not
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:52.880]  have a safe place to go. They might not even have anywhere to go that might not be a grandma or an
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.840]  aunt down the street, who's maybe not even there half the time. So so the schools have even been
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:03.120]  turned into basically daycares for these students that don't have anywhere else to go. And so,
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:06.720]  you know, they'll get government money for lunch, and they'll get government money for books and
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:12.400]  all that stuff. But this is an aspect of the control that the schools have have gotten over
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:18.400]  students' lives, simply because the parents can't do anything about it or they may not even be there.
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:24.640]  Well, and you bring up a great point. I mean, we definitely have a crisis here. I think we've got,
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:32.080]  I mean, I always talk about we need a daddy campaign, we need dads to get engaged and care
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:36.800]  for their children. That's it. Exactly. That's my point is that the school has become the daddy.
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:42.480]  Yeah. And so it's like, oh, you want to get lunch? Where's your vaccine passport? You want access to
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:49.840]  go to college? You better get on the green light locker. Yeah. Right. And so, you know, we've talked
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:55.280]  during the break about how there are these underserved populations, they're vulnerable
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:02.080]  populations. They're a target for impact investor social impact bonds. And these programs that come
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:08.160]  in at the local level, they don't call them that. It's a pay for success type of model.
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:14.240]  But like in Austin, ID 2020 was piloted here on homeless people. And that's the way that you can
[2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:22.240]  get the most vulnerable. Yes, the most vulnerable to agree to the terms, which if they want to receive
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:29.680]  services, food, healthcare, job assistance, all of that will come in through these programs.
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:35.600]  But those are adults who can consent if they ask questions. I'm talking about in the schools,
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.240]  this is a captive market of people who these are children who are preyed upon, fed into a system
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:44.960]  that they did not consent to, neither did their parents. But you think about the aspect of the
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:49.680]  homeless being tested on this. And by the way, when they did that, it was all denied. Info wars
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:54.640]  reported on it first. It was confirmed. And then they just said, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:40:58.400]  It doesn't exist. And then about two months later, they admitted it was all real. But it's the same
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.720]  thing. It's saying, okay, and they didn't quite go to this level yet. But it's saying, okay,
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:06.880]  you want to get the benefits at this homeless shelter down here, you're gonna, you're gonna
[2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:10.960]  have to put this microchip in your body, you're gonna have to sign up for this ID 2020. And at
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:15.120]  that point of the, you know, maybe a homeless person's life, they just figured, hey, whatever it
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:21.040]  takes to get a meal or, you know, whatever, this is just trying to bring it in onto the youth and
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:27.760]  just make it the normal thing for every generation after that. Sure. And people don't think to ask
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:35.360]  questions. Or if they, you know, I talked to sometimes the dads who are the most excited about
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.280]  these technologies, and they'll say, well, I don't have anything to hide. I mean, they can have my
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:43.360]  data. I don't have anything to hide. But they wouldn't hurt me. Right. I don't, I'm not doing
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:49.360]  anything that, you know, I don't care. But you know, that's, I, that response frustrates me because
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:53.600]  I think if they understood what we're really talking about here, I mean, we're going to be
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:41:59.280]  living in a panopticon. I mean, that's really, and I don't know if you've studied geofencing,
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:05.920]  but that the way that we will be controlled how we move about and, and go from even county to
[2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:12.000]  county or state to state or international travel, everything, everything will be, we will be controlled
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.520]  through this blockchain. Yeah, you'll basically be like your iPhone, like find my iPhone, except
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:23.120]  you'll be a person. You're right. Just, you know, a blip on the radar. Yes, exactly. And that's the
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:25.920]  key thing we should get into next. We're about to go to a break here because I have the same thing
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.520]  with friends that I talked to about the vaccines. And, you know, I don't like to peer pressure
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:34.240]  anybody take a vaccine or not. I just will say, Hey, you know, some of the stuff goes on with a
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.920]  vaccine. Are you aware of this? And I get so many times the vaccine makers wouldn't put a deadly
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:45.120]  vaccine out there. They wouldn't do that to us. Oh, the government wouldn't do that to us. Oh,
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:49.200]  if they, the media would covered if they would, well, who do you think owns the media and the
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:53.200]  government? Big pharma, they pay trillions of dollars to own these people. They're not going to
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:57.360]  be honest about it. Now they want to own the schools. If you think the tyranny and oppression
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:03.280]  we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID hand. And that's exactly what
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:09.520]  the COVID passports are all about. And clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:15.440]  own words. They admit that once they've got you with that system, then they're going to carbon
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:21.120]  tax you everywhere you go and track what you do. And publicly they're saying they're going to decide
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:26.640]  when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.440]  are currently announcing that are going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:37.520]  carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the takeover
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:42.480]  in humanity. Better wake up and say no. Finally folks are starting to wake up. Joe Rogan, Tucker
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:47.200]  Carlson, others will leave the charts along with info wars. But it's not enough. Every individual
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:51.680]  has to not comply. We have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice. You see,
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:58.320]  they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully back in stock down and out liquid
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:02.720]  sleep support. It's been out of stock for a while. It's one of three sleep aids we have at info
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:07.920]  war store.com. This one has been very popular. It's sold off the shelves. It's back in stock down
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:16.400]  and out liquid sleep support. This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:22.400]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great comes in pill form. This is the liquid tincture and I think
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:28.160]  this is probably the most powerful one. Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine. This is if you haven't
[2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:32.400]  done an iodine challenge yet, have you haven't done the iodine challenge? What are you waiting
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:38.880]  for now is the time super male and super female vitality living defense plus and the organic
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:44.240]  greens fiber caps. We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:48.480]  so we can order a new batch. It was very popular. The organic greens fiber caps, but we have all
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:54.880]  kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things. Take advantage of those.
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:02.240]  If your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every government on earth and who are
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:07.520]  trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper mobility, you've got to divide and conquer
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:12.400]  the public so they don't know they're being targeted. And that's why the Fortune 100 have
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:17.840]  wrapped themselves in the name of LBGT and African American rights and all the rest of it all over
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:23.120]  the world. That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:28.080]  China and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:33.760]  big tech and the central banks and other zone. So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:41.120]  new super class, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:44.880]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House,
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:51.600]  hell it's postal workers who are all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:55.760]  everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:02.560]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you
[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:08.880]  don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:14.560]  all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do. So in the future,
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:20.560]  under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting your
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:24.800]  credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.760]  that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com. We're

[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:24.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:27.520]  All right, last segment here with my guest in studio, Lynn Davenport. We're talking about so
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:31.840]  much off the air. And then I'll just begin the conversation with this, Lynn, and then take it
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:37.200]  away with anything you want to depart on the audience before you depart. There's a threshold
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:42.320]  that needs to be reached. And I see this in my life. I think you probably see this with parents,
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:47.840]  too, fighting this tyranny coming to schools that the battle you're in right now is,
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:53.840]  when is the threshold going to be crossed intellectually by Americans that the government
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:58.720]  is not there to help? They are not there to help you. There's always ulterior motives.
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.720]  And just because the news won't report it doesn't mean it's not real. And as soon as Americans can
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:11.440]  chew on that and swallow that and understand that that's the case, then these vaccine mandates and
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:16.000]  all the public pressure to do this will just evaporate overnight. It'll just be gone as soon
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:19.360]  as you realize that. I don't know when that threshold is going to be crossed. I don't know how
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:23.440]  much closer we could get to it with everything that we're learning. But let's start with this.
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:27.360]  Talk about, you were talking about at the school board meeting, how there were a couple deaths
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:32.720]  at the school clearly from the vaccine. They won't admit it. And but then also how they basically
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:37.920]  separate illegally, by the way, they segregate people wearing masks from the sheep that the
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:43.600]  sheep wearing masks from the people that don't wear the masks. Yeah, well, a couple of hours
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:50.480]  before the school board meeting, which was going to be a heated meeting to vote on masks, even
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:55.680]  though it's completely illegal, they're going against the governor's mandate where they're GA
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:00.400]  38, where we are not required. We have a choice if we want to mask our children or not, you have
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:07.920]  the choice. But our district has chosen to force masks on the children. So that's all tied up in
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:13.760]  legal battles. Well, so the superintendent sends out an email just before the meeting saying,
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:19.280]  I regret to tell you that we lost a teacher and a student. It was it was the week before,
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:23.760]  but she waited till then to tell that she said it was because the family gave her permission.
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:29.280]  Well, so they're blaming it that they're saying that the teacher and the student died from COVID.
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:34.800]  We don't have any information, no medical history. It says no, they said no underlying conditions,
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:40.240]  but they were both vaccinated. And we know that teens are dying from myocarditis and having
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:47.280]  heart issues. And we know that where the vaccine has been distributed most in Israel in the UK,
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:53.680]  that you can tie that to the variant. So this is inconclusive. You can't say they died of COVID
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:57.600]  if they were vaccinated. You need to take all those things into consideration. But more importantly,
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:04.560]  it was it was using that as a political tool to using the deaths of the teacher and the student.
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:09.600]  The teacher had a third booster that we need to take that into consideration that she may have
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:14.560]  had an adverse reaction. The student might have had an adverse reaction. But more importantly,
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:24.000]  I think the way that they treated us, I think is a glimpse into our future is medical segregation
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:28.320]  apartheid. Yeah, I like that's medical apartheid. That's what it is. Well, my friend who's from
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:34.080]  South Africa, he's a teacher and he was there at the meeting and he said, I left South Africa 30
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:38.000]  years ago, but I've already witnessed this in person. And it's terrible. And I don't want my
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:42.160]  country to be like that. It's like this is America. This is the America I came to. Yes. So they put
[2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:46.720]  the unmasked parents in the back. They set up a separate microphone for us. They actually got in
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:51.040]  trouble. Oh, wow. Fire marshal because we were blocking you couldn't get in and out. So they had
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:58.720]  the masked, the those who worship at the altar of the the mask. And they were all in the front.
[2:50:58.720 --> 2:51:02.720]  And we were in the back corner. I'm surprised they didn't let you in in Austin. They just don't
[2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:06.320]  even let you in or in the surrounding counties. They just you don't want to rash, you don't want
[2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:08.880]  to have a vaccine. You don't want your kids and doctors. They just kick you out. They tell you
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:12.720]  not to come in. If the police tell you not to and keep in mind, you know, our superintendent has
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:19.200]  been seen at social events without a mask on. Of course. Give me a break. This is all political
[2:51:19.200 --> 2:51:27.200]  theater. But but but to create this division amongst and also they try and make it look like
[2:51:27.760 --> 2:51:33.280]  those who are the parents who are anti mask that they're anti vaxxers and that they're also, you
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:41.440]  know, paying us as as privileged and we're racist, all the things. And it's it's completely unfounded.
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:46.880]  And, you know, I've talked a lot about the the academic progress black and brown students. They
[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:52.480]  never talk about their performance. The black and brown trustees, they don't talk about academic
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:56.960]  outcomes for for the students that they supposedly represent. Well, that's because it's an argument
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.440]  that wouldn't work for them. And they know that. But let me just let me let me get this boiled down
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:08.800]  to you because it's not just it's not just unfair the treatment or it's inaccurate because here's
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:13.840]  the madness of it all. I want you to boil down opinion of this. People that are getting the
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:19.440]  vaccines are dying from covid. They admit that. Okay, well, that's just a fact. So what difference
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:24.080]  does it make whether I have the vaccine or not if people to get the vaccine? But they somehow use
[2:52:24.080 --> 2:52:28.640]  that as an argument as to why you should get the vaccine. So it's like, wait a second, this person's
[2:52:28.640 --> 2:52:34.880]  been triple vaccinated and still died from covid. And that's your argument to force vaccines on
[2:52:34.880 --> 2:52:40.400]  everybody. How do you boil that down? How do you boil that insanity down? Because these are just
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:44.960]  average people that you deal with that claim this. I boil it down to science. So you know,
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:51.200]  there was a trust the science trust the experts, which ones because they can't agree. So who are
[2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:55.360]  you going to listen to? But we don't get a public debate. We don't get a public discussion. They
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:53:02.240]  set up their they they put they stack the deck against us. We don't have a real debate on this.
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:10.960]  They decide who gets to impose this. They have an ad hoc committee of yes, men doctors who are pro
[2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:15.920]  mask doctors who are pro vaccines. And there are plenty of doctors out there like Dr Fleming you
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:21.680]  had on the show that they know what's in the vaccine. They know it was a bio weapon. They know
[2:53:21.680 --> 2:53:27.040]  that it the gain of function research. They know all of those things and they're all public information
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:31.600]  sounding the alarms. And so where's the discussion? Science is not settled.
[2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:36.720]  No, science is actually never settled. In fact, guys, I sent you something to print for me. I
[2:53:36.720 --> 2:53:41.920]  don't know if you ended up printing or not. But it was basically saying if we believed the science
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:45.040]  with everything, here's all the different things you would have believed throughout the course of
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:50.320]  history, like giving kids heroin and, you know, all this other stuff that's on there that you're
[2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:54.480]  pregnant. Oh, yeah, the doctors encouraging you to smoke and all that stuff that that's that's
[2:53:54.480 --> 2:53:58.080]  following the science. We were still following all that science. Of course, that that's all the
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:01.600]  thing in the past. That's not science anymore. But it just shows you how it's the same thing.
[2:54:02.160 --> 2:54:06.480]  And I don't know how long it's been this way. Sciences, scientists can be easily bought and
[2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:11.360]  paid for doctors can be easily bought and paid for just like politicians, just like people on TV
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:16.320]  in the news. Everybody has a price. And now we're seeing with all the money that big pharma has,
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:21.680]  they can buy up scientists and doctors and they don't even flinch. Right. And so, you know, I
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:27.040]  mentioned them worshiping at the altar of the mask. So the mask, why I think that's the mountain to
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:33.040]  die on, you know, without even getting into the vaccine passports, the mask, that's the precursor
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:40.160]  to the mandatory vaccines, the mandatory vaccines are the precursor to the vaccine passports. So we
[2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:46.800]  we this is the mountain to die on. And it's not to mention you can you can show how the masks are.
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:52.720]  I mean, clear. Well, here, let's ask the question. It is a vaccine work or the mask work. If so,
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:57.040]  then why do you need? Why are you worried about me? Yeah, that's another level of the
[2:54:57.600 --> 2:55:01.440]  illogic that we're dealing with. No, this is the mountain to die on.
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:05.760]  And here, here's what people need to understand, too. But you know, the sad thing is, Lynn,
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:08.800]  we're dealing with just lying that we're just dealing with lying people. We're dealing with
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:13.040]  dishonest liars. Yeah. And that's why there's really no debate either, because they know
[2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:17.200]  they're liars. They know they would lose in a debate. So it's just like right. It's just like,
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:21.840]  okay. So they control the narrative two weeks to slow the spread. Just close your business. Just
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:27.120]  two weeks. Okay, we're going on year two. Oh, just wear the mask until you get vaccinated.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.360]  I'm vaccinated. You still have to wear the mask forever. Just just one vaccine. That's all. Yeah,
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:35.680]  just one vaccine. And this will all be said and done. Now it's two. Now it's three. Okay,
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:40.000]  just a vaccine passport. That's it. Just a vaccine passport. That'll be it. Well, what's
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:44.080]  after that? It's what's after that blood donations to cross the state border? You know,
[2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:51.920]  right, give your organ. Yeah, it's incrementalism. So it's just a slow creep. But the pandemic was
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:58.720]  the perfect catalyst, the perfect crisis to bring all of this in because all of it has been in place.
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:04.000]  We've had the technology and they've known about it. But this is the perfect tool. Yep.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:09.600]  To impose what we know cloud cloud Schwab. That's why they published this book right here. Right.
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:14.800]  COVID-19 the Great Reset. They don't even hide it. No, no, they don't even hide it. It's right
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:20.080]  here. Here's the book they made COVID in a lab. They released it to get total control of the population
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:26.560]  in medical autonomy and you're done. You will own nothing and you will be happy. Right. Yes,
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:31.600]  as I put my Darth Vader costume on, I'm cloud Schwab. I write books about how we made COVID in
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.840]  a lab and released it to force vaccinate people to lose their bodily autonomy and we're going to
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:39.280]  conquer the world. And the stupid idiots out there are going to completely go along with it
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:44.720]  because they're brainwashed and they guess I just don't want to read. Right. There he is. Look at him.
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:49.920]  I don't know how to read anymore. Oh, he's disgusting. Yeah, I will conquer the earth.
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:57.600]  And once we have extinct humanity and civilization, as you know it, my book COVID-19 the Great
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:57:04.640]  Reset will be the new Bible and we will eliminate God from your consciousness. Good luck, Klaus.
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:08.960]  Good luck. Any final comments, Lynn, before we let you go? Yeah, I mean, it's all a coup on God.
[2:57:08.960 --> 2:57:15.360]  I mean, they're all, they're all playing God. And so I say just at the most basic level, love your
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:21.680]  kids and know what you're, what they're doing to your kids and what they're trying to, to impose on
[2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:28.320]  them and stand in the gaps. They know. And yeah, you got to protect the kids. You got to protect
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:32.000]  the innocent. Yeah, that's what it's all about. And if the parents aren't going to do it, if we're
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:36.560]  not going to do it at schools, it's looking bleak for the kids future. All right, Lynn Davenport,
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:41.760]  thank you so much. Where can people follow you, by the way? On Twitter, Lynn S. Davenport. And I
[2:57:41.760 --> 2:57:45.360]  have a podcast called Social Impact with Lynn Davenport. Awesome. All right, we'll be right back.

[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:51.680]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate a compound
[2:58:52.240 --> 2:58:59.360]  that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts. It's called PQQ
[2:58:59.360 --> 2:59:05.040]  or bio PQQ. When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things. It actually makes your
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:09.760]  telomeres last longer. It doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer in the space of the
[2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:15.440]  same thing. So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get. Well, DNA Force Plus

[2:59:50.080 --> 2:59:52.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:58.880 --> 3:00:04.400]  All right. Stu Peters is about to take over here on the Alex Jones show. Real quickly though,
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:07.840]  we've been pretty serious about this for the last hour. I want to have a bit of a comic relief
[3:00:07.840 --> 3:00:16.240]  before Stu Peters takes over. This is Alex Stein at the Dallas City Council giving a hilarious
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:21.760]  speech on the Texas abortion law. It's a little bit of a slow burn, but by the end of it, I think
[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:26.960]  you'll be laughing with me. Here is Alex Stein, hilarious speech on the Texas abortion law to
[3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:32.160]  the Dallas City Council. Hello, Mr. Mayor, and thank you for allowing me this time to speak to
[3:00:32.160 --> 3:00:36.720]  you today. But unfortunately, the subject that I have to speak about is very traumatic and personal
[3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:41.600]  to me. With a new abortion legislation brought forth by the Texas Supreme Court allowing the
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:46.800]  heartbeat bill and limiting abortions to six weeks is incredibly unconstitutional. Bill Gates'
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:51.440]  father William Gates Sr. would be so disappointed in his son for letting this bill pass, considering
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:56.720]  Gates' family involvement in starting Planned Parenthood with Margaret Sanger. Currently,
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:00.080]  I'm in a situation where I have three different birthing people pregnant at the same time,
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:03.840]  and I would like for all of them to have abortions, but unfortunately with this new heartbeat bill,
[3:01:03.840 --> 3:01:08.320]  we're unable to get the usual abortions that we often get. I don't like to use any
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:12.560]  contraception whatsoever because it hinders my performance, so that's why I depend on abortions
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:19.280]  as a 100% effective form of birth control. But now that the state is making it almost impossible
[3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:24.400]  for birthing people to even get an abortion, I'm going to be forced to change my entire lifestyle.
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:29.840]  Roe vs. Wade made it very clear that abortions are completely legal, and I wish Dallas would
[3:01:29.840 --> 3:01:35.120]  take a page out of New York's Rulebook and approve late-term abortion up to six hours after birth
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.480]  because this would solve a lot of problems for expected parents that don't want to have the
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:43.120]  financial obligation of raising a child that they didn't plan for with money that they don't have.
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:48.080]  And although I'm perfectly capable of financially supporting a young child, and I know that I would
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:51.760]  get crazy amount of likes and comments on my TikTok and Instagram accounts from all the cool
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:56.480]  baby photos, and I could post them in Armani and Gucci baby gear, and it's very easy for me to find
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:01:59.840]  birthing people that want me to leave my seat inside them. But unfortunately, I don't have the
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:05.360]  time or the ability to change my vacations to Cabo San Lucas in Jamaica because those are non-refundable
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:10.480]  flights, and I travel to many other international destinations on a regular basis because my
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:15.360]  social media influence on Instagram is similar to that of Dan's Bazaarian or Chrissy Teigen's.
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:20.720]  But sadly, with multiple children, this could hinder my ability to travel, and I know this may
[3:02:20.720 --> 3:02:26.400]  sound a little selfish, but my doctor and psychiatrists both prescribed me an Eat Pray Love lifestyle
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:30.800]  ever since my first ex-wife and her new fiance died in a fire at her old lake house that she
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:38.160]  received in the divorce settlement. My two transgender children from the divorce deck in
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:42.800]  Dalekshire, both impurity blockers, were just surrendered to child protective services until
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:47.440]  I can get my drunk driving problem behind me because I recently got a DWI outside of the
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:51.920]  Olive Garden on Technology Boulevard after the all-you-can-eat pasta promotion they have, but
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:56.800]  regardless of all the peanut grease you have, Feta G's Alfredo, I sit here in front of the mayor
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:02.000]  and City Council begging that you use some of the budgetary funds to hire attorneys and file a
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:06.880]  lawsuit against Governor Abbott, just like you're suing for the mass mandate laws that are currently
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:12.960]  in place by the governor. Please do something to reverse this unjust, unconstitutional abortion
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:17.280]  ban so that I can go back to raw-dogging birthing people that I meet outside of ARBs and drug
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:22.080]  rehabilitation centers. And if you're watching this online and you want to smoke sister sweets later,
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:28.400]  chill with me, hit my Instagram, bribe type style, all one word, and my Twitter, Alex99.
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:37.760]  All right. All right, we finished with a little humor before Stu Peters takes over. Always informative,
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:42.720]  always covering the uncovered angles. And so you're not going to want to miss the next hour
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:47.840]  with Stu Peters. And then I'll be back. I'll be in this studio today hosting the War Room
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:52.880]  three to six PM with fantastic guests coming up, including a guest in studio that you're not going
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:56.640]  to want to miss in the first hour. And then other great guests as well. Remember, folks,

[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:08.560]  level of censorship we're enduring. This is it. We had to build our own platform. You're on it right
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:14.640]  now. Thanks to your financial supported info wordstore.com. So remember, we have the new best

[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:39.680]  hey, the last ones were great. They had our logo on them. They worked pretty well, but

[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:50.560]  with silent pocket. Get it before it sells out at info wordstore.com. Stu Peters up next.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:05:00.800]  I want to explain something that is absolutely heat understanding our world. It's very, very
[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:07.520]  simple. But the most below know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:14.160]  creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up
[3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:21.440]  infrastructure, intellectual property, energy. They're using it to buy people to buy influence.
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:26.800]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:31.280]  manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation,
[3:05:31.280 --> 3:05:36.400]  or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:41.680]  every sector of the world economy buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:46.880]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies,
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:51.280]  they do fund, the only things left standing. This is the great reset. This is what's happening
[3:05:51.280 --> 3:06:07.680]  now for everyone. It's the only way to stop it. No, so we have talked a lot about the GOP having
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:17.200]  big problems. And this is confirmed when you look at the candidates that the GOP is propping up
[3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:22.800]  up in front of you. These are the people that are funded by the establishment.
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:28.080]  Establishment members of the Deep State Cabal, really. I mean, you look at Lindsey Graham,
[3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:37.200]  Mitch McConnell, the Turtle Lord, Kevin McCarthy. And then you look at gubernatorial candidate
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:44.640]  Vernon Jones in Georgia, who some of you may know appeared on the Stu Peter show yesterday.
[3:06:44.640 --> 3:06:52.560]  And I wanted to ask him about some real issues. I wanted to ask him about why he bragged that
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:57.920]  he might end up Speaker of the Georgia House if Republicans passed an anti-abortion heartbeat law,
[3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:04.800]  but the backlash would cause Democrats to win back the state house. But then he said he voted
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:09.840]  against that bill, the bill that kills babies because it didn't go far enough, even though
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:15.760]  it massively expanded protections for the unborn. It caused a huge meltdown in Hollywood.
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:22.080]  It banned most abortions after just six weeks. So the problem for Vernon Jones wasn't really with
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:28.640]  the bill. Because if it was, he would have proposed amendments at the time to make it
[3:07:28.640 --> 3:07:35.040]  more conservative. It was something else. Vernon Jones changed positions to boost his career.
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:43.280]  So about a year ago, Vernon Jones comes out after being a lifelong Democrat. And he says,
[3:07:43.280 --> 3:07:48.880]  I am now a through and through Trump supporting mega America first conservative.
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:57.360]  Okay, so people change. We understand that. But also Vernon Jones has been on the road.
[3:07:57.360 --> 3:08:06.800]  He's been on telegram. He's been on Twitter doing nothing but posting divisive black versus white
[3:08:07.440 --> 3:08:12.960]  rhetoric, what he's going to do about black people, what he's going to do about white people.
[3:08:12.960 --> 3:08:18.240]  So I looked into this, you know, I mean, he's on telegram posting videos of himself jumping up
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:24.320]  onto John Deere tractors, appealing to the conservative white Christians of Georgia,
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:27.840]  because he knows he's going to need the white vote in Georgia. He knows he's going to need
[3:08:27.840 --> 3:08:36.720]  the Christian vote in the deep South. And so ask him about his promise that on day one,
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:43.440]  he would be banning that CRT crap in his state out of the schools, out of government, out of
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:49.760]  everything. And he had told people some crap about putting a bill before the legislature.
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:55.280]  Again, not a good answer. So it got me thinking that there was a reason Vernon Jones wasn't
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:09:00.800]  fully committed to destroying critical race theory, just like he's not fully committed to
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:07.120]  destroying legislation that allows for babies to be killed. And it makes sense because really,
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:16.560]  CRT has defined Vernon Jones' career. In 2004, Vernon Jones was successfully sued for attempting
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:23.040]  to create a quote darker administration to reflect the new DeKalb County, by the way,
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:28.080]  DeKalb County full of corruption, one of America's most corrupt counties, look it up for yourself.
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:34.400]  But in the trial, the plaintiffs dug up an accidentally recorded conversation
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:41.600]  between a couple of people, one of them being Stone, Joe Stone, who said that he was angry,
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:46.480]  the fire chief wanted to promote for white men, the battalion chief. So there was all kinds of
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:54.400]  things going on in Vernon Jones' administration as the CEO of DeKalb County. And when I confronted
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:09:59.920]  him about this, immediately Vernon Jones starts blowing up, getting on the offensive,
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:04.560]  and on the defensive really, trying to talk over me, trying to talk about job creation
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:08.160]  and other GOP establishment talking points that he's been handed on some index card.
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:14.560]  And I told Vernon Jones that I was going to mute him if he kept up. I don't like doing that.
[3:10:14.560 --> 3:10:20.000]  I'm not the person that wants to censor anybody. But when a conversation is supposed to be
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:24.960]  question and answer, and you're refusing to answer the questions that I'm asking,
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:30.240]  the questions that Georgians really want to know answers to, because I think it's past time.
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:36.480]  I think by and large, America is waking up. People are, they've had enough of the political
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.800]  talking points. They've had enough of big donor, special interest, funded establishment,
[3:10:42.800 --> 3:10:47.760]  lifelong, slick talking, jive talking politicians. They don't want to hear it anymore.
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:53.760]  And so when I asked him about this, he blew up. So I want to give you some context here.
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:11:03.280]  Vernon Jones asked one of his subordinates to fire all of the white employees in a parks department.
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:07.600]  And when that employee, when that subordinate refused to do that, he fired him.
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:14.880]  He demoted a white person, gave her a job in a windowless office in a converted storage area
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:24.160]  while promoting a black person, but yet claims that he's not racist. But this is the deal,
[3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:29.840]  is that liberal Democrats talk about race. Liberal Democrats make everything about race.
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:35.520]  And so that got me thinking even more. So I started going into all of this,
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:41.920]  and that's what he did to this low guy. He fired this guy. And an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:48.240]  ruled that, quote, there was shocking evidence of an overt and unabashed pattern of discrimination
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:54.160]  in Vernon Jones's administration, which he was, quote, the architect of.
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:12:00.960]  So Vernon Jones said all those accusers were lying. All of his victims were lying.
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:07.200]  But if that's the case, then why did US District Court Judge Bill Duffy say that the case against
[3:12:07.200 --> 3:12:12.240]  him was so clear cut that if the jury had ruled in Vernon Jones's favor, he would have thrown
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:19.200]  out the verdict. And then Vernon Jones was ordered to pay $185,000. Here's a little bit of the exchange
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:24.320]  that I had with Vernon Jones yesterday. Go ahead. I'm sure the folks in contact,
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:27.920]  you want you to put it all out there. So let's do it. Let's do it. You ready?
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:31.680]  Okay, sure. In 2004, you were sued for successfully attempting to create a darker
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:36.800]  administration to reflect the new DeKalb County. Does someone tell you that I defer to this?
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:42.560]  Wait a minute. So, so I see right now, I'm reading you're being intellectually dishonest.
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:46.880]  So let me answer your question. I'm reading Circuit Court Orders, Vernon. What you just said,
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:51.840]  it's completely false. It's erroneous. Oh, really? Reckless. And that's why I just said,
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:56.560]  when you, when you try to be holier than now that, oh, you're different from everybody else.
[3:12:56.560 --> 3:13:00.000]  No, you're not. Okay. You're here with a bunch of foolishness. Now,
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.320]  let's get to the next question. Cause I'm going to talk about the issue.
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:08.080]  If they're lying and if I'm foolish, then why are the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals illegal immigration?
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:12.160]  No, no, no, let's talk about it. You're not going to avoid the real questions here.
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:19.440]  If all of those people, his victims were lying, then why did US district court judge Bill Duffy
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:25.360]  say that the case against him was so clear cut that if the jury had ruled in his favor,
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:30.080]  he would have thrown out the verdict. It was that clear that Vernon Jones was the quote
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:39.680]  architect of anti-white racism. Unbelievable. This is what the GOP does. They give you a choice in
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:49.360]  Georgia. Brian Kemp corrupt. Stacey Abrams corrupt. Vernon Jones is a Democrat. And now
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:54.000]  all he wants to do today is talk about how I'm a racist because I call them a jive talker.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:57.280]  We pull up the definition of jive talk. I mean, you could probably Google it.
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:01.280]  It means to be deceptive. Vernon Jones is very much deceptive,
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:06.320]  so deceptive that he accused his victims of lying.
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:14.480]  And so if court rulings are anything to go by, then we now know that Vernon Jones does not see
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:18.800]  his white Christian constituents, which aren't his constituents, but the white Christian voters
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:24.480]  of Georgia with anything other than contempt. He doesn't like white men, but he does like white
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:31.440]  women can't keep his hands off of them. In 2005, he was accused of rape following a three-way
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:36.560]  sexual encounter with his girlfriend at the time. The Cab County DA, Gwen Keyes Fleming,
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:40.240]  said that the case was dropped because the supposed victim didn't want the trauma of
[3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:44.720]  testifying against a powerful politician. Right now, Vernon Jones doesn't have any power.
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:50.960]  He doesn't have any elected position power. But yet, he can say, that was a long time ago when I
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:55.760]  changed, but that's inherently false and he's lying because just in January of this year,
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.640]  he tried to lure a young Christian conservative girl into his hotel room in D.C.
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:06.160]  In March of this year, he tried to lure a young Christian conservative girl into his hotel room
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:13.200]  in Atlanta. Vernon Jones hasn't changed. He's nothing more than a liar. He is a liberal
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:19.360]  Democrat plant, and he resembles a communist. And nobody denies that there was a threesome.
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:24.720]  So what's conservative about having threesome with random girls? What exactly is Vernon Jones
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:31.120]  looking to conserve? He didn't have a change of heart. And now he's doing what every liberal
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:36.560]  Democrat does. He's calling me a racist today. A racist because I wanted to know the answers to
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:41.280]  the questions that are very important to Georgians. So we're going to talk about this. What is the
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:47.040]  conversation? And how do we fix this? How do we get real America first conservatives in here?

[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:29.640]  Hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen,
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:33.500]  after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling there's
[3:16:33.500 --> 3:16:38.600]  one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:42.960]  the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that, I certainly
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:47.820]  So, here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based
[3:16:47.820 --> 3:16:52.900]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[3:17:23.300 --> 3:17:25.260]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:25.260 --> 3:17:29.180]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:29.180 --> 3:17:30.740]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:30.740 --> 3:17:33.700]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:33.700 --> 3:17:36.980]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:36.980 --> 3:17:39.220]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:39.220 --> 3:17:40.540]  I can help you too.
[3:17:40.540 --> 3:17:43.540]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:43.540 --> 3:17:45.780]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:45.780 --> 3:17:54.820]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:54.820 --> 3:18:00.220]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[3:18:00.220 --> 3:18:02.220]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[3:18:02.220 --> 3:18:03.940]  Do you think they would let you in?
[3:18:03.940 --> 3:18:06.620]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't
[3:18:06.620 --> 3:18:08.620]  going to be shoplifting?
[3:18:08.620 --> 3:18:14.340]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay
[3:18:14.340 --> 3:18:16.860]  for your gas with a bandana on?
[3:18:16.860 --> 3:18:18.540]  How far do you think that would get you?
[3:18:18.540 --> 3:18:22.940]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[3:18:22.940 --> 3:18:24.940]  alien?
[3:18:24.940 --> 3:18:31.860]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[3:18:31.860 --> 3:18:35.660]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[3:18:35.660 --> 3:18:39.140]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[3:18:39.140 --> 3:18:41.420]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[3:18:41.420 --> 3:18:44.980]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes
[3:18:44.980 --> 3:18:47.420]  major medical issues and it's dehumanizing.
[3:18:47.420 --> 3:18:48.940]  And the film COVID Land does that.

[3:18:54.620 --> 3:18:59.300]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[3:18:59.300 --> 3:19:04.900]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalists on the other
[3:19:04.900 --> 3:19:08.500]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[3:19:08.500 --> 3:19:12.700]  For the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[3:19:12.700 --> 3:19:16.380]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[3:19:16.380 --> 3:19:21.780]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build
[3:19:21.780 --> 3:19:23.580]  Back Better.
[3:19:23.580 --> 3:19:29.580]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[3:19:29.580 --> 3:19:32.380]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[3:19:32.380 --> 3:19:37.340]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[3:19:37.340 --> 3:19:40.340]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[3:19:40.340 --> 3:19:44.220]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[3:19:44.220 --> 3:19:45.220]  It's that simple.
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:48.380]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[3:19:48.380 --> 3:19:52.780]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[3:19:52.780 --> 3:19:57.780]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[3:19:57.780 --> 3:20:07.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:07.780 --> 3:20:18.140]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:18.140 --> 3:20:21.020]  My name is Stu Peters, stupedars.tv.
[3:20:21.020 --> 3:20:25.780]  So we're talking about Vernon Jones, but we're talking about a much bigger problem here.
[3:20:25.780 --> 3:20:29.060]  We're talking about who the GOP wants to push towards us.
[3:20:29.060 --> 3:20:33.060]  And we have a serious problem, not only with election integrity, but the integrity of the
[3:20:33.060 --> 3:20:36.620]  people that we are trying to elect.
[3:20:36.620 --> 3:20:42.980]  When somebody presents themselves as a conservative America first mega Republican, but yet at
[3:20:42.980 --> 3:20:47.780]  the time is sending just as recently as March, very forward comments to two young conservative
[3:20:47.780 --> 3:20:52.740]  women at conservative events trying to get them back to his hotel room.
[3:20:52.740 --> 3:20:56.140]  The only thing that's being conserved here is the Georgia State GOP and I don't mean
[3:20:56.140 --> 3:20:57.620]  that in a good way.
[3:20:57.620 --> 3:21:01.660]  It's like Vernon Jones is this shiny ornament that they're using to distract people.
[3:21:01.660 --> 3:21:05.660]  Hey, check out this black X Democrat who's becoming an America first mega guy, but it's
[3:21:05.660 --> 3:21:06.660]  a big scam.
[3:21:06.660 --> 3:21:07.660]  He hasn't.
[3:21:07.660 --> 3:21:08.660]  He's still a liberal Democrat.
[3:21:08.660 --> 3:21:11.660]  Here to talk with us about this is Lauren Witzke.
[3:21:11.660 --> 3:21:14.500]  Lauren Witzke knows all about this kind of stuff.
[3:21:14.500 --> 3:21:19.300]  She garnered more votes in Delaware than any Republican in history in that state.
[3:21:19.300 --> 3:21:20.940]  Thank you so much for being here.
[3:21:20.940 --> 3:21:27.460]  So Vernon Jones has mastered the art of projection, accusing others of everything that he's guilty
[3:21:27.460 --> 3:21:32.500]  of being un-American, being racist, being unethical, being corrupt, and that's the attack
[3:21:32.500 --> 3:21:37.180]  that he is presenting on me today because he refused to answer the questions.
[3:21:37.180 --> 3:21:40.740]  So instead he's just attacking me saying that I'm a racist, but yet still hasn't answered
[3:21:40.740 --> 3:21:46.540]  the questions about being a sex predator and about being an anti white racist parasite.
[3:21:46.540 --> 3:21:53.180]  Right, I thought I saw his message where he called you a liberal bigot, so I didn't
[3:21:53.180 --> 3:21:59.260]  know that because if you look at the records and his history, it does show that the only
[3:21:59.260 --> 3:22:02.780]  liberal bigot in the room is Vernon Jones.
[3:22:02.780 --> 3:22:05.860]  You know, right now we're looking at a serious issue that's rising up.
[3:22:05.860 --> 3:22:09.780]  We're looking at anti white racism across the country and it is not something that we
[3:22:09.780 --> 3:22:13.140]  are going to tolerate in the America first movement.
[3:22:13.140 --> 3:22:20.900]  So recently as early as today, DeBlasio ripped funding for this sexual needs program because
[3:22:20.900 --> 3:22:24.100]  it benefited white children the most.
[3:22:24.100 --> 3:22:29.260]  We're also seeing a school shooter in Texas being released the day after with open arms
[3:22:29.260 --> 3:22:34.260]  and a party after he had just shot up a school the day before, released from jail while Cal
[3:22:34.260 --> 3:22:39.660]  Rittenhouse was forced to pay $2 million in bond and was held for a long time and he's
[3:22:39.660 --> 3:22:42.260]  still battling that even today.
[3:22:42.260 --> 3:22:47.260]  So white privilege is certainly a myth, but however, when you have the court documents
[3:22:47.260 --> 3:22:51.900]  and the evidence that prove that not only was Vernon Jones racist towards the male
[3:22:51.900 --> 3:22:57.060]  of white males in his company, when he had the opportunity, when he had seized the power,
[3:22:57.060 --> 3:22:58.660]  we see what he is going to do with it.
[3:22:58.660 --> 3:23:05.340]  Now he can try and spin words to to placate the establishment GOP and try to draw those
[3:23:05.340 --> 3:23:10.020]  white Christian votes out of Georgia, however, we know exactly what he is going to do.
[3:23:10.020 --> 3:23:15.060]  So it's either we call it out now or we're going to end up fighting it in 2023 when
[3:23:15.060 --> 3:23:20.340]  he is doing nothing for the parents to fight critical race theory when he is firing the
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:26.380]  white people from his, you know, gubernatorial administration, you know, this is what we
[3:23:26.380 --> 3:23:32.260]  have a history and people cannot say we didn't know because Sue Peters warned you.
[3:23:32.260 --> 3:23:33.460]  We brought the receipts.
[3:23:33.460 --> 3:23:34.900]  He had the court documents.
[3:23:34.900 --> 3:23:40.260]  We saw everything and the fact that, you know, he didn't even say he didn't even respond
[3:23:40.260 --> 3:23:43.180]  with, you know, I did do that and I screwed up.
[3:23:43.180 --> 3:23:45.180]  I found Jesus changed my life.
[3:23:45.180 --> 3:23:46.340]  No, he didn't.
[3:23:46.340 --> 3:23:48.780]  He went on to blame his victims.
[3:23:48.780 --> 3:23:49.900]  That is what the Democrats do.
[3:23:49.900 --> 3:23:51.260]  They blame the victims.
[3:23:51.260 --> 3:23:57.540]  So as a lifelong Democrat, Vernon Jones certainly has mastered the art of projection.
[3:23:57.540 --> 3:24:02.620]  So you know, we as American citizens and conservatives have to fight back against this.
[3:24:02.620 --> 3:24:06.660]  I know the whole room, like everything everybody was saying is we can't attack Vernon Jones
[3:24:06.660 --> 3:24:08.060]  because he's the best we got.
[3:24:08.060 --> 3:24:13.700]  No, we don't have to expect this just because the GOP is propping him up, giving him all
[3:24:13.700 --> 3:24:14.700]  the corporate donors.
[3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:18.420]  Do you want these corporate donors choosing our elected officials for us?
[3:24:18.420 --> 3:24:21.380]  They're trying to say that alternatives like Candice Taylor never had a chance.
[3:24:21.380 --> 3:24:22.380]  You know what?
[3:24:22.380 --> 3:24:23.380]  They said that about me, too.
[3:24:23.380 --> 3:24:26.540]  They said I would never win a primary and a statewide election.
[3:24:26.540 --> 3:24:27.780]  But my butt got out there.
[3:24:27.780 --> 3:24:30.620]  I knocked on doors and people voted for me.
[3:24:30.620 --> 3:24:31.620]  That is a myth.
[3:24:31.620 --> 3:24:33.620]  I do not let the establishment.
[3:24:33.620 --> 3:24:35.580]  Go ahead.
[3:24:35.580 --> 3:24:40.180]  Leading up to the 2016 election, how many people said that Donald Trump would never
[3:24:40.180 --> 3:24:41.620]  get elected?
[3:24:41.620 --> 3:24:48.340]  The entire mainstream everybody in conservative politics, the entire establishment said Donald
[3:24:48.340 --> 3:24:51.620]  Trump, mark my words, Donald Trump will never be president in the United States.
[3:24:51.620 --> 3:24:54.860]  So don't give me this crap about Candice Taylor not being able to win.
[3:24:54.860 --> 3:24:58.140]  So the discussion that I want to do here is not about Vernon Jones because we know what
[3:24:58.140 --> 3:24:59.140]  he is.
[3:24:59.140 --> 3:25:00.340]  He's a liberal Democrat.
[3:25:00.340 --> 3:25:01.340]  He's a liar.
[3:25:01.340 --> 3:25:03.980]  He's an anti-white racist and a sexual predator.
[3:25:03.980 --> 3:25:07.100]  So that we know, and he's going to come up with all kinds of excuses today, but he's
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:10.580]  never going to actually address the questions of the allegations because he doesn't want
[3:25:10.580 --> 3:25:11.580]  people to know that.
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:13.260]  He's covering up because he's a snake.
[3:25:13.260 --> 3:25:16.700]  So moving beyond that, the conversation needs to be.
[3:25:16.700 --> 3:25:23.220]  So if the GOP is giving us candidates like him, like Camp, like Stacey Abrams, but then
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:28.100]  you have an actual America first patriot who loves God, who loves this constitutional
[3:25:28.100 --> 3:25:34.020]  republic, who embraces the structure of the nuclear family, who represents everything
[3:25:34.020 --> 3:25:41.060]  that real conservative Christians want, then why is Candice Taylor not able to be viewed
[3:25:41.060 --> 3:25:46.380]  as somebody who can realistically win a gubernatorial race in a state like Georgia?
[3:25:46.380 --> 3:25:48.900]  Oh, it's a complete farce.
[3:25:48.900 --> 3:25:50.140]  It's meant to demoralize you.
[3:25:50.140 --> 3:25:54.100]  It's meant to be like, oh, she doesn't have a chance because she doesn't have all the
[3:25:54.100 --> 3:25:55.580]  establishment backing.
[3:25:55.580 --> 3:25:59.300]  You know what Candice Taylor, all she has to do is win a primary, get out there and
[3:25:59.300 --> 3:26:04.420]  knock on doors, girls, like with your, with your team and, you know, let's fight for Candice
[3:26:04.420 --> 3:26:05.420]  Taylor.
[3:26:05.420 --> 3:26:09.700]  I'm throwing all my support behind her because I believe in America first grassroots.
[3:26:09.700 --> 3:26:16.220]  Now I'm not going to let the corporate establishment, the anti-white system, pick my candidate for
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:17.220]  me.
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:18.220]  Georgia is red.
[3:26:18.220 --> 3:26:23.580]  It is a strong Christian state with powerful grassroots workers and they are ready to come
[3:26:23.580 --> 3:26:24.580]  out.
[3:26:24.580 --> 3:26:29.180]  And I am throwing my support behind Candice Taylor and don't let them demoralize you into
[3:26:29.180 --> 3:26:30.740]  thinking that she can't win.
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:33.940]  She will win if you show up and vote for her.
[3:26:33.940 --> 3:26:35.980]  That is how it is with any candidate.
[3:26:35.980 --> 3:26:40.940]  Some of the things here too that I was noticing is when you look at establishment, when you
[3:26:40.940 --> 3:26:44.860]  look at the media industrial complex, and that includes alternative media, so-called
[3:26:44.860 --> 3:26:50.540]  conservative alternative media, Candice Taylor has been blackballed.
[3:26:50.540 --> 3:26:53.500]  She's not allowed on those platforms.
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:26:56.140]  They won't allow her, but yet they embrace Vernon Jones.
[3:26:56.140 --> 3:26:57.140]  They bring him that.
[3:26:57.140 --> 3:27:03.060]  So that should show you the machine that Candice Taylor is up against.
[3:27:03.060 --> 3:27:07.220]  And we need to return this, the reason why we need to fix 2020.
[3:27:07.220 --> 3:27:09.140]  And that needs to be done now.
[3:27:09.140 --> 3:27:14.740]  Not this jive talk, not these lies about how we're going to fix it in 2022 after we're
[3:27:14.740 --> 3:27:15.740]  getting elected.
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:18.580]  So what are you suggesting that we have to use the internet connected machines and cheat
[3:27:18.580 --> 3:27:23.380]  again for me to get in and then I'm going to fix what got me there BS, another lie.
[3:27:23.380 --> 3:27:29.900]  So we need to fix 2020 right now so that when the overwhelming number of Georgians realize
[3:27:29.900 --> 3:27:33.820]  Candice Taylor is the real America first candidate and they want to go vote that their votes
[3:27:33.820 --> 3:27:35.260]  count and Candice Taylor can win.
[3:27:35.260 --> 3:27:36.260]  I got about a minute left.
[3:27:36.260 --> 3:27:37.260]  Your final words.
[3:27:37.260 --> 3:27:38.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:27:38.260 --> 3:27:44.420]  You know, and get out and vote for your candidates, especially the America first candidates on
[3:27:44.420 --> 3:27:45.420]  the ground.
[3:27:45.420 --> 3:27:46.420]  Get out and support them.
[3:27:46.420 --> 3:27:52.620]  You know, don't let the establishment choose them for you, especially in the state of Georgia.
[3:27:52.620 --> 3:27:56.380]  You have a say and in the state of Georgia, it's very interesting that they have a majority
[3:27:56.380 --> 3:27:59.100]  in the Republic like they have a majority Republican in the Legislature.
[3:27:59.100 --> 3:28:00.660]  They could fix 2020.
[3:28:00.660 --> 3:28:02.180]  They're just choosing not to.
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:06.220]  And like I said, you either either address this issue now or you're going to be fighting
[3:28:06.220 --> 3:28:07.900]  it in 2023.
[3:28:07.900 --> 3:28:13.060]  I don't believe somebody like an America first grassroots candidate like Candice Taylor.
[3:28:13.060 --> 3:28:17.260]  I think you can get her to publicly commit to ban critical race theory.
[3:28:17.260 --> 3:28:22.580]  We as Republicans need to harness our political power to our benefit when it matters the most
[3:28:22.580 --> 3:28:25.580]  you know, not this libertarian thing like, oh, we need to do it this way, this way.
[3:28:25.580 --> 3:28:28.220]  The Democrats do the exact same thing to us.
[3:28:28.220 --> 3:28:32.260]  The first thing they did when they were in power was 52 executive orders to destroy our
[3:28:32.260 --> 3:28:33.260]  lives.
[3:28:33.260 --> 3:28:38.500]  When we get power back, we need to be willing to do the same thing to fight these Bolsheviks,
[3:28:38.500 --> 3:28:45.780]  these Bolshevik tactics, like gaslighting, CRT, uh, labeling parents, domestic terrorists.
[3:28:45.780 --> 3:28:46.780]  No more.
[3:28:46.780 --> 3:28:47.780]  I'm a heartbreak.
[3:28:47.780 --> 3:28:48.780]  Lauren whiskey.
[3:28:48.780 --> 3:28:49.780]  Super sharp gal.
[3:28:49.780 --> 3:28:50.780]  Thank you so much for being here with us.
[3:28:50.780 --> 3:28:54.220]  Gene ruby is up next stick around for more of the ox Jones show.
[3:28:54.220 --> 3:28:59.220]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:28:59.220 --> 3:29:04.860]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:29:04.860 --> 3:29:09.740]  and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and I, you know, it gets old having
[3:29:09.740 --> 3:29:13.420]  to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:13.420 --> 3:29:16.860]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:16.860 --> 3:29:21.500]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:29:21.500 --> 3:29:22.740]  almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:22.740 --> 3:29:27.060]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:29:27.060 --> 3:29:29.940]  comes out and the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:29.940 --> 3:29:31.500]  That's why we've got to be taken off there.
[3:29:31.500 --> 3:29:33.580]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:33.580 --> 3:29:37.980]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:29:37.980 --> 3:29:41.900]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:29:41.900 --> 3:29:45.220]  about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:45.220 --> 3:29:50.260]  So thank you all and get an info or store.com gets some great 20, 20 election shirts, supplements
[3:29:50.260 --> 3:29:51.260]  and so much more.
[3:29:51.260 --> 3:29:54.580]  They're wonderful products and they support the info or thank you.
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:30:00.220]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and
[3:30:00.220 --> 3:30:04.740]  other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[3:30:04.740 --> 3:30:06.780]  We don't have them long term.
[3:30:06.780 --> 3:30:07.780]  We die.
[3:30:07.780 --> 3:30:11.860]  But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that
[3:30:11.860 --> 3:30:18.100]  are recommended, if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep, your body will fall apart even
[3:30:18.100 --> 3:30:19.100]  faster.
[3:30:19.100 --> 3:30:22.900]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture
[3:30:22.900 --> 3:30:24.900]  and life, it's hard to settle down.
[3:30:24.900 --> 3:30:25.900]  It's hard to relax.
[3:30:25.900 --> 3:30:27.380]  Well, let me tell you something right now.
[3:30:27.380 --> 3:30:30.420]  Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound.
[3:30:30.420 --> 3:30:35.500]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep and it's
[3:30:35.500 --> 3:30:36.500]  such a game changer.
[3:30:36.500 --> 3:30:40.780]  So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out available
[3:30:40.780 --> 3:30:44.780]  again at mforestore.com for 50% off.
[3:30:44.780 --> 3:30:45.780]  And you know what?
[3:30:45.780 --> 3:30:48.980]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out even though we've already sold out a half
[3:30:48.980 --> 3:30:54.700]  of it in just the last month and we probably are going to have more for about five months.
[3:30:54.700 --> 3:30:59.020]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[3:30:59.020 --> 3:31:03.580]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[3:31:03.580 --> 3:31:08.860]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[3:31:08.860 --> 3:31:09.860]  system.

[3:31:56.220 --> 3:32:00.300]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[3:32:00.300 --> 3:32:03.260]  It's very, very simple but the most people don't know.
[3:32:03.260 --> 3:32:09.980]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[3:32:09.980 --> 3:32:16.540]  of dollars at other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[3:32:16.540 --> 3:32:19.540]  property, energy.
[3:32:19.540 --> 3:32:24.540]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of
[3:32:24.540 --> 3:32:28.580]  trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets but they never allowed
[3:32:28.580 --> 3:32:33.580]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:32:33.580 --> 3:32:38.060]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[3:32:38.060 --> 3:32:44.060]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and
[3:32:44.060 --> 3:32:48.820]  force a collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only things left
[3:32:48.820 --> 3:32:49.820]  standing.
[3:32:49.820 --> 3:32:50.820]  This is the great reset.
[3:32:50.820 --> 3:32:51.820]  This is what's happening now.
[3:32:51.820 --> 3:32:58.820]  Warning everyone, it's the only way to stop it.
[3:32:58.820 --> 3:33:12.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:12.420 --> 3:33:16.500]  You know I just, I'm just to finalize that what I was talking about I'm not going to
[3:33:16.500 --> 3:33:23.220]  apologize for muting Vernon Jones and sometimes we do have technical difficulties and the
[3:33:23.220 --> 3:33:28.780]  mute button was never un-pressed although I thought it was, I'm not going to apologize
[3:33:28.780 --> 3:33:29.780]  for that.
[3:33:29.780 --> 3:33:32.020]  I'm not going to apologize for asking real questions.
[3:33:32.020 --> 3:33:35.900]  We're going to bring accountability back to politics in America.
[3:33:35.900 --> 3:33:40.380]  We're going to shine a big bright light into the crevices of darkness where these corrupt
[3:33:40.380 --> 3:33:44.660]  communists have been able to hide for a very long time.
[3:33:44.660 --> 3:33:48.940]  It's my opinion that we have not had a fair election since probably Ronald Reagan.
[3:33:48.940 --> 3:33:53.060]  I'm going to switch gears just a little bit here and I'm not going to apologize either
[3:33:53.060 --> 3:33:55.980]  for calling him a jive talker because that's exactly what Vernon Jones is.
[3:33:55.980 --> 3:33:58.020]  He's a jive talker.
[3:33:58.020 --> 3:33:59.860]  Switching gears a little bit here.
[3:33:59.860 --> 3:34:04.180]  The incessant push to get a shot in every arm.
[3:34:04.180 --> 3:34:06.260]  I mean we talk about this ad nauseam.
[3:34:06.260 --> 3:34:09.620]  You hear Alex Jones talking about it.
[3:34:09.620 --> 3:34:13.900]  Obviously, you hear Owen Schreuer in the war room talking about it which is up next.
[3:34:13.900 --> 3:34:15.220]  We talk about it all the time.
[3:34:15.220 --> 3:34:20.260]  It's ruining people's lives and everybody that's awake to this understands that this
[3:34:20.260 --> 3:34:26.300]  is not about immunity because if this was really about immunity then why wouldn't antibodies
[3:34:26.300 --> 3:34:32.580]  count which have been proven to be more robust than these shots that are being falsely referred
[3:34:32.580 --> 3:34:36.220]  to as vaccines that have been proven to be dangerous and in many cases deadly.
[3:34:36.220 --> 3:34:41.380]  We're watching the numbers be hidden whistleblowers coming forward from hospitals, the government's
[3:34:41.380 --> 3:34:46.900]  own documents, the Department of Defense, the DoD saying that they acknowledge that
[3:34:46.900 --> 3:34:53.260]  over 60% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 are quote fully vaccinated.
[3:34:53.260 --> 3:34:59.740]  That 70% over 65 that are hospitalized are fully vaccinated.
[3:34:59.740 --> 3:35:06.940]  And so now as you start to look around people are responding to this vaccine resistance.
[3:35:06.940 --> 3:35:11.820]  The government, the Biden regime, the Reich, the White House occupant, the dementia patient
[3:35:11.820 --> 3:35:18.100]  understands that the people who decided against this thing are more than likely not going
[3:35:18.100 --> 3:35:19.100]  to change their mind.
[3:35:19.100 --> 3:35:22.460]  I am not going to change my mind.
[3:35:22.460 --> 3:35:25.180]  And so now they have to figure out a way to combat that.
[3:35:25.180 --> 3:35:28.740]  Big Pharma's got to figure out a way to combat that.
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:32.420]  And people that are bought and paid for by Big Pharma like Lindsey Graham have to find
[3:35:32.420 --> 3:35:35.980]  a way to combat that.
[3:35:35.980 --> 3:35:40.660]  The media has to find a way to combat that, which is why now everywhere you look, everywhere,
[3:35:40.660 --> 3:35:45.760]  including many alternative media outlets are now talking about this Merck and this new
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:50.420]  drug that's about to get an FDA emergency use nod.
[3:35:50.420 --> 3:35:52.420]  It's a pill.
[3:35:52.420 --> 3:35:56.060]  And a lot of people are mistakenly thinking that this is some super ivermectin and they're
[3:35:56.060 --> 3:36:00.940]  probably thinking that because Pfizer is coming out with Pfizer Mectin while making the real
[3:36:00.940 --> 3:36:07.260]  ivermectin originally manufactured by Merck, unavailable for you, despite the fact that
[3:36:07.260 --> 3:36:14.060]  there is a lot of trend that shows ivermectin works as a COVID killer.
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:18.580]  So now they're rolling out this Merck pill that you can take.
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:23.100]  But as we've learned with the rollout of these poisonous shots deceptively called vaccines,
[3:36:23.100 --> 3:36:28.180]  there's always something dangerous lurking underneath with the pharmaceutical mass genocide
[3:36:28.180 --> 3:36:29.180]  cabal.
[3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:30.780]  Dr. Jane Ruby is here with us.
[3:36:30.780 --> 3:36:35.420]  She knows all about this Merck supposed wonder drug.
[3:36:35.420 --> 3:36:36.620]  What is this thing?
[3:36:36.620 --> 3:36:37.620]  And should people be wary?
[3:36:37.620 --> 3:36:42.780]  I mean, I am obviously it's being introduced by Big Pharma, but maybe I'm wrong.
[3:36:42.780 --> 3:36:43.780]  What is it?
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:51.980]  Well, Stu, let me update you and everyone else on what these companies are up to.
[3:36:51.980 --> 3:36:56.740]  Before I get to the Merck circus, let me just share with you, you mentioned Pfizer.
[3:36:56.740 --> 3:37:05.620]  Pfizer has a protease inhibitor, just some enzyme crap that they try to use in HIV.
[3:37:05.620 --> 3:37:09.460]  There's a number for it and it's supposedly stopping the virus from cutting open your
[3:37:09.460 --> 3:37:12.620]  cell and stealing your DNA so it can replicate yourself.
[3:37:12.620 --> 3:37:15.020]  But let me just tell you what they're up to in general.
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:19.100]  They're up to they want you to use the vaccine, vaccine quote.
[3:37:19.100 --> 3:37:21.780]  They want you to use their pill, the protease inhibitor.
[3:37:21.780 --> 3:37:23.860]  And they're also working on an IV version.
[3:37:23.860 --> 3:37:28.140]  And they've actually had the audacity to say that you will need to take all three of these
[3:37:28.140 --> 3:37:30.940]  simultaneously for an indefinite period of time.
[3:37:30.940 --> 3:37:36.500]  Okay, if people don't figure out that this is a really enough, okay, I don't know what
[3:37:36.500 --> 3:37:37.500]  will.
[3:37:37.500 --> 3:37:39.020]  So let me share with you what's going on with Merck.
[3:37:39.020 --> 3:37:41.860]  Yes, a hard not being out loud.
[3:37:41.860 --> 3:37:44.540]  I mean, how do how do you not laugh out loud?
[3:37:44.540 --> 3:37:46.060]  This is a lifetime subscription.
[3:37:46.060 --> 3:37:47.220]  It's a new religion.
[3:37:47.220 --> 3:37:48.460]  Everybody has to get a shot every week.
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:50.500]  You have to pray to Saint Fauci every Sunday.
[3:37:50.500 --> 3:37:54.940]  I mean, this is absolutely ridiculous in New York, the new governor instead of wearing
[3:37:54.940 --> 3:37:59.700]  a cross around her neck is now wearing a vaccinated script around her neck as she says that she
[3:37:59.700 --> 3:38:05.620]  needs people to go and be her apostles for shots in arms and go out and and prophesize
[3:38:05.620 --> 3:38:08.620]  how the world is going to end unless they take these vaccines.
[3:38:08.620 --> 3:38:11.420]  In the meanwhile, they're killing people.
[3:38:11.420 --> 3:38:16.660]  And now they want you to take this plus that plus this plus that when I don't know, I mean,
[3:38:16.660 --> 3:38:21.420]  this and every expert that I have talked to on this thing has explicitly said that pandemics
[3:38:21.420 --> 3:38:24.780]  have a lifespan of approximately 18 months.
[3:38:24.780 --> 3:38:29.220]  And had we done absolutely nothing, no matter how many people COVID-19 would have legitimately
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:31.460]  killed, we would be past it by now.
[3:38:31.460 --> 3:38:35.100]  We would be looking back and saying, I mean, wow, I can't believe that thing wiped out
[3:38:35.100 --> 3:38:36.100]  half of the planet.
[3:38:36.100 --> 3:38:37.100]  Thank God it's gone.
[3:38:37.100 --> 3:38:42.220]  If we have not responded at all, COVID-19 would be dead, done and over with, but these
[3:38:42.220 --> 3:38:46.780]  shots are making it linger and now these pills are going to be weakening people's immune
[3:38:46.780 --> 3:38:47.780]  systems.
[3:38:47.780 --> 3:38:48.860]  Are they not?
[3:38:48.860 --> 3:38:53.660]  I want to prepare people like you said, so you inform them they're empowered and they
[3:38:53.660 --> 3:38:55.260]  can make the right choices.
[3:38:55.260 --> 3:39:01.220]  Look, what Merck has done is it's put together a pill that it says it's it's it's basically
[3:39:01.220 --> 3:39:02.660]  a genetic manipulation.
[3:39:02.660 --> 3:39:04.380]  There's no question about it.
[3:39:04.380 --> 3:39:05.780]  It there's no control.
[3:39:05.780 --> 3:39:09.740]  What this thing does is it gets in and it kind of interrupts it.
[3:39:09.740 --> 3:39:15.020]  It switches around DNA behavior so that the virus can't replicate itself.
[3:39:15.020 --> 3:39:18.500]  And it's a joke because viruses don't have their own DNA.
[3:39:18.500 --> 3:39:22.060]  They use the host cell DNA to replicate themselves.
[3:39:22.060 --> 3:39:29.860]  So if you take this medication, the mechanism of action is to get into the DNA and to stop
[3:39:29.860 --> 3:39:33.420]  it from replicating or to change the code.
[3:39:33.420 --> 3:39:39.180]  So it's been proven in mammalian studies in animals, we're mammals, but it's been proven
[3:39:39.180 --> 3:39:42.860]  in studies that it does interfere with the DNA.
[3:39:42.860 --> 3:39:46.780]  This is essentially still a cancer causing treatment.
[3:39:46.780 --> 3:39:51.820]  So not only are you not going to prevent COVID, but you're going to give yourself essentially
[3:39:51.820 --> 3:39:53.460]  cancer.
[3:39:53.460 --> 3:39:56.100]  And let me just share a couple other things about it.
[3:39:56.100 --> 3:40:03.060]  It's a perfect setup for for carcinogenic and teratogenic, which is a birth defects
[3:40:03.060 --> 3:40:04.060]  to happen.
[3:40:04.060 --> 3:40:10.540]  And in 2020, there was a scientist named Rick Bright, who worked for the Trump administration.
[3:40:10.540 --> 3:40:15.740]  He became a whistleblower because he wanted to raise the red flag and he said, do not
[3:40:15.740 --> 3:40:21.060]  advance this drug, Molnupiravir, okay, this new Merck drug.
[3:40:21.060 --> 3:40:25.420]  Do not advance this into fast track because this thing is not safe.
[3:40:25.420 --> 3:40:29.340]  It is interfering with the normal replication of your body cells.
[3:40:29.340 --> 3:40:31.460]  You know, your body renews itself.
[3:40:31.460 --> 3:40:33.820]  It needs its own DNA to do that.
[3:40:33.820 --> 3:40:37.820]  This medication essentially will interfere with that process.
[3:40:37.820 --> 3:40:41.780]  And in the animal studies, there were loads of cancers.
[3:40:41.780 --> 3:40:45.140]  So this Rick Bright actually got fired.
[3:40:45.140 --> 3:40:49.460]  He was ignored by the Trump administration and the drug, the drug went on.
[3:40:49.460 --> 3:40:51.380]  I want people to understand something.
[3:40:51.380 --> 3:40:55.340]  The federal government with your tax dollars has promised Merck that if they get their
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:40:59.860]  emergency use authorization, which by the way, they're about to apply for any minute
[3:40:59.860 --> 3:41:05.140]  that they, the government has promised to buy $1.2 billion worth of this drug.
[3:41:05.140 --> 3:41:08.740]  You don't think they're going to try to mandate Molnupiravir?
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:10.340]  I mean, come on, give me a break.
[3:41:10.340 --> 3:41:13.980]  And they had some independent advisory board in the FDA.
[3:41:13.980 --> 3:41:15.860]  I've never even heard of that, okay.
[3:41:15.860 --> 3:41:22.100]  I'd love to know who's on that board that recommended to the FDA that they should indeed
[3:41:22.100 --> 3:41:25.860]  grant Merck this EUA from Molnupiravir.
[3:41:25.860 --> 3:41:28.860]  I mean, this is a dangerous medication.
[3:41:28.860 --> 3:41:31.900]  Just like Yogi Berra said, it's deja vu all over again.
[3:41:31.900 --> 3:41:33.500]  Here we go.
[3:41:33.500 --> 3:41:38.020]  They're playing on fear once again because fear paralyzes people.
[3:41:38.020 --> 3:41:46.580]  We have a virus with a nearly 100% survival rate that people are tripping over themselves,
[3:41:46.580 --> 3:41:51.820]  running physically, fighting to get to the front of a line to inject themselves with
[3:41:51.820 --> 3:41:58.820]  something that provides them with no immunity, that has extreme amounts of adverse events,
[3:41:58.820 --> 3:42:03.020]  including myocarditis and heart issues in young people.
[3:42:03.020 --> 3:42:04.780]  This thing is killing people.
[3:42:04.780 --> 3:42:09.300]  And now, because of the fear, they're able to raise the prices as was just shown on the
[3:42:09.300 --> 3:42:10.300]  screen here.
[3:42:10.300 --> 3:42:14.660]  This thing is going to be sold for exponentially more than what it cost to manufacture.
[3:42:14.660 --> 3:42:20.100]  And now, if you want to get your hands on ivermectin, you're not able to do that because the pharmacists
[3:42:20.100 --> 3:42:22.140]  are pulling it off the shelves.
[3:42:22.140 --> 3:42:26.820]  Pharmacies are no longer stocking their pharmacies with ivermectin.
[3:42:26.820 --> 3:42:31.060]  Pharmacies are telling doctors, I need a reason why you're prescribing this now, second guessing
[3:42:31.060 --> 3:42:37.060]  doctors for patients who have a valid prescription for ivermectin, no matter what it is.
[3:42:37.060 --> 3:42:42.540]  And now, instead, they're rolling out a pill to combat the fear of this coronavirus that
[3:42:42.540 --> 3:42:44.140]  now gives you cancer.
[3:42:44.140 --> 3:42:47.940]  And soon, there's going to be an injection for cancer as well.
[3:42:47.940 --> 3:42:51.860]  More with Dr. Jane Ruby in just a couple of minutes as we return on the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:51.860 --> 3:42:53.580]  My name is Stu Peters.
[3:42:53.580 --> 3:42:58.620]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[3:42:58.620 --> 3:43:02.260]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:43:02.260 --> 3:43:06.500]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[3:43:06.500 --> 3:43:11.660]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[3:43:11.660 --> 3:43:12.660]  effects.
[3:43:12.660 --> 3:43:18.300]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[3:43:18.300 --> 3:43:22.580]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:43:22.580 --> 3:43:27.260]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[3:43:27.260 --> 3:43:28.460]  loosen up a little.
[3:43:28.460 --> 3:43:33.380]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:43:33.380 --> 3:43:39.380]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[3:43:39.380 --> 3:43:45.500]  herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian
[3:43:45.500 --> 3:43:46.500]  root.
[3:43:46.500 --> 3:43:51.820]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWars
[3:43:51.820 --> 3:43:52.820] Store.com.
[3:43:52.820 --> 3:43:58.780]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[3:43:58.780 --> 3:44:05.740]  a compound that is naturally in nature, and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[3:44:05.740 --> 3:44:07.740]  It's called PQQ, or BiobQQ.
[3:44:07.740 --> 3:44:12.060]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[3:44:12.060 --> 3:44:14.900]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer.
[3:44:14.900 --> 3:44:18.780]  It doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer, they're basically the same thing.
[3:44:18.780 --> 3:44:22.060]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[3:44:22.060 --> 3:44:25.780]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[3:44:25.780 --> 3:44:30.620]  It's back in stock, the highest quality, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[3:44:30.620 --> 3:44:35.780]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your body last longer,
[3:44:35.780 --> 3:44:38.180]  and that is so incredibly important.
[3:44:38.180 --> 3:44:44.100]  We have it at 40% off, despite the fact it's been sold out for six months at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:44:44.100 --> 3:44:45.100]  It's amazing.
[3:44:45.100 --> 3:44:48.060]  If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus, you really should, and for those of you that love it,
[3:44:48.060 --> 3:44:55.300]  it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com, DNA Force Plus.
[3:44:55.300 --> 3:45:00.020]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[3:45:00.020 --> 3:45:05.740]  enslavement, and in that documentary I predicted the globalist would establish world government
[3:45:05.740 --> 3:45:11.100]  of releasing a virus, demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering
[3:45:11.100 --> 3:45:15.380]  a collapse of our industrial society, and now they've done it.
[3:45:15.380 --> 3:45:19.780]  How did I know they would do it? Because they wrote books and white papers, and many of
[3:45:19.780 --> 3:45:22.260]  their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[3:45:22.260 --> 3:45:27.380]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab,
[3:45:27.380 --> 3:45:31.860]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this
[3:45:31.860 --> 3:45:32.860]  great reset.
[3:45:32.860 --> 3:45:34.580]  Well, we're now living in it.
[3:45:34.580 --> 3:45:39.100]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, known as Ash, is a tyrannical
[3:45:39.100 --> 3:45:40.100]  corporate world government.
[3:45:40.100 --> 3:45:46.340]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally more
[3:45:46.340 --> 3:45:52.340]  and more deadly injections of poison masquerading as vaccines to poison us and depopulate us.
[3:45:52.340 --> 3:45:55.500]  This is what InfoWars is fighting, we're fighting for the future.
[3:45:55.500 --> 3:45:59.780]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[3:45:59.780 --> 3:46:04.040]  of these employees, because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:09.060]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[3:46:09.060 --> 3:46:12.180]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[3:46:12.180 --> 3:46:15.540]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[3:46:15.540 --> 3:46:17.060]  That taxes the heart.
[3:46:17.060 --> 3:46:18.500]  It taxes the lungs.
[3:46:18.500 --> 3:46:23.020]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and
[3:46:23.020 --> 3:46:29.780]  nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[3:46:29.780 --> 3:46:32.020]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[3:46:32.020 --> 3:46:33.940]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[3:46:33.940 --> 3:46:37.780]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up
[3:46:37.780 --> 3:46:42.900]  to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[3:46:42.900 --> 3:46:45.540]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[3:46:45.540 --> 3:46:49.700]  But the only way the real science can sound to the public is if we tell them, get your
[3:46:49.700 --> 3:46:52.660]  copy today of COVIDLand and expose them.
[3:46:52.660 --> 3:46:53.940]  It's covidland.com.
[3:46:53.940 --> 3:46:57.860]  Go there now.
[3:46:57.860 --> 3:47:15.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show on Shroyer coming up next.
[3:47:15.620 --> 3:47:18.260]  He's promised a powerful guest in studio.
[3:47:18.260 --> 3:47:23.500]  He'll be in the Alex Jones show studio for the war room that's coming up here shortly.
[3:47:23.500 --> 3:47:28.260]  Some stats before we get back here to Dr. Gene Ruby that I was looking at here.
[3:47:28.260 --> 3:47:34.060]  You should keep this in mind when we're talking about immunity and antibodies not counting.
[3:47:34.060 --> 3:47:36.420]  But you've got to take this vaccine.
[3:47:36.420 --> 3:47:40.500]  And if you don't take this vaccine, your life is going to be made of living hell, right?
[3:47:40.500 --> 3:47:45.140]  Well, how come that doesn't apply to 6,000 White House staff and Congress, which I'm
[3:47:45.140 --> 3:47:47.300]  sure that this has been talked about the hypocrisy here.
[3:47:47.300 --> 3:47:51.300]  Two million illegal immigrants at the southern border are not being forced to take this jab
[3:47:51.300 --> 3:47:53.660]  upon entry and they're being given ivermectin.
[3:47:53.660 --> 3:47:55.620]  That's really weird, because I can't get it.
[3:47:55.620 --> 3:48:00.580]  Eight million Chinese students in the United States, they're immune from these mandates.
[3:48:00.580 --> 3:48:04.900]  Eight million Chinese students in the United States, meanwhile, American and Canadian students
[3:48:04.900 --> 3:48:07.700]  are told that they have to get the jab before they're allowed to return to campus and complete
[3:48:07.700 --> 3:48:08.700]  their degree.
[3:48:08.700 --> 3:48:13.100]  500,000 homeless people, no, no jab for you.
[3:48:13.100 --> 3:48:19.980]  In Canada, two-thirds of the federal government is not mandated, which is about 200,000 employees.
[3:48:19.980 --> 3:48:24.140]  Does anyone have an explanation for any of that, other than they know something that
[3:48:24.140 --> 3:48:25.140]  we don't?
[3:48:25.140 --> 3:48:28.420]  Dr. Jane Ruby has been with us and she joins us again now.
[3:48:28.420 --> 3:48:33.380]  We're talking about this, let me see if I can pronounce this right, malnupiravir, which
[3:48:33.380 --> 3:48:38.900]  is a pill that you have to take or that you can take in lieu of the vaccine or along with
[3:48:38.900 --> 3:48:39.900]  these shots.
[3:48:39.900 --> 3:48:42.940]  I don't know, we're going to be taking all kinds of drugs.
[3:48:42.940 --> 3:48:45.940]  The government will soon be in my bathroom stuffing everything I need in my medicine
[3:48:45.940 --> 3:48:46.940]  cabinet.
[3:48:46.940 --> 3:48:48.540]  I'm certain of it.
[3:48:48.540 --> 3:48:53.060]  I want to get into some myocarditis stuff, but you have something more on this murk you
[3:48:53.060 --> 3:48:55.180]  were telling me during the break, go ahead.
[3:48:55.180 --> 3:49:01.140]  I just want to make sure, Stu, that people understand viruses do not have their own DNA.
[3:49:01.140 --> 3:49:06.980]  They infect you and they suck out, they use your DNA to replicate themselves.
[3:49:06.980 --> 3:49:11.900]  Malnupiravir forces copy errors, that's the mechanism of action.
[3:49:11.900 --> 3:49:16.700]  It forces copy errors in the virus's attempt to multiply itself.
[3:49:16.700 --> 3:49:18.460]  What could go wrong, right?
[3:49:18.460 --> 3:49:24.740]  By the way, all of these studies are predicated on the PCR test, which the CDC has recalled.
[3:49:24.740 --> 3:49:25.820]  It's disgusting.
[3:49:25.820 --> 3:49:29.820]  The company has essentially publicly lied, and let me read a few of the quotes by the
[3:49:29.820 --> 3:49:31.420]  company.
[3:49:31.420 --> 3:49:37.340]  This does not interfere with the virus's genetic code, lie.
[3:49:37.340 --> 3:49:41.140]  It does not do this in human cells, false.
[3:49:41.140 --> 3:49:45.460]  There's no long-term data, by the way, on cancer, and they also said there's no evidence
[3:49:45.460 --> 3:49:49.420]  of potential, rather, for cancer-causing.
[3:49:49.420 --> 3:49:52.300]  This drug is not capable of inducing genetic changes.
[3:49:52.300 --> 3:49:55.180]  Stu, that's the mechanism of action.
[3:49:55.180 --> 3:49:57.620]  They can't deny their own mechanism of action.
[3:49:57.620 --> 3:50:02.660]  Let me read to you just a couple of titles of studies that are already out on this warning.
[3:50:02.660 --> 3:50:09.260]  Some of them read like this drug inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and vitro means under
[3:50:09.260 --> 3:50:10.260]  a glass.
[3:50:10.260 --> 3:50:14.740]  That means they never tested it in a living, dynamic human being, but is mutinogenic, meaning
[3:50:14.740 --> 3:50:18.980]  cancer-causing in mammalian cells.
[3:50:18.980 --> 3:50:21.580]  Malnutriereview may cause cancer.
[3:50:21.580 --> 3:50:23.740]  You just read down the list.
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:26.940]  I'm telling everybody, this is not a panacea.
[3:50:26.940 --> 3:50:28.260]  This is not a magic pill.
[3:50:28.260 --> 3:50:30.580]  Oh, we can get rid of vaccines.
[3:50:30.580 --> 3:50:31.580]  No.
[3:50:31.580 --> 3:50:36.220]  No, you're going to be, like Stu said, you're going to be forced into cocktails and cocktails
[3:50:36.220 --> 3:50:37.220]  and cocktails.
[3:50:37.220 --> 3:50:38.220]  Anyway.
[3:50:38.220 --> 3:50:45.820]  So people who have signed up for these injections have signed up for a lifetime subscription
[3:50:45.820 --> 3:50:52.980]  to shots and to treatments, to all of these things that are not vaccines because they
[3:50:52.980 --> 3:50:57.060]  are now immunocompromised as a result of the shot and the genetic change.
[3:50:57.060 --> 3:51:01.540]  This is why we talk about things like antibody-dependent enhancement when these people who've been
[3:51:01.540 --> 3:51:05.780]  inoculated get reintroduced to new viruses this fall as we're now getting into the real
[3:51:05.780 --> 3:51:10.940]  flu season, which is the killer for our kids, then they're going to experience all kinds
[3:51:10.940 --> 3:51:13.060]  of different things, massive organ failure and all of that.
[3:51:13.060 --> 3:51:19.580]  But I want to focus on our youngsters because kiddos are our whole purpose in life.
[3:51:19.580 --> 3:51:26.620]  At least speaking for myself, my kids are the most important thing in my life only second
[3:51:26.620 --> 3:51:27.620]  to God.
[3:51:27.620 --> 3:51:30.540]  So it's important to me to protect them.
[3:51:30.540 --> 3:51:35.340]  And as I look to California and I see that entire school districts are being mandated
[3:51:35.340 --> 3:51:39.100]  and then you look to New York and you see Governor or excuse me, Mayor de Blasio, the
[3:51:39.100 --> 3:51:44.180]  clown, the Communist tyrant forcing everybody to take these injections.
[3:51:44.180 --> 3:51:45.980]  Now there's lawsuits going on there.
[3:51:45.980 --> 3:51:48.820]  So we know a lot about our kids.
[3:51:48.820 --> 3:51:53.980]  We know a lot about the age group, 12 to 17 in myocarditis.
[3:51:53.980 --> 3:51:56.580]  Are these numbers leveling out?
[3:51:56.580 --> 3:51:58.820]  Are these numbers exploding?
[3:51:58.820 --> 3:52:04.700]  Is this being overstated when I'm on the show warning about this side effect in our kids?
[3:52:04.700 --> 3:52:07.260]  Or is this a legitimate concern?
[3:52:07.260 --> 3:52:11.380]  Stu, they're exploding.
[3:52:11.380 --> 3:52:19.340]  Especially now that the 12 to 15 year old rollout for these shots is well underway.
[3:52:19.340 --> 3:52:20.980]  I just have to implore parents.
[3:52:20.980 --> 3:52:25.140]  Honestly, God, you just don't know what you're doing when you're tripping over yourself to
[3:52:25.140 --> 3:52:30.420]  shove your 12, 13, 14 year old, 15 year old into these, you know, these shot clinics.
[3:52:30.420 --> 3:52:33.380]  I'm telling you right now, the numbers have exploded.
[3:52:33.380 --> 3:52:36.540]  They're literally 20 times higher than the expected rate.
[3:52:36.540 --> 3:52:43.020]  The expected rate is defined as sort of that background rate that came out of, you know,
[3:52:43.020 --> 3:52:46.820]  the little bit of pivotal trial work that these companies did.
[3:52:46.820 --> 3:52:51.100]  And we're looking at the ages in VAERS from 13 to 23.
[3:52:51.100 --> 3:53:00.340]  Look, Stu, 80% of males between 13 and 23 are getting, I'm sorry, the afflicted are
[3:53:00.340 --> 3:53:01.820]  80% are males.
[3:53:01.820 --> 3:53:05.140]  So look, you're, you're marching your teen boy in there.
[3:53:05.140 --> 3:53:06.900]  You've got a huge risk.
[3:53:06.900 --> 3:53:13.100]  You've got a huge percentage rate of myocarditis and I want to remind people myocarditis is
[3:53:13.100 --> 3:53:14.500]  not just one and done.
[3:53:14.500 --> 3:53:15.500]  Hey, I feel better.
[3:53:15.500 --> 3:53:16.500]  I'm going home.
[3:53:16.500 --> 3:53:17.700]  It's like a common cold.
[3:53:17.700 --> 3:53:23.700]  The inflammation itself leaves behind fibrotic changes, changes in the chemical composition.
[3:53:23.700 --> 3:53:27.460]  Your heart is an electrochemical organ.
[3:53:27.460 --> 3:53:34.780]  It depends on, you know, all kinds of electrical charges and it's all controlled by chemical,
[3:53:34.780 --> 3:53:36.340]  your sodium, your potassium.
[3:53:36.340 --> 3:53:37.540]  These things get disrupted.
[3:53:37.540 --> 3:53:39.140]  The pathways get disrupted.
[3:53:39.140 --> 3:53:46.740]  You are subjecting your child if he gets myocarditis with years of, well, hopefully many years,
[3:53:46.740 --> 3:53:52.380]  but years, unfortunately, of, you know, feeling tired back and forth to the cardiologist.
[3:53:52.380 --> 3:53:53.380]  Lots of damage.
[3:53:53.380 --> 3:53:54.820]  It's irreversible damage, Stu.
[3:53:54.820 --> 3:53:58.020]  It's like, it's like scar tissue in the, in the heart.
[3:53:58.020 --> 3:54:00.100]  The heart is a tire, entirely muscle.
[3:54:00.100 --> 3:54:01.100]  It's scar.
[3:54:01.100 --> 3:54:07.580]  I've been talking about this for a really long time and we all have.
[3:54:07.580 --> 3:54:12.380]  And of course, we're, we're, we're framed in a light.
[3:54:12.380 --> 3:54:17.380]  You know, this is all a big conspiracy, you know, and then you look over at the DOD again
[3:54:17.380 --> 3:54:22.860]  today and you look at patents and Karen Kingston brings forward who's a biotech analyst, a
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:24.940]  former Pfizer employee.
[3:54:24.940 --> 3:54:34.700]  She tells me today that the DOD Joint Artificial Intelligence Office is tracking COVID vaccine
[3:54:34.700 --> 3:54:35.700]  deaths.
[3:54:35.700 --> 3:54:40.220]  But Cyrus Parza just yesterday was a big conspiracy theorist for saying that there's some sort
[3:54:40.220 --> 3:54:44.500]  of an artificial intelligence extinction plan with these shots.
[3:54:44.500 --> 3:54:51.500]  You have to be as, as a pharmaceutical professional, as an expert in, in the medical field, in
[3:54:51.500 --> 3:54:58.500]  the pharmaceutical field specifically, you have to be extremely responsible with the
[3:54:58.500 --> 3:55:01.460]  things that you say.
[3:55:01.460 --> 3:55:03.180]  And you know, I don't so much.
[3:55:03.180 --> 3:55:06.300]  I can just wear it on my sleeve and say it how I see it.
[3:55:06.300 --> 3:55:07.980]  And if I'm, if I'm right, I'm right.
[3:55:07.980 --> 3:55:08.980]  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:11.900]  Most of the time we've been right.
[3:55:11.900 --> 3:55:19.700]  But I see this as an intentional, diabolical, sinister plan, including with this new Merck
[3:55:19.700 --> 3:55:23.820]  thing, because you mentioned something that really caught my attention.
[3:55:23.820 --> 3:55:30.540]  You said that there were problems with the reproductive system or there was, there was
[3:55:30.540 --> 3:55:33.820]  some sort of an issue with that, with this Merck thing.
[3:55:33.820 --> 3:55:36.420]  And we're seeing the same thing with these shots.
[3:55:36.420 --> 3:55:42.380]  They're impacting women's and girls' reproductive ability, making them infertile.
[3:55:42.380 --> 3:55:49.180]  Now we're seeing a ton of these guys, their balls are swelling up super huge, right?
[3:55:49.180 --> 3:55:53.380]  There's all this testicular inflammation going on, weird things happening.
[3:55:53.380 --> 3:55:58.740]  Meanwhile, the guy responsible for all of this, Bill Gates, tells the entire world right
[3:55:58.740 --> 3:56:01.500]  on the wide open that we need to depopulate.
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:07.180]  So in a responsible type of way, I mean, and real quickly, because I got a minute, do you,
[3:56:07.180 --> 3:56:09.460]  do you think that I'm being hyperbolic?
[3:56:09.460 --> 3:56:12.420]  Am I wearing some tinfoil hat here?
[3:56:12.420 --> 3:56:19.580]  Or is this, do you view this as being evil and intentional?
[3:56:19.580 --> 3:56:26.620]  Stu, I have to say that from my, my perspective as a medical professional and a pharma develop,
[3:56:26.620 --> 3:56:32.660]  drug development, there's no therapeutics to these shots, to these pills.
[3:56:32.660 --> 3:56:34.540]  There's nothing beneficial.
[3:56:34.540 --> 3:56:40.100]  Instead, we're going to be looking at, we're looking, we're looking now at permanent heart
[3:56:40.100 --> 3:56:42.220]  damage in young teens.
[3:56:42.220 --> 3:56:49.540]  We're looking at miscarriages, birth defects, strokes, heart attacks.
[3:56:49.540 --> 3:56:57.180]  The volume is incredible and it tells me I can't deduce anything other than this is intentional.
[3:56:57.180 --> 3:57:01.620]  And I'm particularly concerned, I'm concerned about everybody and everything, but I'm concerned
[3:57:01.620 --> 3:57:02.700]  about our military.
[3:57:02.700 --> 3:57:06.660]  Our military could potentially be decimated right in front of our eyes.
[3:57:06.660 --> 3:57:10.980]  They're going to be also mandated to take these cocktails.
[3:57:10.980 --> 3:57:14.000]  If they don't leave now and reject it.
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:18.140]  And once they're kicked out, they're going to be replaced by three people who will and
[3:57:18.140 --> 3:57:23.060]  then they'll march in line and they will help to inject everybody in this country or around
[3:57:23.060 --> 3:57:25.060]  the planet.
[3:57:25.060 --> 3:57:27.500]  That's the way to take over without firing a shot.
[3:57:27.500 --> 3:57:31.100]  The threat of the military, the threat of prosecution, the threat of being criminalized
[3:57:31.100 --> 3:57:34.740]  for going to a school board meeting, that is the state of America in 2021.
[3:57:34.740 --> 3:57:38.980]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you for your constant responsible reporting on all of this and for
[3:57:38.980 --> 3:57:39.980]  joining us today.
[3:57:39.980 --> 3:57:43.260]  My name is Stu Peters, fourth hour of Alex Jones, the war room is up next, stick around.
