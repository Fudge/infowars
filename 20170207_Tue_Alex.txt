[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  This world can't disagree, they don't understand how it can be.
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20.000 --> 00:29.000]  And it's not my part of you, it's a fact, and you know that it's true.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  Gentlemen, it's Tuesday, February 7th, 2017.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  And we've got stunning information and documentation today to break down
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  as we give you the latest analysis of the global war taking place against the huge mega corporations
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  and their attempt to establish a out of control oppressive technocracy.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  I'm going to get into all the news, and I mean all of it coming up in the next segment.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.000]  I want to talk about something that affects us all, and that's life and death.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  A lot of people I talk to never even get to meet any of their grandparents, much less all four of them.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  And my grandmother was almost 93 years old when she died this morning at about 130,
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  and she was still cogent a few days ago when I went and visited with her.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  But she'd had breast cancer for about six years.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  She'd had breast cancer before, and they'd removed part of her breast.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  She got breast cancer six, seven years ago and decided to not be operated on
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  and that she would just go home when God was ready for her.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  And at almost 93 years of age last night, she went home to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  But the reason it's important is I don't really cry for the 93-year-old woman
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  who I knew my whole life and loved so much and who taught me so much.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  I cry for the 30-year-old woman who went and got the second round of polio shots
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  when my mother was four years old and her brother was nine years old
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  that paralyzed her and almost killed her and took her years to be able to walk again.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  She was a beauty queen.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  And then I think about the SV-40 cancer viruses that were admittedly in that vaccine as well
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  and to think about how they soft killed my grandmother way back in the early 1950s.
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  So they got her way back in the early 1950s when she was 30 years old.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Everybody should really think about that and think about what vaccines are doing to people today,
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  especially our military, that are shot up with so many experimental ones as well.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  And I just think about how magic it is to have all these great ancestors
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  and to know that I'll have progeny into the future and I'll be one of their ancestors.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  I just want to deliver for humanity and really build something beautiful and great.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  And so did my grandmother.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  And all four of my grandparents were great, interesting people in different ways.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  I really can't say who my favorite was of any of them, but it's just great that I knew them.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  And I hope spiritually that I can resonate to the plane that they're going to be on
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  with God and transcend this fallen plane we're on and be with her again.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  She was very, very a few days ago.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  She'd be conscious talking about things, be completely there,
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  and then just suddenly be somewhere completely else, talking to her dead brother
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  and talking to other members of her family.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  So she believed she was already in heaven.
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  And I think about Colonel Craig Roberts, who was a Marine Corps sniper and veteran helicopter pilot,
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  investigator, and best-selling author, sniper, one-shot, one-kill,
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  who exposed Oklahoma City as an inside job and so much more
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  and the murder of police officers by the Clinton mafia to cover it up.
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  And he died for about 10 minutes on the operating table for colon cancer
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  and was there at the portal with the angel.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  The decision was made to send him back.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  They'd already walked off and he came back to life.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  And atheists, people that don't believe in God and people that are in other cultures,
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  they have that same near-death or death experience.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  So just know this, there's a lot going on in this world,
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  but I just want my grandmother to know that I love her and I appreciate her
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  and I can still feel her presence now and so I can feel my first grandparents
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  that went Jerry Jones, my dad's dad, back when I was only six years old.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  And it's just good that I will carry them forward with me.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  I hope my children will carry forth my energy and my spirit with them
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  just as they carry my genetics.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  And so let's just all think about our fallen grandparents
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  and of course our parents and everyone we love.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  But you know, the most important thing to do is to reach out for the young today
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  that are under all the GMO and all the chemical attack and all the cultural attack
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  and defend them because that's who really matters.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  He is the young. They are the future.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  After all, we were all young ones.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  As double standards pleaded all night for their colleagues to vote no
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  on DeVos becoming Secretary of Education.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  I'll admit, there were some good points brought up by the double standards against DeVos,
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  a rarity indeed.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  But if the double standards hadn't been like the boy who cried wolf for the last year and a half,
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  Trump is Hitler, Trump is racist, Russian hacking, Republicans won't accept results,
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  there's a Muslim ban, then maybe their effort to stop DeVos could work.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  But they've been the boy who cried wolf for far too long
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  and no one wants to hear the wolf story again from the double standards.

[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls and our minds.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  We have to be good. We have to be pure. We have to be strong.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  We have to build prosperity.
[08:30.000 --> 08:40.000]  We have to bring every one of every race, color, and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  Yes, we've won the first face, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[08:48.000 --> 08:56.000]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[08:56.000 --> 09:13.000]  This is the heart of 1776. Get a white male!
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  Move, kids! Get out of the way!
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  Info warriors help to rule the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking out loud.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.000]  The bullying of the so-called left and how that ties into the legislature of the state, the dean of UC Berkeley,
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  defending the physical attack on people that they don't agree with.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  So that's all coming up today.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  First off, there's a tactic that the mainstream media is using where they pretend that Info Wars is discredited and not cutting edge.
[10:47.000 --> 10:55.000]  And then they connect that to Trump and pretend that he's discredited, hoping to split Trump off from his base.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  Now, Trump knows they're doing this, but they every day say, Alex Jones is Trump's brain.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  Trump is everything from Alex Jones. No, Trump has agreed with me on a few things that are overwhelmingly documented.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  Trump is his own person. I don't say that because I don't want to sit here and make the president mad.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  I say that because it's true. But clearly they're trying to hurt Trump by driving him away from his base.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  It's not working. He's delivering in spades.
[11:20.000 --> 11:31.000]  But every day I see scores of these articles. Info Wars is behind President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks, the Washington Post.
[11:31.000 --> 11:41.000]  Then they show headlines where myself, Paul Watson, and countless others, but they only show screenshots.
[11:41.000 --> 11:55.000]  You can't go see it for yourself. It's a screenshot where we go show where police chiefs, the FBI, you name it, are told to cover up the fact that Islamists are carrying out attacks just like San Bernardino.
[11:55.000 --> 12:06.000]  Now, the truth is, Trump has trolled the media when he spoke at Central Command in Florida yesterday at their headquarters because he knows they'll bring all this out now and lose this debate.
[12:06.000 --> 12:15.000]  He trolled them. He baited them. I wish I was that smart. See, that's the Trump dimension. He knows everything I know and then knows how to really play these people.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  I mean, I know how to play them too, but I don't know how he has the energy at 70 years old. It's just incredible.
[12:21.000 --> 12:28.000]  And this is all coming from Trump. That's what's amazing. I mean, some of it's Bannon, but notice that they keep saying, Bannon is Trump's brain.
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.000]  Bannon makes all the decisions. Now, Bannon goes and researches the laws to carry out the plan of Trump.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  So, yes, he's there assisting him, just like the magician's assistant, but it's not Bannon running the show.
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.000]  It's not Roger Stone running the show. It's not Alex Jones running the show. It's not Matt Dredge running the show. It's Trump.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  President Trump made a whopper. Oh, another whopper like illegals vote.
[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  I have George Soros publicly organizing illegals to vote today, announcing it himself.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  They have all these states trying to pass laws for illegals to vote, and they look at us and go, there's no illegals voting.
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  There's no people voting in dead people's names, even though you get caught. There's no Atlantic Ocean. There's no sun at high noon. There's no...
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's gotten to a point where there's not even being reported, he said, at military leaders U.S. Central Command.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  So then they go on to say, oh, here's where he got it. They got it from Alex Jones.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  Again, pretending they control reality, pretending they define things, and saying info wars is discredited.
[13:42.000 --> 13:51.000]  And thus, by extension, Trump. When the more Trump embraces the new media and the independent media, the more he will continue to get this agenda done.
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  I mean, take Matt Drudge. If you didn't have Matt Drudge, and MSM actually even got this right last year, then Trump wouldn't have gotten elected.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  Because info wars is strong, but we don't have the total dominance of Drudge to force a meme or a topic out there.
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.000]  We can do it sometimes, but not every time. So if it wasn't for info wars, and Drudge, and Breitbart, and Trump knows that, he wouldn't be in the position he's in.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  So the media thinks Trump's dumb and is trying to cut him off from his base and from the fount of his agenda, which is Americana Constitution.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  So I'm going to go through a whole stack of news documenting.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  I mean, Homeland Security was told eight years ago, do not say Islamic terror.
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  And when you stop somebody, you can't ask where they're coming from, or if they're a Wahhabist, or look on their cell phones.
[14:43.000 --> 14:53.000]  So you're coming from Yemen, you're coming from Saudi Arabia, you're coming from Sudan, you're coming from places that are war zones, like Somalia, a totally failed state.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  And you can't even ask when it comes up in a data sheet that you're al-Qaeda, are you with al-Qaeda?
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  They can ask me if I'm part of a criminal group, they can ask me if I've got drugs, they can ask me if I've got fruits and vegetables, but you can't ask the Islamists this.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  They're actually in the news saying, oh, Trump may lose his appeal now, because he mentioned Islam.
[15:11.000 --> 15:22.000]  Congress will make no law respecting establishment of religion, or whatever the exercise they're of, but you can bar someone that's part of a religious group that its tenant is to bomb and kill innocents.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  That's a cult, comprende, not a violation of the First Amendment.
[15:26.000 --> 15:35.000]  When you've sworn allegiance to a murderous military death cult, you don't have a right to come here, just like every other nation has a right to bar whoever they want.
[15:35.000 --> 15:48.000]  And it's clear in law what they're saying now through the courts is, oh no, we can open up to anybody we want, anybody can come here, which is globalism, which is the end of our sovereignty.
[15:48.000 --> 15:56.000]  So, M4 Wars is by President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks, and that was on CNN last night, this morning it's everywhere.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  And sure, it gives us a little bit of traffic, but they have dwindling audiences of idiots.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  This is mainly a Psyop, so that Spicer and people read this and go, look, Mr. President, more about how Alex Jones is your boss.
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.000]  Don't listen to him, go with the mainline Republicans, listen to Priebus, that goes on, by the way, behind the scenes.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  Word for word. So, we're going to be getting into that whole stack.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  We're going to be getting into how Starbucks in Saudi Arabia won't serve women, but Starbucks is fine with that.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  They just want to create racial division here in America and above, how our country is so bad.
[16:32.000 --> 16:41.000]  We're also going to get into the dollar jumping and stock market going back up to all-time highs, despite the fact that Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bloomberg,
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  all these suspects have been trying to drive the dollar down with Soros.
[16:45.000 --> 16:53.000]  It failed again, turkeys, and more major TV sets that are coming out admit they actually watch you in live time and listen to you and sell the data.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  Vizio's the latest, we'll tell you about that.
[16:56.000 --> 17:03.000]  Yeah, more fake news, we broke, we broke TVs watching and listening to you because it was in a Google press release to their shareholders.
[17:03.000 --> 17:13.000]  Fifteen years ago, Paul Watson broke that. Oh, it was fake news. For years, they said, Crazy Alex Jones, there's your TVs watching, listen to you.
[17:13.000 --> 17:21.000]  Yeah, I was so crazy, a Time Warner engineer who held patents, came and met with me pulling up as, you know, $200,000 Mercedes and said,
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  I just can't do it anymore, Alex. Here's the blueprints. The new scientific Atlantic cable boxes have microphones listening to you with keywords.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  Oh, oh, such fake news, all now proven correct.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  That's why we're exploding, you're contracting. I talked to Joe Rogan last night.
[17:37.000 --> 17:45.000]  He said, clearly, this is the biggest podcast in his seven and a half year history, dwarfing stuff that's been up there seven years.
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.000]  In fact, it's had, because you can't see on iTunes.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  I don't even know, Joe didn't tell me how to talk about this. I'm gonna go ahead and talk about it. I'm gonna skip this break to have time.
[17:55.000 --> 18:05.000]  Joe said it is definitely censorship, because he is all the top iTunes shows of all time, and they won't even let him have but a couple up there.
[18:05.000 --> 18:13.000]  Even though they say this is our top shows of all time, Joe has every top podcast of all time on there, but they will not even show it.
[18:13.000 --> 18:23.000]  And this one, they're purposely burying, because we mentioned Pizzagate, just like YouTube won't let it trend, even though it should have been number one on YouTube the first day
[18:23.000 --> 18:30.000]  and then gotten 20 million views, but they killed it where it was only on his channel, but you basically couldn't share it to the most viewed channels.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  It didn't take its place in poll position, so it only got 2.2 million or whatever.
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  So that's how they operate, that's how they censor, that's how they control.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  And Breitbart had its apps kicked off a month and a half ago off of iTunes.
[18:43.000 --> 18:51.000]  They paid for them years ago, they were there and they said, you're racist, we're kicking you off when there's nothing even racist there, which we always said.
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.000]  First they ban the racist, which I don't agree with, I don't agree with what they're saying, but if you ban them, everybody else is next.
[18:57.000 --> 19:05.000]  And now you notice, the Democrats can say, kill whites, whites are evil, whites are bad, whites say that.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  You're an effing white male, that's okay, that's loving.
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  But we can't even say that that's racist or we're shut down.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  We're all in this together.
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  And Trump's busy trying to keep the economy going, defend the borders.
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  I get exposing Obama's bill he signed to start restricting the press is down the road.
[19:29.000 --> 19:37.000]  I get Trump has bigger fish to fry than the fact that his own chief strategist news site is being censored.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  But this is a big deal for America and Trump needs to start addressing it, and he is.
[19:41.000 --> 19:49.000]  He's first is crediting the MSM that says Trump's crazy. We're not covering up Islamic attacks.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  We're not playing them down.
[19:50.000 --> 20:01.000]  The FBI two years before knew that the two San Bernardino shooters were going to Saudi Arabia and other countries to train for terror attacks and were threatened with civil rights criminal indictment.
[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  If they didn't drop investigations of the mosque, that came out a week after and the FBI leaked that they were told to say it wasn't terrorist.
[20:09.000 --> 20:18.000]  Even though they went to a Christmas party targeting Christians and Jews because of their religion, but that's okay.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  And on and on and on, they say it's not Islamic terror when they run over people or I mean this is crazy.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And then they go, oh my gosh, info wars is insane.
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.000]  It says we're covering up and Trump's insane for saying it.
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  No Trump just trolled you.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  You are the ones that are now talking about we don't cover up this.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  You cover up black on white crime statistics.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  Reporters all over the country have been told you cover up Islamic rapes and murders in Europe.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  More police unions are coming out and saying in Sweden and Germany.
[20:51.000 --> 20:59.000]  They've been ordered to cover it up and you've got the nerve to shake your finger at us and say we're covering.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  Oh, kind of like we said the polls were fake and Trump was going to win kind of like that.
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  Kind of like I said that George Soros was directed the Democrats to send out people to rough folks up at Trump events and then blame it on Trump.
[21:11.000 --> 21:20.000]  And exactly what I said came out because I have major sources in the Secret Service and in the Chicago PD.
[21:20.000 --> 21:32.000]  I mean, I don't want to tell you too much here, but let's just say we've got all the intel and we know exactly who's doing what.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  My problem is I'm so busy, I can't even go through all this stuff.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Let's go to this first video.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Trump trolls CNN into covering Islamic terror that they say doesn't exist.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  And when he says they're covering it up, they say, oh, ha, ha, ha, of course we cover Islamic terror.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Ooh, ha, ha, got you dummy.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  Here it is.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Police, this list of terror attacks.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  The president said the media is downplaying or not reporting on, right?
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.000]  That's right, Anderson. I have it right here. 78 attacks since September of 2014.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  And the White House is careful to say that most of these attacks were not reported on adequately enough.
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  But Anderson, just going through the list, there's no scoring system or grades to say, OK, these attacks.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  It's come out that the FBI and others are told to stand down and not call Islamic terror.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  I mean, we've had authors on that worked inside Homeland Security as senior analysts who were at the meetings where they were told.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  78 years ago, you will no longer say the word Islamic terror.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  It does not exist.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  And Anderson Cooper is CIA.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  The whole foundation left his arm of it.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  He went to Cairo and celebrated the Arab Spring that overthrew the country and murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  And we're going to go over all those names and all those documents in a moment.
[22:47.000 --> 22:53.000]  But Cooper and this other dingbat try to sit there and look shocked by this.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  Everybody knows you're con men, OK? Everybody knows you're frauds.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  You have a tiny audience, so get a bigger teleprompter.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Get a bigger studio, bro, because you aren't getting your job done.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  Yeah, the other dingbat is Jim Acosta. Here it is.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  We're covered adequately. These attacks were not.
[23:10.000 --> 23:18.000]  And most puzzling of all Anderson, inside this list, you see mentions of the Paris attacks where 129 people died.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  The San Bernardino terrorist attack, the Nice truck attack, and so on.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  And as you know, Anderson, these are all terrorist attacks that we covered days on end, not only here at CNN,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  but other international news outlets around the world.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  This is perfect, because the default is, say, Trump's a liar.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  So they come out and say, Trump's a liar. We cover all the 70-plus Islamic attacks.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Of course, we covered all these Islamic attacks.
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  And under it, if you're a radio listener, it says breaking White House releases lists of uncovered attacks.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  Again, White House releases lists of under-covered attacks.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  And then they put in parentheses, we covered many.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  So they're admitting they didn't even cover them all.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  And what we're saying is they under-report them.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  I mean, when a black guy kills a white guy, newspapers all over the country know,
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  you don't put a picture of who did it, and you don't say who they are.
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  And whenever they're looking for someone, most of the time they won't even say a Hispanic male or a black male.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  They'll just say that it's a white male. Everybody knows about this. This has been admitted.
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  So, again, Trump is a total genius how he is annihilating our enemy that is the foreign-owned, globalist corporate press.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Let's go back to these two jokers.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  This appears to be a talking point that is in search of a set of facts that just doesn't exist.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  The other thing we did not get an answer for is why the president made this claim today,
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  that the news media are not reporting on these attacks.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  He said, I think you know why to those military commanders today.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  But no explanation was given as to why the news-
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  Let's pause again. Let's back that up 10 seconds.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  No one knows why. He's saying the military, I think you know why.
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.000]  Because Sintkamp told him, and General Flynn told him, and General Mattis told him,
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.000]  and all the generals told him, sir, there's been a deal made with Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda to take over more than 50 countries.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  They've already invaded 16 of them. That was back at the time four years ago.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And we've got to stop them. They're now in 30-plus countries on that list, sir.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  We've been double-crossed, sir. They overthrew our ally, Egypt.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  They overthrew Qaddafi who'd made a deal with us. They're trying to overthrow Syria.
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.000]  They're trying to overrun Iraq. Sir, it's a major threat. We've got to stop it.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  They've been telling Trump that.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  Trump's had General Flynn and people telling him behind the scenes for three years.
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  A year before he ever announced running for president.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  Four and a half years ago, General Dempsey, the head of the Joint Chiefs, went to the White House and told Obama,
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  we're not going to be the Air Force for al-Qaeda. Remember all that in the news at the time?
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  So, oh, we don't know what Trump's talking about when he says the military. I think you know why.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  You know what, President Trump? Keep taking the gloves off.
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  Say you know why. Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS and the Saudi Arabian Caliphate expansion.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  And you are the ones that came to me and asked me to run for office to stop this.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  So now here we are, men. The gloves are off. No limits. We're taking them out.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  You really want the rest of the story? Cooper, hoping you and your idiot audience don't know what's happening?
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  Hoping there's still some dwindling group of morons that are low information and will still buy all of your posturing?
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  We don't know what he's talking about. Cooper was a cheerleader in the Middle East for al-Qaeda.
[26:37.000 --> 26:46.000]  Cooper is a monster. A total blood-sucking, robber baron, great-great-grandson, nobody.
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  An enemy of the Republic, every single one of these people who knows what they're doing consciously
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  is undermining this country, trying to crash the stock market, trying to cause race wars,
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  trying to get illegal aliens to vote. That's in the news today.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  Everyone outside their mouth, we're organizing illegals to vote, letting illegals vote, but there's no illegals voting.
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  Trump's insane. Every single one of them is now an enemy of the Republic. Back to him.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  You know why to those military commanders today, but no explanation was given as to why the news media would not report terrorist attacks
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  given all of our coverage. It's just not true. Jim McCartney, thank you very much.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  Jim said not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list the White House has released,
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  we cover them heavily. I know because I was there on the ground reporting a number of them.
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  360 was in Ottawa, Canada, October 2014. That's on the list.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  Where a gunman killed a reservist at the National War Memorial where he was on duty at the tomb of the unknown soldier.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  I was also in Orlando last June. That was on the list. Also, after 49 people were gunned down at the Pulse nightclub.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  But we can go back and show how you first reported for days that it wasn't Islamic.
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.000]  I never say it in San Bernardino or in Orlando. Everybody knows that and how it suddenly goes out of the news in a day or two.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  Hillary State Department blocked investigation to Orlando Killers Mosque. I mean, this was all in the news.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  And they go, oh, well, that's info wars with us all linking to the Florida newspapers.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  We're credible. They know it. Let's go out to break with Paul Watson. Here's Paul Watson.
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.000]  Media coverage of terror attacks is more like a cover up. Here it is from last year.
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  After the Munich shooting last Friday, almost every other media outlet included the name Ali in the name of this culprit.
[28:28.000 --> 28:36.000]  The BBC didn't, you know, hours after the priest beheading yesterday where we knew that they were shouting Allah Akbar.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  We knew that they were chanting pro-ISIS slogans. They were Muslims.
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  They were beheading people or at least slitting their throats. We knew it was an Islamist attack.
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.000]  Now was afterwards the BBC was still reporting no known motive.
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  And some people are just going to read that and say, oh, another attack. No, no motive. Who knows what's going on?
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  The world's crazy. Let's not focus on Islam. The true source of it. And then they'll move on.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  And then, oh, there's another attack. And let's hide. Let's obfuscate the true meaning behind that, the origin of that.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  So we see it every single time. The BBC is the worst for it.
[29:11.000 --> 29:20.000]  And I mean, I can read you something from the BBC yesterday. Listen to this. This is after, you know, four Islamist attacks in Germany.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  This is a quote from the BBC, not the onion.
[29:23.000 --> 29:32.000]  With four attacks in southern Germany coming shortly after the mass murder of 84 people in Nice, counterterrorism officials are struggling to detect a common thread.
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  Is there a single defining feature to these attacks that could offer clues on how to prevent more of them happening?
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  We'll be right back. Common thread.
[29:41.000 --> 29:49.000]  We'll be back, folks. But understand, they use this in the Washington Post to discredit us when it's total proof on them. You understand?
[29:49.000 --> 30:10.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:10.000 --> 30:22.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[30:27.000 --> 30:34.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.

[32:07.000 --> 32:13.000]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[32:22.000 --> 32:31.000]  New NSF EPA-certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses,
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  all forms of fluoride and much more.

[33:22.000 --> 33:47.000]  Alexander Duggan is going to be joining us in about 30 minutes.
[33:47.000 --> 33:55.000]  A long time advisor to President Putin. The mainstream media, the corporate media will call us Russian spies for having him on.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  No, it's called what cultures do is talk to each other if you don't want to have nuclear war.
[34:00.000 --> 34:09.000]  You know, like Hillary met secretly twice with Putin, but that's okay and her minions made deals to transfer uranium to Russia.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  But all that's okay when they actually sell us out. I don't blame Russia, that's part of their only interest.
[34:14.000 --> 34:24.000]  Trump is going to stand up for our interest. He's just not going to look for trouble and try to dominate Russia because he believes in national sovereignty and doesn't want to conquer Russia.
[34:24.000 --> 34:31.000]  He intends via trade, in other areas, to try to make money with Russia through commerce.
[34:31.000 --> 34:39.000]  And he will guarantee you watch because we have the leverage to get a better deal. But the deal they get will also help Russia.
[34:39.000 --> 34:52.000]  And it's okay for MSM to interview the guests that's coming up. But it will just be bad when I do. You watch tomorrow, it'll be Alex Jones is a Russian spy.
[34:52.000 --> 35:06.000]  Look, Duggan's named Alex, I'm named Alex. So much happening. Betsy DeVos has been confirmed in the Senate.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  That's some breaking news. Let me give you a bunch of other breaking news that's coming up.
[35:10.000 --> 35:18.000]  UK Speaker Vito's Trump addressed to parliament. Jamie White in FullWars.com, globalist claim that national sovereignty is racist.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  That's right, just a president or anybody saying who can come in the country is bad. Saudi Arabia can ban any refugees to their country.
[35:25.000 --> 35:34.000]  That's fine and not let women shop or go out in public loud hoods over their heads. And Starbucks just doesn't let you in in Saudi Arabia.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  But see, that's just their culture. It's okay.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  Overwhelming evidence proves Trump right about massive voter fraud. Dr. Jerome Corsi in FullWars.com story.
[35:44.000 --> 35:54.000]  Top Clinton lawyer joined Soros Super PAC to stop voter ID so illegals can vote. The Haitians are protesting the Clintons, but you'll never see that in the news.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  That's all coming up.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  China is proposing further tightening of internet oversight. That means ending free speech, but Reuters puts it like it's a good thing.
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  And the Vatican's caught having an organ harvesting meeting basically at their human rights board.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  Isn't that just cute? It's going to put the Saudi Arabians and the Yemenis over human rights at the UN.
[36:17.000 --> 36:27.000]  Let's put the big bad wolf over the three little pigs house or the fox over the hen house or let's put Hitler over the local Berlin synagogue.
[36:27.000 --> 36:37.000]  You know, let's put the devil over heaven. Let's put the state over humans and over God.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  Yeah, that's what it is. It's upside down world. That's all coming up.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  But the good news is they've been trying to drive down the stock market and drive down the dollar and have the opposite effect.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  Dollar jumps on rate bets, U.S. stocks and records, market rat Bloomberg.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  Not going too well. Is it for you?
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  But make no mistake, they're trying to bring things down.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  They're trying to blame Trump and other nationalist movements. They've told the Brexit movement.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  How dare you try to get out of the EU you never entered that we took over your country?
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  And how dare you not let us make 90 plus percent of your laws and open your borders?
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  We're going to destroy your economy. And they're trying.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  That's called terrorism, economic terrorism, bullying.
[37:19.000 --> 37:29.000]  And I've got stacks of articles where at universities, the universities are training the students on, quote, fight club to go out like hoodlums
[37:29.000 --> 37:41.000]  or like SA, Jens de Rome, storm troopers in proto Nazi Germany and beat people up in the streets while they stream.
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  Racist KKK, go away. Racist KKK, go away.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  I was at the LAX airport. I got a video of it of like women and children and families that like ate at night coming out to the curb in a cab.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  And here comes about 70 people just bumping in everyone and laughing.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  Just like Asian people and white people and black people are just like looking on. What the hell is this?
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  Black Lives Matter, racist KKK, Donald Trump, go away.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  Just bumping into people, running over people.
[38:12.000 --> 38:23.000]  The cops look all freaked out, marching at the head of them as they just ran over whoever they wanted and it was just like, this is just an exercise of like a temper tantrum of a two year old.
[38:23.000 --> 38:32.000]  And I remember Paul Watson's viral video a few years ago where he said millennials are like toddlers.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  It's just crazy. You're just standing there in a multiracial crowd of humans trying to get cabs.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  And here comes just people just, we're the good guys out of our way. Boom, I'm Indian. You're like, whoa.
[38:44.000 --> 38:52.000]  They walked by F.U. Alex showing some of me knew who I was and there's just still screaming KKK.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  All I'm trying to do is turn the economy back on and not let all the money go to the bankers.
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  Shut up KKK. You know, I don't want war with Russia. Shut up Russian agent.
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.000]  Oh, I saw these great memes I didn't get to yesterday because I let some agenda 21 news I read really get me down.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  I shouldn't let them get me down. But it was all these memes.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Maybe we can Google it. Russia lost the game for Atlanta.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  That's right. It was the Russians that caused the turnaround for Brady and everybody else.
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  And of course, you know, Trump, that's his favorite team. So obviously it's now about white supremacism.
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.000]  The news actually said a lot of people saying it's white supremacists because the the Patriots have the highest level of white players.
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  Oh my gosh, it's almost half the team isn't black. That's okay. It's whoever the best players are.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  People don't watch it and go, I'm rooting for the Patriots because they're white.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  But the media put that out and sure enough, some of the white supremacists go, yeah, that's true.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  Tom Brady's our avatar. So now the ball's rolling. You see, everything turns into something being racist.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Let me say this though. Some teams are like 80% black.
[40:06.000 --> 40:15.000]  Now, are we going to have affirmative action and say, well, you know, you need to give say a little Asian player from, let's say, Japan.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  You need to let some guy that weighs 100 pounds play out here or it's not fair because we need to give them a chance with affirmative action
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  because that's kind of where all this goes when I'm digressing.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  I'm going to break all this down here today.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  First, I want to get into some really bizarre senile behavior that's going on that that's actually frightening.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  And there's so many of these clips, I can't even get to all of them, but I'm going to I'm going to try to get some of these.
[40:39.000 --> 40:49.000]  But first off, my dad developed this with the biggest maker of organic toothpaste in the country, the private label it at their factory here in the United States.
[40:49.000 --> 41:01.000]  And we add to the leading brand out there, probably by info wars life iodine of the true nascent type and nano silver as well as peppermint and tea tree oil.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  We sold out of this last time in one week.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  We sold out. I had no idea that this would end up being probably the best seller.
[41:11.000 --> 41:18.000]  If this next batch sells like the last, it'll be the best seller we've ever had.
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  The best seller we've ever had.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  And again, it doesn't turn red like iodine because that's impure iodine. It turns grayish blue.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  Now, one thing the leading manufacturer did was put a natural dye in it because they're like, well, it isn't really super blues.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  Why are you calling it super blue? We're going to do this for you to make it turn blue or faster.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  We're like, no, that's coming out of this batch.
[41:41.000 --> 41:55.000]  Okay, because it turns gray. The point is, is that, is that it'll make your teeth super, super white and nobody's put true iodine in, in a toothpaste with colloidal silver, much less peppermint and tea tree oil.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  Now a lot of kids, we got complaints.
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.000]  The only complaints we got was a lot of kids don't like the super high concentration of peppermint.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  Adults like it. Kind of like a 10 year old doesn't like a shot of whiskey, but a 30 year old does, you know, doesn't burn.
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  Well, it's the same deal. We had a high level. It was basically their highest strength of, of, of, of herbs of this major brand.
[42:14.000 --> 42:26.000]  Everybody knows the name. When you private label, you can't say who the point is, is that this is a big fat tube of it in our own packaging with all these ingredients added by their experts.
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.000]  Super blue is now back in stock and we doubled the order and it's $9.95 out of the gates.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  And the purchase helps support the broadcast, but you've never had any toothpaste like this. This is undoubtedly the best toothpaste out there.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  You can go to infowarstore.com and read the reviews. They're 4.8 stars.
[42:45.000 --> 42:54.000]  The only thing with higher stars is the body armor. Thousands of pieces sold. It has a perfect 5.0 score.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  I'm sure that'll change. The trolls can go on there even though they have a bot stuff to do it, but it doesn't matter.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  Nanotech developed the University of Texas body armor, infowarstore.com. It's amazing.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  And the citizen armor has a 5.0. And it's made right here in the big defense labs.
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.000]  The police are starting to use this around the country. It weighs five to seven times less than the big armored plate, but it has slots for the plate.
[43:17.000 --> 43:26.000]  If you want that, it stops all pistol rounds up to 50 cal and we even shot stuff like 40 and 9 millimeter through rifles, through car beams, and it still wouldn't go through.
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  We can't say this, but technically, if you wore two of the inserts, it would stop high velocity rifles.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  In a couple hundred yards, it does, like 308 and Win Mags and stuff, but we can't obviously say that's guaranteed.
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.000]  You have to have two sets of this, but they're coming out with that soon. We're the only civilian dealer of this, ladies and gentlemen,
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  because we have connections and a lot of folks know how hard we fall from this country.
[43:50.000 --> 43:57.000]  And so we say five to the country. We mean domestically in the information war. So we've got, we've got the best stuff.
[43:57.000 --> 44:06.000]  Thanks to Tim Friget and Quentin Carter and of course, Pat Riley, busting their butts to bring so many game changing products like combat one,
[44:06.000 --> 44:13.000]  infowarstore.com, that only Defense Department has now adopted system wide as they're disinfectant, totally clean, natural, healthy.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  It's patented at secret ingredients, but it knocks out stuff.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  Evidence is showing even better than colloidal silver. The stuff just stops working.
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  So this is, it's got pads, wipes, sprays, creams. This is what they use it for cleaning rifles.
[44:27.000 --> 44:34.000]  They use it special operations to wipe their air ends. I mean, this stuff is amazing in the field to stop infection.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  And it's very low cost. Okay, because obviously it's been adopted by the Defense Department.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  They want it massively scaled up tactical baths, everything.
[44:45.000 --> 44:52.000]  So new. A lot of folks haven't reviewed even the combat one tactical bath yet. They've reviewed combat one, 1.7 ounce a bottle,
[44:52.000 --> 45:00.000]  field foam, field liquid, all of it infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  We had to end the 25% off the water filtration and the air purifiers, but still the price they are.
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  They're great deals, but get super blue today. Don't procrastinate.
[45:09.000 --> 45:18.000]  995. And believe me, folks, it cost us as much as the regular toothpaste costs just to make this because it's all supercharged.
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  We are getting bubblegum flavor that doesn't have the peppermint and some of the other herbs in it.
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  Obviously it won't be as good, but kids don't like high powered peppermint, which goes in there and just, you know,
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  absolutely gets those blood vessels going and so good for the body as well.
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.000]  Super blue infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  Thank you all for your game changing support.
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  Okay, let's get to some really frightening videos.
[45:49.000 --> 45:59.000]  We've all seen Maxine Waters say that she believes Putin actually tells Trump everything to do like drain the swamp or lock her up or
[45:59.000 --> 46:08.000]  Hillary for prison, that all came from Putin. Quite frankly, lock her up and Hillary for prison came from us and our audience.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  Our audience wearing Hillary for prison shirts, they started saying lock her up.
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.000]  So I can't even take credit for that, but that that I can tell you that didn't come from Putin or maybe we've got a Putin advisor coming on next segment.
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  Maybe or next hour, maybe it comes from the other Alex.
[46:25.000 --> 46:31.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down. We've got Pelosi saying, how do you make this mic work?
[46:31.000 --> 46:38.000]  But first, Nancy Pelosi promises to oppose President Bush's agenda so she doesn't even know it's President Trump.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  This woman had nothing when she went to Congress, she's almost worth a billion smackers now.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  Talk about sucking at the trough at the peep.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  And then Nancy Pelosi refuses to say the Democratic Party needs new leadership.
[46:49.000 --> 46:57.000]  And we've got Dingbat, Democrat, Maxine Waters hopes Trump won't serve four years thanks Putin invaded Korea.
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  I mean, she's up there going, he invaded Korea. I love it.
[47:01.000 --> 47:10.000]  My grandmother at almost 93 died last night and she was more together than Maxine Waters.
[47:10.000 --> 47:17.000]  My grandmother was really proud of the fact that we were a big talking to her this weekend.
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  She'd be like, you're doing big things. I'm so proud of you. Just stay humble.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  I was sitting there feeding her chocolate mousse.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  I was telling her, but I said, look, she's going soon. Just let her eat what she wants.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  Let her have ice cream is what she's asking for. Good Lord.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  Give her, try to want beer. She hadn't wanted beer in years. I want a beer.
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.000]  Oh boy. Again, let's go ahead and go to this meltdown of these entitled disconnected nutballs.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  Nancy Pelosi promises to oppose President Bush. She didn't even know what president it is. Here it is.
[47:50.000 --> 47:58.000]  This while it's only a couple of weeks since the inauguration, there's complete evidence.
[47:58.000 --> 48:05.000]  We've seen nothing that we can work, but I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed
[48:05.000 --> 48:11.000]  because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign,
[48:11.000 --> 48:19.000]  which turns out to be not true, a hoax, and really dangerous to the economic stability of America's working families.
[48:19.000 --> 48:26.000]  So there you go. Doesn't know what president's what. Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[48:26.000 --> 48:34.000]  What are we going to do? How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting,
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims,
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin,
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC,
[48:50.000 --> 49:04.000]  and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in a level.
[49:04.000 --> 49:15.000]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea,
[49:15.000 --> 49:24.000]  I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position where folks will begin to ask,
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  what are we going to do? And the answer is going to be, eventually, we've got to do something about him.
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.000]  We cannot continue to have a president who is acting in this manner.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  It is dangerous to the United States of America.
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  It is. I mean, to invade Korea. Do you believe President Trump invaded Korea with Putin?
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  And then that Guam had too many Marines on it and flipped capsized as well.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  We've got Pelosi saying, no, there doesn't need to be any new leadership.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  This is at the same press conference. Pelosi doesn't know who the president is.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  Maxine Waters thinks that Trump is working with Putin to invade Korea.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  They've got all these made-for-TV movies about Aleppo. Here it is.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  The issue of Democrats having lost touch with the Rust Belt with a lot of voters in there that used to be,
[50:12.000 --> 50:20.000]  and I guess I want to ask it this way, which is, does the Democratic Party need new leaders to touch base on this stuff?
[50:20.000 --> 50:29.000]  Whether it's Hillary Clinton, yourself, Chuck Schumer, you've all been in power a long time, and there was a rejection of that in the 2016 election.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  Do you accept that?
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  Well, we have plenty of room for all kinds of leadership at every level.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  Right now, we need experience as well as new leadership.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  I was a new leader when I emerged myself, so I'm all for that.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  But that's not the point. The point is...
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  By the way, folks, we need that DNC lady running for DNC that says I'll suppress the white people.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  I'll make sure they don't get any privilege. I'll be a good, good, good, good, white house slave.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  That's who we need. She'll really destroy them.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  Happy Valentine's Day, honey.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  Wow, look at these roses. They're gorgeous. You didn't have to get me these.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  Aw, thank you.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Guys, this Valentine's Day, even though she says you don't have to get her flowers,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  take it from me. Send her flowers. She'll be so happy when you do.

[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  Okay, coming up, we've got one of Putin's admitted top advisors.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  So we're going to be talking to him about the state of the world and what's happening.
[55:05.000 --> 55:06.000]  He speaks English.
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  I don't speak Russian.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  They had to translate when I've been on their national TV show, so that's coming up.
[55:11.000 --> 55:17.000]  And then we also have Professor Daryl Hamamoto, who's out at UC Davis,
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  who's been warning, and he's what you call a real liberal.
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  I mean, he's not anti-gay, he's not anti-women, he's not.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  He says there's just this weird race cult.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  He was on a couple of years ago saying, watch, they're totally racist,
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  and they're led by white women and menly Latino women, that's what he's saying,
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.000]  by the foundations putting them in charge to totally teach the downfall of society.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  So, and I was hearing him going, man, is he being a little extreme?
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  But let me tell you, you go to these rallies and they're just screaming,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  you're a white male, shut up, you need to die.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  And then the men walk behind the women, and it's a cult, man.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  If I went to an event and all the men walked behind the women, I'd be freaked out.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  It's just crazy.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  The only time I'm walking in front of a woman is to get the door for them or get their bags.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  But look at this, report by Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  Starbucks in Saudi Arabia refuses to serve women.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  No entry for ladies, only send your driver to order, because women can't drive either.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  The Starbucks coffee shop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, recently refused to serve women.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  They claimed that the corporate giant was swiftly forced to deny.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  Oh, yeah, because Saudi Arabia doesn't ever restrict women.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  A Twitter user by the name of my near end posted an image of a message posted outside the Starbucks,
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  which read, please don't enter here for ladies, only send your driver to order.
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.000]  Thank you.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  Starbucks in Riyadh refused to serve me because I'm a woman and asked me to send a man instead.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  Oh, of course, again, another conspiracy theory.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  It's well known that a lot of shops, a lot of businesses and things don't serve women.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  And look, it's one thing if you're a women's only shop or a men's only barbershop.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  Remember the men's barbershops getting sued?
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Because we're like, listen, we drink beer.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  There's Playboy magazines are laying around.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  And then women start threatening, okay, I'll cut your hair.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  And still they sue.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's one thing if you're a, you know, it's like curves is for women.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  Gary Haven started it.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  I'm not going to walk in and go, hey, I'm a woman.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  Let me, I mean, I get women wanting to be with women.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  Men want to be a man like a guys club or whatever.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  You know, a man cave.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  But we're talking about a Starbucks that says it's open to everybody.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  Well, that's okay though, because the Saudi Arabians, that's just their culture.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  And, you know, after all, Donald Trump's making up that there's Islamic terror or no, I'm sorry.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  He's making it up that the media is covering it up.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  Even though I have a mega massive stack of that, I'll get into after our first guest leaves us.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  But here's just some of it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:48.000]  M4's is by President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  Journalist calls out White House claims over terror reporting.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  Seeing in.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  Second Swedish police officer blows the whistle on migrant crime cover up.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  France anti-Christian attacks rise 245% in last year.
[58:01.000 --> 58:10.000]  Media won't identify once-deported murderer who raped woman as illegal, presses sanctuary city, runs cover up for criminal who raped Austin woman in front of her child.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Don Salazar exposes that.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Scandal mass media covers up terrorist attack Islam.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  Whistleblower fed shutdown terror investigation that could prevent a San Bernardino attack.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  Philip Haney, high-level anti-terror analyst.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  DHS Obama blocking terrorist probes.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  White House intentionally ignoring surveillance.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  Hillary State Department blocked investigation to Orlando Killers Mosque.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  Everybody knows they've been covering it up.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  We'll be back.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:43.000 --> 58:58.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  I agree with you.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  If it's Betsy DeVos, then no way.
[59:16.000 --> 59:22.000]  As double standards pleaded all night for their colleagues to vote no on DeVos becoming secretary of education.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  I'll admit, there were some good points brought up by the double standards against DeVos, a rarity indeed.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  But if the double standards hadn't been like the boy who cried wolf for the last year and a half,
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  Trump is Hitler, Trump is racist, Russian hacking, Republicans won't accept results, there's a Muslim ban,
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  then maybe their effort to stop DeVos could work.
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  They've been the boy who cried wolf for far too long and no one wants to hear the wolf story again from the double standards.
[59:44.000 --> 59:52.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Give me liberty or give me death is Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Well, my grandmother, almost 93 years old, died at 1.30 in the morning and the reason I raised that is,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  it just reminds me of how mistakes in medicine have touched us but also things on purpose.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  We're not sure, there's conflicting evidence on both sides about if they did it on purpose in the 1950s
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  with the oral-delivered vaccine that gave so many people polio, that's admitted, and that also gave so many people cancer.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  That's undisputed in history.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  We don't know though if they consciously did that, but we do know they covered it up.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And we do know into the future, they've still been doing it ongoing around the world with SV40 and others.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  And my grandmother got the second round of the polio vaccine and got the vaccine she was given it for.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  And one of the co-developers of it famously jugged on PBS, we played the club.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Yeah, we said, hey, this is killing a bunch of people.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And we said, well, there's too many people.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  There was a beautiful grandmother who had my uncle, who she lived longer than my mom's brother and my mother.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And she was on, almost an hour and a long, almost died, fought back.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  They said she'd always been a wheelchair.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  She got where she was on crutches and was a beautiful lady on crutches.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  But I watched her wracked with pain much of her life.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I watched her again, then cut off, cut apart one of her breasts about eight years ago.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  And she got cancer in the other breasts.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  She said, I'm ready to go seven years ago.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And they said, well, you'll be dead in three years.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  It's slow acting, but it'll be dead in three years.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  She lived seven years and she would not see doctors basically anymore.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Went off for medications and everything and lived seven years.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And boy, was she ready to go.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  So quite frankly, I'm not happy she's dead, but it is a big relief.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  And she did it her way.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And that's what matters.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  But it fundamentally makes me angry that they did that to her way back when she was 30 years old.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  And I had the best years of her life in front of her.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  And that they're doing it to countless children everywhere.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  And they'll take, you know, one person, a right winger hits and kills as the biggest thing in the world.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  And then they'll take bill them on the gates all over Africa, Latin America, Asia,
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  with people getting a quote paralyzed after the polio vaccine.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  And they go, oh, it's polio like symptoms.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  They're just out there giving it to them everywhere.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And they tell us, oh, we've eradicated polio here.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Well, that's because they went around spreading it.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  And of course, people learned immunity and how they give the troops live anthrax shots.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Because you can't attenuate anthrax in a crystallized form.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  The cell divides and absorbs the other side and can live a million years.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Radiation doesn't kill it.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Nothing kills it, but dissecting it at a microscopic level or both blast furnishing it.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  I mean, there's no debate.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  You shouldn't give the troops the anthrax shot.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  And I'm really just digressing.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I just think about how they do this human testing on us.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Now, this whole system is basically a big secret human testing operation.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And that's why you can't trust.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  I mean, it's in the news today that televisions are watching you and listening to you and selling the data.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  It's in the news that the vaccines have liability protection and are hurting people.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And what's Trump doing?
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  First president ever to come out and say, we need to investigate vaccines.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  They're dangerous.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  They're being contaminated.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  They shouldn't have liability protection.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  They should face the same rules as everybody so they can't carry out the social engineering.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  You want to know how the public looks like a bunch of half dead zombies?
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Fluoride vaccines, GMO, TV.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Every study shows you what's happening.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  This is on purpose, phasing out the human population.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Look at the Russian population has been plunging.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I'll give Putin one big fat gold star.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  The fact that he's trying to reverse that gets your population numbers back up.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  They're not putting fluoride in the water there.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  They're not trying to break the family up.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  That's why the devil Hollywood is so upset because it comes to kill, seal, and destroy.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  This is the Info War.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  Our guests, Russian advisor Alexander Duggan, straight ahead.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  I'm Alexander Duggan.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here in Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide and our guest is joining us from Moscow, Russia, Alexander Duggan.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  The media says that he's a top advisor to Putin.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  But from my research, I'd say it's more like when the media says that I'm telling Trump what to do.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  That's not really what's happening.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  We're just looking at the same picture, the same story, the same truth.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  We're reading from the same historical piece of music.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  But undoubtedly, Dr. Alexander Duggan is one of the leading people when it comes to rebirth in Russia and rediscovering the greatness of Russia and humanity itself and creating a pro-human system.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Now, I've only read one of his books and I've read quite a few of his writings over the years and well aware of who he was even a decade ago, tried to get him on.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  But here he is now.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I've been on one of his national TV shows that he has in Russia.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  But there's so many bios out there, so many things the media says he said.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I want him to spend a few minutes about himself first before we get into all these big, huge topics because I will cover what the elite believe or I will cover what some other group believes.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And then I'll wake up in the morning and the newspaper will say Alex Jones believes XYZ and that's not true.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  So it's better to directly hear from someone telling you what they actually believe in and what he believes Putin believes in and the type of world system I'm trying to create versus what they're trying to create versus what the globalist are trying to create.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  And I noticed one of the topics he wanted to get into, we haven't talked beforehand, but he just gave us a few notes here, is post-globalism. Make no mistake.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  We are post this form of corporate global government.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Now, they may fight on for a while, but it's not a boast to say you can look at all the evidence they are in major retreat.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  And I use the allegory or the analogy of 1945 Germany a few months before the final fall.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  You know the Nazis are going to fall. The question is how long will this go on?
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  So we're long past the Stalingrad moment where you know they're going to lose the globalist using that analogy, say for Nazis, because they're very similar to it.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  The problem is what are they going to do to try to keep power?
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Well, Soros has doubled the amount of money for rioting. They're training people at universities now to go out and attack the public.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  They're planning something big. So we'll talk about it all in the next hour, and I'll try to just sit back and let our guest speak because he speaks English.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  So, doctor, thank you so much for coming on.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  We'll spend a few minutes just on you, what you really stand for, what you really believe, the big movements you've launched that admittedly have reinvigorated Russia and given it faith again in yourselves.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  The globalists want to suck that out of all of us.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  And then let's get into who you think Putin really is, who you think Trump is in this new multi-polared world.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Thank you, Alex, for your kind presentation.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  I would express my ideas concerning what is going on in the world with new agenda for the United States with Mr. Trump that I support with all my heart.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And so what is going to be to happen with Russia and with Mr. President that I as well support with all my heart.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  And I think you have put the things very clearly, dear Alex, because you have said exactly the truth about my relations with Putin. We defend the same position.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  We share the same concern. So we are loving our people and I am making that on the level of ideas.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And Mr. Putin is doing the same acts and steps and the great politics, but there is quite a correspondence between that.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And I agree because when I am seeing impoverished and when I am hearing what Alex Jones says, it is not, it is the same agenda.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  I hope that Trump, Mr. Trump, Mr. President Trump share as well.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And that means the kind, not coincidence, that meant that unity of the same position, the sharing of the same values and the same ideas.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  So that is quite clear. And we are blamed not because we are bad or pretend to be extremists.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  It is all lie because, for example, in my book, Fourth Political Theory, I am criticizing three political theories, all three.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  I am against liberalism, against globalism. It goes first.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  I am against communism and I was always, because I was dissident in the Soviet time, because I didn't, I never share the conventions of communism.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I am traditionalist, I am Christian and I didn't accept this kind of values.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  But at the same time, I am anti-Nazi, anti-Nazi, anti-anti-fascists, because I didn't share nor racism, nor brutal corporate state in the sense of statism.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  So, and I am always affirming the same thing. I belong to the Fourth Political Theory. And when they try to present myself as a kind of extremist or communist or fascist, it is absolutely lie.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  So, I've actually read your writing. You'll explore each avenue of those and show the problems of how they're all basically failed systems centralized.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  We have to go back to our primal natures, basically. I just know this. Trump wants justice and he doesn't want wars with countries that aren't getting in our business and attacking us.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  He can see the real world and see that an alliance with Russia and with European countries and with the UK and with Japan and others against some of the other countries that are trying to expand and actually threatening people's way to go instead of globalist using America as a tool of world domination.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  That's why they're so mad at Trump. Can we speak specifically, since you bring it up, the post-globalist world, where you think we are, but first, can you speak then, knowing Putin, obviously, and seeing the distortions of the press, why Vladimir Putin is so popular in Russia and around the world, and what he really stands for?
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  So, my introduction was important because I would like to stress that I am simply relics, as well as you, Alex, as well as Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  First of all, realism. Realism doesn't mean nationalism. Realism doesn't mean some ideology.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Realism is considering the sovereignty of the people of the nation as the highest value, and that is completely anti-globalist agenda.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Exactly, because Trump's a known realist. You're saying Trump's a realist, you're a realist, I'm a realist.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  We should celebrate sovereignty and nationalism and cultures and work together and not try to conquer each other.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  I mean, what you're saying is just common sense. There's been a sickness of this globalist attempt to conquer all cultures and destroy them.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  So, this is a human right to resist this common enemy.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Absolutely, and what is important in this sovereignty, national sovereignty, state sovereignty, is the form to defend identities.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  The identities can be different. They could coincide or not coincide, but that doesn't mean necessarily the war or the conflict.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  We could accept the differences in the positive way. Americans and Russians are different.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Europeans and Americans and Russians are different. The people of the other countries.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  And we shouldn't have to accept some global system, much less who programs what we're supposed to be.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  It's not just that we should all work together. They want us to give up our identity and then take something on.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  And when you study what we're taking on, it's cultural death.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  Absolutely, and globalists, they try to make a kind of pacifist dream, killing the country, killing differences.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  We need to affirm our identities. And that is the way to understand each other, to understand.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  And that is the position of Putin as well. He is not imperialist. He is not fanatic.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  He has no idea to invade no country.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  In fact, I noticed how humble he is. He's always saying America is more powerful. Okay, you're great. We just want our right to be here.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  And I think that now we are in this situation where there is not anymore a kind of hostility between our countries.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  I would say I was anti-Americanist, anti-American during the government of Obama, of Bush, not because I don't like Americans.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  I was an American once in Washington. I like America. I like America, but I hate the globalist agenda.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  Sure, if America has been conquered by globalists, which we're starting to try to stop, then you have to rally your people through nationalism to defend yourselves.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  Yes, so now we understand everybody in Russia. Now we understand that America was hijacked by a globalist sect, and Trump is restoring American dignity.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  And we stop immediately to hate America immediately because that wasn't America that we hated before. It was globalist elite.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  And now we see that half and more, the majority of American population, as well as against this globalist sect, and that makes globalism the problem of each country, each people.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  We are as well under attack of globalists, as well as you. And we need to be united, consuming our differences.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  And I think that real multiplicity could lead to cooperation, to the friendship between different countries and different people.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  But we need, absolutely, we need to fight our common enemy. And before we had a deal, we have deal with Mr. Soros that tried to overthrow our government, tried to create a color revolution in our country.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  And by the way, for new listeners and viewers, because the media is going to grab this and twist it, he brags on CNN, he overthrew Ukraine.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  He brags he's trying to overthrow Russia. He brags he has hundreds of NGOs, non-governmental organizations doing it. That's so crazy.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Then Trump says, no, we're not going to do that. And they go, you traitor. But it's the very same foundations trying to overthrow America.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  This is a global disease. And Russia threw off the oligarchs that we're trying to throw off. That's the solidarity. And that's why the globalists hate Russia. They hate America.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  And Japan is hungry to throw off the oligarchs. Turkey, I know. In fact, we should bring this up later. You've been instrumental, reaching out to Turkey with a deal with Russia to bring your cultures together and not be played against each other.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  So I want to talk about the larger geopolitical view where you think this is going. But absolutely, looking at this, we have a clip from just last week or this weekend of Nancy Pelosi saying she wants to know what Putin's got on Trump.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Well, I want to tell her, Trump doesn't want war with people that haven't done anything. Plus, people that have nuclear weapons. Plus, he's been advised by top generals that made secret deals that are now public.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Cy Hersh exposes years after we did, that we made deals to begin taking out radical Islamic jihadists out of Saudi Arabia together and countermanded the globalist plan four and a half years ago.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  So the beginning of the U.S. Revolt didn't start with Trump. It started in our military, in our Christian military, not wanting to openly back Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  So that's the fissure. And then we started working with Russia. We first reported it four and a half years ago. People didn't believe it. Now it's mainstream news.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  So General Flynn and others are saying Russia wants to work with us. They're not a threat. Let's destroy the EU. It's unelected. It's evil. Let's free Europe. Let's have a bunch of trade.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Let's get China under control and let's actually have real peace. Now, we'll still have our militaries. We'll still have issues. I'm sure we'll still have problems.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  But we're not going to try to conquer Russia or vice versa. This is ridiculous. The globalists are attacking all our countries trying to make us all poor. Let's get them off our back.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Then if we want to kill each other later, that's our own issue. The point is that globalists are the big enemy. So I'm going to get your take on what do they have.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  Let's talk to the guy they call Putin's brain. He's not. He's like, I'm not Trump's brain. We just believe the same things. So we're synced up here.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  And so let's see what the top Democrat in Congress has to say, wanting an FBI investigation of the president.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  Yes, yes, we'll play that clip in a moment. I'll go ahead, sir. No, no, we're playing a moment. Go ahead, Alexander.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  So my idea is that you are absolutely right. Now you are facing you American. You are facing the same threat with service at the same end.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  So what was American, so called American attack, attack against us. Now we are dealing with the same, the same threat in your country.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  And I agree absolutely with you that Russia, we need to understand that Russia is no more communist. We couldn't apply all the Cold War cliches,
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  all the Cold War models to understanding a new situation. Russia is traditional Christian country as well as America is.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And radical Islam supported by globalists is our common enemy. And I think that now what is important to Russia,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  that we are hearing the voice of the people who are dying for our freedom of the military men, of the people who depend our security.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And I think that that is very important for globalists. They met generals, met militaries and so on.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  But for us, they are very, very high appreciated persons. And I think that that is very important to what the people of army says.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  And because we are losing our guys fighting against radical Islam.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  I want to talk about that in a moment. And we do have the Pelosi clip now. Sorry, I wasn't clear to throw it to it.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Here is the leading Democrat saying she wants to know what Putin has on Trump. This is just ridiculous. Here it is.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  But let me just go back to the first part of Senator's statement. I want to know what the Russians have on Donald Trump.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  I think we have to have that investigation by the FBI to his financial, personal and political connections to Russia.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And we want to see his tax returns so we can have truth in the relationship between Putin whom he admires.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  But I want to go back to the issue of Democrats.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  So let me say it again, just so Pelosi understands.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  And again, this is Pelosi who is acting very, very senile more and more and just said yesterday that she believes that President Bush is being bad.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  That some very evil people that have put some very senile brain damage, self-centered people. I don't mean that mean in power because they don't know what they're doing.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  We also have one of the other top Democrats, Maxine Waters saying Putin has invaded Korea and Trump is helping him.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  So get to understand folks, this is the same press conference. These are doddering lunatics.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  And I don't mean that mean. It's very dangerous and it's got to be dealt with.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Our military is horrified because quite frankly, they've been given orders to launch attacks on Russia.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  That's where this craziness is going. And it's gotten to the point where the military is saying, no, we're not committing suicide for the planet.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  So there's just a very spoiled, evil, hunchback force that we're trying to kick out of Europe and the United States right now.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Not that Russia is perfect, but at least Russia is trying to pull itself free of this face-sucking succubus.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  So I want to get your take on that, doctor. And then let's get to this next clip of Maxine Waters saying Putin invaded Korea. Go ahead.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  Sure, we'll go ahead and play Maxine Waters. Here she is.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  He is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in Aleppo. And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position where folks will begin to ask, what are we going to do? And the answer is going to be...
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Overthrow the president. So there's everywhere saying kill Trump. They're all over the newspapers. And let's be clear.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Soros bragged on CNN, Farid Zakharov, that he overthrew the State Department, Ukraine, and tried to kill the Russians.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Why he has this endless hatred of Russia? Maybe you could explain. So anyone who's informed knows that Russia didn't invade Ukraine, but she can't even get it right.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  She says Korea. I mean, how do we deal with a leadership that is this rotten in the mind?
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  I think that is a very good example of how globalists understand the world. For them, Korea or Ukraine or Syria or Aleppo is the same.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  It is completely pure illusion. It is virtual for them. And they sent American people to die in the nears. As in the computer game, they have no responsibility at all for the people.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  They don't understand the history. They don't know geography. And they are speaking about Putin inviting Korea. That shows how deep their knowledge is about Russia, about Putin.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  How deep the understanding of geopolitical world of people, of geography. That is characteristic for globalists. They have a huge lack of culture.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  That's right. Lack of culture. Because they have no culture. They are trying to make us like them. And I've studied Russia, because it's so interesting. Never been there, unfortunately.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  But Russia had so much land, that was its problem. Russia was never expansionist.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  All of us, Alaska, was a friend of ours in the Civil War, until the globalist put the communist, the proto-globalist out of New York and out of London, admittedly, put the communist in to take over your country and exploit it with the same social justice warrior brainwashing America is now going under.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  Yes, exactly. I think that we need a little bit to make our strategy a educational one. Because if we, only with very incompetent people, with very stupid audience, the globalist thesis, the globalist speeches could reach their goal.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  And now Americans have shown that they are not such idiots as globalists think they are. And Americans have chosen what they wanted, what they think to be real response to their problems. And now globalists are furious.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Alexander Duggan, doctors stay there. We're going to come back. This is powerful information. How do we stop the globalist? They're in trouble. But how do we truly make it the end of globalism, post-globalism, straight ahead with a lot of key points?
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  And we're going to open the phones up as well for your question for the man they call Putin's brain. We'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor. It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  So when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years, people that currently have tested for us, they didn't just say outstanding. What they really say about them? They want to know how do they get it? Where do they find it? A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  The backpack body armor is only $200. I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick. It's got a 20 year warranty. It's waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable. And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  Again, fund the info or get the game changing and Nanotech Goobs gets a win-win. $200. Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com. It's amazing.

[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  Everybody knows I don't promote violence. That's why I don't want senseless war.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  But radical Islam is really Orthodox Wahhabism has been funded for decades by the robber barons, by the globalists, and they've openly flooded Europe with 5 million.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Eastern Europe has an instinct to survive because they dealt with the jihad. The Crusade was a response to defeat that with both the Orthodox and the Catholic Church battling it.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  And that's our shared ancestry and history with Russia. And the globalists see any strong sovereign nation as an enemy, especially a Christian nation.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  I've talked to top Hollywood producers. I mean bigger than Chris Carter. I was just down in Los Angeles and they said, no, it's true. It's totally anti-Christian.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  There is like a satanic hate of Russia and of the Christian Church in America. And now they've got this new pope that is definitely anti-Christ. I don't mean the anti-Christ, but it is an anti-Christian spirit.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  He says, Europe, how? He goes, I get sick at my stomach when I hear about Europe being Christian.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Buddy, you say that from behind 100-foot walls while you open the borders up with people that are constantly killing each other in their own countries.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  There are lots of Muslims that aren't radicals, but the Wahhabis call them heretics.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  And they are now coming against everybody and they are the shock troops of this thing. And they're saying Trump can't even execute a law that's already in the books to say that if you're coming from Somalia, a failed state,
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  that there's no proper IDs until we have a system set up that proves they are who they say they are, until they quit using fake IDs, we're going to block them?
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  That's something every president's done. But now the courts, the media, the Republicans, the Democrats, they all come against him.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Alexander Dugan, author, researcher, launched much of the nationalist or sovereignty movements in Russia.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  I mean, just an absolute rock star in his own country, demonized and misrepresented here, obviously, in the United States.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  And I obviously haven't read all those writings. I don't agree with all of them or disagree.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  The point is, because they're saying the Kremlin's candidate and they're going on to say that Larry King is a Russian agent and Schultz is and Jesse Ventura.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  And they go on to some of these things to say, I am. I mean, that's ridiculous. I mean, during the Cold War, my family was fighting the Russians.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Okay, it's pure absolute monarchy because they were under communism.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  But again, it was a manipulation. Trump knows because he sat at the feet of the top advisor to, this is just a history lesson for folks, to Joseph McCarthy.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  And McCarthy finally went, it's not the Russians. There's an evil global group manipulating both sides. We've got to stop it.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  And that's when they shut him down. Trump was given all that info and he was like 25 years old.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  You can actually dig and find New York Times articles about it, about Roy Cohn and all the rest of it.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  So Trump's got the big picture. So when he was told all this by top generals, they asked him to run a year before the election.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  They said, sir, you're the man. We know you know all this. And he did it. He did it. And he won.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  This was a military and intelligence coup with the American people. The revolution here was American.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  How dare the media act like we couldn't do this ourselves. And the Russians did it.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Of course, the Russians cheered it on as they watched the globalists in Europe, the Vatican, the Saudi Arabians, the Communist Chinese,
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  not the Chinese people, but their leadership all gang up on us and try to stop us getting free like Russia did.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  But here's the difference. Putin took him a decade to get Russia quasi free.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Trump has been in 17 days and they're already trying to kill him.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  So I want to speak about the end of globalism or what happens if they kill from just all the key points that you want to impart to folks
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  about Putin's concerns when you talk to him, where you guys see this going, just all the different angles to this.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  But look, we've come this far with them already when we start a war in 2008 and last year.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  So thank God we've backed the clock, the doomsday clock back, I think, a few minutes.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Alexander, go ahead.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Yes, I agree much more absolutely with you that now we need to think about the future.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  First of all, globalists, they remind me of the black periods of my own history, of Soviet history.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  The lie is the Stalinist type of life, the communist, Stalinist type of life.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  They try to impose their understanding of the things.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  They ignore the position of the other.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  And our fight together for the future world should be based on these defences and affirmation of identity,
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  cultural, religious, spiritual.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  And we Russians, we want nothing more.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  We don't want to occupy, invade anybody.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  We need to secure our borders.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  We need to create our country safe, morally safe.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  And that's all, that's all.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  But we are under constant attack.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  We are not any more communist.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  We have over strong communists.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  We are trying to create Christian, normal Russian society, accepting and respecting the minorities.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And we are demonized precisely because it works, because we could stand the blows from globalists.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And now America is a little bit in the same situation.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And when they say, globalists, they say that Putin has helped Trump, is lied in the way they try to explore that.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  All this stupid history is about the hackers and so on and so on.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  But Putin really has helped Trump showing the example how to defend the realist values.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Exactly, the way he did it was by leadership and openly putting the ideas out like you've done and I've done.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  And our ideas defeat globalism because it's about being soulless.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  And if we just stand up, they can't beat us.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  So Russia is the example of pulling out of globalism first.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  And I salute you for that.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  And now all over the world, from Brexit to Italy, to everywhere, to Iceland, everybody's pulling out.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  And they keep saying, Russia did it, Russia did it.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  It's not true that Russia manipulated it, but Russia did lead by example.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Absolutely.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And I think now the situation is a little bit changed.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  Very interesting.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  We're living in an important moment of human history.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Now the initiative to change the world is once more in the hands of Americans, in the hands of Trump.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Russia has made a kind of introduction to the change of world order in order to create multiplicity.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  But now everything all depends on United States of America, on President Trump.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Because now he's in a position, he is capable to save the world and people of the world from globalism.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  And he has begun this real spiritual fight.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  It's not only political fight, it is not only technical or material fight, it is spiritual fight.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  And now America is a kind of leader in this war after Brexit and after Trump presidential election.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  That is a turning point of the history.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  I think now the initiative has passed to you.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  And now you need to make all the efforts, because you are in the best situation that you are the first power in the world.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  And now we are very proud about that.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Yesterday, in Obama's time, in the Clinton, possible Clinton perspective, that was a doom for us, that you are first.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  And now it is hope for us, that you are first power in the world.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  And I think you need to concentrate, concentrate on the vision of the future.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Because in America, there are so many examples of the real greatness before this globalist turn in the last decade.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Absolutely. And Alexander, let me just add this for your listeners.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  What's the best website? We have several here for people to visit to learn more.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  But some of your books, people can actually read what you've said instead of what the media says.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  What are some of the best websites for people to visit of yours?
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  I think maybe 4pt.com.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  It says fourth political theory that there are many texts in English or catechon.com, where we are publishing our English texts.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  As well in America, they have published some of my books concerning fourth political theory.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  The book on Heidegger and the book of Putin's geopolitics.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  And there are many other books that are now translated.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  I suggest to people to try to search something in order to understand better my ideas.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  And when they read my books, maybe they will oppose some points or debate some points.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  But what is important? We need to think differently.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  We need to try to open new perspectives to conservative understanding.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  The conservatism is a kind of lie. It is not repetition of the same truces from the past.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  No, exactly. It is always having to learn from the past, codify and celebrate men and women together.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  Families, honor, men being strong, people telling the truth, production, lifting society up, not dominating the weak.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  Basically, nobility.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  Yes, exactly. But the roots of the tree are always growing as well.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  So tradition is changing as well. And conservative demands a kind of imagination, a kind of view for the future.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  Exactly, because fake liberalism is an attempt to take over the human species.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Conservatism is actually the compendium of everything.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  Because what is to conserve, it is just that we are conserving what is good, but we are actually the future.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  The left claims they are progressive, but only progressive like a cancer.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  Absolutely, absolutely. Quite right. Cancer is the right name for globalization.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  They try to repeat the same mother, the same gender politics, the same hyper-individualistic attitudes towards human nature.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  And they destroy the differences. They destroy the richness of the human life, of the human culture.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  Absolutely. I mean, they're at war with language, people being individuals.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  And let me just throw the number off and take a few calls. I forgot to do that. I apologize.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  800-259-9231, quick questions for our guests.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to point something out.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  I'm not in an intelligence agency. I've organically built InfoWars.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  And, you know, did this just off of Americana and the list for supporting us.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  But obviously, over the years as we've grown, I mean, we know generals and colonels and CIA people.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  And a lot of famous folks, a lot of undercover people.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  And let me just tell you, almost the entire CIA, NSA, the branches of the military, know what happened to Russia.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  They now know about all the secret documents about the globalists, the proto-globalists sent over to take over Russia,
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  who was not expansionist to use Russia as this engine to take over, how that stalled and failed, how Russia's reconstituting.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  They've got a few people in intelligence agencies that still want to have war with Russia.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  They believe that's the global domination model and that, you know, they need to prove that Trump's not a Russian, you know, agent by going after Russia.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  Believe me, if Russia does anything or pulls anything with Trump, it's not going to, it's going to be, it's going to be quick action.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  But Trump knows that Russia is not, doesn't want to do that.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Trump understands with all the top generals advising him, not because they're Russian agents.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  These generals, like Madison others, are historians and they read my work, their own research.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  They read the doctor's work. They know, okay, they now know the big plan.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  They're trying to free humanity. This is actually a good group. There's not just evil in the world.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  So we're in a very, very epic historic time.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  You talk about swamp, the concept of the swamp, Putin as Trump and the bipolar system.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  Let's talk more about that and then take some phone calls.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  The swamp, it appears to be a kind of word used only for the electoral campaign in the United States.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  But the sense, the meaning of this new political concept is much deeper and it is quite right word, word swamp.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  Because the swamp is the same as globalist system. It is anti-national that tries to destroy, to penetrate any country.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Exactly. It's a blob. You don't know who runs it. It's secret. It's dark.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  Everything Trump does now, you notice it's out in the light. He shows it all.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  Absolutely.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  It could operate only in secret. They try to impose their agenda, not withstanding the acceptance or rejection of the people of the societies.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  The swamp is absolutely anti-democratic.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  It is anti-people. And now the swamp has found a world to attack, accuse us.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  They call us populists. So now they understand that they could not use anymore the term as fascist or communist,
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  because that is too ridiculous after all this repetition during the Trump's campaign.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  And now they have found the word populism. And they accuse us to be populists.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  Well, we are.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  He's against populism. But the populist is the man, the person who depends his own people.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Exactly. They're calling us populists like it's dirty. Isn't that good?
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Absolutely. I could...
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  Populist means the people. Why, you're for the people. I mean, that's how deluded and disconnected they are.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  And what I can't believe is we were ever conquered by scum like this.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  Because I guess we don't think evil. We don't think like they do.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  I don't think about screwing people over because I'm strong. I have too much honor.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  But it is really true. We have really been conquered by a bunch of jokes, which really is our fault now,
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  if we know this, if we let them keep dominating.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Now, their nature is clear. When they begin to call us populists, to accuse us to be populists,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  they show their real nature. They hate people. They are completely anti-democratic.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  They are against Americans, Russians, against as well against Israel,
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  or Jews, because they try to destroy any sovereign country.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Exactly. Let's go further. It comes out in the WikiLeaks that George Soros on the left wants to overthrow Israel.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Whether you love Israel or hate it, Israel has done some bad things, some good things.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  They want to overthrow it too. They're Jacobins. They're Aluminist.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  And I want to tell you something because they claim you say this, and I'll skip the breaks.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  We have more time, and they take some calls. It's so important.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  I grew up, and I'm related to the Puritans and folks like that,
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  and they were Francis Bacon trying to set up a new Atlantis.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  But they thought it'd be a new Atlantis of freedom, a new Renaissance, a good thing.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  I understand your earlier writings saying it's the land-based, old, human Russia
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  versus this new liberalism of the Atlanteans.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  But all I'm saying is, for me in research, it's actually the people that want to set up new freedoms
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  that are the classic liberals versus the new cancerous Jacobin, false 1776.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  French Revolution is the counterfeit of the new Atlantis versus George Washington and the real Atlantis.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  He countered the Jacobins, and his writings sound like your writings.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  So maybe the media took you out of context, or maybe you're right and I'm wrong.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  But just knowing that I was basically brought up, it wasn't like a cult or anything,
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  but we're building the new great world to empower the whole planet.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  That's America's secret destiny.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Because I had a lot of family that helped found Texas and other places.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  It wasn't like it was just known. This is what we do, and we don't want war.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  We want to fight evil. We want to free the oppressed.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  So talk about your theory of the Atlantean civilization versus the Russian land-based civilization.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Because hell, Russia, as you know, was pretty much founded by water-based Vikings to a great extent.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  So I guess, I mean, wouldn't you argue at the end that Russia itself is an Atlantean creation?
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  So, first of all...
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Oh, just one favor. Your thing's a little... I'm loud too, because I'm excited like you.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Just because there's a little bit of reverb that got worse, just don't talk too loud so we can hear you, sir. Go ahead.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Okay. That is not Russian invention, idea of Atlanteanism and Eurasianism.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  It is a pretty concept of Mr...
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Francis Bacon.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Macindor Spickman, an American tradition of geopolitics. And they made an identification between western society as an Atlantean liberal society and eastern society as a society that is based on the collective values.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  So that was more or less so. But at the same time, it is geopolitics.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  And when the West acts with such concept, we are obliged to counter-pause, to oppose to that Atlanteanist concept and this imperialism or colonialism of the West.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Yes, they are our Eurasian response, but now we are going to the new stage of geopolitics.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Now, real terms of opposition in geopolitics are the geopolitics of this wall against geopolitics of the people.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  And we need to revise a little bit this geopolitical vision because it is completely authentic. That fits absolutely where we are dealing with globalist agenda.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Sure, absolutely. But I get your point that the kind of the new Atlantis idea could merge with the British Empire and then end up taking over the world and then say merge it all together.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  So it kind of is the proto-globalism is what you are saying.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Yes, absolutely, absolutely. Britain's vision of the world was the root, the truth of globalization.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  And the United States of America, the United States of America, they opposed to this Britain domination.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  They opposed, you have opposed...
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  No, they were. And of course, the Russian Tsars, I'm not saying they were perfect, but they were opposed to it too. And that's why they were basically taken out.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  Absolutely. And that is why we were friends with America because we opposed this globalist agenda.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  And we affirmed the liberty, the freedom for each society to construct, to create, to build their own civilization.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Let me ask you a question. Would it have been better? I'm not saying...
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Because obviously, World War II, the Nazis were bad. But if you look at World War I, the British did basically start that.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Russia helped defeat the Germans and then got betrayed. Would it have been better for history if Russia wouldn't have come in on the side of England?
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  I think that is difficult to revise a historical aspect.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  But what is important is that after World War II, there began a Cold War based on this geopolitical attitude.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And the United States of America, that was a kind of special power, a very, very special power that served very much for the balance of the world.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  They began to turn into the new instrument of globalists, the new instrument...
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  No, absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt the globalist brag. Why do you want to go to some phone call, sir?
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  And then you've got to go at five after. If you do a few extra minutes for the next hour, that'd be great to finish calls.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  I want to go to them. But clearly, the globalist...
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  I try to study what they come out of, but it's just an amalgamation of people that stand for nothing but raw power.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  And then they see any culture or any honor as a threat to them because they're dishonor.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  They cannot coexist with any form of goodness. They truly are evil.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  I don't just demonize my enemy out of hand. It took me decades to come to grips with the fact that we truly face organized evil
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  and its operating system and its destination is evil.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  And so that's why it's so scared. And I believe it is being rounded in your gut.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Do you think we're going to defeat this system and what tribulations are we going to go through?
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Then we're going to go to some phone calls.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Absolutely. You're completely right.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  What is important with Trump, the Trump now is changing this core, this direction of 100 years, of last 100 years of America, Atlantis, British imperialist tradition.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  There were very good periods in the last century for America.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  America, as I say, Buchanan, America has won the world but has lost itself.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And that is very tragic. So America stopped to be real America and became instrument for globalist, international...
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  That's right. And so we're seeing the rebirth of America just as we're seeing a rebirth of Russia and a rebirth of nation states everywhere.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And that's what horrifies them is the sleeper is awakening.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely. You're completely right.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  And I think now that the most important mission, most important mission in the global sense now is in the hands of Donald Trump because he has changed already the direction of...
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  No, I agree. So what do you think of him working so far?
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  I mean, he is executing every promise he said he would. And when they ask him to attack Putin, when Putin's done nothing to him, he refuses to do it.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  He refuses to be bullied into it. And so they're trying to organize Trump's death right now. Can you speak to that?
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Yes. But I think that Trump is completely wrong to consider Trump to be a kind of pro-Russian or pro-Putin.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  It is not so. He is pro-American. He is a patriot. He is working only for the interest for his own country, for your country.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  And that is why he is very close to Putin because Putin makes exactly the same...
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  And that's what Trump said. He said, I like Putin because he stands up for his country. I'm going to do the same thing. He says Putin's a model.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  And they get so mad at that. Putin's beat the globalist. Trump wants to beat him. Why shouldn't he be a model?
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Absolutely. And at the same time, I think that for Trump and for Putin, our national interests are first, are more important than anything else.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  And that is why realists with realists could agree. For example, there are so many things that divided Russia and Turkey.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And we were on the edge of the new war. And globalists tried to involve us in this war.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  And when I have discovered that with my Turkish friends and Russian friends, we tried to stop this attack.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  And you did. You did. In fact, you're credited with that. Amazing.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  I want to do five more minutes. There are just a few calls here. But just in closing, looking at this, the average American...
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  I mean, the polls are even better than you see. There's not one war with Russia. They see through it. They're sick of it.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  I'm just really concerned about curveballs, sneak attacks, just in the last 30 seconds before we go to break.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  What tricks do you think the globalists have, though, to try to stop this?
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  So I think that globalists now, they have changed their poll before they were in the United States. Now they are more in Europe.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  And I think that now French elections with Marine Le Pen and beyond, and the other...
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  That's right. They're trying to stop nationalist victories everywhere, populist victories. They're trying to stop the people everywhere.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  We'll be back in 70 seconds. Final second with Alexander Duggan. Stay with us.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  We're off the fact they're getting together to train to beat down Trump supporters because the previous incidents of beating, pepper spraying, kidnapping, lighting on fire, wasn't enough.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Of course, the irony is they cite the rise in hate crimes against Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, women, the LGBTQIA, whatever that is, community, Jews, African-Americans, since the rise of Trump and other alt-right neo-Nazis,
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  all evidence points to a rise in hate crimes against Trump supporters. So I guess if this isn't a terrorist group, no longer will we see the cheap shot and run technique.
[1:59:43.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  The leftists are just going to toe up on the streets. This is Owen Schreuer from the Information Fight Club.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  Welcome to youth from the former United States of America. Deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  I'm going to have to get rid of that line or so. We're taking America back from globalists.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  And I don't mind them switching sides.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  I'm going to run down my country.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  Walking on the fighting side. They say countries themselves are bad. The president wanted to have a border as bad.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  This has been an amazing interview, a little bit echoey with our guests, but I want to get him back up sometime in.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  I'm going to mail him an external mic. But to Alexander Duggan as our guest, Dr. Alexander Duggan as our guest, they say he's the brain of Putin.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  Obviously, that's not true, but he is an advisor to him. What an amazing time he's given us. We're very, very thankful.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  I didn't get to a lot of these calls. I apologize. Let's go to a few right now. Let's talk to Hans in Pennsylvania. Hans, you're on the air with our guest. Go ahead.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Yes, good afternoon. The major obstacle to the globalists in taking over America has been the American citizen's right to keep and bear arms.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  A good example of the opposite of that is the globalists disarming the countries of Europe. Now that the Muslims have invaded Europe, the men don't even have any means of defending their women or their children.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  The Muslims are running wild. I was wondering if Mr. Putin would consider arming his citizens as well as a defense.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  That's right. Putin's now doing pro-family stuff, pro-Christian stuff, and I've heard some of the gun laws have been loosened up. What about that, Alexander?
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  I agree that an American tradition to have arms represents a kind of real dignity of the men. I'm supporting this tradition. It's a very good tradition, a very democratic tradition.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  You're afraid people are armed. So what about Russia?
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  Yes, you could defend not only your dignity, your family, your tradition, your religion, but as well you could defend democracy. And that is very important.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  That is why globalists are against this. They try to unarm American people. But we have different understanding of identity.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  It is not in our tradition to have arms. Much more in our tradition is to have a powerful state with a spiritual leader, depending on traditional values.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  It is our arm. It's a little bit different. And I think that in Russia, the real success of Putin precisely resides in the fact that he loves his own people. He loves Russia.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  He gives them a culture. You make some feel good again. Great point. Thank you so much, Hans. Jesse, real quick from Texas. Go ahead, Jesse. You're on the air.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  Hi, I just wanted to know if now that we have a new administration that's anti-globalist, then you think it's going to be possible for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin to work together and actually form a U.S.-Russian relationship, unlike any we've ever seen before?
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  That's a great question. When is this rumored Rocky Effect meeting going to happen? Alexander, have you heard anything about when the two leaders are going to meet?
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  I think that now the relations are already much better already. And we feel that anti-Americanism has vanished in our country. And that is very important because Putin hears what the people think.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  And he understood. And in our relations now from Russian part, there is the end of anti-Americanism that was very, very high. And I think our leaders could make the world, the humanity, great again.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  Sure, let's be clear. Russia could use this hey, outsiders are against us as a way to control people. But Russia has been very nice about seeing Trump's position and trying to make good relations.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Alexander, thank you so much for the time. Hope you'll come back again soon. I'll come back on your show anytime you'd like. Thank you so much and have a great week.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Best wishes to all American friends.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  All right, absolutely. America first, Russia first, nations for nations, nations for their people, a revolutionary idea instead of global enslavement. We'll be back with our next guest. Stay with us on Alex's shows.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  Look who's being discriminated against now, Republicans. That's right, a new leftist fight club has started at the University of Central Florida where the Knights for Socialism have organized to teach left wingers how to bash the fasc.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  No Republicans or Trump supporters allowed. Donning the Antifa logo, you can find them on Facebook. So I guess the first rule doesn't apply to these guys. They want to show off the fact they're getting together to train to beat down Trump supporters because the previous incidents of beating, pepper spraying,
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  kidnapping, lighting on fire wasn't enough. Of course, the irony is they cite the rise in hate crimes against Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, women, the LGBTQIA, whatever that is, community, Jews, African Americans since the rise of Trump and other alt-right neo-Nazis,
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  even though all evidence points to a rise in hate crimes against Trump supporters. So I guess if this isn't a terrorist group, no longer will we see the cheap shot and run technique.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  Now leftists are just going to toe up on the streets. This is Owen Schreuer from the Information Fight Club.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more. Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at infowarslife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, gobs and school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  We're the solution! Americans! Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  How many times lie from the InfoWars.com studio? That's Alex Jones.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  You know, I really do want to see prosperity in all of humanity working together through free will and free association.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  So Martin Luther King talked about not what color you are, what you stand for, what you produce. Everybody knows that. I don't care where you're from, what you look like.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  You make a pair of boots I like, I'm going to buy them. You make beautiful music that I like, I don't care where you come from, what you look like, I'm going to buy it.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  You cook great food. Man, I'm going to seek it out. I want to go in all those so-called ethnic restaurants. And I want that culture.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  The truth is, humanity wants each other's cultures. We just don't want to be played off against each other.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  And that is happening so bad. I've got stacks of articles where people wearing Trump hats are being beaten and attacked everywhere.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  Where you've got Schwarzenegger, you've got Robert De Niro saying, I want to beat up Donald Trump, smash his face in, you've got all these newspapers and magazines saying kill him.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  And then they call him a fascist. I mean, it is just completely insane.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  And then all these other presidents blocked people, usually from the very same radical Muslim nations, because they don't have real passports until we find out what's really going on.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  Then they say, oh my gosh, he's overridden by the San Francisco Appeals Court. He's discredited. He's a fascist.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  And now universities, we put the article on screen for TV viewers, are organizing fight clubs to train to go out and beat up libertarians and conservatives or, I guess, gay activists like Milo that dare come to their university.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  And again, I would call Milo pretty much a classical liberal. He's a liberal that doesn't like fake liberals sitting there beating up women in his name or this monopoly to say,
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  if you're gay, then you can't be libertarian or conservative. It's just, it's a cult, folks.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  And I remember our next guest, Professor Daryl Homamodo, coming on like three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, and saying they're instilling racism.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  They're instilling a cult. They're putting women in charge. We're not against women, but it's like this weird thing where every ad and every movie, the women are the heroes.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  That's not to empower women. It's to make women be at odds with their own species and have a chip on their shoulder.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  A woman should be assertive like a man if they're being screwed over, but just running around looking for trouble where I'm sitting there with a buddy and his wife playing pool,
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  and women literally come over with James Dean haircuts with cigarette pack rolled up in their white shirt and say, give me your woman.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  Well, there was a guy that gets their ass kicked, but it's a woman. You're like, what is going on? It's this weird power trip. It's like this bullying insanity.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And it's like, oh, what, you don't like lesbians? And I'm like, no, I can care less.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  The point is, he's like, what is this? What is this weird hyper dominance thing where I'm going to speak like you say, I'm going to do what you say, I'm going to submit to you?
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  It's like a bunch of crazy tyranny. And so, but frankly, I heard him talking about all this three years ago there at one of the California universities and Berkeley,
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  and you know, where all this is going on. And I just can't even believe it that it's gotten this point. And of course, he's been persecuted.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  And he's not even some right winger for trying to expose this and this weird cult because even though he's a Japanese American, he's a man.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  So he's bad too. And of course, it's big corporations and big foundations that he's been through their programs.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  He's been through the big secret of Rockefeller programs. That's why he could kind of guide us through it that are teaching this, but not to empower women, but to take any human culture away from them.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  How do you kill fire ants? How do you kill a bee colony? You put a pheromone into reproduction.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  And so again, whether you're gay, straight, you know, into, into whatever, I don't care. Everybody knows that. I'm not hating you for who you are.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  But the media calls me a homophobe and a transphobe and all that stuff because I say, what is this being forced fed to five year old kids about when they're not even thinking about sex?
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  The point is, is that there's an anti human agenda and our guest joining us the rest of the hour, Professor Darrell Hamamoto has taught the University of California for most of his career.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  He holds a undergraduate degree in political science, popular culture studies, comparative culture.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  Hamamoto is a senior ranking professor at the Department of Asian Studies. He's recognized authority on US media, popular culture and sexuality, having published extensively in the area.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  His current project is a volume that outlines the principles of the New World Order theory that is directed to the current generation college and university and undergraduates in search of alternatives to the dominant foundation guided
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  corporatist curriculum, tryanday.com where you can find his, his book. So I've been ranting here, but I got to tell you, this has gotten so crazy that I don't even know what to call it now, but it's good to have you back with us.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Thank you very much, Alex for inviting me.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  Before I begin, though, I wanted to compliment one of your frequent contributors, Roger Stone, with this excellent book here, The Making of the President 2016, I've gotten my two copies ordered through Infowars.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  And this is the first draft of history. This is the book that academic historians, for what that's worth, that academic historians will refer to when they write about this ethical moment, not just in American political history, but in world history in general.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  This is a truly excellent piece of work. And it's not a coffee table book. There's great photos, four color photos that are included in this volume, but it's very, very dense. It's not a commemorative.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  No, you're right. When I say coffee table, but use that means photos. You're right. I mean, it's got a lot of text as well, but I just, it's something you want to show off.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  Oh, absolutely. But from a participant observer position, Roger Stone, you're getting the inside lowdown on the specifics of this incredible campaign.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Also, if I could, and that was a really excellent interview with one of my intellectual heroes, Professor Alexander Jugen of Moscow State University.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  And I hope he'll invite me to Moscow. I haven't been to Russia myself yet either, so that I can give some talks and talk to journalists and people, everyday people, and absorbed and immersed myself in the beautiful, soulful Russian culture and history.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Anyway, I just wanted to add that, and I read his books avidly. This is more of an academic book. This is his political philosophy. It's called the fourth political theory.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  But in the book, he outlines this concept of Eurasianism. Now, that's mostly he devotes that concept. He treats that concept as a geopolitical concept.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  But I wanted to amplify or highlight one of its dimensions, and that is that the Eurasianist concept is going to be one of the master concepts for the revival of the American economy, the US economy, and the world economy.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  So it's, in addition to a political, geopolitical concept, it's a very, very practical blueprint or conceptual map for how we are going to get out of our economic crisis.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  And I agree, Professor Hamamato, but imagine, we're having this complex talk, our audience is getting it. Compare this to Nancy Pelosi not knowing who's president or Maxine Waters thinking Russia attacked Korea. I mean, I don't say this to be in an elitist position. I think of myself as an average person. I am frightened by the Republican and Democratic establishment's arrogance and fossilized brain structure.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Oh, absolutely. But I'm not going to stoop so low as just to dismiss them as being a moronic.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  No, I mean, they're in control. That's what I'm asking. How would how did this dominate us?
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Well, they're very much in control, but it's from sources, which hopefully I can get to later today that are that are very similar.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  That to to the mechanisms that students and the professional rioters are under control. It has a lot to do with frequencies in F and pharmaceuticals, which I've spoken to before on your show previously.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  I think most of these people who are in positions of power need to be vetted so far as their their health, their mental health and their physical health.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  Exactly. There are people behind us who use basically mentally ill, add old front people.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  Yeah, they are insane clowns.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  Well, let's look then we got three minutes to break. Let's roll through. I mean, you're you're opening salvo.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  Professor Hollamotto on what we're seeing at Berkeley, what we're seeing the attack of women and the media praising it, the bizarre behavior.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  Well, it's already been declared that future transhumanist or post humanist society will be female lead. I was just reading the Chronicle of Higher Education.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  And the latest wrinkle on that is the elite institutions such as Yale. It's the same old story going back to skull and bones.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  They're promoting polyamory, which is multiple husbands by a singular mama seat who who runs over who controls that that family.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  So this is their declared intention and how we proceed on that level remain to be seen. I have some some some concrete proposals that hope.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  David, you're on like three years ago or podcast saying that they're going to have the men walk behind the women all this.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  I witnessed that at the Women's March and the men all did it was like a cult.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  So it's just breaking that down.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Absolutely. You're following the queen bee. And by the way, what one of the strategies that we're going to use here is trolling these people and pranking them.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  You recall the so called Women's March on Washington that was Soros funded and you heard you saw the so called pussy cap.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  Well, here is one of our solutions.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  We're going to use the phallic guitars in Pudenda pink.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  Right. This happens to be a pure American offender Esquire guitar.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  I took it to one of the social justice warrior rallies with my little fender champ amp.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  And I asked to sit in. I watched them on YouTube and I figured out what they were trying to do. They were trying to propagandize undergraduates with rap and hip hop and funk.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  So I took my I said, what would be the the gayest instrument in my collection that I could take to this event.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  It was my pink Esquire, my Pudenda pink Esquire, and they wouldn't let me sit in.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  They said, I'm sorry, brother. We just can't let it happen.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  And they were hired. This is part of the the cultural takeover as well as the academic takeover.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  And then we're we're getting into the discussion of Professor Robert Reich.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  I'm very, very disappointed in I think he was pretty much a traditional liberal under the Clinton administration.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  He was the secretary of labor, but now he's a professor.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  And now they're now now he's saying it was it was Trump people that ride it when we come back.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And let's get into exactly let's get into the social engineering, what we're witnessing and how it's a cult.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  Because we try to talk to people that are part of these protest groups.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  They won't talk to us because they're all basically told what to do.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  And they get all these little scared freshmen that come to the schools and they're inducted into a eugenics cult.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  Basically, we'll be back.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  Hostage by your wireless carrier for two years.

[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  The active ingredient in turmeric known as curcumin is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  But now, one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  Employee's going around beating up women and men and the university's just praising it saying, well, you're fascist, you deserve it.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  The demonization of people projected onto them for their political views. I want to tell all the minions of this something.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  Your culture, your political system, your whole ethos is a false corporate program not to give you power down the road but to sabotage society,
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  all the machines and the automation and globalism take over and as we're made obsolete.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  And if you go look at your rallies, you are the most uninformed, uneducated, unprofessional people I've ever seen.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  I don't say that to be mean. It's just that you're in a cult and I want to see you come out of it.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  It doesn't mean what I'm doing is perfect but you're really a mess.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  And we have Professor Hamamoto who's been through the Rockefeller Foundation programs for education but saw it and has been exposing it and has been persecuted for it.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  So understand, the whole power structure is against Trump. Not that he's perfect.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  So you sit there and claim your anti-establishment, Goldman Sachs is trying to sabotage the economy right now.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  They're openly against Trump. They gave zero money to him.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  So don't shake your finger and say he appointed three Goldman Sachs people.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  That's because they're guides to do the demolition of this program.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  But Trump sees the wave of nationalism and sovereignty and populism that's here.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  He knows what he's riding on. That's why he's successful. What about you?
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  I don't want to sit there and laugh at you and say you're Trump. So I want you to wake up.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  This is your short segment Professor Longwin coming up.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  But just the big picture of what you witnessed for new listeners, new viewers, what's been happening at the campuses.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  Just the craze-eyed madness you're witnessing. What is it?
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  I was saying, what is this madness we're witnessing?
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  All right. First of all, the Bay Area has long been for decades one of the primary regions for cult formation,
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  whether it's fake religions such as the People's Temple, which by the way was linked to the University of California and the University of California, Davis.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  There's an excellent book that's never really been published, dissertation on that topic.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  But going down to the Stanford Research Institute, which most of your audience will know about,
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  and including UC Berkeley and the whole UC system with it currently with their neuroscience,
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  but back in the early days with studies on obedience and torture and the Zimbardo experiment.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  And that's why Napolitano was there. You even predicted two years ago when she went there, she was going to plan something big.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  But go ahead.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  Exactly. By the way, she has a second occurrence of cancer.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  And the reason I mentioned that is because a lot of these students who are on or provocateurs, professional rioters and students who are exhibiting strange, bizarre behavior like Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi,
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  they're being bombarded by 5G technologies.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  The city of, and this is from an environmental science, sorry, respect and admire greatly, Lauren More. She has gone very deeply and shown how the city of Berkeley and Oakland, Alameda County has been completely wired into a smart city.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  And this is altering the behavior.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  Oh, listen, when I go into these smart grids, I get sick all the time and the plants are dying. I mean, there's no doubt this is going on.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  Exactly. So we have a really, really, really deep, radically deep problem here.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  We, it does the students, the young people and us, ourselves a disservice to just call it cult behavior.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  And some people will say, oh, well, it's Berkeley in the 1960s. Forget it. That's the last war. Generals are always fighting the last war.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  Yeah, the CIA putting out, you know, suitcases of LSD is nothing. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, the second, you know, people are fixated on the 60s and how it was a CIA contract and all that.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  But what we are seeing is a silent weapons in a quiet war. Right. I mean, we've, we've seen that pay paper.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  And a lot of it is workshopped at the University of California from, from the Department of Energy as well as Department of Defense.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  And in the meantime, the thin sliver of our humanity that remains that should be taught in the English and comparative literature department.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  Instead has been hijacked by the so-called performance people performativity, the people that give rise to Maria Abramovich and are encouraging these types of street theater that we're seeing here.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  So we see it from a, from a curricular standpoint, this is full spectrum dominance, as well as from a techniques perspective, a rollout.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  And it's a trial run. Your city, Austin, as well as Alameda, right?
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  Oh, no, that's why I've got to get out. I've announced a three year plan to the crew to get out of here because they admittedly this, they're saying Austin's the best city in the country to live.
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  They're rolling out this code next program where, where all the houses look the same and like, and no more single family dwellings.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  I mean, this is a cult. Exactly. And it's no accident that both Austin and Alameda were the sites of Operation Urban Shield.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  And you covered this about two or three years ago yourself on InfoWars.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  Full spectrum dominance. Let's stay right there mastering the human domain. Come back. Take your time, professor.
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  I want you to roll out the next 18 minutes, 18 minute segment. What's happening?
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  And listen, if you're a new listener and one of these victims, we love you. Break free of the conditioning. You've been programmed.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  We're here to help.

[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America.
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  Let me just read a little thing here. The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  Individual rights will have to take the backseat to the collective.
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after your guns.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  Oh yeah.
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  I take it ain't going to sit well down my way at all. It ain't going to sit well.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  If you ever wonder what happened to America, they lost. We won. We want to see what Trump's up against.
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand pot of beers.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  And beef was for supper.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.

[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  I remember about 16 years ago there was an article in the Baltimore Sun about DARPA that went to the Internet testing, adding frequencies of microwaves on top of cell phone towers to calm the public.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  And light bulbs that go into police departments to transmit data to the computers and, you know, patents for TVs to watch and listen to you and people say, oh, you're crazy.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  Well, here's Ars Technica today. Visio smart TVs track viewers around the clock without consent, sell the data.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  Manufacturers will pay 2.2 million to delete data to settle privacy invasion charges. Yeah, the answer is sue all these companies.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  I'm not an aggressive person when they didn't put the agreement.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  That's why Samsung has an agreement when you punched up it says we're going to sell this to third parties and even admonish us.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  So watch what you say. That's a quote. Watch what you say.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  20 something pages into the terms of service. I agree this all sounds Buck Rogers and crazy. It's 2017.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  You're in Buck Rogers, but the future is not equally distributed.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  We're going to go back to our guests, but Nico just said, listen, you didn't plug any last hour. You got to plug.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  Let's say fun things.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  It's back. It's made by the biggest toothpaste manufacturer that does organic toothpaste in the country. Everybody knows its name, but we private label with them with our own container or own quality.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  But they're big lab right here in America right up in Maine.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  I mean, right up in, you know, where and the point is, is that we then add to it iodine and nano silver peppermint and tea tree oil.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  Nobody's got something this good. It's amazing. It's sold out in a week.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  Last time we got double the shipment this time and the profit we make again helps fund the operation.

[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Roger Stone's book that Professor Hamamoto mentioned as well.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  It's all there in solutions from science has the next generation PPX mobile generator available.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  The new model has 60% more power.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  You can charge or run most of your electrical devices. It can jumpstart 10 buses in a row.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  Solutions from science PPX allows you to create your own private power grid at your home or even in a remote location, but a private power grid.com.

[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  So Professor, I want you to take over in this segment that I've been learning a lot, but just continue with the history.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  But but but looking at the actual wreckage of this.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  I mean, it seems like they're going insane, but I know they're meant to make us go insane.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  And then the system just organizes it, tests it and control it. But it seems like the elites are getting blowback to from their own.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  They're kind of smoking their own dope is what I'm saying. Go ahead.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  Well, yes, I mentioned Janet Napolitano for the second time in her life is suffering from the ill effects of cancer treatment.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  So it's hitting all these people who think that they are on the side of his on the right side of history.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  It's blowback. It's techno blowback, if you will.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  But before I go on here, I just wanted to thank your father, Dr. David Jones for developing that tooth gel.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  I ordered five tubes and it's great. And as everybody knows, the digestive system is your main driver to your overall health.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  So start with your teeth and your gums. Anyway, let's go back to this.
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  Because I think it's important because we need these these technologies in order to defeat the 5G, the EMF,
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  the various pharmaceuticals that we're being and the chemtrails, right, the geo and engineering that are bombarding us continuously.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  And I know that your son is is advertising a RF protect block of phones.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Right. We need those. And it's going to be a great opportunity for inventive entrepreneurs to come up with these types of counter technologies that will help protect us as we are taking back the republic
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  and disassembling these 5G technologies that are going up indiscriminately.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  And I've been collecting academic articles by the dozens. It's all out there.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  This is this is hard information talking about the devastating effects down to the DNA level of these new technologies that young people have become addicted to in a very short time.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  And it's 5G. It's astounding. So it's we're out of tinfoil hat conspiracy type discussion here.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  We're talking about scientists themselves, just like the centers and the whole climate fraud science scandal have come forth with the science papers to validate their position.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  Unfortunately, the University of California is one of the chief globalist institutions in the world has signed on to this this larger agenda, whether it's called agenda 21, you name it.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  They are the epicenter of it, but nobody, including the chancellors, the president, and as well as the professors who think that they are doing some sort of engaging in some sort of their favorite word transgressive activity by fomenting a virus.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  By fomenting a violent acts against innocent people, as well as engaging in repulsive so called performance art and collecting so called transgressive art and hanging it in their their deluxe homes like the one of the Podesta brothers.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  You're you're you're hitting down the wrong trail and as Alex alluded to earlier, there's still hope for you. There's there's still time for you and there's still hope.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  You just need to be deprogrammed and we're going to come up with the tech we're going to detoxify your mind as well as your body over the coming months.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  And if I may, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the techniques of riot and urban violence.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  What we saw is Berkeley and again, the media defending it or even blaming the Trump supporters, women being beaten by crowds of men. This is happening all over the country now. This is the new sacrament. And I wonder why the dishonor is what they want to do.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  It's not like they beat up a few women. They target women. What is that?
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  Well, in Berkeley itself, I was doing some research on this. There are and who knows who the funders are. And this is where independent journalists and investigators come into play here. But there's a meeting place.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  It's at 4799 Shattuck Avenue in Oakland, California. It's a major street. It's called Omni Commons and they have these little these infiltrators.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  These provocateurs have these little spaces where they can go and plot out their street data and little actions.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  We need to find out who's behind Omni OMNI Commons as well as other institutions.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  I also see that the Berkeley School District is, if not subsidizing, but but directly propagandizing a new generation of K through 12 children in the Berkeley area in the entire East Bay.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  There is this one teacher there. Her name is, let's see, what is her name, Pallarta? I think her name is.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  She definitely looks like one of these Nancy Pelosi slash Maxine Waters, mind controlled, bat ass crazy type demonstrator, but she's a teacher there.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And so she's exposing the K through 12 students to her techno authoritarian propaganda. I saw her pop up at the demonstration in the capital city of Sacramento, California with a fake bandage on her.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  Supposedly she was there to fight neo Nazis who are probably who knows that they were probably not neo Nazis. They were probably provocateurs themselves. They might have been part of the black block. And then recently at Wednesday, last Wednesday at the Berkeley riots, she shows up again.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  And the reason I mentioned this is because and this is so much speculative.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  You know, we can do this, we can kind of put off these hypotheses based on what we already know about decades and decades of mind control systems and programs, much of which, by the way, as I stated before, we're concentrated in the East Bay.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  But she and others of a certain subset within the Asian American community, most specifically, I'll say it, even though the majority are great, nice, hardworking, intelligent and upright Christian people, and I'm talking about Filipino Americans.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  I think they're coming out of the Alameda Naval base.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  They are the products of what colloquially is known as the super soldier program.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  And what's happened is that there they come out of a total naval navy family of total totally administered life from from meals to health care to education.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  And there's this new generation of immigrant naval personnel of Filipino American heritage who who got to the United States through their military service who are now at the core of
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  this so called street actions that we're seeing in the East Bay and the Northern California.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  And we're identifying leaders that you know have a Navy background, which just means a government background.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  Exactly. Yeah, it's it's the it's the deep Navy. It's not the ordinary Navy that we know and love.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  And that's defending American sovereignty. But there's a subset.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  The shadow Navy.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  That's exactly as you know that that within any institution, there's always a shadow entity with them at the very top.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  So they're coming out of Alameda, I think, and and how I came upon this insight is through the work of a Filipino American multi generational Navy family person by the name of James Bartley.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  So your viewers might want to check out his work and he goes into great for the more detail than I'm able to. He goes into great detail on how this has played out in his own life.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  And now we're seeing a larger rollout.
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  Remember the guy at the naval yard saying, you know, this is my ELF weapon or whatever.
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  Exactly. Yeah. And we you see the guy that was at the Fort Hood shooting.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  He was a son. What Pakistani American. He was a medical doctor. And he also yeah. And he also so we're seeing a lot of my two years.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  The CIA knew what he was planning and didn't stop it.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  And he was reportedly getting orders online. They shouldn't stop it.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  So and there's definitely something going on here.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  Well, let me pull him back from this. Where do you see all the insanity going because they're only intensifying?
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  What's the end game of the controllers?
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  It is mind control to get a bunch of people to go beat up women.
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  I'm sorry. Where do you see it going? I mean, I mean, where do you see these political movements going now that they're into this call for violence, call to kill Trump?
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  What are your big picture concerns?
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  Well, I'm afraid there are going to be killings that takes place on on on the in the same way we saw Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  Which what do you think of him exactly organizing the left into fight clubs to prepare to go out and attack and kill people all over the United States?
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  I mean, they have here's what I don't get. You start a fight with 100 million gun owners.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  You start a fight with the military that's awake to what's happening and some of the police that are awake.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  I mean, it just sounds like they're setting them up.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  But then I see Soros has succeeded in other countries with this.
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  So I see his confidence or is it really a plan to set up the left?
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  But then I see the legitimate attacks on Trump. They really tried to beat him. So I think they've gone crazy themselves.
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  I don't look. George Soros's son, as you know, goes to Berkeley there.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  Yes, he's a graduate student there. And from what I understand, he's there primarily to to carry forth the agenda for the next generation, which is a fake left liberal progressive.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  Well, there's no doubt you see Berkeley, but also California state schools are the tip of the spear, except for like Harvard and MIT. I mean, why do you think California has been chosen as the admitted testing ground, the development?
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  I mean, they're putting all their eggs in that basket right now.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  Well, as I stated before, it's because the globalists, the bankers want to retard if not completely derail the eurasianist economic engine of growth, the region that that Alexander Juegen has and others.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  I get it. So California is a link into Asia. They want to create a disease in California that culturally spreads through Hollywood. And that's why they want the Chinese to buy up Hollywood.
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  Absolutely. I mean, the university, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  No, no, no. Talk about talk about talk about the Eurasian movement. Talk about that.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  Well, it is founding the the skull and bones men who founded the University of California in Berkeley, which was just a sleepy little town at the time.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  It was part of a conscious process to cite the university to point to Asia. They knew this in the latter part of the 19th century.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  You know, we're talking about the Spanish American War and they were appointed specifically as they just grabbed the Philippines.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  They just got in the calling stations. Exactly. And Hawaii, of course, right, which was it was a territory.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  So this is the engine of American and global rejuvenation and renaissance. The Eurasianist concept. We're seeing it's called the Silk Road economy.
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  They're building train lines going from from Southeast Asia all the way to Tehran and and you can take the the ferry to to London.
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  So that is the new Renaissance.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  Oh, yes, it's the Earth Island. And that's the good news for these young people that were going to D program because they do not.
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  You can be a part of the real economy and not be sabotaged. The globalists want to sabotage you because you're going to be powerful in the new economy.
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  Precisely. They're hobbling you. They're starving you just like the surfs of medieval Russia or Japan where you're like one foot smaller and 50 pounds lighter than than the warrior class of people.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  And you don't even look them in the eye or they will cut your head off, right?
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  Yes, they want these these globalists want a neo feudal society in order to achieve that. They have to stunt the economy and by the way, neo feudalism has been every culture was the same.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  It's like they're trying to put us back, not forward to the opposite of progressives.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  It's absolutely true. Now, under the neo feudalist society, though, there were really highly testosterone driven men who would use farm implements to attack and defend themselves.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  Against the samurai who were put out there by the feudal lords to extort taxes from the people.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  They use the nunchaku, they use the sickle, they use the torch, they use the pitch for.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  So I just agree with Professor Duke and the Russian people have always been armed.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  But our ace in the hand, our ace card here is is weapons, not just rifles by informational informational exactly.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  Well, I think let me ask you this question. This is so on target.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  A professor, they are panicking right now. I think globalism is being set back.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  I don't think we're in post globalism like the professor was saying, Dougan earlier.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  But I mean, they they they know they're getting their ass kicked the energy of humanity willing itself to success.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  I don't see them suppressing. In fact, I see it actually energizing us.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  Well, yeah, these are desperate moves and desperate times for them. But I would not let down who knows what types of curves are going to throw at us again.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  Now, there's another dimension to this analysis that I come up with recently in light of the pedophilia roundup in the state of California.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  Oh, yeah, I meant to ask you about that. Flack by the upper level handlers of the University of California to divert attention from a looming
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  pedophilia roundup in the University of California.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  So think Penn State, right? Think Penn State.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  And it's not necessarily strictly more strictly speaking, it's called the fibophilia. And that's the same sex, sex, use and exploitation of young men 18 years or older.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  A lot of them, you know, your varsity athletes, for example.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  But there's not only a Luciferian slash satanic underground at the University of California at this as well.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  But I suspect and by the way, I don't have any information on this inside information.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  But I suspect from what I've heard and seen and observed.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  And again, this is partly speculation. We can do that based on past performance that there is a fibophilia underground at the University of California that they need to to to suppress.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  And the reason I think I'm over the target is that I went in over the holidays to access my office and I found out that I've been locked out.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  And one of the main ringleaders at UC Davis, who's the vice provost of academic affairs, wrote me a nasty letter.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  And a friend of mine told me she was looking at my profile, faculty profile, the University of California, Davis.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  Well, stay there. Let's talk about it on the other side.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  Attention, patriots, tired of the tyranny and crime in the sanctuary cities, leave the city and seek refuge in the American redoubt.
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  Advertising your business with GCN is simple, effective and more affordable than you might think.

[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, gobs of school, morality out of future, and beef was for supper.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans need to see this film.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  This is Michael David from Seattle. I'm 51 years old and six months ago, I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I've lost 35 pounds of fat and my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  I have more energy and I looked and feel 20 years younger and now my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah. After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  That was eight years ago. I continued to take Andro 400 and I've maintained my weight at 172.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Gained muscle and energy. I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  Andro 400, the natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy and feel great.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  Try Andro 400, the safe, effective, affordable way to boost your testosterone.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435. 888-400-0435.
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Look, when I call the globalist Satanist, most of them don't get around a pentagram or worship the Elsie Bub, but they're just all about them.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  They're burning with how great they are. And instead of wanting to empower others, because they're not really that great, they just hate everybody that's successful.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  And that's the nature of slavery. It's the nature of feudalism. It's the nature of globalism.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  And they've created a giant horde of dumb-down dangerous people so the middle class will join the elite in hating them and enslaving them.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  And then we all fall once we've done that. That's the big trap.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  And Professor Hamamoto is our guest. Obviously, what better group to run oppressive systems than pedophiles?
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  Because it's not about sex. It's about dominating them, stealing the innocence. It's a very dark spiritual thing they're up to.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  You get past religions. It's very dark energy. And it runs this planet.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  And so we were getting into the whole pizza gate thing, which doesn't matter that Joe Rogan's got the biggest podcast ever.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  He was telling me yesterday it's blocked where it didn't go to the top where people will see it.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  And of course, that happens to everything we do here, but it's okay because the listeners understand.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  But spread the links, spread the articles, spread the videos. You're the reason we're having this big effect despite the algorithms trying to block us.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  So you're locked out of your office. Tell us what else happened.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  Yeah, I've become a Soviet-style non-person. My profile has been taken off my departmental website.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  So they do that before they officially fire you. They kind of just disappear you.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Exactly, right. There are different techniques that come right up. Unfortunately, they don't have very much imagination.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  If you do any reading, it's very predictable.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  Yeah, they're hoping you throw a fit and go crazy and quit because they don't want to fight.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  Absolutely. But my audience in my classroom, ironically, has become much larger than the University of California Davis.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  The University of California Davis was part of the Manhattan Project. It's been part of these mind control programs that I've alluded to.
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  Well, they even helped write the script to cover up the new plant that blew up. Remember that?
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Absolutely. And they're also a big recipient of a Monsanto slash Bayer funding.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  There are a number of people in the sciences and biology and agricultural sciences.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  But it shows how leaked they are. So what's happening? I mean, you think they're going to try to, like, you know, remove your tenure or what's going to happen?
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  Are they just trying to mess with you?
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  They're trying to put me out of the institution, but doing it in a way that's not to expose them to embarrassment and bad public relations.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  I've been there for 20 years now. It's going to be, it's going to look very strange when a person who had an exemplary publishing and teaching record all of a sudden disappears.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  But they're not going to get away with it because before we leave today, I have some at least one suggestion on how we're going to recapture or reabsorb or renew or reunite with these young people who think that they're
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  Tell us how you're going to do it. We're almost out of time. We'll have you back soon. I mean, how are we going to do it?
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Okay, we're going to do it by instead of just focusing on communism versus socialism versus fascism, we're going to do like the thinker who was connected to Anthony Sutton, Patrick M. Wood.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  We're going to instead focus on the technocracy and how all of us are going to be enslaved by this technocratic.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  All of us are being losing to robots and they admit the age of us is over come together.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Absolutely. AI and nanotechnology and sophisticated robotics. That is the common enemy and we have to educate these young people that this is what's really taking place here.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  And I'm going to start the movement by human. In fact, I've been meaning to launch that. I'm going to say at first by human is the movement.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  We're not against robots, but they've been programmed to displace us so until we have to buy human.
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  Exactly. Such as handcrafted musical instruments. That's a good start.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  Well, listen, how do folks contact you, Professor, to defend your free speech and talk about it? I mean, I'd love to get with one of my writers, too, so we can write an article about your persecution.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  Okay, absolutely. You can contact me on my Facebook. It's called Darryl Y. Hamamoto and I have a YouTube channel called Professor Hamamoto.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  We're going to talk soon. I'm out of time. Paul Watson is taking over from London. Let's have you back up next week because I want to defend your free speech and get an update on what's happening.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  Paul Watson from London, stay with us.
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  Except the future is female only if they agree with you. If it's Betsy DeVos, then no way.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  As double standards pleaded all night for their colleagues to vote no on DeVos becoming Secretary of Education.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  I'll admit, there were some good points brought up by the double standards against DeVos, a rarity indeed.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  But if the double standards hadn't been like the boy who cried wolf for the last year and a half, Trump is Hitler, Trump is racist, Russian hacking, Republicans won't accept results, there's a Muslim ban, then maybe their effort to stop DeVos could work.
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  It's been the boy who cried wolf for far too long and no one wants to hear the wolf story again from the double standards. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[2:59:53.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  You're back for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson, and we have a very important video coming up at the bottom of the hour which I put together.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  Basically over the course of a month, that's how long it took to put together. It is the truth about popular culture. It's already going viral on YouTube.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  I'm going to play it at the bottom of the hour. Absolutely vital that we red pill the next generation and by the next generation, I don't mean millennials because they're pretty much a lost cause at this point.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  I'm talking about Generation Z who are the most conservative generation, the most reality based generation since anyone since World War II.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  These are the people we're really waking up. It's no longer a cliche. I get messages every single day, deluge of messages, not just from millennials, but from teenagers, people born after the year 2000.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  They're a massive source of our fan base of our listenership right now. They are the most conservative generation since World War II. They are waking up quicker than ever.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  They are rejecting this toxic, plastic, contrived, vulgar popular culture in greater and greater numbers and coming over to our side, the reality based culture.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  And that is why I say conservatism is the new counterculture because, one, it really triggers liberals. They really don't like it when you say that because they think they have a monopoly on cool.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  As Andrew Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture. If you influence the culture, if you hijack the culture, if you hijack this celebrity bandwagon that feeds young people, their political opinions,
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  because, of course, most of them don't read newspapers. They don't watch television news. They get their opinions, their outlook from celebrities.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  If you are able to hijack that, you're able to turn around an entire generation. And Generation Z is really coming to fruition as the most red pill generation since World War II.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  The most they call it conservative. It's really just reality based, common sense based generation. And it's the youngest generation. These people are going to be around for a while and they're coming over to our side in greater and greater numbers.
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  So we're going to get into that at the bottom of the hour with the truth about popular culture.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  Top story up on infowars.com right now, though, poll, clear majority of Europeans want total ban on Muslim immigration. And what do you know? The contrived narrative that this was outrageous, that only racist and Islamophobes and deplorables thought like this
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  has proven to be completely wrong. Not only in the United States of America, where we had a Reuters-Ipsos poll about a week ago, which said that Americans supported Trump's travel ban, 49 to 41%, now in Europe, which is a lot further to the left than America.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  As you know, we have a massive survey, extensive new poll carried out by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is not Breitbart, okay? It's not the Daily Mail. It's not the Daily Express. It's not Marine Le Pen.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  It's not Nigel Farage. It's not infowars.com. That is a globalist institution. If they wanted to manipulate this, they would not have manipulated this way because they don't make very good reading.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  If you're a globalist body that has supported mass immigration for the past several decades. This poll found 55% of Europeans agreed with the statement that they want to stop all further migration from mainly Muslim countries.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  55%. Now, don't go thinking that, well, 45% said the opposite. No. 25% responded they don't know, so they didn't have an opinion either way. Just 20% of Europeans support further Muslim immigration.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  They asked 10,000 people in 10 different European countries, do you agree with the statement all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped? The huge, significant, clear majority agreed with that statement.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  This mainstream media narrative that this is a fringe issue, that it's outrageous, that it's racist to agree with this, completely debunked. This is now the mainstream view. We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live with more infowars.com. Don't go away.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  No Republicans or Trump supporters allowed. Donning the Antifa logo, you can find them on Facebook. So I guess the first rule doesn't apply to these guys. They want to show off the fact they're getting together to train to beat down Trump supporters because the previous incidents of beating, pepper spraying, kidnapping, lighting on fire wasn't enough.
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  The irony is they cite the rise in hate crimes against Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, women, the LGBTQIA, whatever that is, community, Jews, African Americans, since the rise of Trump and other alt-right neo-Nazis, even though all evidence points to a rise in hate crimes against Trump supporters.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  So I guess if this isn't a terrorist group, no longer will we see the cheap shot and run technique, now leftists are just going to toe up on the streets. This is Owen Schreuer from the Information Fight Club.
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.

[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  By really seeing the re-emergence of this weathermen-style ideology, this immediate resort to fists, to violence, to fighting, over actually having any kind of argument, any kind of reasoned political debate, because the left or the far left, at least for the time being, although it's being given cover by the mainstream left,
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  they've lost the argument. They called us racist and Islamophobes for years, and for many years it worked. Let's admit it, it did work, even though it wasn't an argument.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  People bought it in the public eye because they were so afraid of being lumped into these groups. They were so afraid of being called these slurs, these pejoratives.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  So it worked for a while, and then it stopped working when people got wise to it, when access to information became so great that they could see it was completely transparent.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  And that's why we had Brexit, that's why we had Trump, that's why we had the rejection of the left in Italy, that's why we're going to have more massive rejection of the left in these European elections that are coming up in 2017.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  So their tactic of calling us racist failed, they finally understood that it has now failed and no longer works, now we're seeing the move on to the next phase, which is this weatherman ideology of violence.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  This is why we see socialists at universities being trained to beat people up. This is why we see even celebrities now like David Harbour and others get up on stage at these award shows and say, just start punching people in the face.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  Because they're Nazis, and anyone you disagree with is a Nazi, so that's kind of a dangerous idea, isn't it? First it's neo-Nazis, then it's Milo Unopolis, then it's anyone who works for Breitbart, then it's just conservatives in general.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  And the last Trump riot at Berkeley, they had a sign in graffiti saying, liberals get the bullet next. So don't think you're safe, it's like the old Nazi thing, you know, first they came for the communists, I wasn't a communist, first they came for the Jews, I wasn't a Jew.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  They've made it very explicit, this violent far left element which is being funded by the establishment by George Soros, that they see liberals as the enemy too. Yet what do we see across the board? Liberals giving them cover, justifying, legitimizing that very violence that we've seen over the last few weeks, which is only going to get worse if this is not decried.
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  They've run out of arguments, now they're resorting to their fists, and they're seeking aid and comfort from actual terrorists, they're actually now aligning themselves with jihadists because they both share the same method and tactics of using violence, thuggery and intimidation to get political power.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  What terrorists do, that's the very definition of terrorism, using violence to advance a political objective, which the far left is now doing with the implicit support of the mainstream left.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  But again, it's not working in the polls, they're losing the argument and this new survey from the Royal Institute of International Affairs exemplifies that perfectly.
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  They're 55%, they asked 10,000 people, this wasn't a little phone survey with 200 people, 10,000 people in 10 different European countries, if they agreed with the statement all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped.
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  55% said yes, 20% disagreed with the statement, 25% said they don't know. You can break it down country by country. Even in Spain, which shows the weakest support for halting Muslim immigration, 41% endorse a halt compared to 32% who don't.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  This is the weakest. And that's obviously because Spain hasn't had mass Muslim immigration, so they haven't had to deal with the consequences of it so far. But even in the weakest countries in terms of support for this statement, those are the numbers.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  So if you look at France, which of course over the past two years, numerous horrific terror attacks, they've had the Calais migrant camp debacle, they've had basically now you go to Paris, it's like an open air migrant camp, there are people with mattresses on the streets.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  Even in the upscale areas of Paris, you look at the numbers there, 61% oppose Muslim immigration, and we're talking about a total ban here. 61% oppose just 16% support it in France.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  Look at Germany, where of course they've invited in what is it up to now 1.3, 1.5 Muslim migrants, 99% Muslim migrants, Cologne, mass molestation, Hamburg, other areas. Well, the numbers show 53% of Germans support a total halt on Muslim immigration, compared to 19% who oppose that view.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  And you can go through it country by country, Poland is even stronger, 71% oppose it compared to just 9% who support it. And then you look at millennials.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  Out of everyone asked this same question, do you agree with the statement all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped amongst millennials 18 to 29, 44% agree with that statement compared to 27% who don't.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  So even millennials support this by a clear majority, we're talking about by a 17% majority, millennials in Europe want a total ban on Muslim immigration.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Those are absolutely extraordinary numbers. And the big question, of course, will they translate into the elections, we've got the French election coming up here in about six weeks time the first round of it, at least we've got the Netherlands election shortly after that would get wild as
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  nationalism. Of course, we have an election in Germany later this autumn, later this fall, will those numbers translate into actual political change. What they tell us for the time being is that we're winning the argument.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  No matter how many Nazis you punch, which at this point is anyone who disagrees with you, we're winning the argument. You're looking increasingly deranged.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  You've allied yourselves with the very people who want to destroy the West. And they're openly engaging in an outreach right now. Of course, we've had the story before.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  ISIS puts in its own manifesto that the far left in America and Europe broadly shares the same goal as them. So they're going to try and recruit them and look at what's happening now, turning to brazen violence because they've run out of arguments.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  They've lost the argument. And the question is why do large numbers, a clear majority of Europeans support total ban on Muslim immigration?
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  Well, that's because they see that governments import huge numbers of people who are dependent on more government. Of course, it is the left that is the party of big government.
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  It's a political objective to import large numbers of people that will vote for your agenda. That's one of the reasons why they do it. That's why they started doing it in the first place.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  You know, many of these people do want to escape a terrible life situation in the Middle East. It's not much fun to live there.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  The question, of course, is then why do they bring that whole culture over and just import it into Europe and just ghettoize and don't assimilate into what is clearly a superior culture, Western civilization?
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  Of course, it's completely failed. Now we have a situation in Sweden, which is so out of control that two top cops in Sweden have gone public at great risk to themselves,
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  given the sheer level of intolerance to anything that's not far left in that country. Two top cops in Sweden have now gone public decrying the impact of mass immigration.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  We have the article up on infowars.com right now. Second Swedish police officer blows the whistle on migrant crime cover-up.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  A second Swedish police officer has gone public to blow the whistle on how authorities are covering up a migrant crime wave just days after another top cop was reported as a racist for making similar comments.
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  The first police officer, again, a veteran out of Albrero in Sweden, he posted a message on Facebook. It went completely viral. They reported him to the authorities as a racist simply for pointing out that the country is in chaos due to an epidemic of serious crimes being committed by Muslim migrants.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  And I know this for a fact because I see the stories every day because I have friends who live in Sweden who now they say walking down the street hearing explosions in the background is just a routine part of day-to-day life.
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  They just accept it. Not only do they have, we've had the video, we've had the clips, people throwing fireworks at people walking down the street.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  Now these migrants literally just turn up at government offices and just throw grenades at the building. That's how bad it is. They cover it up because of course they don't want the public to know the full scale of the chaos.
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  But they already know it because they live amongst it. We've had riots. We've had cars being torched almost every night now in Malmo.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  One of the top police chief had his car torched just the other day. That was a big story. And according to yet another police officer, a veteran there in Sweden, they are using this Code 291 procedure to cover up information about crimes committed by migrants,
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  crimes which include terrorism. You've got this big media narrative against Donald Trump. Oh, the media is not reporting on Muslim terrorism. What a conspiracy theory that is. Well, actually, no.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  Germany have told, the authorities there have told the police not to report on the identity of suspects if they are migrants, whether they're committing low level terrorism or serious crimes.
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  The same situation in Sweden. And now another top cop has blown the whistle. This is Thomas Astenloff, who says that the Code 291 procedure is being used to cover up crimes committed by migrants.
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  They're not releasing the photographs of the suspects in crimes to the public, even though it's in the interest of public safety to do so.
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  Because again, they don't want to further this reality, to even establish this reality in the minds of the Swedish public, that mass immigration is causing huge problems.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:39.000]  I know people that live there. I see the stories every single day. Of course, the first individual who came out to blow the whistle on this Peter Springer.
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  Now he's been deluged with bouquets of flowers from the public who are supporting the fact that he was brave enough to go public in the first place.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  Now his Facebook post, we'll get into it after the break again. He blew the whistle on this massive situation that's being covered up by authorities.
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  Now he's getting the backlash. We'll come back more.
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients, so the body will heal itself.

[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  I started out four months ago and since taking Android 400, I have dropped 45 pounds. I'm sleeping better. There's no cravings. I actually don't even think about food.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  My knee pain went away. I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute that to Android 400.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  One thing that Android 400 said on the radio ad is it attacks belly fat.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  Well, let me tell you it did. The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach. I've lost six inches. This product really does work.

[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  Now getting back into the news, of course, I mentioned before the break, these two top cops in Sweden have gone public saying every single crime or almost every single crime that they process
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  that comes across their desk, the suspect is named Muhammad, Muhammad, Muhammad, Muhammad, Muhammad.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  You can spell it differently. The suspect is still named Muhammad. They're talking about serious crimes, rape, extortion, blackmail, abuse of judicial procedure,
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  violence against the police, drug trafficking, aggravated drug offences, attempted murder. You've seen the horror stories out of Sweden.
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  These cops have gone public simply pointing out the reality. One of them, at least for the moment, has been reported to the authorities as a racist for pointing out these known facts.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  But finally, it seems, given the reaction, the public reaction to this officer going out, sticking his neck on the line and telling the truth, it seems that they're finally starting to come around.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  He was deluged with bouquets of flowers. What's interesting is that the police department wouldn't allow the press to come and take photos of these flowers.
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  You see them here, but the police department wouldn't allow the press into the police station to take photos of these because, again, that busts the narrative that there is now a huge groundswell of support,
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  which is coalescing in the Sweden Democrats performing well recently in the polls against mass immigration and what it has done to Sweden.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  And let's just go through a few more stories to that effect just from today.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  Muslim migrants shouted damn Germans as they torched refugee camp. This is out of the gateway pundit. Muslim migrants shouted damn Germans and laughed as they torched the Düsseldorf refugee camp.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  Now, what was the reason for torching their own refugee camp at which they're looked after with taxpayer money at great expense? Well, they ran out of Nutella, which is a chocolate spread and gummy bears.
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  Okay, so supposedly fleeing war-torn Syria, supposedly fleeing ISIS, terror, civil war, and yet they get triggered and burned down their own asylum center because they ran out of gummy bears.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  Now, something tells me that not all of these refugees are actually fleeing war and that many of them aren't actually refugees and that they're just economic migrants.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  Could that be the case, do you think, if they get angry when they run out of gummy bears? Well, I wonder.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones show. The big video, The Truth About Popular Culture is coming up.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  Don't go away. We'll be back.

[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:32.000]  Popular culture is more vulgar, vapid, self-absorbed, hedonistic, and dehumanizing than at any other time in living memory.
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  Culture is supposed to be uplifting. It's supposed to infuse our lives with intrigue, lust for knowledge, and appreciation of beauty.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  Instead, for the past two decades, pop culture has only served as a sewer pipe of projectile diarrhea aimed directly at our gawping mouths.
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  By its very definition, popular culture has always been mass produced for mass consumption.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  But over the last 20 years, as I'm sure you've noticed, pop culture has become significantly more vacuous and obscene.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  It's a rancid assault on the senses. Why is popular culture so contrived, plastic, empty, meaningless, grotesque, and incredibly retarded?
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  Because from the 20th century onwards, postmodernist, moral relativists, critical theory espousing, cultural Marxist nihilists began to seize control of society.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Postmodernism seeks to erase the distinction between high culture and popular culture. They want to turn everything on its head.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  In simple terms, postmodernists have sought to reshape society in their image.
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  And that's why everything's so ugly, from architecture to art to music to entertainment, they're making everything hideous.
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  The goal? To completely undermine the foundation of Western civilization and leave us open to subversion and capitulation.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  Look at television. TV's endless portrayal of broken families, emasculated male figures, and aberrant nihilistic, droog-like youths.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  The stars of so-called reality television are virtually always narcissistic, amoral, and borderline insane.
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  They have no redeeming traits, indoctrinating us with the idea that this is actual reality, that this is how we should act too.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  You're beginning to think that the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal. You do whatever the tube tells you.
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you even think like the tube. This is mass madness, you maniacs.
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  In the decadent late stages of a society, bizarre behavior proliferates and is legitimized by the dominant culture.
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  They're fetishizing pathology, where even seeing the mainstreaming of pedophilia by the news and entertainment media.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  Salon.com giving a platform to a wannabe child molester. Articles that legitimize watching child porn. A new Fox show that shows a transgender six-year-old wearing a sadomasochistic bald gag.
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  This is all intended to drag us down into the gutter. Once we absorb this kind of degeneracy, our moral filter is irreparably damaged.
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  Studies show that the more TV you watch, the more depressed you are, even for active people who exercise regularly.
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  And is it really any wonder, given the warped and corrosive view of humanity, that is perpetuated by television?
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  We are their cattle. We are being bred for slavery.
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  Can somebody please explain to me what the hell that's all about?
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  Popular culture is also hypersexualized. It's not prudish to observe that the sexual imagery we're bombarded with by television is infinitely more gratuitous than it was just 25 years ago.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  Even pornography itself is becoming uglier and nastier.
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  It's documented that this hypersexualization process has normalized cheating and betrayal.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  It's this, oh, everyone else is doing it, so why not me? Mentality. Hypersexuality in popular culture leads to ruined relationships and failed marriages.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  Pop culture is making us miserable and lonely. Look at the cult of celebrity.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  Being famous used to require having actual talent, even as recently as 20 years ago.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  Now, the measure of famous celebrity achieves is directly proportionate with the volume of tasteless debauchery that they inflict on the world.
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  Vulgarity has replaced talent. The more vulgar and ostentatious, the better.
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  Thanks to social media, young people have been indoctrinated into this idea that narcissism, not fulfillment, not meaning, not authenticity, but narcissism is the ultimate measure of satisfaction and importance.
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  Celebrity is just a reflection of that. So what do we look for in our celebrities?
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  Talent, meaning, authenticity? No, we look for narcissism.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  When 16-year-olds were asked in a survey, what would you like to do for your career?
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  54% answered, become a celebrity. Yet nearly 70% of them had no idea whatsoever how they would achieve this.
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Sometimes when I watch TV, I stop being myself and I'm a star of a series or I have my own talk show or I'm on the news getting out of a limo going someplace important.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  All I ever have to do is be famous. People watch me and they love me.
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  It's no surprise that since the explosion of celebrity-led narcissism, young people are more depressed than ever.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  Suicides amongst those aged 10-24 are up every year since 2010.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  Why are you all so unhappy? Because you're aspiring to something completely vacuous and unobtainable for the vast majority of people.
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Popular culture is making us miserable.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  Celebrities are now more revered than religious icons.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  This is why people suddenly turn into gushing morons whenever a celebrity dies.
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  Render, blubbering idiots over somebody they never knew and never even met.
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  In many cases, someone they weren't even interested in until they died.
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  It's like North Korean competitive crying every other week.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  And look at celebrities who wake up from their coma and use their platform to bite the hand that feeds them by questioning what they're a part of.
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  When Kanye went off script and started decrying the popular culture he once served, they put him in a psych ward.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  Look at how the custodians of pop culture treat celebrities who think for themselves or who challenge the status quo.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  They're immediately dispensed with because the entire scam is dependent on a complete lack of diversity,
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  a vicious intolerance of anything that's truly original or unpredictable.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  That's why popular culture is so sterile.
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  And you know, it's ironic that one of the most popular talent shows is called the X-Factor.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  Given that the introduction of actual X-Factors, i.e. unknown quantities into the system, would cause it to collapse.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Look at popular music, the same handful of people writing and producing songs for the same handful of popular artists.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  Why do you think everything sounds the same?
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  The same procession of electronic beats, repeated hooks and verbal diarrhea that passes for popular music now.
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  Music is less diverse and the lyrics are more dumbed down than ever before.
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  Man, rap today sucks bad. They're not even saying words anymore.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  They just got a hard ass to trick dumbasses like you to make you think you like to hit a brick wall.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  There hasn't been a single authentic movement in popular music for the last quarter of a century.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  And look at the effects it's had.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  Young people were once able to channel their self-loathing, their anger through the medium of rebellious music.
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  Think punk grunge goth.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  Now they're all growing up listening to sterile drivel like One Direction and Maroon 5.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  Yes, we always had manufactured plastic crap, but we also had alternatives.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  Now there are no alternatives. They just don't get the airtime.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  MTV used to play alternative music videos.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  Is that what they mean when they say videos have symbolism?
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  What does MTV play now? 16 and pregnant musicians with actual talent and authenticity
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  because they still exist are prevented from challenging this sterile status quo
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  while talentless, button-pushing, noise-vomiting DJs are deified.
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  Millennials have been stripped of the ability to diffuse their adolescent rage and alienation into music or subculture.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  So they turn to the mental ghetto of identity politics instead.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  And that hasn't gone so well.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  What has my generation contributed to advanced popular culture over the last 30 years?
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  Humiliatingly little.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  Seriously, what have we contributed?
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  Can you name anything positive?
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  Gangster rap? A movement that encouraged millions upon millions of young people to aspire to act like degenerate criminal thugs.
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  Yeah, that worked out great, didn't it?
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  But then look at someone like Hobson.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  Here's a guy who raps about how retarded and destructive Gangster Sheik is.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  A guy who tells young people to get off drugs and live clean.
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  What happens to musicians like Hobson?
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:11.000]  Yeah, some of them get signed to big labels, but then they get parked for three years
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  or their albums are deliberately given no promotion.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  They're never allowed to obtain superstar status.
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  Because their message represents a threat to cultural Marxism,
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  a threat to the toxic identity that the music industry force feeds young people.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  Look at youth counterculture.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  In the past, youth culture was spearheaded by students.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  They created the counterculture, which then trickled down into pop culture.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  What are students busying themselves with today?
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  Safe spaces, political correctness, virtue signaling and gender studies.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  When did being cool become about parroting everyone else's opinions?
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  They are socially conscious citizens and are provoked by the loathsome presence of a non-mutual.
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  They are sheep.
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  Being hip become about writing laborious Facebook posts about how progressive you are.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  As Theodore Dalrymple noted, the pressure to conform to cannons of popular taste
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  or rather lack of taste has never been stronger.
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  Everyone's petrified of constant social media surveillance by their peers.
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  Reactionary! Rebels!
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  Disharmonious!
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  Rebels! Reactionary!
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  And we force ourselves to swallow this rotten culture,
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:33.000]  just so we can feel an affinity with our peers.
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  So we can fit in.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  That's why there's no discernable youth counterculture.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:41.000]  It's all predicated on conformity.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  You must conform.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  Yes, it is my swan duke to see that you do conform.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  And kids today are so satiated with the deluge of entertainment on offer
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  that they have no time or interest in rebelling against the received culture.
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:44:58.000]  No time to create their own look.
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  No inclination to form their own ideas about the world.
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  But when it's so much easier to just regurgitate what Russell Brand or Meryl Streep is saying,
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  whether it be fashion, art, music, literature, comedy.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  Culture has been completely sanitized.
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  There is no counterculture.
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:21.000]  And that's why, with very few exceptions, everyone looks the same.
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:27.000]  Same haircut, same beard, same clothes, same meaningless tattoos, same lazy cynicism,
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  same political views, same outlook.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.000]  There's no authenticity. There's no daring.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:35.000]  There's no individuality.
[3:45:35.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  Look at modern conceptual art.
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  The post-modernist war on absolute truth has spawned the demented belief that anything whatsoever can be considered art.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:54.000]  Why is modern art that requires skill or displays or inspiring beauty ignored in favor of tawdry trash?
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  Literally trash.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  Have you ever visited Tate Modern in London?
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  It's a giant building full of scrap metal, concrete blocks, urinals, and this.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  Whatever it is, they call it an art gallery.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  It more closely resembles a landfill site.
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  What does this look like to you?
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  Dog food and a turd?
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  No, it's conceptual art.
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  The post-modernist decree that literally everything has to be part of a social justice movement
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  has also inspired feminists to offer up their bodily functions as art.
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  A giant ass was nominated for the Turner Prize.
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  I mean, forget full retard.
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  We've gone full idiocracy.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  The years passed, and mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  And the number one movie in the country was called ass.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:53.000]  And that's all it was for 19 minutes.
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:46:57.000]  It won eight Oscars that year.
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  So we're told to genuflect over the deeper meaning of a six-foot butt crack
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  while actual works of art are being renamed because the original title might be offensive.
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  Look at modern theatre.
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  We went from Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to this.
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  They're making everything that's supposed to be exquisite, hideous and repugnant.
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  What's supposed to inspire us now dehumanizes us when ugliness is venerated as beauty.
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  We know we're in the depraved late stages of a civilization.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  Popular culture is so invasively vulgar that it's often cited as one of the factors
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  in the radicalization of Islamic terrorists.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  Jihadists in the West often immerse themselves in this culture
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  and then become suicide bombers as the only form of repentance.
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  That's how bad it is.
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  That's right.
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  Jersey Shore and Miley Cyrus are actually seen by terrorists as legitimate reasons to attack the West.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  And who could argue with them?
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  But seriously, when we defend Western civilization, we're not talking about popular culture.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  We're talking about the Sistine Chapel, not Piss Christ.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  We're talking about Beethoven, not Bieber.
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  But we've become bored of what we've inherited.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  The true meaning behind the rich tapestry of our cultural heritage has been forgotten.
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  Popular culture, as it exists today, actually represents a direct threat to Western civilization
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  since it provides our enemies with a justifiable reason to destroy us.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  A civilization is starting to unravel.
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  You can find it again and again and again through history.
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  It's a culture that no longer believes in itself.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  On the edges, whether they're the vandals and the Huns, or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS,
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  you see them starting to mass on the outsides of the culture.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  And that's what we have right now.
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  If we allow this to represent what we stand for, whatever moral superiority our ancestors earned
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  will be eviscerated within a generation.
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  That's why we need to constantly savage this notion that popular culture represents Western civilization.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  It doesn't.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  The weaponization of popular culture, as I've described it, is merely the reassertion of cultural Marxism.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  By making the culture that underpins our society completely meaningless and therefore rudderless,
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  it can be easily overthrown. We need to reject popular culture in all its grisly, grotesque, dehumanizing forms.
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  We need to encourage a new cultural renaissance that is once again inspired by beauty, talent,
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  and the exaltation of human accomplishment.
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  That is the truth about popular culture.
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  It is available right now up on my YouTube channel, Get It, Share It, Red Pill Generation Z.
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  Just picking up on one aspect of that video, I've talked about the vicious intolerance
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  that the entertainment industry has for anyone that deviates from the leftist consensus, the orthodoxy.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  TMZ reports Kanye West released all Trump tweets.
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  Kanye West has scrubbed his Twitter account of all things Trump,
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  and it's because he's unhappy with the president's performance over the first two weeks in office.
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  Yeah right, it's not because he's been hounded and intimidated by leftists in the entertainment industry
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  for daring to go against the grain, is it?
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  Absolute complete vicious intolerance of diversity of opinion.
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  They hate it. We'll be back with the final segment on The Alex Jones Show Live. Don't go away.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  Extendivite 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  Can you afford a heart attack?
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:38.000]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.

[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:14.000]  Maybe you also have food storage, but how would you keep your refrigerator running in a long-term EMP blackout?

[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  We're live on the final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  Remember, we need your support more than ever. We're under attack constantly.

[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:20.000]  This is how we expand. This is how we do it.
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  This is how we've got to this position in the first place and we have super blue fluoride free toothpaste back in stock after being sold out for months at infowarslife.com.
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  This is the premier fluoride free toothpaste. Everybody should be using it by now.

[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  And it's now available at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, fluoride free toothpaste.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  Nobody in their right mind should still be brushing their teeth with fluoridated toothpaste.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  You've got to be on this by now and why not get it from us at infowarslife.com to support this network.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  Now you heard before the break we had the truth about popular culture.
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  Basically at this point, millennials are lost. Generation X is lost.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  The good news is Generation Z is the most conservative since World War II. This is a report I have the Daily Mail which is actually a few months old now but I wanted to re-highlight it.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  And when I say conservative, it's basically just reality-based. It's common sense-based.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  The most conservative since World War II, you look at the percentages.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  Around 85% of millennials and those in Generation X had a quite or very liberal stance overall.
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  You compare that to Generation Z and it's quite the opposite.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  The numbers are very encouraging. One in seven, 14% of 14 and 15-year-olds took a quite conservative approach to life compared with only 2% of millennials and 1% of Generation X.
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:18.000]  So those numbers are vastly superior.
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:24.000]  Again, I get messages every single day from teenagers saying how much they support me.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  Conservatism is a new counterculture. They're bombarded with trigger warnings, with safe spaces, with left-wing puritanism from cradle to death.
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  This is the new form of rebellion. If they're going to school and hearing these same turgid leftist viewpoints every single day and being shut down whenever they try to challenge them, well, of course, naturally, they're going to rebel against that.
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  And that's what's happening with the next generation.
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  We're turning over the next generation to be on our side with the information, with reality-based information.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  That is the red pilling of Generation Z.
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  And there's an independent article up right now which ties into this.
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  Millennials are struggling, and I bash millennials. I'm a millennial, but quite frankly, a lot of them are lost right now.
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:20.000]  Millennials are struggling at work because their parents gave them medals for coming last.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:24.000]  Bosses the world over are struggling with their millennial employees.
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  They say we confound leadership or self-entitled narcissistic, lazy, and tough to manage.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  This is the attitude that's created with this everybody gets a trophy mentality.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:46.000]  This is the attitude created when you have an entire generation suffering from narcissistic personality disorder because they're all drug addicts for social media likes.
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:57:51.000]  They literally get the same impact as a hit of dopamine when somebody likes their Facebook posts.
[3:57:51.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  They've become addicted to that.
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  They've become addicted to approval to social brownie points from their peers,
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:09.000]  which is why they all share the same opinions and why anyone who dares to go against the grain and have actual reality-based opinions is socially ostracized.
[3:58:09.000 --> 3:58:17.000]  Tying into that is another story which found that Antifa members, the far-left violent anarchist Antifa members in Germany,
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:24.000]  92% of them still live with their parents and 90% of them are single.
[3:58:24.000 --> 3:58:31.000]  In other words, these people are complete losers. Millennials are lost but Generation Z is ours.
[3:58:31.000 --> 3:58:35.000]  That's going to wrap it up for the show. Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow.
