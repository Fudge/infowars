[00:00.000 --> 00:13.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.120 --> 00:30.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones we were
[00:30.840 --> 00:38.600]  live here Friday we're live today on this Monday edition 29th day of September 2014 before we knew
[00:38.600 --> 00:47.600]  details of the beheading and attempted beheading wounding of another woman at a factory facility
[00:47.600 --> 00:55.800]  up in Oklahoma and it wasn't hard to guess that it would be connected to radical Islam but you
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.680]  see the media response since it's come out that indeed that's what happened trying to cover it up
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.720]  and I'm not one here calling for a cold war with Muslims I'm not an Islamophobe everybody knows
[01:06.720 --> 01:13.240]  that but at the same time when you have a real radical Islamic offensive that we've been talking
[01:13.240 --> 01:19.360]  about for a long time four years at least being launched worldwide and being funded by the highest
[01:19.360 --> 01:29.960]  levels of NATO and Western governments you've got to ask what's the in-game plan here well it's
[01:29.960 --> 01:37.360]  to bring in basically martial law under the name security I mean I was listening to local talk radio
[01:37.360 --> 01:42.960]  today I was watching the news this morning over the weekend they were saying oh looks like those
[01:42.960 --> 01:50.960]  military equipment are needed to fight ISIS looks like it was the right thing to do was it
[01:50.960 --> 02:00.520]  military equipment armored vehicles checkpoints NSA surveillance that stopped Alton Nolan who
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.680]  tried to chop two women's heads off and successfully chopped one woman's head off before
[02:04.680 --> 02:15.280]  being shot by the CEO of the facility who had his concealed carry and mitigated it money on it
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.280]  this guy would probably stab 1015 people and of course you could go look Saturday and they already
[02:21.280 --> 02:27.760]  found his Facebook with him showing off with the Islamic State flag and the rest of it promoting
[02:27.760 --> 02:36.280]  Islamic State and they were on CNN this morning saying gee we wonder if it's connected to any of
[02:36.280 --> 02:44.240]  that oh my goodness we don't know he is literally in the last six months been radicalized hanging
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.640]  around with these people he was a football enthusiast slash Oklahoma Christian six and a half months
[02:50.640 --> 02:59.480]  ago on his Facebook post and then got immersed in a quote radical mosque so he kind of went from
[02:59.480 --> 03:07.320]  being a football player godfather thug life type guy somebody was on the edge want to be tough
[03:07.320 --> 03:13.480]  want to be a man and I've pointed out that the way they use Facebook and Twitter we're really
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.880]  seeing trendies with ISIS patches we're really seeing it because celeb we're really seeing it
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.240]  being promoted and pushed by the Muslim Brotherhood and out of Kenya through Obama's cousins and
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.560]  half brother and others we really are seeing Google behind the Arab Spring and our government
[03:31.560 --> 03:38.760]  trying to overthrow the former Egyptian dictatorship of housing Mubarak to put something in far worse
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.200]  and then our media criticizing the military after a year of tyrannical rule of the Muslim
[03:45.200 --> 03:50.880]  Brotherhood something like 20 million Egyptians hit the streets protesting it so the military took
[03:50.880 --> 03:55.800]  back over stop letting them burn down all the churches and crucified people and our media
[03:55.800 --> 04:02.440]  CNN actually criticized it so let's get one thing straight here the people running our government
[04:02.440 --> 04:11.880]  the special interest are protecting our funding our shepherding our opening the door for radical
[04:11.880 --> 04:20.240]  Wahhabist Islam to launch a jihad worldwide and the whole buildup of homeland security in the last
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.840]  1213 years was in preparation for this so that we will accept the police take takeover which will
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.240]  then be flipped onto Liberty movement now I told you that before it happened 13 years ago it's
[04:31.240 --> 04:37.400]  now happened you've now seen the flip again but they they need another push to get the cops the
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.560]  military everybody to go along with it so that they get in place get accustomed to go into the
[04:43.560 --> 04:52.600]  motions before they publicly stage false flags in America and turn them loose on anybody who

[08:43.240 --> 08:51.800]  ladies and gentlemen it is monday the 29th day of september 2014 i am your host alex jones
[08:53.480 --> 08:57.480]  and every day i seem to come on air and say wow our plate is certainly full but
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.880]  but that is on the tip to make the broadcast sound interesting i am completely overwhelmed
[09:05.000 --> 09:18.920]  bellying up to this nightmaric bonanza this virtual cornucopia of craziness but sticking
[09:18.920 --> 09:25.000]  our heads in the sand will only make it worse so that's why we're here to break it down as a radar
[09:25.000 --> 09:34.280]  system and to try to navigate the planet terra firma approaching its carrying capacity
[09:35.160 --> 09:42.600]  four seven billion 350 plus million souls aboard this planetoid
[09:45.240 --> 09:50.840]  so fantastic to be here again i'm extremely honored to be your host but it's even more
[09:50.840 --> 09:59.960]  fantastic obviously to be a conscious sentient man experiencing this existence with all of you
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.960]  we are all truly brothers and sisters in that experience no matter which side we serve
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.760]  so always remember how epic consciousness is the system first and foremost
[10:14.760 --> 10:21.960]  first seeks to shutter the mind to make you feel pointless and weak and to make you bored
[10:21.960 --> 10:28.360]  and to make you only tune in to their attempt at false reality that is the state-run media
[10:28.360 --> 10:33.800]  and the controlled hollywood culture it is an attempt for them to force you into their
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.440]  artificial consciousness their system of total control and this revolt
[10:38.440 --> 10:45.560]  that i am only a small part of is truly a revolt demanding free will
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.880]  and for the self-determination to at least be able to make some of the basic decisions
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.280]  governing all of our individual and yes collective destinies as a species
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.880]  i am honored to be here thank you so much the news websites are info wars dot com and prison
[11:07.880 --> 11:15.480]  planet dot com obviously we have obama coming out saying that they underestimated islamic state threat
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.040]  islamic state was built by nato saudi arabia turkey
[11:24.200 --> 11:29.560]  basically everyone in the middle east but iran and syria and egypt and libya
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.400]  that matter of a country was our ally or neutral it's been overthrown and handed over to islamic
[11:37.400 --> 11:44.440]  state known as al-qaeda known as wahhabis known as sunni radical arm the paramilitary takeover
[11:44.440 --> 11:53.880]  arm of saudi arabia and this is all being done because they know the military finally clicked
[11:53.880 --> 12:03.320]  finally had a paradigm moment when the light bulb ignited above the head and realized oh my gosh
[12:03.320 --> 12:10.760]  there's a global shadow corporate chaos organization that consolidates power out of worldwide crises
[12:10.760 --> 12:14.360]  that is protecting and shepherding radical islam
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.200]  and we don't want to be part of it and so once this force had been turned loose
[12:24.200 --> 12:31.000]  now they have to have some staged bombings of it to try to get the narrative back to
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.120]  homeland security and the other homeland security systems in australia england germany you name it
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.400]  they need to now legitimize not just to us but to their own people who are really now sitting back
[12:45.400 --> 13:00.920]  decompartmentalizing so we have that we have a little small order with 36 confirmed dead when
[13:00.920 --> 13:12.920]  a volcano erupted in japan spewing ash and toxic fumes by comparison in the reports i've got here
[13:12.920 --> 13:19.000]  they estimate that the yellowstone volcano the supervolcano the biggest known in the world
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.360]  there's several but it's it's now active i want to say that again active and with their computer
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.840]  algorithms they estimate it will erupt soon now that means the next hundred years but
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.360]  now it's moving even quicker they think it erupts every few million
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.360]  that it is between 10 and 20 000 times bigger than what this volcano eruption was
[13:40.360 --> 13:46.760]  hundreds of times bigger than mount st helens covering more than half the united states in
[13:46.760 --> 13:55.480]  molten ash changing the climate of the planet sending us into a dark age it erupted 2.1 million
[13:55.480 --> 14:03.240]  years ago 1.3 million years ago 640 000 years ago according to the isotope readings the biggest
[14:03.240 --> 14:10.600]  eruption was 640 000 years ago and i'm not saying this is imminent
[14:13.800 --> 14:19.960]  in a human lifetime scale but it just shows you when they say we need to have stable climate
[14:19.960 --> 14:27.160]  and pay a un body and homeland security domestically quote prosecute green crimes of not throwing
[14:27.160 --> 14:33.880]  your recycling oil or whatever that it has nothing to do with protecting anybody and
[14:33.880 --> 14:40.520]  everything about surveilling and micromanaging every facet of our lives as a world unifying
[14:40.520 --> 14:46.520]  religion that isn't even based on real sensible environmental crises and problems that are
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.040]  happening they need to be dealt with it's a cover for all of that as all the gmo and pharmacological
[14:52.040 --> 15:00.840]  crops and cross species abominations and human cloning and chimeras spider goats it all glow
[15:00.840 --> 15:07.160]  in the dark dogs all of it racing forward and we're talking about carbon dioxide and how we've
[15:07.160 --> 15:13.880]  got to have a totally stable climate with no change the only thing that's stable is change the only
[15:13.880 --> 15:19.000]  thing constant is change the only thing that continues to happen is change anyone with a
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.680]  literal iq of 60 points knows that but they insult everyone's intelligence i saw no exaggeration
[15:26.680 --> 15:34.760]  probably 25 articles or more last week mainstream headlines smithsonian nasa washington post cbs
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.520]  no one questions climate change is now not global warming and then quotes about we must not have
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.640]  climate change denial and we must get the taxes in place to do it and obama's going to act with
[15:45.640 --> 15:55.080]  executive orders regardless to protect us from climate change when giant asteroids hit the earth
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.880]  all the time there's huge volcanoes everywhere how many civilizations got covered in lava in five
[15:59.880 --> 16:13.960]  minutes like pompe crack a toa it's just ridiculous we're on a planet that hadn't even cooled with
[16:13.960 --> 16:21.080]  about a mile two mile thick depending on where you're at somebody's even thinner floating islands
[16:21.640 --> 16:30.840]  of mountains and seas flying at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour through space orbiting
[16:30.840 --> 16:40.680]  a sun out on the edge of a galaxy and we really are worshiping hollywood stars and obama and red
[16:40.680 --> 16:49.080]  carpets i mean give me a break go out to west texas when it's a clear sky no moon you'll just
[16:49.080 --> 16:57.240]  fall to your knees it's like the stars are just coming down the stars are big and bright deep in
[16:57.240 --> 17:05.080]  the heart of texas what's that song we're singing when i was a kid the stars at night are big and
[17:05.080 --> 17:12.200]  bright deep in the heart of texas i mean that's incredible what's the bible say you can see
[17:12.200 --> 17:21.240]  god's handiwork in the firmament and it is shifting from looking at the dirt and the amoeba
[17:21.240 --> 17:29.480]  like globalist and shifting and seeing the big picture transcending them just that thought alone
[17:29.480 --> 17:35.800]  begins the journey of escaping this devilish construct they're trying to build this technological
[17:35.800 --> 17:47.400]  terror they've constructed to quote darth vader the arrogance and the hubris of the wicked
[17:51.800 --> 17:57.080]  the fool and his money are quickly parted more like the fool is quickly parted from his own
[17:57.080 --> 18:02.840]  consciousness and free will and all i want people to do is to think for themselves
[18:04.680 --> 18:08.440]  the minute we heard about a beheading and a man trying to behead another person
[18:09.480 --> 18:16.120]  i mean we knew what it was going to be and it's it's it's hype this guy the so-called suspect
[18:16.120 --> 18:21.160]  even though he's seen by over a hundred people alton nolan was killed by the ceo of the company
[18:21.160 --> 18:27.640]  in oklahoma who had his concealed carry and within a minute and a half of the attack happening
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.920]  the head of the company went in the ap reports and the police report they were finally forced
[18:36.920 --> 18:46.760]  to report this it was out on saturday he wounded him a man fired from an oklahoma food processing
[18:46.760 --> 18:56.920]  plant beheaded a woman with a knife was attacking another worker when he was shot and wounded
[18:56.920 --> 19:06.200]  by a company official police said friday alton nolan having a fruity and slip saying killing him i
[19:06.200 --> 19:11.720]  wish he would have killed him because that's a true crime of hate to be able to take a knife
[19:11.720 --> 19:19.960]  and go in and saw somebody's head off and see young males that haven't had good fatherly
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.360]  role models it's just a statistical factor four to seven times more likely to end up in prison
[19:24.360 --> 19:30.440]  to end up being violent to end up being thugs it's the exact same statistics for a white kid or a
[19:30.440 --> 19:37.240]  black kid except that blacks are two or three times more likely to be a legitimate now and we've
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.200]  talked a lot about this and so instead of being a gangster now because he was into being that
[19:42.200 --> 19:47.240]  previously on his facebook a godfather mac daddy gangster then in the last six months he got into

[24:00.680 --> 24:10.920]  i can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
[24:10.920 --> 24:16.280]  i don't have to see for miles and miles even though i can see a screw job in the making
[24:16.280 --> 24:22.440]  happening right in front of me here's an example the u.s ambassador to the un said about a week
[24:22.440 --> 24:27.160]  and a half ago we played the clip here two or three times that yeah of course taking out isle
[24:27.160 --> 24:35.480]  is about taking out a sod there are chenemy who's done nothing but fought al qaeda for four years
[24:35.480 --> 24:43.880]  with our government arming them and now the shoddy arabian ambassador to the u.s the videos up on
[24:43.880 --> 24:52.840]  info wars dot com came out on 60 minutes yesterday and said yeah we need to take out isle take out
[24:52.840 --> 25:04.280]  a sod that's how dumb they think we are it first aired on 60 minutes also then aired on uh this
[25:04.280 --> 25:11.640]  morning with anchor norah o'donnell i'm not gonna play the clip okay it's just so insulting
[25:13.480 --> 25:18.280]  that you know what i don't start fights i don't back invading countries that haven't done anything
[25:18.280 --> 25:24.760]  and blowing up every church it's not rocket science to say it's wrong for our government
[25:24.760 --> 25:30.360]  and nato for four years i know i keep harping on this but it's just so incredible how dumb they
[25:30.360 --> 25:37.160]  think we are and i guess we are to be pumping billions of dollars in 600 tons of weapons
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.560]  just the last month or so
[25:42.440 --> 25:48.920]  as senator paul talked about into isis they're not getting whole warehouses of armored vehicles and
[25:48.920 --> 25:58.520]  us special forces trucks and us m16s at military bases we just left in eastern or western iraq
[25:58.520 --> 26:05.240]  they've been given them and our military is completely freaked out and they should be
[26:08.360 --> 26:16.520]  and all of this is about covering obama's but and hillary clinton's and the rest of them
[26:16.520 --> 26:23.640]  and senator graham and senator mccain who's so angry at ran paul who keeps saying you met with isis
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.320]  and then he goes that's ridiculous well actually i did but so what uh you should go meet with them
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.720]  too and then all these headlines ran paul got caught in the hoax mccain never met with anybody
[26:31.720 --> 26:38.120]  bull i remember two years ago showing the video the photos he was proud of it and half the guys
[26:38.120 --> 26:44.680]  he met with are the leaders of islamic state but they think you're so dumb they're still up
[26:44.680 --> 26:52.120]  they're lying about it and now the saudi arabian ambassador to the us tells cbs news yeah it's about
[26:52.120 --> 27:03.560]  taking out a son after we take out isis what it's about turning that place over to saudi arabia
[27:03.560 --> 27:13.480]  saudi arabia conquered it before last century syria Damascus and so it's just all about smoke
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.520]  everybody's like oh my gosh what's gonna happen oh i guess we had to take them out of course
[27:18.520 --> 27:23.800]  of course al qaeda needs to be destroyed it's horrible and let me tell you people say alec
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.440]  you're the one always saying terror is fake why are you saying islamic states are real threat now
[27:29.320 --> 27:33.400]  well i always said there's different types of terror there's purely provocateur there's
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.720]  lined up toys where you find mentally ill people get them to do it there's systems where you open
[27:37.720 --> 27:42.360]  the door for terrorists to attack and use the nsa systems to make sure other agencies that are doing
[27:42.360 --> 27:47.480]  their job aren't able to stop them because literally like 98 percent of the government is
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.080]  compartmentalized it didn't know this stuff was going on now that it's all out in the open it's
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.440]  the decompartmentalization that could destroy the new world order folks i remember three years ago
[27:56.440 --> 28:02.440]  at belterberg we got the intel from sources inside that they were having main meetings about how to
[28:02.440 --> 28:09.720]  spin that they weren't behind al qaeda and how to cover it up the head of nato was there and they
[28:09.720 --> 28:15.480]  were really upset because their narrative was being disrupted and the fact that arab spring had been
[28:15.480 --> 28:23.320]  launched by them was starting to come out and so now obama's running around saying we were caught
[28:23.320 --> 28:30.680]  flat-footed well i got bad intelligence bad intelligence they have armed over 100 000 of
[28:30.680 --> 28:35.800]  these jihadi spare minimum given them the weapons turned them loose all over the place and the media
[28:35.800 --> 28:44.120]  has backed them overthrowing libya syria egypt another areas you all saw them do that so this
[28:44.120 --> 28:51.160]  is a challenge here are we this dumb well let me tell you the public may be dumb the military's not
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.840]  they all know the players they all know what's going on only tell you who else knows
[28:57.480 --> 29:02.440]  quote law enforcement only because they actually have to study these groups and organizations
[29:02.440 --> 29:07.000]  and so they know this is completely phoning so the question is do you trust a government
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.040]  that's doing stuff like this that's all i'm saying because when we come back the next phase that i've
[29:12.040 --> 29:20.040]  been warning you about is beheadings in america then mass shootings of schools factories universities
[29:20.040 --> 29:26.280]  federal buildings and a big truck full of plastic explosives rolling right into the white house when
[29:26.280 --> 29:31.240]  obama will be gone don't worry when they do that oh he'll be such a hero or or the president took
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.400]  off the helicopter a minute before when they got a warning i mean i'm throwing out these scenarios
[29:35.400 --> 29:40.280]  because i know how they work so they can't pull them and believe me i'm not being arrogant they
[29:40.280 --> 29:45.640]  watch they listen and then this decompartmentalizes all the secret service and other people that are
[29:45.640 --> 29:50.760]  good to know what to look for they can blow up congress folks we're i'm telling you they're
[29:50.760 --> 29:56.280]  getting ready to pull something run by spider sense feels and the gzm radio network now you're

[34:07.240 --> 34:17.080]  to god it's alex jones the inventor of the world wide web warns of threat to internet freedom says
[34:17.080 --> 34:25.720]  a global tyranny is taking over william benning number four at the nsa a director of their technical
[34:25.720 --> 34:33.240]  operations and development they say uh even abc news says one of the great greatest codebreakers
[34:33.240 --> 34:39.800]  and mathematicians in nsa history says it is a total totalitarian takeover with the destruction
[34:39.800 --> 34:46.760]  of free will in mind i don't know we now have sir tim burners lee saying there's a global takeover
[34:46.760 --> 34:54.360]  that's afp we have the former director of the nsa saying it's a totalitarian takeover i mean people
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.240]  say if there was a takeover happening people would warn us there are good people in the system
[35:00.520 --> 35:06.840]  i had colonel schaefer on about a month ago and he said if you want to know what i really think
[35:06.840 --> 35:12.840]  because he still just classified briefings of congress interview this gentleman mr steel who
[35:12.840 --> 35:21.720]  was a cia actual field commander with the army and then we get steel on and steel starts saying
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.160]  this is a false flag that's a false flag they're bringing in marshal law because you know isis
[35:27.160 --> 35:35.080]  basically works for them because that's what's going on do you understand that we're not up here
[35:35.080 --> 35:42.600]  playing patty cake making stuff up when i tell you that they're getting ready to release brigade
[35:42.600 --> 35:49.000]  level i'm talking three four five thousand terrorist sleepers in this country that's the type
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.440]  of capabilities from my research that islamic state has in this country this isn't some fake al-qaeda
[35:54.440 --> 36:02.200]  wing cutouts decoys set up on 9 11 who are really on cia payroll that's confirmed that's that's
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.600]  that's one and guardian that they were at least double agents bare minimum and we're being lied to
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.440]  about what really happened the 28 pages that saudi arabia was intimately involved and then our
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.160]  government ordered to stand down bare minimum that's been confirmed by congressman walter jones
[36:17.160 --> 36:23.400]  that's read the 28 pages that's been confirmed by colonel butler who was there that day he was on
[36:23.400 --> 36:31.560]  three weeks ago briefing congress congress was told in briefings 95 percent of the islamic
[36:31.560 --> 36:42.120]  jihad force attacking syria isis that's just a catchall term it's all all of it i even predicted
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.240]  i said they'll bomb some little 50 person 100 person splinter group they will not bomb their
[36:47.240 --> 36:53.160]  main is that they equipped and trained and you notice they couldn't get a resupply because
[36:53.160 --> 36:58.120]  congress blocked the funds and the pentagon refused to ship the weapons because the pilots
[36:58.120 --> 37:03.240]  came on this show and literally got death-threaded and everything else and and subpoenaed by the
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.840]  justice department people like oh there's good people in the cia they would ship guns al-qaeda
[37:08.840 --> 37:14.600]  well they came on the show and told us all about it tosh plumley what do you think that was
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.440]  the pentagon wouldn't do it so they said okay just come into iraq resupply there
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.960]  and they do it through saudi arabia so they can have plausible deniability they can fence the money
[37:27.960 --> 37:39.080]  the weapons this is what's happening ladies and gentlemen and so if i wanted to overthrow america
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.720]  if i wanted to overthrow what's left of western civilization if i wanted to bring in a tyranny
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.760]  so i could then turn the west into an armored compound to launch a global war worldwide to
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.440]  take over the planet for the bankers and destroy the other free countries and the other rogue
[37:56.440 --> 38:04.040]  countries as well as the west while i was at it i would fund a radical jihadist worldwide to threaten
[38:04.040 --> 38:08.040]  the west and to stage horrible atrocities i would then give them part of the middle east as their
[38:08.040 --> 38:15.720]  payoff have their patsy's commanded by shadow forces attack real installations they will really
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.360]  be killed there will be real wars with our troops and these people there will be real police killed
[38:20.360 --> 38:30.200]  by these people it's a real world fight but the whole thing is simulated at the top and is synthetic
[38:30.200 --> 38:36.280]  the word they use is synthetic this is an artificially manufactured created system
[38:36.280 --> 38:46.840]  and the next move
[38:49.400 --> 38:54.760]  it could be a nuke they've put a lot of pre-programming out on that going off of the major city a huge dirty mom
[38:56.600 --> 38:58.440]  but they really want to go after guns
[38:58.440 --> 39:05.640]  so they'll probably target a democratic controlled area where they know they've got a lot of
[39:06.360 --> 39:12.040]  lot of tied up victims with nobody there to protect them new york chicago dc
[39:13.960 --> 39:17.000]  and they'll go in and just kill a lot it could be 200 kids
[39:20.120 --> 39:26.680]  and then they'll spend it we need gun control see the these local ices sympathizers got their
[39:26.680 --> 39:32.920]  guns legally at gun shows i mean i just just just think about the enemy's mind learn how they operate
[39:32.920 --> 39:36.520]  and what would you do if they were them that's how i continue to predict what they're going to pull
[39:38.360 --> 39:40.120]  you would do something like that or
[39:45.480 --> 39:49.320]  by the way people that say oh don't give them any ideas believe me these people already have all
[39:49.320 --> 40:03.000]  these ideas let me assure you of that do you know what a hundred real trained terrorists
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  with asymmetrical warfare can do to an industrialized country
[40:09.800 --> 40:17.560]  just unbelievable have it and remember while our southern and northern borders are wide
[40:17.560 --> 40:24.120]  open they are saying we've got to have the armored vehicles and paramilitary police to counter ices
[40:24.760 --> 40:30.040]  when their training is for the tea party and gun owners and veterans and when they're done letting
[40:30.040 --> 40:34.760]  the jihadis attack the west and shoot down airliners with stinger missiles that our government gave
[40:34.760 --> 40:43.640]  them 15 000 of bare minimum they are going to come after all of us claiming that somehow we were
[40:43.640 --> 40:50.280]  involved or somehow you know we launched terror attacks it's a script they're following
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.600]  and so i harp on this a lot because this is what i fear these are the moves i would make
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.640]  if i was the establishment plus we've caught them doing this stuff over and over again
[41:05.720 --> 41:07.800]  so for me it's not a question of if but when
[41:07.800 --> 41:17.080]  and it's really hard to cover all this other news when we know this here's obama though trying
[41:17.080 --> 41:24.840]  to distance himself from the stand down of letting 100 000 there's over 200 000 fighters
[41:24.840 --> 41:34.040]  estimated in syria attacking Assad in the military 200 000 head choppers 100 000 whatever it is they
[41:34.040 --> 41:39.400]  try to downgrade the numbers of you know 13 20 000 actual isle isle the names are all meant to
[41:39.400 --> 41:48.440]  confuse people we know that pouring back into iraq and obama is saying that it's underestimated
[41:49.080 --> 41:55.880]  islamic state threat underestimated that's like dr frankenstein's saying he underestimated
[41:55.880 --> 42:05.560]  what his monster would do let's go ahead and go to that club i think our head of the intelligence
[42:05.560 --> 42:11.560]  community jim clappers acknowledged that i think they underestimated what had been taking place in
[42:11.560 --> 42:19.960]  syria essentially what happened with isle was that you had al-qaeda in iraq which was a vicious
[42:19.960 --> 42:28.440]  group but our marines were able to quash with the help of sunni tribes they went back underground
[42:28.440 --> 42:34.440]  but over the past a couple of years no during the chaos of the syrian civil war and you are
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.120]  essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned they were able to
[42:40.120 --> 42:47.000]  reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos and attract foreign fighters who believed in
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.640]  their jihadist nonsense and traveled everywhere that's enough 60 minutes the united states
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.480]  notice how everything's to manipulate our marines were able to quash crush them
[43:03.160 --> 43:09.800]  which is true that was like six years ago right as you got into office that was already done
[43:09.800 --> 43:15.800]  and and then they were allowed as we told you three four years ago to set up bases in western iraq
[43:18.280 --> 43:24.280]  to prepare for the attack into syria and to set up bases in jordan and bases in turkey and bases
[43:24.280 --> 43:29.880]  in the golan heights israel helped them this is in the news this is admitted in jerusalem post
[43:31.960 --> 43:36.680]  to then launch this all out coordinated attack and the argument was all it doesn't matter they're
[43:36.680 --> 43:41.480]  the only ones that'll fight remember three years ago uh in council on foreign relations foreign
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.760]  affairs publication they had the headline why we need al-qaeda and it said well they're the
[43:46.760 --> 43:52.360]  only ones that'll fight we got to take out a side and now we're told they're going to shoot down
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.640]  airliners they're going to bomb us they're going to start chopping heads and the border is wide open
[43:57.640 --> 44:07.640]  there's the headline cfr strategist praises al-qaeda bombings in syria 2012 paul joseph
[44:07.640 --> 44:15.240]  watson and then links to foreign affairs in the article where you can read it for yourself
[44:17.480 --> 44:22.520]  look at this quote the syrian rebels would be immensely weaker today without al-qaeda in their
[44:22.520 --> 44:31.880]  ranks by and large free syrian army battalions are tired divided chaotic and ineffective feeling
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.720]  abandoned by the west rebel forces are increasingly demoralized as they square off with the Assad regime
[44:37.720 --> 44:44.360]  superior weaponry and professional army writes the senior fellow the middle east studies in the cfr
[44:44.360 --> 44:50.040]  and they go on to say al-qaeda fighters however may help improve morale and then it goes in to say
[44:50.040 --> 44:56.040]  the influx of jihadis brings discipline religious fervor battle experience from iraq yeah killing
[44:56.040 --> 45:01.480]  our troops think of the sickening macchiabellion statement funding from sunni sympathizers in
[45:01.480 --> 45:09.960]  the gulf sorry arabia and most importantly deadly results in short the fsa needs al-qaeda now he adds
[45:09.960 --> 45:16.600]  good job blowing that up group remember listeners i say something you can search it and you can find
[45:16.600 --> 45:22.360]  it not making jack squad up here does that mean i don't get stuff wrong occasionally or flip dates
[45:22.360 --> 45:30.200]  around no i do and i got a whole team of people in there watching what i say they go hey he didn't
[45:30.200 --> 45:35.400]  he didn't get killed he shot him he shot the head chopper the ceo did and oh oh yeah thanks for
[45:35.400 --> 45:41.400]  reminding me he wounded the head chopper he didn't kill him because you try to take it on your feet
[45:41.400 --> 45:45.720]  up here with no teleprompter but the point is that's why this is different radio slash tv
[45:45.720 --> 45:49.880]  than anything else because we're going off real research here and i know i've been spending 45
[45:49.880 --> 45:57.800]  minutes of the first key hour on this but this is the big enchilada and i've got to say again
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.280]  it is libertarians it is conservatives it is police and military
[46:06.280 --> 46:14.760]  are the only groups getting any grasp of this right now and i listen to so-called liberal media
[46:17.080 --> 46:22.760]  and it is just a defense of obama and a defense of what's happening and a defense of all these
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.360]  wars and they're really coming out of the water work attacking us right now saying we're traders
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.760]  because we don't want to attack and they're attacking ram pulsing he doesn't want to attack isis
[46:32.760 --> 46:37.720]  now he said if we could bomb isis that'd be great but why did we arm them to begin with
[46:37.720 --> 46:44.120]  that's the big issue and that he's not confident in the attacks obama is ordering launch because
[46:44.120 --> 46:50.840]  they are as phony as a three dollar bill you can rest assured of that now dr russel blalock's
[46:50.840 --> 46:59.480]  going to be joining us for a full hour to look at obama care as we've now been into it fully
[46:59.480 --> 47:06.200]  phase one fully implemented there's phase two and three and also want to get him on about
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.160]  all the different neurological disorders we're seeing increasing and the rest of it
[47:12.520 --> 47:17.240]  and the fact that that guys i forgot to ask you this will you print me on the news the last week

[56:34.600 --> 56:43.560]  dot com and prison planet dot com and let's look more uh at alton nolan uh the reported beheader
[56:43.560 --> 56:51.560]  who went into this hr area and made a b-line for two white women killing one wounding the other
[56:51.560 --> 56:58.440]  and it's a racial attack meanwhile obama gave another speech we have the video play it next
[56:58.440 --> 57:04.120]  hour we have time with blalock saying that basically everyone knows america is racist
[57:05.720 --> 57:13.160]  well alton nolan said quote sharia law is coming now until six months ago when he became
[57:13.160 --> 57:19.000]  a muslim uh he was into being you know kind of a mac daddy type uh you know the godfather all
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.400]  this gangster type stuff in football but see it was even more gangster and scary to be an og with
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.320]  i guess isis so this is more like a lone wolf camp follower and i expect to see more of this
[57:33.320 --> 57:38.040]  type of business the way the media hypes it is cool as it is online in fact i'm the first person
[57:38.040 --> 57:45.480]  months ago to say i'm seeing a cool trend i'm seeing this isis is garbage really being pushed is cool

[58:00.760 --> 58:06.360]  and um of course the media is not saying it's racial and they're not saying it's is islamic
[58:06.360 --> 58:12.760]  and here's obama quote most americans think nation is racist and he went on to say that
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.640]  black males you know don't trust the police well well here's the issue i don't trust a lot of
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.760]  stuff that goes on with the police because historically there can be real corruption

[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:51.080]  what to do it's just that i feel in my gut that this year is going to be a whopper because i've
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.040]  already seen the drug-resistant bugs build to a certain point i've already seen it's not even my
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.120]  gut i sit around i look at the news i look at the numbers all day and even though they're not really
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.280]  reporting that a crisis is forming you can see it and then now they're saying oh yeah get ready for
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:10.520]  super bugs super viruses super bacteria you know this this winter is going to be a mac daddy
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:21.640]  and now we have people getting paralyzed who have been exposed to the intro virus guys
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.640]  print me the headline from last week i forget what publication was mainstream about i think was mbc
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:32.600]  that uh mystery illness linked to vaccinated kids that was the one i wanted and then the
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.480]  i think you gave it to me i want the
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:45.640]  i want the thing about kids dying and and collapsing to get the hbv in columbia
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.800]  and then other stuff because i want to just be able to show all those when blalock comes on with
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:59.480]  thank you some of the other news that's coming up fumbled bid for governor imperils ohio democrats
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.160]  all over the country democrats are losing because people are revolting against them
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.680]  the problem is that the republicans don't deliver on some real reform
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.680]  and not scuttling this country they're going to run the ship up on the rocks fully
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:21.400]  and so people will vote for a ham sandwich or a donkey
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:28.760]  pun intended before they will vote for a democrat right now because people understand
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.440]  they have been mildly betrayed and people say well that's just how politics is yeah but it's
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:39.400]  getting more severe it's getting more extreme i mean obama care is a doozy of a whopper on steroids
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:48.520]  it's bold with the death list and the and the death panels and the rationing of care
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:54.120]  and the 20 plus taxes and the payroll taxes i mean it is cold blooded
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.200]  so all over the country they're in trouble
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:09.720]  all over the country they're in trouble and so it looks like the republicans are going to take
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:19.640]  the senate as well not just the house and the message to congress is please don't stop this
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.880]  or please do this or please vote for that say we know about the globalist takeover we know the
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.040]  country's corrupt we know they're devaluing the dollar we know special interest from trying to
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.960]  blackmail you or threaten you just do the right thing together or the whole country's wrecked
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.800]  they're going to bring the whole thing down i mean now this isn't even about being goody two
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.720]  shoes anymore we're far past that this is about do you really want to wreck the golden goose
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.160]  because we tell you this isn't good for business except for a few mega banks that want to buy this
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.800]  country every piece of the dollar this global depression they're bringing in is is bad news
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.280]  but if we point out the globalists are behind it they may back down and do a soft landing
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.520]  they're only going to pull this off if they can get away with it dna force when cells become toxic

[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.920]  former congressman ron paul is going to be joining us tomorrow for 30 minutes with his take on that
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.080]  his son running for president and a lot more and former minnesota governor jessie ventura will also
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.560]  be joining us tomorrow they're both on the second and third hours we're now in to the second hour
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:17.320]  today i am your host alex jones now one of my favorite guest is dr russell blalock and of
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.880]  course he's a retired brain surgeon a well-known famous brain surgeon who developed some of the
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.600]  most widely used techniques out there today and he has basically in the last 30 years introduced
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.120]  many of the terms that are now in mainline medical journals like excitotoxins and issues like that
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:42.520]  and and he he has been vindicated uh on the dangers of aspartame uh mercury in the vaccines the
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:50.040]  marisol he's been vindicated over and over again in the last month we've seen not one but two not
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:57.480]  one but two high level fda whistleblowers come out one of them was one of the scientists that
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:04.280]  was was one of the two main authors of a big study that came out five years ago six years ago and
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.480]  then another one that came out in 2004 now that the one in 2004 was the one that said mercury's
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.480]  actually good for your children's brains and i'm going to play that clip from cbs news from 2004
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.040]  and he said that they were basically ordered to omit the evidence showing a tripling in autism in
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:30.200]  boys so how did monsanto with the sural research say that monkeys you know that were fed in their
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.080]  milk aspartame was fine they just omitted all the dead or brain damaged monkeys and then only kept
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.160]  the ones that were okay and said oh look it's fine doesn't matter 73 percent of the monkeys died or
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.480]  became brain damaged they just omitted them from the study that's been in congress so and where I
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:52.200]  learned about that from dr. blalock of gotta be 15 years ago on the show of all the guests uh he
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.600]  he has been the most trailblazing i know he hasn't come on you know to have his you know butt kiss
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.480]  but i mean we need to recognize people that have been demonized on national television the
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:06.440]  associated press you name it when he said the h1n1 was a fraud would lower your immune system a year
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:13.000]  later the head of the eu commission dr. wolf gain woodard came out and confirmed it all he has
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.080]  been triple vindicated uh in everything he said and so i want to just cover the waterfront from
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.040]  the articles he wrote on his blalock wellness center dot com the articles he wrote from newsmax
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:32.040]  dot com everything i mean it's just so accurate his research that literally i just he's a national
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.840]  treasure and you know i don't gush like that with most our guests it's just that i've been on the
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:44.840]  air 20 years i've interviewed on this guy since 1998 or so so i guess about 16 years and we wouldn't
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:50.440]  be where we are having most americans now aware of what's going on vaccine levels going way down
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.320]  people realizing they're dangerous we're not against vaccines it's just that it's what's in them and
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.760]  they've got liability protection is we got to clean up their act and at least that's my view
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:07.480]  he has a new super awesome website and a podcast blalock health channel dot com blalock health
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.040]  channel dot com what a resource send that out to everybody we're going to tweet it at real alec
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:18.440]  shows we're going to post it to facebook get that out to everybody because every child we warn every
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.080]  parent we warn they won't listen to somebody like me half the time or they won't even listen to ron paul
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:28.040]  or they won't listen or they'll they can fire hollywood stars that come out and criticize
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:33.240]  vaccines to try to shut everybody up but but they'll listen to a medical doctor a brain surgeon
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.240]  like dr russell blalock so he's with us for the balance of the hour
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.040]  and then we're going to have open phones in the third hour today but we're going to cover it all
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:49.560]  obama care the vaccines this new mystery virus that even cbs and nbc admit is linked to the vaccines
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.440]  four articles the last two weeks in three continents people getting paralyzed or dying
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:03.720]  from u n vaccine programs m m r polio and garter cell it's just crazy what's happening
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.520]  dr blalock thank you so much for coming on with us well thank you alec where do you want to start
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.760]  uh well we can start with this enter a virus uh d68
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.040]  you know what uh most people don't know in a lot of positions i don't know is that
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:29.400]  uh the enter of viruses which is a group of uh viruses that normally inhabit the intestine
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:36.200]  most of them are pretty benign they just call it a mild fever a little ache and a few days later
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:44.040]  you're well uh when i was growing up in fact we called it a summer virus so these are very common
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:53.160]  viruses now what changed to produce the the epidemic of polio back in the 30s 40s 50s
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:14:00.520]  was not a change in the virus it was a change in the host that is people's people's immune system
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.880]  and analysis of it now by independent scientists not the politically controlled
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:14.280]  uh scientists but independent scientists uh shows that uh something happened to people's immunity
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.280]  and about the time that polio started paralyzing so many children they had uh were doing widespread
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:30.520]  inoculations for diphtheria retussis and there's evidence now that that alters the immune system
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:37.640]  so that uh it produces a different disease and that is a paralysis and you know if the
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.960]  virus itself caused paralysis then everybody that got infected with the polio enter virus would have
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:50.760]  been paralyzed well they weren't the vast majority of people who contracted the polio virus had no
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:58.120]  disease or very mild disease only a small percentage uh were ever developing any form of paralysis
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  by the way my grandmother who's 89 uh you know just beautiful wonderful smart person
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:10.040]  and she was given the first polio vaccine and then a month later got polio and it ate half
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:15.320]  the muscle on her body but sorry just go ahead yeah and this is one of the things that was a big
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.800]  scandal at the time was that the vaccine itself eventually was causing virtually all the reported
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:32.600]  cases of polio not not a wild type virus uh and one of the big puzzles uh was that the uh virus
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:40.760]  seemed to be affecting the wealthier people the the upper uh uh economic class than and poor
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.680]  neighborhoods which normally would be just the opposite and what they discovered was that poor
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.840]  kids get a lot of normal infections and so they have good strong immune systems whereas the the
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:16:01.000]  wealthier kids were being protected against these uh diseases by avoiding uh the infections
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.600]  and getting the vaccines and therefore their immune system was very poor and couldn't react to it
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:13.880]  and this is uh we're seeing this magnified uh many times over now where they're just an
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:20.680]  unending push to vaccinate for every known disease even childhood diseases are quite mild
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:27.640]  you know when i grew up everybody got measles, mumps, chickenpox uh all of these things were
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:34.680]  very common uh and uh that built our immune systems up so that we became adults for more
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:41.160]  resistant things like flu and and uh so you know i've never had a flu shot in my life i've never
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:48.760]  had a serious case of flu but uh we weakened everybody's immune system so severely now
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:55.880]  from all of these things or diet uh things that that we know suppress immunity like the vaccines
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:02.440]  uh the way they're given uh that now people can't react and what people don't know about
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:08.120]  vaccines and most doctors don't know uh but it's well demonstrated in medical literature is that
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:16.520]  the vaccines shift your immune system to an immune suppression uh type state called a th2 shift
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:24.440]  and you said that during the h1n1 uh scare and then six months later the canadian government
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:31.160]  came out with two studies and said that it cut your immune system by as much or more than 50
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.760]  percent to take that vaccine so you how did you know that at the time i guess it's because it had
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.320]  already been done before i mean you already knew well the research had shown that that's what most
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:49.960]  vaccines do is they shift your immune system to a weaker uh antiviral type immune system well
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:59.560]  well we we know for instance if we switch over to the obola uh incident uh in africa well uh what
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:06.360]  they don't tell the general public is that africans almost all have a parasitic infection malaria
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:13.160]  roundworms in their intestines and that it has been shown by multiple studies and several recent uh
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:20.280]  have come out the nature magazine and science that this powerfully suppresses their cellular immunity
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:26.920]  their ability to fight viruses uh the obola virus itself invades the white blood cells that
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:34.440]  fight viruses and weakens immune system further so they're at a particularly vulnerable state
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.160]  it's not that the virus is such a vicious killer is that the people that it's infecting
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.640]  have this immune suppression uh well if you're taking the united states and injecting people
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:54.520]  with so many vaccines that you're keeping them in this constant state just like the africans that
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:02.040]  now you're you're switching everybody to this th2 uh immune suppression uh then uh everybody in
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:08.520]  united states becomes more susceptible as well uh and no one's talking about that now a lot of
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.960]  scientists know that but they're afraid to speak out because their careers would be ruined well
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:19.320]  that's what i was about to throw out look at how they get comedians fired from state farm commercials
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.200]  just because in their private life they say man something's going on with these vaccines or
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:30.040]  america's becoming fascist but uh you know this in the literature other medical doctors know it
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.400]  my dad's an oral surgeon and a chemist but you know he told me this stuff when i was a kid uh so
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:40.120]  it's obviously not a secret with people that are learned but then i've got family that are other
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.080]  medical doctors that write articles for the newspaper you know promoting vaccines saying
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:51.240]  you know safe and effective no problems uh don't listen to people that say you know it's the law
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.880]  when it isn't the law because i'm a good doctor and and i'm harvard educated and you don't tell me
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:03.720]  i'm wrong and and and that's a bunch of quackery but then i go read all the mainline studies the
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:10.280]  inserts you are really covering what's mainline science how can there be a disconnect between
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:15.880]  a a harvard educated pediatrician and then a brain surgeon like yourself when all your
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:23.240]  doing is covering the body of the most scientific respected literature well the problem is most
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:29.800]  physicians don't read scientific literature they read clinical studies and they read it in only a
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:36.040]  handful of journals for instance pediatricians read their journal and a couple other journals
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:41.640]  but that's it so most of their information they're getting from the vaccine manufacturers
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:50.280]  they're getting from their pediatric uh uh what i call a trade union uh and so they're not getting
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:55.160]  scientific information they're getting propaganda sure i mean in the journal you got a Gardasil
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.920]  ad you got two or three other ads and then right next to it an article about how great
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:04.040]  Gardasil is i mean this is not rocket science well and thing is to see what i do is i spend a lot
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:11.960]  of time delving deep into mechanisms by which all this occur and and i just finished a couple
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:19.160]  weeks ago lecturing to a group of pediatricians teaching them this mechanism uh and uh in the
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.680]  orange for a number of uh scientists who do excellent science and they agree they said that
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:30.040]  you know the mechanism you're describing is right on target well uh when you hear these
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.160]  doctors uh who get up and say it's completely safe and there's no mechanism by which it could
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:41.560]  cause it uh they don't know what they're talking about because there is a very firm well demonstrated
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:48.680]  scientific method by which these vaccines are causing brain damage uh prolonged brain inflammation
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:56.920]  uh and excitotoxicity in the brain that goes on for decades possibly a lifetime uh that has
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:04.600]  the potential of increasing a number of neurodegenerative uh diseases like Alzheimer's Parkinson's ALS
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:12.520]  and what shocked me is i cannot believe since uh my career and it goes back a good ways i have never
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:18.680]  seen so much neurological disease in people uh we're just seeing an explosion of Alzheimer's
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:24.920]  and Parkinson's and ALS you know when i was a resident uh we had to look around hard to find a
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:31.400]  case of ALS uh now there everybody everywhere everybody knows somebody that has a friend or
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:37.400]  a relative that has ALS uh it's just unbelievable and yet the medical profession i'm talking about
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:43.240]  the clinical practicing doctor he's totally clueless as to the mechanism by which you could
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:50.520]  produce this yet in experimental animals we can produce all of these neurological diseases uh
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:57.240]  by stimulating the immune system and and ways that resemble vaccination particularly the sequential
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:03.720]  sure excessive vaccination will produce this uh progressive neurodegeneration just like we're
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:09.400]  seeing uh clinically well i worked for a large animal vet off and on for three years and this
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:18.840]  was 25 years ago uh and back then uh one day a week at his clinic he would take uh dogs and cats
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.320]  out in the country and people would come in and he'd say you don't need a shot every year you know
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.440]  they ate them every three years max some of these vaccines work 10 years on a dog or a cat and they'd
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.200]  say but i'm supposed to get every year and he'd say no you don't need that and then he would explain
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:38.600]  to me we see him have convulsions we see him have autoimmune disorders we see uh their allergies
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:44.520]  especially in purebreds uh he's and then now of course in the last decade vets lobbied to get it to
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.400]  every three years now the vaccine companies are pushing back through the veterinary associations
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.920]  to make it the state level mandated every year uh literally just to make money but the vets knew
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:02.680]  this dr blalock 25 years ago yeah i hear from a lot of veterinary uh experts who tell me that they're
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:10.600]  seeing a terrible deterioration of of the dogs uh and the cats from these uh vaccination and because
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:16.360]  just like humans every time they can think of a new vaccine they give it to them and uh they're
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:22.120]  seeing this this terrible deterioration and it's the same sort of disorders we're seeing in humans
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:28.440]  we're seeing uh brain degeneration we're seeing an explosion of autoimmune diseases in the animal
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.160]  plus exactly what we're seeing in humans we're seeing an explosion of autoimmune diseases of
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:41.720]  every kind they're curling at early ages we're seeing increased ms uh lupus all of these uh
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:49.240]  autoimmune disorders we have good explanations as to how the vaccine would do that uh we have
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.400]  demonstration in our scientific studies of producing these very same diseases by vaccination
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.080]  and yet the intimidation by the pharmaceutical companies and the government and link with
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.720]  pharmaceutical companies scientists are terrified to speak out and what they did to andrew wakefield
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:15.480]  is one of the reasons that doctors are so terrified to open their mouth and say hey look millions of
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:22.600]  people are having their lives destroyed and their health destroyed by this crazy vaccine
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:28.760]  policy i mean we're not even reasonable now uh they're wanting to give 150 vaccines over a lifetime
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:35.560]  well you can't do that to an animal and not to destroy the animal's uh health uh you and you
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.040]  can't do it to a child or a human being a child gets about uh almost 40 different vaccines by
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:47.400]  the time they start school well now after they're in school they want them to get even more vaccines
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.840]  and when they go to college they want more vaccine uh if they go into the medical profession they say
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.560]  you can't enter a hospital and let's get a flu shot every year isn't this the heart of tyranny
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.640]  because if you talk to the brain surgeons the medical doctors the vets they'll all tell you the
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:07.560]  same thing the inserts on a lot of the vaccines admit it doesn't even protect you more studies out
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:13.480]  that uh hepatitis vaccines attack the liver why are we giving newborn babies getting to the heart
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.760]  of this dr. blalock they've had decades now to know this is going on instead they're ramping it up
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.800]  until six years ago no medical doctor i talked to would ever vaccinate a pregnant woman so they
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:29.880]  doubled down and said pregnant women need extra i so so instead of admitting that they've been caught
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.800]  in this eugenics policy is what i believe it really is and you've you know documented that as well
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:42.520]  instead they seem to be doubling down what's at the bottom of this rabbit hole what is the vaccine
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:52.600]  agenda really about well before i answer that i i i think without question the um vaccinating
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.800]  of pregnant women which they say they should be vaccinated during any stage of their pregnancy
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:06.360]  is the most absolute insane anti-scientific unsupportable idea anyone could have come
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:13.720]  up with now we have overwhelming evidence that immune stimulation during pregnancy increases
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:19.880]  the risk of that child being born with uh uh later developing autism or schizophrenia
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:26.680]  about six-fold or seven-fold higher now we know that we know miscarriages are increased
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:33.720]  uh yet they they're tearing out this insane policy of telling every woman to get a vaccine now the
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.400]  reason they're doing that is because they can't even interpret the scientific studies which found
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:45.880]  that if women develop the flu or develop uh an infection a serious infection during pregnancy
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  it increases the risk of autism and schizophrenia the baby but the studies found it's not the virus
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:58.520]  it's the uh the immune reaction that causes it it's interleukin six and that you can produce it
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:05.800]  without a virus just by stimulating the immune system well uh a woman's risk of getting a serious
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:12.440]  infection during her pregnancy is pretty small but they're calling for stimulating the immune system
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:19.160]  of every pregnant woman in the united unbelievable how insane is that well because it's unbelievable
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:25.160]  that the doctors that know this the the scientists that know this will just sit by and let them
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:33.480]  destroy the lives of millions of unborn babies uh uh and knowing that the science strongly supports
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:39.240]  that this is the most insane idea anyone could ever come up with but no one the flu vaccine
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:46.600]  during pregnancy the flu vaccine is ineffective uh for most people and particularly during uh
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:53.800]  pregnancy uh the the vaccines can be a lot less effective so but it will stimulate those cytokines
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:00.280]  that produce this uh the abnormal development of the brain that produces autism and schizophrenia
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:06.040]  so how many schizophrenics and autistic children are we going to have uh another five years from
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:11.720]  now after they've started this insane policy unbelievable the neurological disorders the
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:19.800]  mental illness every metric is going parabolic straight up like a rocket and when we come back
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:25.320]  we'll get your answer because you just set that up with is it on purpose well at this point we
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.240]  know it is because they know i mean every doctor i've talked to those yes it's true we know you
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.880]  don't vaccinate pregnant women everybody knew that so why do they say in articles i have women
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:43.320]  need extra i mean just give a pregnant woman extra they just need it it's a doubling down it's an
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.960]  over-the-top evil it's a full commitment and it is just devilish dr blalock is our guest we're on

[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.440]  you should be on a mission to send this to school nurses a mission to send this to their talk show
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.800]  host a a a mission to take the youtube that will be up by tonight or tomorrow of this live radio
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.960]  slash tv show and you should send it out to people vaccinating pregnant women is a death
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:58.680]  sentence in many cases imagine if we were reporting the nazis would shoot up pregnant women to try
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:06.760]  to force an abortion the un's been caught adding a hormone synthetically to the tetanus shot to
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:11.240]  then cause abortions you can look that that's mainstream news they've been caught in the
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.240]  mid 90s and again last year doing it so this is going on remember the tiskegee syphilis stuff
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.120]  remember all the other tests on troops it's still going on why do we trust the people
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:27.480]  these huge genesis that run the system i'm going to get dr blaylock to get into that in his research
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:33.480]  and why he thinks this is going on and because if we ever admit this is really going on the whole
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.440]  system will come down that's why so many people in the system just rationalize because they've
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.320]  been part of it they don't want to admit that through ignorance they have aided and abetted
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:50.120]  this scientific dictatorship that's my view we'll get dr blaylock's view in a moment one thing
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:57.160]  i'm doing because of all the super illnesses the super bacteria the mercer the flesh eating
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.120]  garbage is i'm getting more sun i'm drinking purified water i'm eating healthier meals

[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:52.040]  to play a clip here and get your response to this because i don't like to mention this without playing
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:59.160]  it because it's so outrageous here's the local version of a national cbs story from 2004 we now
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:05.800]  have one of the main authors uh on the study admitting they were told to omit the evidence
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:12.440]  that was actually tripling autism in boys what a difference 10 years makes here they are 10 years
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:18.200]  later admitting it was all a lie here's the original report mercury is good for your brain here it is
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.560]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:28.520]  pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.240]  might impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.880]  opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:44.920]  performance now the reason i play that probably for the 300th time over the years is that's what
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.760]  i call the over-the-top stratagem of these companies that funded that fake pr piece to be put out
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.480]  that oh we know it's hurting women and the insert says don't give it to pregnant women
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.320]  just take it off the insert and give it to them and just carry by the door you know if we're going
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:08.280]  to kill a million people of vaccines why not kill 20 million or or is it pure hubris what is behind
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:16.520]  this from your deep research dr. blalock well listening to this this piece that you played
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:24.280]  that was a very clever way that they came out with this what they found was that these kids
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:30.840]  that live on islands who eat whale meat whale meat is the highest mercury level of any uh
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:37.320]  secret and they found out that if they ate the whale meat and had high mercury levels
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:44.520]  but they also had very high omega-3 intake it blunted the damaging effect of the mercury
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:54.520]  so they had a slightly higher IQ than people who uh were deficient in omega-3 but they were far
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:03.400]  below uh the IQ elevation of those who didn't have the mercury so they just read uh stated this
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:10.120]  implying that the mercury was making the kids smarter and it wasn't the omega-3 but the mercury
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:19.800]  was uh interfering with the ability of omega-3 to improve mental function now the fact that mercury
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.160]  is is harmful to the brain that there's more research than you could read the titles to the
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:33.480]  articles that that prove it beyond any uh structured imagination my new doses doses that are almost
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:42.440]  in the nano concentration and produce significant brain uh destruction and damage it goes on for
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:49.880]  year now that is so well demonstrated for them to come out with this it is the it is a absolute lie
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:56.040]  it was a distortion it was nothing but pure propaganda and it led to the harm of a lot of
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:03.080]  people uh thinking that mercury actually improves your IQ that's the most insane idiotic statement
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:08.520]  I've ever heard and it's unsupportable but that's the kind of nonsense these people are involved
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:14.520]  in what they do is they manipulate research they pay scientists to produce phony research
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:20.280]  they even have articles written by a professional company and then have doctors put their name on
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.320]  it later because it's going to be in a prestigious journal and the doctors didn't have anything to
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:30.440]  do with the writing of or the research that's what the UN did with the 2000 scientists on climate
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.400]  change well this is happening all the time uh particularly these pharmaceutical companies
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:41.480]  they will they pay this company to write fake articles and then they'll go to harvard or Yale
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.080]  of the big universities and get people to put their name on it to give it press press g exactly but
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:52.120]  I'm not a brain surgeon but I've seen hundreds of articles I've seen I mean nothing's been studied
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.760]  more than mercury the last 200 years as you said I mean it's the most destructive thing on the brain
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:02.600]  except for cyanide we have the guys type in electron microscope mercury and brain tissue it
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:09.560]  causes electrochemical chain reactions explosions I mean I just it's how do they with straight faces
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.360]  say mercury is good for your child I don't see mercury on the vitamin aisle they say it because
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.440]  they're getting pockets full of money these people are being paid huge amounts of money to make these
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:28.840]  absurd harmful statements the problem with the scientists that know better than this the scientists
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:37.400]  who're doing the real research on mercury brain toxicity generally are badgered and terrified
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.840]  to speak out publicly because number one the media will not interview them the media will not
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:50.600]  carry their story uh and uh the only thing the media will do will destroy their reputations and
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.960]  then the pharmaceutical companies and the government and agencies will do everything they can to get
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.480]  these people to lose their their jobs and this has happened time and time again a good friend of mine
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:07.080]  David Lewis wrote a book called science for sale which I recommend anybody that's interested in this
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:16.600]  subject by this book uh he worked for the EPA for 30 plus years and he exposed uh some of the uh
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:23.400]  phony things the EPA was doing that was harming people published it in one of the most prestigious
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:29.640]  of the science magazine and they fired it and he goes through here and shows all the cases of
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:36.840]  people who've been fired how they control science how they control the media tell this the fake
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:43.880]  propaganda stories to the public so that they can promote vaccine programs they can vote promote
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:50.200]  fluoride they could promote whatever they want to and the real scientists are never interviewed
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:57.080]  for instance when they did this big study in the very straightened study uh no true mercury
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:04.520]  expert was even invited to the meeting now there were a number that are world-renowned experts
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:10.680]  on mercury and the effect on the brain they weren't consulted none of their articles were even
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.000]  quoted or entered into the study but even so the study found that mercury damaged the the
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.400]  brains of these children that were from vaccine and then that they altered the study uh when they
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.680]  published it in the journal pediatric so it said just the opposite uh now this is the kind of
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:33.880]  shenanigans that goes on every day and that's this is the kind of nonsense that the average
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:39.880]  position is reading so let me ask you this big pharma just wants to make money but as we know
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.200]  Bayer knew they were shipping out the HIV and hepatitis and the factor rate did it on purpose
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:50.760]  didn't care that came out in trial is it eugenics steering at all or is it they just don't care i
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:56.200]  mean how do you get executives and then this whole chain of people to get up there and say mercury
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.840]  is good for your kid and to cover up all the bad things that are happening how did it get so evil
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:08.280]  what's going on well i think the number one driving force for CEOs of companies and head of the
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.920]  pediatric association and all this is money they're buying these people they're putting large
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.920]  amounts of money into their pocket uh the the doctors that are they're experts and top people
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:29.400]  at harvard and yale and columbia and they are approached and given contracts to do fake research
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:35.080]  for these pharmaceutical companies and they can't resist the money it's just too much it's too lucrative
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:40.040]  some of these people are making millions of dollars and now they've done the fake research so now
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.840]  they're part of the crew they're now compromised they're now defending it because they don't
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:51.800]  want to be discredited exactly and so the the real uh position the real uh researcher who's
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:58.520]  doing this this research that's demonstrating this damage uh he's told what you can publish in
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.640]  and in your journals but don't ever approach the media uh you know and and there's been
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.080]  numerous cases of these people publishing uh these articles are trying to get them published in
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:15.000]  journals and having the pharmaceutical company approach the journal and have the article removed
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.560]  this has happened numerous times very good research apparently done research but if it shows harm of a
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:27.720]  pharmaceutical uh product it's making them billions of dollars they will use their influence on that
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:34.680]  journal to have that article removed now some journals uh are uh beyond that won't do that
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.880]  but there's a lot that will and a lot of them are the journals that physicians are reading so the
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.720]  physician reads these articles he thinks it's in a prestigious journal and he believes it uh he
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.760]  will not do the the homework that takes deeper reading deeper understanding and find out he's
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:57.400]  being lied to so they paw pair at this nonsense to their patience uh and it's just like this
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:03.960]  garter seal thing i can't believe that physicians are or see a 11 year old girl and 10 year old girl
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:09.240]  and tell that mother that that child needs to have a garter seal vaccine or she's gonna get
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:15.560]  uh cervical cancer now number one he doesn't know anything about hpv uh bars if he says that
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.520]  because it's sheer nonsense and he doesn't know anything about the vaccine now there's been
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:25.400]  almost a hundred girls that died from the that vaccine there's been thousands that have been
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:31.400]  harmed they continue to be harmed and and the insert says it doesn't even protect you from hpv
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.960]  i want to shift gears the time we have left to talk about obama care uh now they admit the death
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:42.600]  panels they admit va secret death list um zika lemanuel admits it's about getting rid of old
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:49.320]  people an article he wrote it's time to die by 75 the case for killing granny uh 21 new taxes
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:57.480]  bankrupting poor people uh payroll taxes on poor people rich companies exempt i mean such a monumental
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.440]  screw job and the democrats and republican leadership defend it i mean is that not a manifest
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.560]  conviction of the power structure that they would bring in this eugenics based system
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:17.480]  yeah i mean the obama care system absolutely outrage it was a fraud from the very beginning
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:26.680]  it was sold uh on fraudulent data uh the people who really knew about medical uh uh health care
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.520]  who came forward and said that the numbers you're quoting are false they're not real
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:36.840]  most of these people that are uninsured are people who have uh chosen on their own not to do it
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.640]  because they don't want to spend the money they're young they're healthy and they don't see any reason
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.320]  to do it well they inflated the number even further than that to give the public the impression
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:52.200]  there were all these tens of millions of people that were uncovered and the government was going
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:56.760]  to do the benevolent thing and make sure they they were covered well they lied from the very
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.480]  beginning oh you can keep your doctor oh you can go to any hospital you want to you can keep your
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:08.920]  plan they knew that the the bill itself said none of that was true uh the media covered for him as
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:15.080]  always you can always depend on the media to cover for these and then a z-keel a manual admitted on
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:19.560]  fox news we played the clip probably 20 times not going to play it again he said no this is meant
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.480]  to wreck the old system we're working with the insurance companies to do it there'll be a few
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.840]  big ones left at the end and they'll dole out government controlled care they admit they are
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:34.040]  trying to ruin the system just like you said four years ago on this show to kick all the old doctors
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.080]  in and bring in a bunch of foreign doctors that aren't even doctors well most of the people i know
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:45.080]  in medicine are saying i can't wait to retire i want to get out of it i can't stand all this
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.520]  paperwork and control and regimentation and being forced to hurt my patient they won't out
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.200]  and young people are not wanting to get in so the answer is and this is why the government's
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:01.160]  not worried about bringing all these foreign doctors uh from hundreds of countries around the
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:07.800]  world who they've been uh practicing and socialized medicine so they they don't see anything wrong
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.480]  with they'll come here and practice in american socialized medicine because the system they operate
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:18.840]  in is in shambles so they figure this has to be better until it ends up in shambles yeah that's
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.880]  like californians fleeing to come to austin and then try to take my guns and raise taxes and wreck
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.760]  everything it's like they wreck one place and then they go the next place to wreck it and like a bunch
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.240]  of locusts they just move to the next target well i've always said that we need report cards
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.760]  for the public because no one's paying attention that every one of these programs every one of
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:46.040]  these socialist systems every socialist country is in shambles absolute shambles and yet there has
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:52.680]  not been a single success report card of any of these systems and we keep playing it out as this
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:58.920]  is the utopian future to be effective absolutely just stay there dr blalock blalock health channel

[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:22.840]  i'm gonna talk about this at the start of the next hour dr stan montee from medical doctor
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:28.120]  passed away this morning and for battling cancer a long time he is resting in peace with the lord
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:33.160]  and they don't want folks to call they said if you want to write support letters to the family
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:47.320]  it's radio liberty po box 969 and i guess that's s o q u e l california 95073 and he was just an
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:57.640]  amazing guy and i don't think anybody had more total knowledge of what was going on and and
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.360]  the medical tyranny and why they were doing it than a dr stan montee for me he would do five
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:07.160]  hours a radio a day on over a hundred stations around the country including some of our affiliates
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.240]  and it's a true loss i don't know how to eulogize him at this point except fight back against the
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:17.080]  tyranny i know even he was on about a few months ago while while battling cancer and we went and
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:20.760]  interviewed him a year ago and he would have to go lay down for 20 minutes to get up and come talk
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.160]  to us he was somebody that really cared about freedom and i was just talking to dr blalock
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:30.920]  about why the enemy is so arrogant right now juxtaposed to somebody like dr stan montee
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:36.600]  dr blalock uh i know you've been on his show before but specifically can you repeat what you
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:43.560]  were saying to me during the break well stan was a good friend of mine um i've been to his house
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:51.720]  know his wife and his son uh it's very close to stan he was he's a man of enormous virtue
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:58.200]  honesty he just loved this country and he loved freedom and he fought forward he spent all his
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:05.480]  money on that radio station he's just the most wonderful man that i've ever met just incredible
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:14.920]  as the whole family so i'm really sad by this but what i was telling you and stan would he liked
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:21.560]  when i would say these things is that uh you know this it said that a man is a socialist
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:29.000]  and direct proportion to his contempt for his fellow man and that's what we see that these
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:37.800]  uh socialists these central planners uh the collectivists have absolute arrogance they see
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:44.840]  themselves as elites that they should dominate and rule and design the world and that people are
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:53.160]  nothing but useless and a little stupid cattle to be moved around like a chess piece and people
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:57:00.360]  unfortunately too many are allowing themselves to be treated this way you live in a free country
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  you have an opportunity to save yourself but people need to wake up they need to read about
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:13.000]  socialism communism collectivism they need to understand the words the propaganda how this work
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:22.280]  uh and quit listening to the idiotic propaganda uh from the the elitists themselves because they're
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:28.520]  the ones who who hammer this nonsense that well there's no no one world conspiracy there's no
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:35.880]  design for a world government uh when they write about it uh ceaselessly uh you can find it everywhere
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.800]  they've literally written thousands of books admitting their whole plan but knowing the
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.600]  public isn't reading it and just hoping they call us liars and people won't believe us that's right
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.600]  they have the media they're they're yap dogs to sit there and tell everybody oh yeah just what the
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:58.040]  what david rockefella said it's exactly what bruisinski said i tell people look at two things
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:06.280]  bruisinski and uh rockefella uh and kissinger right now just recently said we need to get behind
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:13.000]  this president he's the best president uh that we have we could have bruisinski was the one who
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:21.400]  uh promoted uh choosing obama for the presidency uh now bruisinski's not a stupid man he's a very
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:28.600]  powerful man he created the trilateral commission uh he writes books numerous books about geopolitical
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.840]  design dr blaylock we the next hour is coming up do five more minutes with us and i know you
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:37.160]  got to go to finish up talking about the master plan and a little bit more about your good friend

[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.480]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most

[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:20.360]  linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:24.920]  pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear to me
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:30.280]  it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:35.720]  escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured

[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.840]  that they even helped him try to battle the cancer he lived a lot longer than most people
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:38.440]  would the type of cancer he had and kept broadcasting last few years with it we're
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.960]  gonna do a special report for friday show uh when watson's sitting in and and put together some of
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.360]  the older interviews and also some of our video interviews with dr. stanmont teeth we've got a
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:55.320]  bunch of them together to remember him but just contrast this selfless loving informed caring
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:02.440]  person versus a hillary clinton a monstrous people that just have total disdain and a z-column annual
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:09.000]  these people just drip hate and envy and fraud but telling us they're virtuous and liberal uh any
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.880]  research that you let you discover that we're dealing with craven sickos uh finishing up with
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:21.080]  their master plan any other words about dr. stanmont teeth dr. blalock well the the point i
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:28.760]  was making is that here with all the disasters the big god see the isis the isle the the giveaway of
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:36.840]  the entire victory and all the the sacrifice our armed forces is uh committed in and uh
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:44.520]  afghanistan iraq he gave that all the way gave it away and yet these two brilliant man kissinger and
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:51.960]  brzezinski uh and say that this is the best and we should get behind the president now that tells
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.720]  you something about kissinger and brzezinski now anybody who doesn't believe that there's uh
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:04.280]  something uh a foot that's quite foul in our world with these powerful men putting this
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:11.800]  traitor to our country as president uh then there's something wrong you need to look into it now uh
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:20.040]  stanmont teeth was a man who always stood for truth over everything uh stan was uh
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:27.160]  one of the finest men he was a orthopedic surgeon and he spent uh all his time on this radio
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:37.320]  broadcast researching traveling teaching lecturing uh he just was determined to tell people what was
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:45.080]  going on he was a voracious reader he knew numerous people of of high position who were telling him
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:52.840]  information from the inside uh we we've lost one of the great men uh and great defenders of liberty
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:03:01.880]  and and uh my heart goes out to his family i don't think you can quantify the effect he's had uh
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.680]  though that's why i admire him you and ron paul and so many others who truly are out there trying
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.600]  to educate telling the truth trying to stop this evil and as bad as things are if it wasn't for all
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:17.960]  the people uh like congressman mcdonald and countless others that came before us we would
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.120]  already be completely overtaken these collectivists have already taken down most of the world they've
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:29.480]  taken us down to a great extent but we just can't quantify where we'd be if it wasn't for people like
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:37.720]  dr stanmont teeth yeah he's his contribution it's unmeasurable and his influence on people around

[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:02.600]  to just you name it all the kgb defectors and you name it he interviewed him
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:11.080]  he was interviewing gebra griffin 40 years ago he was interviewing anthony sutton 30 years ago
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.680]  he was interviewing senator church of the church committees i mean just he was immersed in this
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:22.120]  no exaggeration with that focus of an old line professional medical doctor he quit his practice
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:29.960]  focus on this i guess 30 years ago very lucrative successful and just put everything he had and
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:36.760]  worked 18 hours a day 18 hours a day when he had cancer he would just sleep and then get up and do
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:42.440]  radio shows i'm not going to get into all the stuff i know the backstory we were there two years ago
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:48.360]  for the obama deception too i got to put that film out and he didn't want to tell us he had cancer at
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.160]  the time we learned about it later and he would like talk for 10 minutes go in a room and obviously
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.920]  throw up and stuff and then just like come out and do the interview and it was and he had all
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:04.520]  these archives too he was offering him to us but saying i don't know what to do with all this we
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:10.040]  don't have we don't know what to do with it literally thousands of film reels and rooms of
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.240]  documents and just dr. stan whenever we would have some piece of information he would call him
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:20.520]  say i want the source of that or when someone claims something he would he would ferret it out
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.760]  and discover who the source was he obviously had a lot of intelligence operatives and people feeding
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:33.080]  him info because he had so much integrity and he exposed that hiv was a race specific bio weapon
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:40.440]  got the documents he never wanted any of the the credit for anything he just so many times you
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:48.040]  track something back to dr. stan monteef you track it back to where he'd gotten the document where
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.600]  he had originally of course was in the new york times but he'd made a big deal about it back in
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:58.120]  1976 whenever mouse a ton it was 76 died and david Rockefeller wrote an obituary about how
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.520]  wonderful he was it was monteef made copies of that by the thousands and sent it out to radio
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:08.520]  people and sent it to congress and freaked out he was one of those people that just was always at
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:15.480]  the epicenter of of good change and and defending liberty and battling tyranny and and he did it
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:25.640]  absolutely with a servant's heart and that's what mattered and uh you just got to be proud of him
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:31.560]  there is so much honor in that and and such a sense of completion and even though it's sad it's
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:39.240]  bittersweet because there's real satisfaction in a man and a family and his wife who've lived
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:47.640]  integrity who've lived dedication to fighting evil who have who have focused like a laser beam
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:55.480]  with a commitment that's what manliness is not acting tough not shooting up a bar uh not running
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:02.360]  around you know flexing your muscles threatening other people or road rage manliness is full on
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:12.600]  dedication for 14 18 hours a day for 47 48 years when he discovered the new order conspiracy
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:22.680]  to fight it and hold it back that's a commitment just quiet focused in their hammering away at the
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:31.080]  enemy and it takes different strokes for different folks i'm i'm you know boisterous angry aggressive
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.360]  because i got into this when i was 20 years old i'm 40 now and i get angry when i learn our
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:42.280]  government funded now who killed 84 million people i feel threatened at a very primitive level
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:49.880]  and i but people like to stand my teeth can control it obviously feeling the same thing
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:55.160]  and focus it now some could say obviously in my 20 years i've been more successful to
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:00.440]  mon teeth and his 47 we don't measure things like that because we stand on his shoulders
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:06.200]  that's why the little things you do to fight evil helping old lady across the street praising a
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.040]  police officer when they do the right thing getting in a police officer's face when they do the wrong
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:16.760]  thing running for mayor decrying yourself when you do the right thing helping your family not
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.400]  just throwing you know gram on a nursing home to die but actually taking care of her or making sure
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:25.960]  they're taking care of at the nursing home it's an inside job with all of us to make a better world
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:34.360]  not letting government treat us like slaves having dignity being honest confronting corruption
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:43.560]  that's what this journey that's what this journey is all about
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:53.240]  and none of you know i don't know what ripples in the pond our lives like rocks hitting the surface
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.040]  what ripples will touch others i mean i've been in the pond jumping around splashing quite a bit
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:05.000]  but the real power of info wars is you the listeners taking action spreading the word
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.400]  doing your own access tv show your own youtube channel your own local radio show
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:16.840]  encouraging others you don't know who you're going to warn who laughs at you but five years
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.280]  later wakes up you don't know how those dominoes and those chain reactions connect into others
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:28.200]  the enemy does they have an idea because they understand the power of the individual
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.400]  they know what they've done working together in evil what power it had so they know you have power
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.720]  they know i have power and so they're always they're telling us we don't have power they're
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.800]  always they're telling us that it's all lost with nothing we can do we're reveling in it yeah your
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:46.200]  kids belong to us yeah two plus two equals five yeah you didn't build your business yeah we're
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:53.320]  going to get your bible and your guns because they want to dominate us through their disdain real men
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:59.240]  and women have too much pride and honor to want to dominate someone who's even lesser or to take
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:07.160]  advantage of stupid people you try to build them up so incredibly pathetic and the disdain for
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:12.520]  humanity you people have out there that serve evil makes you want to throw up you're about your

[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.320]  fingers at the west and say it's the great source of evil but it was also a great source of liberty
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.840]  so more wealth was produced here so evil came to take it over to turn it towards an engine
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:57.560]  of planetary evil planetary cancer and that's what we face now so many trendies go well there are
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:02.040]  seven and a half or seven hundred seven billion three hundred something million people i mean
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.640]  there are too many people i mean we do need to sterilize people and they'll kind of wink and
[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:11.080]  giggle about it like they're part of it you fools you're being targeted as well we should be working
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:17.000]  to build up humanity working to find solutions working to be honest not working to put deadly
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:24.040]  vaccines into pregnant women that they know brain damages their babies bare minimum i mean it's all

[02:18:54.360 --> 02:19:03.640]  acumen anyone who's got any six cents or a spirit or or dialed in you can intellectually see it but

[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:24.040]  about coyotes terrorizing people across the u.s and eating people's pets it's because nobody's
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.000]  shooting them and it's in all the liberal areas oh we can't allow that they're they're animals well
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.480]  okay your dog and cats are all going to be dead then see this is how it works you want to act like
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:37.960]  prey animals and roll over and teach your sons not to fight back or your daughter's not to fight
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:43.320]  back and then you wonder why it's in liberal feminist controlled areas that the women are
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.640]  getting raped and attacked and why your crime rates are 10 15 times higher it's because you've
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:59.240]  been raised to be prey to the criminal class see my granddaddy and my daddy raised me to be a farmer
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:07.000]  and how to live off the land and how to be a business man you see that's the difference
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.560]  you got a country boy can survive maybe we should come back with that i live back in the woods to
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:21.320]  see the woman the kids and the dogs in me i can skin a buck i can run a trot line they don't want
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.680]  that and they don't want us as black white it doesn't matter hispanic whatever coming together
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.760]  around the family and around liberty but i got an article i forgot to it's in my office actually in
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.080]  my bathroom if somebody'll bring it to me it's out of the journal i actually get up in the break
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:41.000]  and get it it's out of the journal of nature and it's an excellent article actually about how
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.480]  the family unit is what made humans so strong starting with men and women being absolutely on
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:51.480]  the same team in the division of labor but i read globalist stuff from the sixties about
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:56.200]  destroying the division of labor destroying the human family so the state could absorb us
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:02.280]  and so this article is the same research but from the perspective of why it's good for men
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.560]  and women to work together so see it's not just one big unified evil people have already had so much
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:15.560]  of this they know it's bad almost everyone i know scientists psychologists um futurist uh
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:22.360]  inventors anthropologists sociologists they get it now but they can't get funded by the
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:29.240]  establishment you've got to fund them by buying books and things and and and research it's a
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:35.240]  it's a money war folks but i'm telling you most people in the establishment are easier to wake up
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:38.920]  than other people because they're so they're so close to it they know how creepy it is
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:45.000]  but i mean i was reading this whole thing about men and women and how that's what made humans
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:50.760]  superior and how we took over the planet was was was our teamwork and not a fake collectivism where
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:56.280]  some ant hive tells us what to do but we're in little units we would vote to put in charge
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:01.240]  whoever was the smartest the best the most trustworthy and it was a culture of honor
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:07.240]  and chivalry now as the agrarian society came in the last 6000 years and cities got built the
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:13.000]  corruption then became in because you could have larger organized units and it wasn't based on small
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:20.040]  bands and honor anymore it was based on whoever had the most troops and then taxation and then
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:26.120]  decadence set in and now we're going to see a hyper confluence of all the billions of people
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:32.280]  the the high tech the decadence and the establishment but also the public uh the mistakes of the
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:38.840]  elites magnified into just such an incredible time to be alive i mean this is the most amazing time
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:44.520]  to ever be alive from a macabre point of view but also from an exhilarating point of view
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:50.840]  we are going to see unbelievable things unfold so strap yourselves in we're on the don't just

[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:07.000]  dr stan monteef passed away this morning a really good friend of mine i've been on his radio show
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:14.200]  for at least 18 years as a guest he's been on my radio show since about 1997 so close to that
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:19.560]  interview him for a few years till i got on air a few years and uh he died after a two plus year
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:24.360]  battle of cancer then he would tell anybody about until about the last year while he wasn't on the
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:31.960]  air a lot had fill in guests and others but he's gone now and all i can say is he was a very classy
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:39.320]  person and the amount of intel he put out and how much information went out like ripples from the
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:50.120]  water when you throw a rock into it from him is mind blowing and it makes me feel so humble about
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:56.760]  the position we have that reaches even more people every day standing on his shoulders the shoulders
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:03.400]  of giants that's why i don't want to be thanked because i think of how much better job i should
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:11.640]  be doing with this type of firepower in our hands at our disposal info wars dot com prison
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:18.120]  planet dot com the nightly news this radio show we've all got to realize how epic this fight is
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:24.840]  and i'm talking to my reporters i'm talking to the crew everybody myself included and realized
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:29.000]  we shouldn't take this for granted we shouldn't imagine that any of us will be here tomorrow
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.560]  that info wars will be here next month info wars has never been bigger never been stronger never
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:39.960]  been more successful but never had more enemies never had more dirty tricks never had more enemies
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:48.840]  coming out of the woodwork like roaches at midnight in an old restaurant because the enemy is
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:56.120]  making their move more door is launching their attack this is just the beginning i told you
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:01.160]  few years ago i said just wait all hell is going to break close civil war staged uprisings messing
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:08.600]  with russia china domestic police state false flag radical jihadi windup toys like alton
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:13.080]  nolan i mean major evidence he was being radicalized probably by criminal elements of the government
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.840]  you can pull up the new york times saying almost every terror plot has been hatched by the government
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:24.120]  and i bet money this guy's a windup toy he just fits the whole mo but the plan got foiled the
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:33.480]  windup toy got killed by somebody or got wounded by somebody uh with a handgun there it is terrorist
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:37.800]  plots hatched by the fbi new york times it goes on to say almost all of them
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:46.760]  they go out and find mentally ill people wind them up turns out a lot of the islamist's
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:50.360]  mosque leaders are allowed to say all the stuff in england and here call for violence they're
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:56.040]  being funded and allowed to radicalize not to even track people back to their home countries
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:00.680]  you know that they're being armed over there but as a destabilization force look the border is wide
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:07.320]  open so i want to be clear this threat is real but it's like dumping a bunch of black widows
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:12.520]  in your neighbor's bed did you order the black widows to be the most venomous spider in north
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:19.480]  america did you order the black widows to bite them no you just put them in the bed so you are
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:27.000]  an accomplice because of the premeditation of it and it just it's par for the course that you
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  don't get promoted in these agencies unless you go out and do these things and then the argument's
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.360]  well it gets us the funding to fight real threats it's a simulant now i don't think it was simulated
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:42.600]  that lays head getting chopped off now again we can't prove that yet but this facebook and him
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:47.000]  operating and everything else and the fact that they could get him to do this in six months i've
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.200]  said this over and over again hypothetically i'll never do it i could go out and find schizophrenic
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:57.320]  or mentally ill or borderline person i just ordered people tell them what they want to hear
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:05.320]  mentally ill you name it and i mean in a matter of days i could have him do whatever i wanted
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:13.960]  and that's what the government does and it's despicable it's truly despicable
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:18.440]  and and see this starts the whole narrative oh my gosh the muslim terrorists are hiding
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:23.480]  everywhere give up all your liberties here is the intro to in about a little nine minute speech
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:28.680]  dr monteef was there to hear me speak a few years ago and stand a cruise to the listeners of ksc
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:37.000]  michaels whirlings fine group of stations he has a few stations there uh and i said hey will you
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.920]  please get up here and speak and he said oh i really don't want to i said please and so he gave a
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:45.000]  short speech he did die again this morning and we're going to be putting a compilation together
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:50.040]  for friday of some of his most important interviews and work and some of our video interviews with him
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:56.840]  we're going to show some of those never before seen uh with dr stan monteef um and some of these
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:00.920]  interviews he's so sick he can barely talk but it's important information that he's putting out there
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:05.640]  really trying to impart people the knowledge but let's go ahead and go to uh some of this
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:16.520]  speech from a few years ago in santa cruise pack in the late 1950s when people demonize you and
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:23.080]  attack you a hundred times more than they attack me because all this stuff's coming true now this guy
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:29.640]  was an icon who stood up against him and he goes four or five hours of radio every day warning
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:36.200]  the planet and so i wanted i don't know if you know him but i i came to hear not just you and not
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:40.680]  just to give the speech but to talk to dr stan monteef so i'm going to spend 15 20 minutes
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:46.840]  just crystallizing the fact that uh he's seen this huge awakening and where society's going
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:54.680]  and for us to count the cost and decide which side of this equation we're on liberty or tyranny
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:04.920]  go ahead sir you got the floor you take it away well i'm not going to take very long because
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.600]  i think that alex really is doing the most amazing job you know i've been at this for 48 years now
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:18.440]  but i've never seen as much enthusiasm as i've seen in the last few years and things are getting
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.360]  worse and worse now don't believe them when they tell you that things are going to get better
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.840]  that the housing market's going to stabilize no it's not the housing market's going to continue
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:32.600]  to fall and more and more people are going to continue losing their homes the jobs are coming
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.960]  back the jobs are not coming back they've been sent overseas and they're going to stay there
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:44.120]  why are they going to stay there because there is a plan now most people really don't know what
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:50.040]  the plan is but it's called globalism it's an organized effort to lower the living status in
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:55.400]  the united states and raise the living standards throughout the world so we can have a one moral
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:03.880]  government a one moral religion and a one moral ruler now if you want to document this it's all
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:10.280]  in something called the earth charter written by uh well steven rockabella the nephew of david
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:16.680]  rockabella by behal gorgotiv and by marie strong and they're in point 10 a of the earth charter
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:23.320]  they say we're going to have equitable distribution of wealth between nations now how do you get
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.960]  equitable distribution of wealth between the united states and china while you lower living
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:33.640]  standards in the united states and you raise living standards in china and in india and all throughout
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:38.520]  the world and this is really what's happening but they cannot tell the american people because
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:44.200]  most of you are so selfish you don't want to give up your home you don't want to give up your pension
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.200]  you don't want to give up your social security and Medicare benefits and all the wonderful
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:52.360]  things that we have in this country but you must understand ladies and gentlemen the america we
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:58.600]  have known has ceased to exist it will never exist again during our lifetime but the one thing we
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:04.360]  can hope is we're going to be able to preserve an element of freedom now how are they sending our
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:11.960]  jobs overseas well it's a process unknown as offshoring manufacturing and what we do is we take
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:19.400]  a manufacturer and we say oh look you're paying 35 corporate income tax in the united states how
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:25.240]  you'd like to not have to pay any taxes at all you move your factory over to china you don't have
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:29.880]  to pay any corporate taxes you can keep those that money invested throughout the world you can
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:34.840]  sell a new manufacturing in all sorts of country how many of you here if you were offered that
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.560]  opportunity to make hundreds of millions of dollars wouldn't take the opportunity and that's
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:44.760]  what our green corporations are doing furthermore they can get abundant labor there's all sorts of
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:49.800]  labor over there cheap labor they don't have to put up with a bureaucracy that harassment they have
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:56.280]  here they do not have to actually pay unemployment insurance workman's compensation insurance
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:03.480]  five of taxes they're actually given loans you can get a loan if you go over there we're doing
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:09.880]  everything we can to encourage our corporations to move overseas and of course the reason they do
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:14.280]  that is because they bring their products back here because we don't have taxes what we need to do
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:19.320]  of course is to protect our economy yes it'd be nice to help the rest of the world but first of
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:26.200]  all we've got to save America and anybody who talks about tariffs now it's called a protectionist oh
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.680]  you're a protectionist why don't you know if we put up tariffs why we would have all sorts of people
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:38.840]  out of work if we put out tariffs we'd have tremendous trade deficits and suddenly we have
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:47.160]  people out of work the real unemployment is not 9.6 percent it's close to 20 percent if you use the
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:52.120]  u6 unemployment figures which are put up at the Bureau of Labor Statistics but never mentioned by
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.880]  the control of media and then you take away the birth death ratio it comes up to over 20 percent
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:03.320]  if you calculate unemployment today as they did during the great depression over 20 percent
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:08.840]  how many times have you heard that from us? Well ladies and gentlemen you have to understand number
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.480]  one the press is controlled in America it's controlled by five or six great corporations
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:19.720]  90 percent of the press is controlled through interlocking directorates and we're talking about
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:27.240]  Time Warner Bertelsman which is a European corporation Viacom which runs CBS Disney which
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:33.160]  runs ABC Fox which runs a Wall Street Journal and Fox News that's Woodward Murdoch and then of
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:39.400]  course the sixth uh is Comcast they just bought a several elect opinion pipe they just bought a NBC
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:47.480]  most people don't understand that literally all of the major news magazines and major newspapers
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:53.560]  and the major networks are intertwined in what I call the brotherhood of darkness intertwining
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:57.560]  in the council on foreign relations the toilet after commission and all these things that Alex
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:03.000]  talks about and he's talked to you many times about but they have an organized program to
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:08.920]  destroy this country now first of all you offshore are manufacturing eight million jobs are gone
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:14.840]  they're not coming back again they're outsourcing our jobs and that means that of course Obama
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:22.280]  recently gave 23 million dollars to a educational facility over in India to teach Indians how to
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:27.320]  speak better English so that they can have our answering jobs over there we can move our answering
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:32.200]  services overseas because they can do our architecture they can do our engineering they
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:38.440]  can read our CT scans and and cat scans and all those sorts of things medical I mean in fact
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:45.080]  there are between 25 and 42 billion jobs they can leave America and be done just as well overseas
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:51.320]  according to Dr. Alan Binder who's a professor of economics at Princeton what they're talking about
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:56.840]  is impoverishing the American people they're encouraging people to come in from other countries
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:03.400]  well trained people with h1b visas who work for much less they're refusing to enforce our immigration
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:08.680]  laws why because they want the illegal immigrants to come in so they will work for less and drive
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:14.200]  down our wages now right now people are turning too badly I mean we've got unemployment insurance
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:20.280]  it's been extended out to two years you get 50% of what you were making before but what happens
[02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:26.680]  when the federal government runs out of money you can't keep borrowing money and eventually what
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:31.160]  happens and of course we're going to see this within about 10 years is that they'll be pointing out
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:38.760]  certainly more for insurance on the national debt and for social security medication and
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.280]  all the money that comes in there won't be anything left over for unemployment insurance
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.920]  it won't be anything left over for the military all of these programs these wonderful programs
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:53.400]  are going to come to an end and that's exactly what they want who are they well with the trilateral
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:58.280]  commission all you need to do is of course you go back and read what Gary Goldwater told us back
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:04.520]  in 1979 his book from the apologies what he said this group is international their goal
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:10.360]  is to take over the financial and commercial interests of the world by first taking over
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:20.200]  the government of the united states what have they done well from 1977 to 2008 every president
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:26.200]  and or vice president of the united states came from the membership rolls of the 87 members of
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.800]  the north american chapter of the trilateral commission do you think that happened by accident
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.560]  six of the eight presidents the world bank who controlled the world finance came from this
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:40.920]  little group eight of the ten world trade representatives who determined our trade
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:46.360]  policies seven of the twelve secretaries of state nine that's the crazy defense they control our
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:53.400]  government and russia bought us never get it yet and shahadity isn't going to tell you and glenn
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:49:09.080]  beg is going to tell you but alex jones well the radio locally here that michael's warning
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.280]  is has the courage to put him on alex is doing a great job he's picking up i'm not going to be
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.280]  around i'm 81 i'm not going to be around any of that much longer but it's great to know that we
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:23.800]  have people who are going to be able to stand up and tell the truth wow and uh there's a little bit
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:28.360]  more of that speech will air on the nightly news or later in the week but what a sweetheart
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:33.720]  and believe me i don't want to be the only host on a big platform telling this stuff it's dangerous
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.520]  and now you do hear glenn beg talk about some of this and others and then that's good
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.960]  i'm not in some competition here i don't territorialize the truth man i i went out of this
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:50.040]  i liken it to like claustrophobia the global is what they're doing the evil the things they're
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:57.880]  doing i personally feel it and i and i want to stop it and so we've lost a real warrior and

[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:28.680]  barry goldwater the trilateralist commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:33.320]  for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control the
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:37.480]  political government of the united states the trilateral commission represents a skillful
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:42.360]  coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary
