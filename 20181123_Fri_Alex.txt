[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:11.000 --> 00:34.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  Then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  They're coming from Mexico.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  You want to drop! You want to drop!
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  I'll win this fight.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  Get off me!
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Get off me!
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  Get off me!
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Who in the president?
[01:06.000 --> 01:26.000]  Muzzle.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  And you would think everybody in the country is like to the bunker.
[01:30.000 --> 01:51.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Monday, November 19, 2018, global transmission.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and you will get next year's news today here.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  As we speak, they're in the control room printing off news articles from a year ago and two months ago and about a week ago.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  Where I said that Facebook's collapse will signal the new digital dark age coming in,
[02:12.000 --> 02:21.000]  where the globalists are going to then terrorize these companies into going under full deep state control and the merger with the chai comps.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  If Trump doesn't get ahead of this curve, we're going to lose it all.
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  I predicted that I would be totally de-platformed as the beta test to make the debate about Alex Jones being taken off and not everyone else.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  Now, they've got top professors, top globalist operatives, all over the news in elite publications like Wired Magazine, Atlantic Monthly,
[02:45.000 --> 02:54.000]  The New York Times today saying the takedown of Jones is only the beginning, we're taking everyone down,
[02:54.000 --> 03:03.000]  and we're taking them down by the time the Democrats take office in the house in two months in January, January 20th.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  And they have got incredible graphics and wired of me being basically grabbed by hand and drug into the darkness.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  Like I'm being thrown in the back of a van, a snatch and grab operation.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  This is real authoritarian behavior.
[03:22.000 --> 03:37.000]  And who wrote it? An authoritarian out of Turkey now working in US so-called academia in that special group countering foreign disinformation and propaganda act.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  So these people are here, they've brought in foreign operatives, they've even hired former Stasi,
[03:44.000 --> 03:56.000]  Google's even moving into the former Stasi headquarters in East Germany, you cannot make this up.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  Unbelievable. You know, I was going to tell them when I mentioned this,
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  they're not showing me being thrown in the back of a van, a snatch and grab to get a scanner darkly to show a clip of that from fiction.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  And I didn't tell them to do it, but great minds think alike, great job of the crew and they're doing that.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  If you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this, you're hearing it, I'll go over all of it today.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  This is the next big move, it's been announced, and we can sit there like idiots and let them do it,
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  or we can call the White House, call Congress, call talk radio, you can make a big noise, we can stop this.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  They want me off the air, they want us curtailed back to nothing, they thought I'd already give up.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Give up, I'm only begun to fight.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  While you're looking at my ship on fire, you might turn around and look at yours, it's going under the water right now.
[04:42.000 --> 04:53.000]  And over the horizon, new fleets are on their way, flying my flag, your flag, the blood red flag of 1776 Worldwide.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Alex Jones, we are the resistance.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[05:03.000 --> 05:10.000]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[05:17.000 --> 05:23.000]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[05:29.000 --> 05:36.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[05:42.000 --> 05:50.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:54.000 --> 06:21.000]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:45.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:45.000 --> 06:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this 7th, 19th day of November, 2018.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, and let me just now tell you what's on the plate,
[07:02.000 --> 07:17.000]  and then beg you to stay tuned and beg you to take notes and beg you to take action, because we have the absolute, total, complete battle plan of the globalist
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  to take down the West, to take down our prosperity, to take our free speech, to take your pension funds, to take control of your life, your children, everything.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  And it's all coming up here today.
[07:30.000 --> 07:43.000]  Now I'm going to air Paul Joseph Watson's blistering report dealing with the race brainwashing of children via YouTube programs put on by the left,
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  but understand this is actually what's shown in the public schools.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  This is the actual training that is going on.
[07:55.000 --> 08:01.000]  He covered some of this Friday, but Paul's done a bigger report on it, Kids Brainwashed to Hate White People.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  It's up on infowars.com, and I suggest everyone get this out to everybody you know.
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  There's another even more devastating report that I mentioned yesterday that I'm going to get to, a 22-page report out of the Daily Mail,
[08:14.000 --> 08:27.000]  where they are taking mentally retarded children in the UK, it's happening here too, and telling them you're transgendered, so they can then basically sterilize them.
[08:27.000 --> 08:38.000]  But let's go to Paul Joseph Watson's report, where they're also teaching these little girls this as well, and just understand this is the most hardcore Marxist brainwashing you can get.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  This is how you create weatherman terrorists. Here it is.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Welcome to Radical Cram School. We're going to learn about Social Justice Revolution.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Hello, my young comrades.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  Just when you thought we'd run out of cancer, along comes a fresh supply. Now to be clear, I'm not being mean to these kids.
[09:02.000 --> 09:11.000]  I feel sorry for them. They're victims of brainwashing. They've obviously been coached on what to say by either their parents, Christina Wong, or both.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  I'm going to show a picture. This is my way of figuring out if you've been tainted by the patriarchy.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  Patriarchy? What? Oh, I knew that.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  Who do you think it is?
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  It's Harvey Weinstein, because inside every white man there's a serial rapist just fighting to get out, right?
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  All these white rape gangs everywhere. It's an epidemic.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  Wait, it gets worse.
[09:33.000 --> 09:44.000]  There's this thing about white people that just makes me feel like they're right there in a pool and I'm walking into the pool and they just give me the desk there and I'm just like...
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  What?
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  There's this thing about white people that just makes me feel like...
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  What kind of parent would teach their child to be afraid of a person based on their skin colour?
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  What kind of person could possibly do such a thing?
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  Yeah, a racist. So in a class for teaching kids that racism is bad, you're actually teaching them to be racist. Genius.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Hello Kitty!
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  What is Hello Kitty? What is she missing?
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  Imagine being such a pathetic f***ing snowflake that you think Hello Kitty not having a mouth is some vast racist sexist conspiracy.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Her mouth? Why doesn't she have a mouth?
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  The people who created her didn't want Asian girls to speak up about who they are.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  Very profound. Very profound.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  Yeah, you obviously just told her to say that.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Very profound.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  The person who designed Hello Kitty is an Asian woman.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  She explained why it was designed without a mouth years ago.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's got nothing to do with silencing Asian women.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  Again, the designer is an Asian woman.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  I mean, Hello Kitty doesn't have feet either.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  Is that a racist throwback to Asian women having bound feet?
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  Or is it just a harmless design feature and you're a hysterical moron?
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  I'm guessing it's the latter.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Very profound.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  What do we know about him?
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  What do we know about him?
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  Orange man bad. Orange man bad. Orange man bad.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  How do we feel about this wall?
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  It is a blocking opportunity for people that don't live in America to come here for a better opportunity.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  And we all came at some point from some other place.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Yeah, so let me teach you something.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  If you don't have any borders and you allow everyone from some other place to come to America,
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  it stops being like America and starts being like some other place,
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  meaning the opportunities afforded to all those who came legally disappear.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  My daddy came here and my mom came here too.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  They came here from where?
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Cambodia.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  Oh, wow.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  What do you think they think that they came from all the way to Cambodia
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  and this is what they get to look at on the TV screen all the time?
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  Right, because I'm sure they prefer to look at something else.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  Oh, I don't know.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  Maybe the 23,000 mass graves containing the bodies of 1.3 million Cambodians
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  who were all slaughtered as a result of a left-wing government genocide.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  Now that I think of it, Kristina and Polpa have similar tastes in headwear.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Oh yeah, and after Cambodia's communist regime got done killing a quarter of its own population,
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  the United States accepted 158,000 Cambodian refugees.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  You know, because it's so racist and all.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  What does gender fluid mean?
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Like you can be any gender.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  You want to be a boy or like you're not just a boy, I'm just a girl.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  Yeah.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Does anybody know anyone who's gender non-binary?
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  Elle?
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  I am gender fluid.
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.000]  You're gender fluid?
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  Yeah.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  That's a wonderful thing.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Yeah, sounds more like child abuse to me.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  I have friends in the pool and I was telling them that I wanted to be a boy or a girl.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  And one of my friends said I can't because I was born as a girl
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  and got made you as a girl.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  What does a six-year-old know about anything
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  yet you're imposing sexuality and your warped ideas about gender on a six-year-old?
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  That's just creepy.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  Stop.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  I have lived in America my whole life.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  Because this is a case of structural racism.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Say it with me.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  Structural racism.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Structural racism.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  So structural it gives non-white people
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  giant public corporate sponsored media platforms
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  who endlessly lecture white people about how evil they are.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  When Downing the Bulley was calling
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Hannah Rochelle Ching-Chong Choo or things like that,
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  has anybody ever had that happen to them?
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Well, like...
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  No, it didn't.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  So that kind of suggests that America is nowhere near as racist
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  as you relentlessly claim it to be.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  White women earn 75% of what white men earn.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  Why do they get to earn more?
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  Because they work longer hours
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  and when that factor is eliminated,
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  the gender wage gap virtually disappears.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  That's what we would have to do to get a full cookie,
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  is form a union.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  No, you just have to work the same hours
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  because in most evil white western countries,
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  gender employment discrimination is illegal.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  So what are the few things that fathers have to think about?
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  Well, frankly, rest.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  Resting, yeah.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  Now, I'm not calling Christina Wong a c***,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  but she did literally dress up as a vagina
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  before proceeding to reel off politically correct statements.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  Always asked what someone's preferred gender pronoun is.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  And called it comedy.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  Yeah, really.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  My Asian vagina does have the power to end racism.
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  I'm gonna have sex with the entire state of Alabama now.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  I don't know if you'd flex, but okay, believe it or not,
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  according to salon.com,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  that video was one of the funniest
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  political comedy moments of 2014.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Yeah, I had funny bowel movements in 2014,
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  but then again,
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  salon's number one political comedy moment of 2014
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  was a stand-up show about white people
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  in the United States becoming a minority
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  because racism is so hilarious.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Here's the point.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  This is just some crappy YouTube web series.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  Ratio, comments, disabled, but wait,
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I thought people being silenced was a bad thing,
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  except when they're trying to criticize you.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  Imagine that.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  So it's just a crappy YouTube web series.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  But schools and colleges across the West
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  are already imposing elements of this on your kids.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  This is what they want.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  Your children brainwashed, indoctrinated,
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and turned into NPCs.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  So, orange man.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Bad.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  Teaching hatred to fight hatred.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  Teaching racism to fight racism.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  There's just like this thing about white people
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  that just makes me feel...
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Using kids as political weapons
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  to amplify racist, regressive lies
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  that foster more division and more bigotry.

[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Hear that?
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,

[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Security is a mindset.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.

[17:55.000 --> 18:01.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  introducing pollen blocks.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  eye comfort, and respiratory functions.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  It's a good thing, and I've had water filtration sponsors
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  since the day I got on air.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  I learned what the best was.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  Maxapure pros their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  that does the most gallons an hour.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  It's amazing.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in,
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  the good minerals.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  that have developed these filters
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  He has a glut of them.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  When it's discounted, it's $200.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's $127.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  He's selling them to us at cost,
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  It's amazing.

[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Hell, I pay the price.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  But why do I always feel like I'm in some twilight zone
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  and I always feel like I'm in some twilight zone
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  and I always feel like I'm in some twilight zone
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  and I always feel like I'm in some twilight zone
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  It is November 19, 2018 on this Monday.
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  Global broadcast as we head into National Turkey Day.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  Thanksgiving.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  Celebrating the original successful mission
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  to begin the development of this continent.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  My are illustrious ancestors.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Let's do this in this segment
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  because when I'm about to cover something so momentous
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  I have trouble getting into it
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  because I want to be calm about it
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  but I also want to cover all the facets.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  The much easier if I just told the audience
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  what's happening and what I believe is going to happen next.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  And a lot of folks do pay attention
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  because they know that I know
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  what I'm talking about on most issues.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Establishment certainly paying attention
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  and that's why they don't want me to be able to reach new people.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  That's where you come in carrying the football down the field
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  by word of mouth.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  When you take action, you're unstoppable.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  When you don't, we're done.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  I was told covering Bilderberg in 2006
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  that the whole meeting was basically about
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  large portions of it was about social media
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  being the future of things.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  And then the next year we covered it in Istanbul
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  and Zuckerberg was there.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  We had a reporter there.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Jim Tucker, rest in peace.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  And so I heard a lot of this then
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  and Tucker's asked me on the phone,
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  when he gets back from Turkey,
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  he goes, what do you know about the internet?
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  They got this young whippersnapper.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  They think this thing will spy on everybody
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  so they'll be able to control all the elections
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  with this thing.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  And that's what I got from the sources in there.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  Only got with more of a gravelly voice than me.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  It was old Jim smoking those filterless pulp malls.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  That's Bilderberg a few years later.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  And they have your radio listeners.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  They're putting images up on TV to the TV viewers.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  And now in hindsight, and now from what we know,
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  and now it's Deepa Chenick said a year ago
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  and two months ago here on air and what we've broken down,
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  we know what's going to happen to Facebook
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  and we know what that's going to trigger.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  Now, obviously, if people would have listened to us
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  a couple of years ago,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  you'd have made a lot of money in the stock market knowing this.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  But people always remember that we were right later
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  because we actually go crawl around the ground
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  and sneak into buildings and get thrown off and get arrested
[23:13.000 --> 23:21.000]  and Jim Tucker's been shot at.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  So the system is doing everything it can
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  to keep you from getting this information
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  because the average political talk is nothing but a distraction.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  It's nothing but a diversion from the real things going on in the world.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  People will look at Jim Acosta clearly pushing the woman's arm down,
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  jerking the mic back from her.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  And he says, I didn't touch her.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  It's meant to just create a debate about did he touch her or not.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  And while we're debating whether he touched her or not,
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  and I can't help it because I'm in the middle of it.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  They're claiming we're lying.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  They give us offers we can't refuse.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  When they make it about us almost all the time,
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  we've got to respond or people will believe we actually lied.
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  So while we're delayed fighting with the disinfo,
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  the road box they throw out there,
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  the whole future is being stolen from us.
[24:14.000 --> 24:22.000]  So it's very frustrating to know what's going to happen.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  Don't know exactly when or exactly how,
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  but we know in the main what's going down, real accurate.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  And the globalists hear this and they say,
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  you've got to get that off the air.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  You've got to shut that down, whatever you do, or we're screwed.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  Everybody ought to go, oh, if this is what they want shut down so bad,
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  maybe something's getting said here that's important.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I know most of you understand that, but folks,
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  this isn't a thing now of were we right about Facebook.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  And a lot of people say, good, I hope Facebook goes belly up.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  I hope that's one-dimensional thinking.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  Yes, I told you when they were first setting up Facebook,
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  it was going to be a pump and dump.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  And we were sure of it then like eight years ago
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  when Zuckerberg went again over in German.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  So we've been laying it all out for you here.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  But out of the collapse of Facebook and the reorganization of it
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  is going to come the new rules of the Internet
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  and a global social score and draconian censorship
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  and the web will now be a surveillance grid
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  commanded by the new officer class, professors and corporate operatives
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  who will oversee armies of bots, armies of censors
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  to shut down all thought they don't agree with.
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.000]  There's a Chinese gentleman running in New York
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  for national office presidency.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  He's already getting all this big hype,
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  but he's just there to put these issues in.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  And he wants us to adopt the Chinese communist social score.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  Oh, but you'll be paid $1,000 a month to do it, universal income,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  which then is meant to control your whole life.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  It's called slavery.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  We surveil everything you do and you get $1,000, you young idiots.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  And they're just here pitching it to all the young millennials
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  that want something free.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  That's what Andrew Yang.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  So it's here.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  This is the invasion.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  This is the takeover.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  And Trump can win on jobs and he can win on the economy
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  and he can do so many things.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  He can defend the border.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  But if he doesn't stop the digital invasion
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  and the digital user patient and the takeover of the Internet,
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  we'll lose everything.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Because the Internet is the industry.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  It is the communications.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  It is the jobs.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  It is the whole system.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  And there are sickening articles in the New York Times
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  and Wired Magazine and others today salivating
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  over how they're going to shut everybody's communications down
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  and how they're going to shut nationalists and Christians
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  and conservatives banking down when they're done.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  They're coming for you.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  And there's no amount of submission that'll get you out of it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  We're going to have to fight our way out of this one, folks.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  So get ready.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now we come back.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  I'm going to get into the nuts and bolts of this.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  Then we've got incredible SJW footage.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  We're going to premiere here of our crew down at the border
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  showing the caravan invasion that they said didn't exist.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  And the local Antifa shows up.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  So we're going to show you this bleeped video,
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  but it is unbelievable.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  No one's seen it yet.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  Meanwhile, Mexicans agree with Trump
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  call migrant caravan an invasion.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  The mayor in Tijuana says there are a bunch of criminals.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  They're waving foreign flags.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  They're burning American flags and Trump's like,
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  they want to get in and they're burning flags.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  And now the Mexicans are marching against the Honduras
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  because they know an invasion when they see one.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  They've got their heads screwed on straighter
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  than the average dumbass American, which is a real shame.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  So good for the Mexicans.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  It's all coming up.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  Now, and it's on infowars.com.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  The article Mexicans agree with Trump call migrant caravan an invasion.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  Get this out there.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  I was at a barbershop this morning.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  I got to South Austin, kind of a blue collar.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Barbershop, most of folks work there.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Hispanics get great haircut to really nice people.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  And they don't really know who I am,
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  but they're bringing up to me about, yeah,
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  the Mexicans want them out and they're burning American flags
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  and why are we letting people in and they're criminals?
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  And those Mexicans, by the way,
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  a lot of them are like 60-year-old guys.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  They were not virtue signaling at me.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  They had a Mexican background.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  So that's what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  All right, we come back.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  You want to know how Facebook's going to collapse
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  and how it's all going to play out?
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  I'm going to tell you.
[28:53.000 --> 29:21.000]  We're going to hear the future when we come back.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  What if there was a social media network
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  only for the conservatives?
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  What if there was a social media network
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  not only for the conservative right general public,
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  And what if the social media network
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  was the only free speech network in existence?
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  There is. It's rightsocial.net.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Rightsocial.net.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  Rightsocial.net, where you have the right
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  to freely speak your mind.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  Rightsocial.net.
[29:56.000 --> 29:58.000]  The right place to be.
[29:58.000 --> 30:00.000]  Please, whatever you do realize,
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  They say affiliated with InfoWars.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  They even know we had like InfoWars stores
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  that just showed our products.
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  But they just banned them all yesterday
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  in punishment that I be in a Trump rally
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Your excitement about America,
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  this broadcast is what brought the country
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  and the world back from the brink.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  But the globalists now want to target
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  where the resistance came from
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  so that we're not pesky in the future.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  I want to keep going.
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  I want to make them do the ultimate,
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  not just destroy us financially.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  I want to push all the way.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  I've committed to do that.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  I've prayed for that.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  But you've got a back-ish and I promise you this.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  I'll give you my commitment
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  if you ever waver at the spiritual level.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  I physically will.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  at infowarsstore.com
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  to give you my absolute total commitment.
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  It's really hard to have the energy
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  or to go for a run or go to the park
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  Believe me, I know.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  I spend hours in front of a screen
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  and then hours in front of bright lights
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  every day.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  I still have that energy.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  There's no way I could have the energy
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  at the end of a long day to fight back
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  against the chemicals and the food and water
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  to still have the stamina
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  and endurance, energy and drive
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  to get to the gym, get to the park
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  and get exercise that you need
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  for your health.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  So go to infowarsstore.com
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  This is actually our last run
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  of Supermail Vitality.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  So I want you to experience
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  Supermail Vitality
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  from infowarsstore.com
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  Living in Volcano
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  may sound more dramatic
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  than it really is.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  The real drama can be found here
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  in Leilani Estates.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  and we need to be concerned about ash
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  and acid rain.
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  Ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  And acid rain
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  To find out,
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  we employed a series of tests
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  for heavy metals, alkalinity
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  and pH.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Next, we tested the water
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  And not only were the heavy metal levels
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  within safe measure,
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  we also restored the optimal levels.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  As it turns out,
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  the filter on the Alexa Pure
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  raises the pH of the water.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  and acid rain can contaminate
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  a rainwater supply.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  But more importantly,
[32:56.000 --> 33:11.000]  it can purify it.
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.000 --> 33:30.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  Well, Super Brain
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  and Super Model
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Savannah Hernandez was out there
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  with our intrepid camera man,
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  Brub.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  And I told him, I said, take the Action 7
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  mic flag.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  Don't go to the border
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  with an Impole Wars flag.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  But they're tough. They did it in subordination.
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  We'll probably get a bonus for it.
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  But they're tough. They did it in subordination.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Seriously.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  And we're going to play this coming up next
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  segment because it dovetails with the Mexicans
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  over the side of the border
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  and their mayors saying, we've never seen such criminals.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  And that's what other Mexican towns said
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  when these people are coming through
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  by the tens of thousands,
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  robbing, stealing, raping, smuggling kids.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  It's insane.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  The Mexicans are saying, get the hell out of here.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  This is out of control.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  Here's a little snippet of what's coming up with Savannah.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  Those guys are saying,
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  did you think I had anything to do with you?
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Dude, we just cut off black guy over here,
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  come over and tell us he's hunting people
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  and give us a Nazi salute.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  You think color matters?
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  You think your people are fucking tell us?
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  Check it out.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  I'm standing here and I am trying to show everyone
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  what's going on out here.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  You know what? This isn't a fucking great interview.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  And I have a bunch of fucking members
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  that are all the same.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  You're a part of a racist organization.
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.880]  sort of surreal Nazi, you're the one spewing race. Why do you have to look like a meth
[34:54.880 --> 35:01.280]  head to be an Antifa? So we're going to be getting this exchange coming up and then tying
[35:01.280 --> 35:05.000]  it in with all the amazing footage that they got, but also local news of what Mexico is
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.760]  actually saying about tens of thousands of people, 80 plus percent military age men engaging
[35:11.760 --> 35:20.320]  in all sorts of crime, attacking police, killing people, you name it. It's simply crazy. All
[35:20.320 --> 35:29.800]  right, let's stop right there. And I always have this quandary. Should I just get into
[35:29.800 --> 35:36.120]  all the proof or should I just get directly to what's about to happen? Or should I point
[35:36.120 --> 35:48.400]  out that we told you this was coming? Because this is bigger than Facebook, it's bigger
[35:48.400 --> 35:55.000]  than the economy. This is the next domino to fall to get our free speech. And you just
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.520]  saw how they were able to steal many of the elections because they totally shut down all
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.280]  their opposition, which became an in kind donation to the Democrats by big tech. And
[36:04.280 --> 36:09.800]  you saw how that's now emboldened the Democrats to call for even more censorship. We're going
[36:09.800 --> 36:16.160]  to get to that. But how is Facebook going to go down? Why would the establishment do
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.720]  this to Facebook? Why were we able to predict the pump and dump you're about to see a long
[36:21.720 --> 36:27.240]  time ago? Because we watched the globalist. We studied them. We also talked to insiders
[36:27.240 --> 36:32.600]  like Dr. Steve Pachennick, former head of psychological warfare operations for a three-letter
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.000]  word agency. He doesn't like it when I say the name of the agency, even though it's in
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.840]  history books, which agency he's worked for. He'll be joining us to get into this as well.
[36:40.840 --> 36:45.000]  One of the founders of Delta Force, and let's just say he knows where a lot of the bodies
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.920]  are buried. So that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour. We'll continue with this
[36:49.920 --> 37:00.920]  discussion. So we're going to plunge into this here in just a moment. And then at the
[37:00.920 --> 37:10.400]  start of the next hour, I'm going to specifically get into how the new censorship will be implemented
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.040]  and the phases it's going to be rolled out in until everyone realizes it wasn't just
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.960]  censorship of conservatives. It's a total social score of everything you're doing being
[37:19.960 --> 37:28.280]  surveilled in live time to then literally oppress and control everyone. No amount of
[37:28.280 --> 37:34.720]  submission is going to be enough because this is a post-industrial economy killing form
[37:34.720 --> 37:41.840]  of siege or a post-industrial world, technotronic, technocracy era. So how do I know exactly
[37:41.840 --> 37:47.400]  where we're going? Because the destination's been announced by the globalist. Now they
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.840]  can drive the train faster or slower, maybe make a few more stops or a few less stops,
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.320]  but we know where this train track grows. This is not like a highway with a car where
[37:56.320 --> 38:06.680]  you go wherever you want. This is the driver takes you where he was told to take you. So
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.320]  again, I suggest everyone pay particular attention. We'll go to that information here in just
[38:11.320 --> 38:21.320]  a moment. I was about to do a plug this weekend for the Black Friday specials that run all
[38:21.320 --> 38:26.880]  week, and I just come up with a specials. Not really even a formula to it. I just make
[38:26.880 --> 38:30.760]  sure they're massive in the belief that if we have the best prices out there, people
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.320]  will buy more and that that'll equal out. It's certainly been the case so far. But
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.200]  I was doing an ad about how Black Friday usually isn't the best time to buy products
[38:40.200 --> 38:44.200]  that stores raise their retail than lower on the day before and or they have a really
[38:44.200 --> 38:48.560]  sought after item in a limited amount. When you get there, it's not really there, but
[38:48.560 --> 38:51.960]  you go ahead and impulse buy things that say they're a sale, but they're not really as
[38:51.960 --> 38:55.880]  big a sale as they say. Plus there's the big crowds and all the rest of it. And I was saying,
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.400]  so this isn't our best sale of the year, but it's one of our biggest. And the best time
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.200]  of the year is generally right after Christmas. When anything inventory we have left, we need
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.480]  to sell so we don't have to pay income tax on which is basically inventory tax. And in
[39:10.480 --> 39:13.880]  Texas, they say we don't have an income tax. If you got a company, they do. It's called
[39:13.880 --> 39:19.120]  a franchise tax. And I got to pay on every desk, every light bulb, everything in here.
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.160]  I got a few percentage points on and over the years it's growing. That's how they did
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.200]  it. So Texas is lower than some states, but it ain't as good as they tell you. But I'm
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.720]  digressing. Excuse me. I'm sorry. So I'm sitting there reading the specials. I came up with
[39:31.720 --> 39:36.960]  a few days before while I'm cutting the live ad and by ad, I mean, I cut a lot of these
[39:36.960 --> 39:41.320]  ads like it's live. There's not a lot of editing. Maybe we put a few articles over it, but it's
[39:41.320 --> 39:44.440]  usually I just, if it's two minute ad, one minute ad, four minute ad, I just have a clock
[39:44.440 --> 39:50.600]  and I talk for four minutes and halfway through, I go, wait a minute, this is the best sale
[39:50.600 --> 39:53.480]  we've ever offered. You're like, well, wait a minute, the one you had a few weeks ago
[39:53.480 --> 39:56.360]  was the best ever. Yeah, because they're trying to take our credit card processing away and
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.840]  shut us down. So I want to sell everything we've got in the warehouse, including stuff
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.320]  that I had for us to go into February, but probably be a situation here where we don't
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.680]  even have any products really for a few months at the new year, but that's better than them
[40:11.680 --> 40:17.200]  taking our credit card processing and things like that. Well, I follow lawsuits and stuff
[40:17.200 --> 40:20.880]  and for a few months, can't sell anything. It's better to have those nuts for winter
[40:20.880 --> 40:24.400]  bill to fund the operations. That's why you are getting the best sales we've ever had
[40:24.400 --> 40:29.440]  because if the army's coming over the hill to destroy it and you got to shop, you might
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.640]  as well, a dry good place, you know, back in the whole West, might as well sub everything
[40:32.640 --> 40:36.360]  you got for the union army slams in and burns your ass to the ground. Then they're just
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.200]  getting a building, not your goods. Now, we don't think that's going to happen. We think
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.280]  we're going to beat all this, but we're not, we're not going to just sit here on our thumbs,
[40:44.280 --> 40:51.200]  as they say. So this is with the double Patriot points, the biggest sale we've ever had because
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.040]  it's the sale we had earlier. Everything must go Christmas, Black Friday, Rollin one
[40:56.040 --> 41:02.120]  plus it's double Patriot points. So instead of 5%, you get 10% on your next purchase.
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.360]  So it's literally money in the bank. So instead of 5%, it's 10%. You had all these specials
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.080]  in like sign up for auto shipping additional 10%. A bunch of these are big loss leaders.
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.600]  So this is everything must go biggest sale ever. It's not a secret. They're trying to
[41:18.600 --> 41:21.680]  shut us down and I'm not believing they are going to be able to shut us down, but they're
[41:21.680 --> 41:25.120]  all over the news today licking their lips saying, here's how we're going to do it. And
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.960]  after we get his ass, everybody else, wait till I cover this stuff. They have images
[41:28.960 --> 41:35.000]  of me being choked and pulled into darkness and killed by horrible evil Turkish writers
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.760]  that come from a dictator ship where they do that to you if you are a political dissident.
[41:40.760 --> 41:46.000]  I mean, they are important people folks that are very wicked. There are a lot of good Turkish
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.800]  people I know as well who fled the evil. A lot of Armenians can tell you about, you
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.120]  know, they've been enslaving and taking people down and silencing them since the Muslims
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.640]  took over Turkey when it was the Byzantine Empire. Yeah, zoom out of that for folks and
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.360]  show them our magazine and the Turkish writer doing all this for TV viewers. You can just
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.120]  show it full screen if you'd like. There it is. He who must not be named, what Alex Jones
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.320]  and Voldemort have in common and then they image themselves as a big dark blackness sucking
[42:17.320 --> 42:23.880]  me in to a snatching grab. I think that's Voldemort. So that's coming up. So we have
[42:23.880 --> 42:29.160]  50% off store wide, up to 50% off the high quality storeable food. That's unbelievable.
[42:29.160 --> 42:34.520]  Alexa pure water filtration system at 127, 49% off because that's an overstock issue
[42:34.520 --> 42:38.800]  with them. We've never gone that low. It's the very best system. Alexa pure breeze 40%
[42:38.800 --> 42:46.360]  off the air purification and a bunch of other huge specials up to 75% off store wide. Everything
[42:46.360 --> 42:52.440]  must go fund our spacecraft engines for the next jump. We've already launched the new
[42:52.440 --> 42:58.520]  1776 revolution. When come back, I'll tell you the next level. The globalists know that
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.720]  if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens fluoride
[43:02.720 --> 43:09.040]  chlorine bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.320]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.840]  gone through two permutations. First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.920]  to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[43:22.920 --> 43:28.440]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.360]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.080]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed
[43:38.080 --> 43:43.040]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[43:43.040 --> 43:50.400]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:50.400 --> 43:55.240]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available
[43:55.240 --> 43:57.320]  at m4slife.com.

[44:57.920 --> 45:04.040]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air. Obviously
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.080]  water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing and I've had water filtration
[45:07.080 --> 45:11.920]  sponsors since the day I got on air and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration.
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.560]  I learned what the best was. Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.400]  steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing. It's got all the bad stuff,
[45:20.400 --> 45:24.440]  leaves the good stuff in the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my page
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.760]  supplied that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year. He
[45:28.760 --> 45:34.920]  has a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted
[45:34.920 --> 45:42.280]  it's usually $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us at cost and we're making $27 bucks
[45:42.280 --> 45:46.720]  on them. So they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the
[45:46.720 --> 45:53.720]  gift of health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure Pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or

[47:01.240 --> 47:19.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.520 --> 47:32.720]  I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[47:32.720 --> 47:47.720]  From the front lines of the Information War is Alex Jones.
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.040]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us on this live November
[47:51.040 --> 48:00.560]  19, 2018 global transmission. Okay, now remember, liberty and freedom is not a spectator sport,
[48:00.560 --> 48:03.120]  and that's why they hate this show and why they hate this audience because you are the
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.040]  Info War. I'm not telling you something you're not already doing. Great job. Let's keep doing
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.040]  it. Let's absolutely go into the thick of battle every time we're going to win this
[48:12.040 --> 48:17.200]  thing. We're promoting freedom. The globalist promoting authoritarianism, poverty, lies,
[48:17.200 --> 48:22.560]  and so on. Big corporations have set up the internet that DARPA designed to control and
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.320]  track and consolidate power and shut down their competition. They're going into that
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.480]  phase faster than they were planning because the internet has been taken away from them
[48:31.480 --> 48:39.640]  and is being used by human intelligence to go out and actually educate and inform others.
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.360]  And so, nationalists and populists are being elected everywhere. And so, when you read these
[48:44.360 --> 48:49.840]  different CIA funded professors that are in the news from the leftist stay-behind network
[48:49.840 --> 48:53.960]  just like they left the Justice Department, they left the CIA and funded the John Warner
[48:53.960 --> 49:00.000]  Defense Authorization Act 2017 that Obama signed before he left office in December 2016,
[49:00.000 --> 49:08.400]  it says, we have a global crisis of nationalists. We're going to fix our global order. Google
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.000]  gave speeches that was sent out in the internal Google video that got released a few months
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.080]  ago, two years ago, saying, oh my God, we're going to start censoring to stop the conservatives.
[49:17.080 --> 49:22.160]  They were already doing it, but they said, we've got to do it completely. Now, in the
[49:22.160 --> 49:29.160]  midst of all this, I had been told that Facebook set up whatever it was 14 years ago or whatever
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.720]  and then promoted to the top of the food chain in the last eight, nine years, was meeting
[49:33.720 --> 49:36.960]  with Bilderberg, meeting with top globalists. And we later confirmed Zuckerberg had been
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.520]  going to these meetings right out of Harvard. He wasn't on the list. He was an unannounced
[49:41.520 --> 49:48.880]  guest at a few of the earlier ones, but by about 10 years ago, he was at the front of
[49:48.880 --> 49:56.160]  Bilderberg. Then they went public. Hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars came in.
[49:56.160 --> 50:00.040]  The top people at Facebook now for about three years have been quietly taking their money
[50:00.040 --> 50:05.920]  out. That's the pump. Now here comes the dump. And so we said, they don't just have people
[50:05.920 --> 50:09.320]  in there because they've set up a social system to track people. They're going to want this
[50:09.320 --> 50:14.280]  for social control. They're going to want this for political control. They're going
[50:14.280 --> 50:18.960]  to want this to track and trace everything you're doing for behavioral modification.
[50:18.960 --> 50:23.760]  That's what we'd heard from sources over 10 years ago that were inside the meetings.
[50:23.760 --> 50:30.520]  Then six years ago, we get documents that Google is helping China design a social credit
[50:30.520 --> 50:35.840]  score that will track everything you do in real time. Info words is first to publish
[50:35.840 --> 50:45.040]  as usual outside of academic circles. That pisses him off. Now you see, oh, the guy from
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.320]  China who loves Communist China, he says, we need a social score like China and he's running
[50:49.320 --> 50:52.880]  for president. And oh, the New York Times, Washington Post, oh, Zuckerberg's going to
[50:52.880 --> 50:57.960]  have a social score in face scanning, even, you know, park your car. And see, we're not
[50:57.960 --> 51:01.120]  a good globalist. Your face scan turns off and you can't park your car. You can't get
[51:01.120 --> 51:05.320]  on a bus. You can't get on a plane. And China is already doing it. This year, 11 million
[51:05.320 --> 51:12.280]  flights for people canceled because they got lower than their social score. So this is
[51:12.280 --> 51:21.720]  the most naked out of control authoritarianism the galaxy's ever seen. I use that term because
[51:21.720 --> 51:31.200]  lawyers and like contracts for rights, they will say in all known universes and this galaxy.
[51:31.200 --> 51:37.480]  So imagine, and then it's a pump and dump, meaning they pump it up, they get all the
[51:37.480 --> 51:41.240]  schmucks in it, they quietly take their money out of the Ponzi scheme, and then they decide
[51:41.240 --> 51:45.480]  when to implode it, but you don't stop there. You then say it happened because they helped
[51:45.480 --> 51:49.960]  Trump win when that was like not even 1% of what went on with people paying Facebook for
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.640]  analytics. Trump just publicly scraped names of conservatives to contact them. Facebook
[51:54.640 --> 51:59.600]  in live time and it's in the WikiLeaks said the Democrats own us. He told Merkel, you
[51:59.600 --> 52:06.280]  own us, whatever you want, they give them everything. But see, they let the EU come
[52:06.280 --> 52:11.240]  in and start regulating Facebook and Twitter and Google by Trump and the Republic is not
[52:11.240 --> 52:15.600]  regulating for two years and saying no regulation. It's allowed the EU because our government
[52:15.600 --> 52:23.000]  hasn't protected our companies to come in and take over regulation by fiat. And Trump
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.400]  gets that now, but we got to get moving. And so then when they implode Facebook saying,
[52:31.400 --> 52:35.240]  oh, it spies on people, it won't be for all the real reasons. And out of that will come
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.000]  these new laws and regulations that the Democrats have written up and the EU have written up
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.040]  and the China have written up that will allow the internet globally under EU, Chinese and
[52:44.040 --> 52:51.280]  US rules to merge under a new censored controlled system. And this is all been announced now.
[52:51.280 --> 52:57.160]  We first saw it coming. We first knew about it. We first went into bars and local hotels
[52:57.160 --> 53:03.960]  and said, after work hours were over, we go there at midnight, buy people drinks and say,
[53:03.960 --> 53:08.000]  hey, so you work over there at that hotel. It's going to be closed next week we hear.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.520]  You got to have advanced teams go to these things. And they'd say, oh, we already told
[53:11.520 --> 53:15.760]  us we can't talk to you. I'd say, here's my number. When you see how evil they are
[53:15.760 --> 53:20.040]  and how you can't look them in the eyes, when you hear all the evil things they say, I want
[53:20.040 --> 53:24.960]  you to get stuff out of the trash can. I want you to bring it to me. We've got flows, your
[53:24.960 --> 53:28.920]  car is following us and chasing us and you know, Tucker and Istanbul and you know, guys
[53:28.920 --> 53:32.120]  on walkie talkies, I mean, and ducking in and out of things trying to get documents
[53:32.120 --> 53:38.040]  and they tell you, go here to get it. And I mean, this is this really goes on. And
[53:38.040 --> 53:41.280]  then you find out they're going to have a social score system and control everything
[53:41.280 --> 53:45.040]  and track everything you do. And if you don't comply, they'll not even allow you to operate
[53:45.040 --> 53:49.560]  in society. And I'm like, this is Mark of the beach. So I'm on the air. And I put the film
[53:49.560 --> 53:53.520]  out 11 years ago in game where I say they're gonna have a casual society Mark of the beach
[53:53.520 --> 53:58.040]  where everything you do is track live time on the internet with a score you have. This
[53:58.040 --> 54:04.660]  is in the film. A score you have that they can then stop you from having a job or getting
[54:04.660 --> 54:09.640]  on an airplane or buying food if you're not a good globalist. That's in the three hour
[54:09.640 --> 54:17.640]  film because it's from the builder group. Now it's all over the news. It's here. Take
[54:17.640 --> 54:23.680]  microchips microchip your kids blah, blah, blah. And they now have a huge article written
[54:23.680 --> 54:30.600]  by an authoritarian from Turkey where they put people in dungeons saying Alex Jones should
[54:30.600 --> 54:35.480]  not even be allowed to be on the air period. He lies and says vaccines can hurt you. The
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.400]  Dan insert says that and they lie to you and don't tell you. And they list all these things
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.520]  I've supposedly done. They either lie about what I say or they twist it. But the point
[54:45.520 --> 54:51.160]  is it has me being grabbed by a black hand and drug into darkness. And again, they've
[54:51.160 --> 55:01.120]  got an authoritarian from Turkey who specializes in annihilating free speech. Zaynep tufekchi.
[55:01.120 --> 55:07.480]  And what's the message? And they say we're taking control of the internet. We're going
[55:07.480 --> 55:13.920]  to censor everybody for everyone's good. And Alex Jones is the devil. But they're the devil
[55:13.920 --> 55:17.000]  coming in the dark to grab you and pull you into the dark and saying you don't have speech
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.160]  and then lying about you. But see, they get to be ruling class now. They've been prepared
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.000]  and trained at the universities. They're really intelligence operatives of the of the deep
[55:26.000 --> 55:37.200]  state to come in and take control of civilization. They're going to come in and they're going
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.880]  to run your life. They're going to dominate you that they are rightful rulers of you.
[55:42.880 --> 55:46.360]  And they will control your speech. There it is ex Stasi agent hired to censor xenophobic
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.560]  Facebook post. That was four years ago. Now, last week, Google is looking at moving into
[55:51.560 --> 55:57.040]  the former Stasi headquarters in East Berlin. You cannot make this up. So here's the big
[55:57.040 --> 56:05.440]  news. They're going to take Facebook in to be the new MySpace. It's going to go way down.
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.520]  Then it's going to go back up some and then it's going to go down again. Within two years,
[56:09.520 --> 56:17.040]  it will be a dead stock at their current rate that there'll be some more hills and valleys.
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.000]  But out of this, they'll terrorize everyone else, all the other tech companies, everyone
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.400]  else that you better get in line or this will happen to you. But not because they were spying
[56:29.400 --> 56:32.520]  only because they were designed to be a pump and dump. This will be the cover of someone
[56:32.520 --> 56:38.080]  being punished for spying while Apple and Google and Twitter spy and whoever they want. So
[56:38.080 --> 56:46.360]  it's a big spectacle. And it's designed to be a huge distraction from everyone of what's
[56:46.360 --> 56:51.880]  really going on. Let's look at it. Infowars was right. Facebook using ChaiCom social score
[56:51.880 --> 56:59.480]  for users. August 21st. Doc and cam shot, please. Intelligence Insider, Google, Facebook
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.720]  and Twitter are about to collapse and are desperately seeking Chinese help. September
[57:03.720 --> 57:09.720]  Dr. Steve Pachennick's coming on later. World exclusive Facebook to completely collapse
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.680]  in preplanned operation to in free speech as we know it. Insiders told Alex Jones over
[57:13.680 --> 57:17.960]  a year ago that the globals are going to use Facebook as a sacrificial lamb to terrorize
[57:17.960 --> 57:22.120]  other tech companies into adopting total censorship. And now we've got Senator Warner and all
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.080]  of them calling for it and doing it. Oh, survival of our democracy depends on banning sites
[57:27.080 --> 57:34.880]  like info wars. Dem senator says, isn't that sweet? Oh my gosh, isn't it just cute? It's
[57:34.880 --> 57:41.160]  all coming up. And now Facebook is posting its longest losing streak ever as they prepare

[59:51.320 --> 01:00:02.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:14.240]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.320]  Jones. Okay, I just spent much of the last hour getting
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.440]  into the establishment, getting ready to take down Facebook. It'll take about two years,
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.280]  but it'll be gone. And they might decide to change course and resurrect it, but they generally
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.640]  don't do things like that. We have Dr. Steve Pachett joining us that predicted
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.720]  a lot of this on air at the bottom of the hour. And again, a lot of folks will say,
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.760]  good, I hope Facebook goes away. They're corrupt and bad. It's not about that. It's about a
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.560]  pump and dump on investors, the big boys getting their money out years ago. And it's about
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:56.600]  using the spectacle of its ongoing collapse to sell new forms of censorship and to muddy
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.240]  the waters and act like Facebook's being punished for surveilling people by focusing in on things
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.720]  that weren't even illegal to cover up all the real crimes that Facebook and others have
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:14.240]  been engaged in and to create fear in the other tech giants that they could be regulated
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:23.120]  because there's fear in the tech giants that they could be taken over by government, but
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.880]  government has acted so pliant and pliable with it that now big tech's gotten big breaches
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:36.440]  and thinks that it actually runs. Thanks. So you've got corporate powers vying with
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:43.440]  each other. You've got the Chai comms, the EU, Russia, the United States and the globalist
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.760]  hate anybody who has allegiance to their country, allegiance to free market, allegiance to anything
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.360]  decent. We've got top dem senator, the one that's been running the censorship in the
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.320]  Senate who demanded I be taken off the Internet four months ago and you saw the effect one
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:06.040]  month after he gave the order because he represents the globalist, Mark Warner. Google must do
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:14.280]  more to censor YouTube and other dem senators are saying the same thing. So they're making
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.440]  their move because the establishment's decided that an open and somewhat free Internet will
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.920]  destroy them. And so we have to know what's next and get Trump and the Congress to take
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.400]  action because the Republicans are, hey, you're free market companies. We're going to leave
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.320]  you alone. But the Democrats are working through the EU and the Chai comms to put regulations
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.920]  from overseas on these companies. And so you're allowing them by not coming into the vacuum,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.440]  Mr. President, to take control. And they're also fearful that ignorance by the Republican
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.600]  leadership, how the Internet works, may allow them to get regulations through regardless.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:04.680]  So the Republican establishment are extremely stupid. Trump's not. And I sat there in a
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.000]  committee hearing headed up with Warner a few months ago and I watched the only Senator
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.360]  Cotton bring up the Chai comms and the spy chips and all of our electronics and how this
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.080]  is so dangerous and how they Google won't even work with the Pentagon on things now,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:25.760]  but it'll work with China on AI. Yeah, the globalist are anti America. Google's move
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:34.880]  there. Apple's move there. Turns out as big tech makes bigger profits, they cut the pay
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.600]  to their own employees. They don't pay taxes. They're the most ruthless, evil, godless people.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:47.320]  They own the worst factories. These tech companies are run by demons, but because they dress
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.840]  like hippies. And you know, Jack Dorsey has a little nose ring, a little booger collector.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.840]  I'm not saying you're bad. If you like nose rings, it's just like, Oh, I'm an average
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:05.920]  guy. I have a nose ring. Look, I have tattoos. It's like that deal where billionaires will
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:11.920]  drive some old Ford Taurus, even while they jump on some $7 million, you know, jet copter
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.000]  that flies into the airport where they get in their $100 million jet. It's all just virtue
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:25.040]  signaling crap. These people are ruthless authoritarians. Absolutely enjoy making you
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.200]  poor. Want to suppress you want to take away your liberties and freedoms and then give
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.280]  you race based identities. While they say they're fighting racism, 180 degrees different
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:44.320]  from Martin Luther King. Yeah, China's been executing more gays, but Tim Cook, it's okay
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.520]  because Tim Cook's gay. Look, if you support China, the slave factories and killing gays,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.640]  as long as you're gay, it's cool. I mean, everybody knows some gay people are mean to
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:59.440]  other gay people. Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.200]  to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts. They say affiliated with info wars. Yes,
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.920]  some of them are like little side accounts. They know we had like info or store that just
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.440]  showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.640]  in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. You're excitement about
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.880]  America. You're excited about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.880]  back from the break. But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.680]  so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.520]  going. I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially. I want to
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.560]  push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.360]  going to happen. But you've got a back ish and I promise you this, I will never falter.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.280]  I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will, but I give you my commitment.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:06:16.280]  If you financially support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:36.680]  So in case you didn't hear, I'm sure you did. It's the top story on drugreport.com for three
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.960]  straight quarters. Facebook's been going straight down and a lot of people say it's
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:48.680]  not really profitable. It's a giant pump and dump. And there's a big fight taking place
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:53.440]  over who's going to control Facebook. Well, let me tell you, Facebook was set up over
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.680]  the decade ago with Bilderberg money. Back in Zuckerberg, we just got out of Harvard.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:06.520]  He was going to Bilderberg meetings and they were planning it as a social control mechanism
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:12.920]  that would then basically privatize illegal NSA spying and get people to opt into illegal
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.480]  spying. And then if they wanted to use NSA data on somebody illegally, they would just
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.200]  go pay Facebook to reverse engineer it so they could have claims in court that it came
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:27.480]  from that. And, you know, you saw the judge just ordered Alexis last week with Amazon,
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:33.120]  it's little spy droid in a double murder case. And then Amazon had to confirm, yeah, it was
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.120]  recording from the day they plugged it in, even when it's off to the day it was unplugged
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:43.320]  by the police. And it's got the audio, everyone being murdered, recorded. That's the whole
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:51.640]  point of AI. And, you know, beware Greeks bearing gifts. They bring you the Trojan horse.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.480]  You put it in your house. And then you wonder what's going on. You're like, well, I'm not
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.040]  murdering anybody. That doesn't matter. It's run so they get a detailed profile on you
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.040]  and know everything about you and have high tech AI scanning it all, putting it into a
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:13.040]  database. So they are getting ready to destroy Facebook. They'll drive it way down and it'll
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.400]  go back up a little bit the next year and then finally plane out forever. They'll want
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:24.920]  to sucker the suckers again. Remember Zuckerberg said, our users trust us. They're dumb efforts.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.920]  I can't believe how pathetic they are. They're so stupid. That's a quote. He just loves screwing
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:37.240]  you over. And he will. Don't you? Because he acts liberal. I'm a liberal. But as long
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.680]  as you go, then everything's okay, literally. Just like Tim Cook, just like all of it. It's
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:49.160]  very, very funny. It's very, very funny. And then if you want to censor the Internet and
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.440]  take over, well, you first demonize somebody for two years saying they're the dark heart.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:01.840]  They're the worst person on the planet. They're a Nazi. And then finally, oh, they have their
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.240]  moral moment, the slave factory owning Apple that's given all the code keys to communist
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:12.000]  China. Tim Cook bans me and that everyone else follows suit. And then always a little
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.120]  virtue signaling companies, they come along and they do the same thing. So that no one
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.240]  stands up for me except Matt Rudge and Tucker Carlson and our listeners. And then the president
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.200]  shut for everyone else. And it's wild how they were calling for me to be taken off a
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.120]  year ago and six months ago. It was because I'd done horrible things. They never showed
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:41.840]  what I did. They'd lie about it. But now they just say, oh, we're in a crisis against nationalists.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:52.480]  We've got to shut them all down. And Alex Jones was just the beginning. And they have
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.360]  major academic papers working with the federal government. You say, well, Trump's the federal
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:04.320]  government. No, he's not 90 plus percent of it does not follow his orders. This is called
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.920]  mutiny against the nation against the people by these multinational corporations allied
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.160]  with the most murderous regimes on earth. So this is the whole shooting game, ladies and
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:21.320]  gentlemen. I got lots of other incredible news, but this right now is everything because
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.920]  if they take your communications away, if they can selectively control what you can
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:34.280]  see and what you can do, it's the ultimate form of discrimination. So let's go over
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.080]  the latest news and then Senator Warner, but let's first look back a little bit. Because
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:44.360]  when I come back, I'm going to read you the most sickening authoritarian babble you've
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:49.360]  ever heard out of a foreigner that comes from an authoritarian country licking their lips
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:57.680]  about silencing you and your family. They create authoritarian regimes on the universities.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.160]  They bring in the controllers and then they deploy them to run your life. Horrible, spoiled,
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:10.160]  rotten, evil little authoritarians. Does the banning of Alex Jones signal a new era, a
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.800]  big tech responsibility? The Guardian, oh, the liberals, the leftists are suddenly, oh,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:23.720]  they're so responsible. The Guardian is for bringing jihadis back to kill women and children
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.040]  to the UK and giving them free housing to rehabilitate them. They mean to run the country,
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:34.280]  but oh, Alex Jones, he it's such a good thing to take him off here. Here's another one.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.480]  Does the ban, oh, Info Wars, how Alex Jones lost the Info War. Remember Colbert and all
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:47.120]  of them celebrated? Yay, he's gone. Info Wars was right. Facebook using Chicom social score
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.400]  for users, we told you. And then it goes on from there. World exclusive Facebook to completely
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.920]  collapse in pre-planned operation in free speeches, we know it. Dem senator demands
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:04.600]  more censorship conservative media. Survival of our democracy depends on banning sites
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:12.000]  like Info Wars. Yes, you must defend people's open right speech being first most in a supposed
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.440]  democracy. We're a republic that guards the minority rights even more. It's like a super
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:22.680]  democracy, but a protected one. So you can't have 51% say enslaved the other 49. Oh, but
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.440]  notice that being a patriot means you don't like your nation. Macron up is down, down
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.960]  is up. Survival of our democracy depends on banning sites like Info Wars says dem senator.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.280]  And now they've done it. Alex Jones calls out Tim Cook. Everything they're doing in
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.240]  China will come to America. WikiLeaks points to Democrats after Info Wars takedown warns
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:50.480]  it could be next. And now it's happening. Soros issues death threat to Google and Facebook.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.120]  Totally censored. Let my people run what you're doing or all implode your stock, which he's
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.680]  now doing. That's what this is about. Use them, make them do the illegal stuff. And then
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.720]  when they won't totally ban everybody and commit suicide, Soros says I will pump and
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:10.800]  dump you faster if you don't submit to me. We told you months ago, tech investors start
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.920]  to panic as Facebook stock rise plunge more than 20%. That was a few months ago. So here
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:24.480]  we are in 2012 at info wars.com calling Facebook a pump and dump in the future. So there's
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.040]  some background for you. And now it's here. And now it's happening. And now they're going
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.760]  to bring in a social score where every because that's what the suddenly the professors are
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.440]  all proposing it. And the New York Times is proposing it and a nice man from China who's
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.840]  running for president, you know, to be on the stage and call for censorship being a
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.440]  good thing. You'll be paid $1,000 a month. You don't have to work. But everything you
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.360]  do will be tracked by your smartphone. The government gives you. It's called slavery.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.960]  That's all over the news. And then the senators come out and act like they're pressuring big
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.440]  tech to do it. But it's all part of the larger plan. Top dim senator, Mark Warner, Google
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:11.600]  must do more to censor YouTube. That's out today. YouTube is one of the most censored
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.000]  places out there now, unless you're promoting child molestation or devil worship or teaching
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.400]  six year old Asian girls that white people are inherently bad. We played video last hour.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.640]  You can't allow stuff like that to be challenged. It has to be in an echo chamber to succeed.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.080]  And so now he's come out and he's pushing this whole thing. We must act against this.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.560]  We're allowing China and the EU and big tech with the Democrats to come in by fiat with
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:44.800]  regulation, take total control of the Internet, censor everyone and then say that we're bad
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.920]  people. And when I read, when we come back this article and I play the clip, he who must
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.360]  not be named, what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common, it is the most incredible
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.960]  projection I've ever heard. We need to drag Alex Jones off into the darkness and silence
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:04.600]  him. She comes from the authoritarian country where they do that turkey. She goes on until
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.280]  all these lies and twist things and then talks about how we need to move to censor everyone
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.360]  that opposes us in this emergency we're in. Yes, some people in Brazil and Italy and the
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.440]  United States and even Mexico and other areas are upset about this. And people know this
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.600]  is bad. And so you're calling it an emergency that people want to run their own countries
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:37.760]  and not have the globalist run them from afar. It's just astounding. It's completely incredible.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.120]  But you can override the censor. You can override these tyrants. They'd like to bring people
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.320]  in from foreign regimes, former Stasi and authoritarians out of Turkey to rule us. All
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.920]  you gotta do is share the link, share the article, spread the word, call C-span, call
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:58.040]  the radio, newswords.com, newswords.com, infowords.com. Hear that? That's the sound of a house being
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.600]  trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.080]  be destroyed. This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break in. Go to faketv.com
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.000]  and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.760]  miles away. Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.

[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.560]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:42.440]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.040]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:54.560]  with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.760]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.160]  food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.800]  over an open fire, then there's a much better way. The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.360]  burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.520]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable. For the

[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:27.480]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. Very powerful article by Jamie White just went
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.680]  up on InfoWars.com. Veteran GOP congressman, schools' dims who claim Trump attacks press
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:39.860]  freedom. That video is coming up. Also, Democrat presidential candidate wants government-sponsored
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:47.040]  social credit system compatible to China's. It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.800]  if you're on welfare, you'll have to be on it, but you can opt-in at $1,000 a month
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.040]  to be totally trapped. That's just to begin it. It's called slavery. It's how you domesticate
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.240]  wild animals. You start feeding them a little bit, and you build a cage, a pin, you put
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:05.280]  the food inside the pin, they go in, you close the gate. The circle is now complete. All
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.320]  right. So, bringing this to a head, they're trying to bring down Facebook right now to
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:17.480]  terrorize the other big tech companies to get in line for total censorship. George Soros
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.920]  is threatening Google and others that you'll go like Facebook if you don't submit. We will
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.440]  absolutely take your stock down. This is economic terrorism, and the president and others going,
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:31.080]  oh, we're free market. We'll leave it alone. It's allowing the vacuum of the Chai comms
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:36.800]  that you use Soros and others to come in. Meanwhile, Obama declared an emergency, signed
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:43.320]  the emergency into law in the Defense Authorization Act in December of 2016 for the next fiscal
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:51.920]  year. That's done before the year. And recruited stay-behind networks of operatives for the
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:59.040]  emergency to stop the Russian takeover. And that's just, they know it's all a joke. That's
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.160]  the cover. Then they had congressional hearings that said, Jones is a Russian operative. We
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.920]  must get him off the internet in 2017. By the middle of 2018, they'd begun to do that.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:14.240]  So if you're outside globalists taking down the country, you call the loyal nationalists
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:21.040]  the outsiders. Because the Achilles heel of the globalist is, they are the outsiders usurping
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.880]  and enslaving the country. And now the president says, we're a nation. We shouldn't have one-sided
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:31.920]  trade deals where Canada has a 280% tariff on milk and we don't. They go, that's the most
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.240]  racist evil thing. Your nation doesn't exist. But Alex Jones is evil. And he works for
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:42.640]  the Russians because he's red, white, and blue and loves the country. See? I know you
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.160]  know this as an audience, but this is what they're doing. Then they bring in a bunch
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.800]  of former Stasi. They bring in people out of Turkey, out of the Middle East, real authoritarian.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.640]  A lot of Chinese operatives are brought in. Most of these Democrat senators actually have
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.080]  a Chinese officer from the intelligence board as part of the Chinese funding of any high-level
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.160]  dem. You have to have one of their operatives, usually as a chief of staff or as their top
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.880]  assistant like Diane Feinstein, who then runs the whole op. And we of course were the first
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.320]  to expose that she was Chinese run. We already knew that that was known, but we've got that
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:21.000]  out there. Let me continue here. So, he who must not be named. And then it shows me, and
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.200]  this is going to be reportedly one of the cover stories on the December Wired magazine
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:33.240]  coming out here in just a week. Is total darkness with a black hand? That means an assassin's
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:40.360]  hand. This image, it means in intelligence operations, this image, but it's normally
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:46.360]  just a normal looking face, not my face, is the symbol of a snatch and grab. One woman
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.240]  that's a total darkness and a black hand grabbing over the mouth. It means you're going into
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:55.560]  a dungeon, which Turkey is very famous for. So, we have this Turkish individual over here
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:01.520]  who's at least about women's rights, of course. Don't the Islamists always do that. He who
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.360]  must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common, this demon snake creature
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:12.840]  from Harry Potter that I'm not into magical thinking, so I haven't followed Harry Potter.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:19.760]  If you want to be into that, that's fine. I've seen pieces of them. But you read this,
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.280]  he's the one calling for censorship. She's part of the big evil cabal. And then she's
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.040]  talking about how I'm the devil and the one that must not be named. Remember David Hogg
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.240]  talking about this and said, ooh, I'm not supposed to say his name because you're not
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.280]  supposed to say my name. Here it is.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.520]  I'm saying Alex, sorry, I don't want to mention his name. When individuals say these things
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.760]  to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.240]  to make money off them. For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.040]  want to name the name of, but as you said, it's from Info Wars, he shots a lot. I'll
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:58.360]  just give you that and he looks red. He's advertising many of these things and the power
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.560]  lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear-mongering, hate-loving people that just
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.480]  want to spread hate and division in America. For example, on Info Wars, one of the main
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:12.000]  things that he's put, one of his famous things is saying that, one of his most famous statements
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.880]  was saying that Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too. First off,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:21.160]  gay people are awesome. I don't think that's a problem at all. And secondly, if you notice
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:26.520]  at the end of that video, he advertises water filters. Interesting.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:33.600]  Yeah, that's the point. The water is toxic and here's the best water filter at the best
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.720]  price. By the way, the best deal ever on Alexa Pure Pro. That's their biggest, nicest, stable
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.880]  steel model, the one that does the most water. The best model out there, 127. Leading competitors
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.760]  for something similar, a 350, 400. They're normally a great deal at 240. They're selling
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.960]  it to us at cost because they ordered too many of them and they don't want to get hit,
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.600]  obviously, with the end of year inventory tax so that you've never been a better time
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  to get Alexa Pure Breeze. It is literally 127 right now at infowarstore.com. InfoWarsLive.com
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:07.320]  or triple-aid 2533139. See, he is an actor, not a crisis actor. The shooting happened.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.120]  He's an actor on the acting deal, a Democrat. He admits he's given lines and his lines are,
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.960]  let's say, Alex Jones' name and, you know, turn to Frogs Game, even though the chemicals
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.320]  are actually sterilizing the frogs is what we said. Now, he who must not be named. I
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:27.080]  got Dr. Steve Pacinic coming back on the broadcast and he's predicted a lot of this. We're going
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.240]  to look at how big this is and what this really means to everything. It's a lot bigger than
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.240]  just Facebook and then when he leaves, I'll get into all the latest Antifa and the rest
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.800]  of it. But to read this authoritarian's article, she says the most ridiculous things in here
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:51.080]  and it shows how childlike their minds are. These wannabe authoritarians. She goes on to say,
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.440]  I will now say his name because now he has no more Voldemort power. He has been banished and
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.320]  is nothing. And I think she must believe in Harry Potter like she's saying this. Oh,
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.760]  she's a five-year-old girl and it just happened. Hey, cupcake. I have some smart advisors,
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.280]  but I do what I think I should do. They've begged me not to tell you this.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:19.400]  But I will because my weapon is the truth. Lady, we're on fire like a sun exploding.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:29.480]  You're a moron. But you evil people never get it, do you? I mean, you're a grown woman
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.440]  talking about shutting down all nationalist conservatives free speech in a giant big brother
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.320]  grid beyond anything Orwell ever dreamed of. And you've got yourself all dressed up in like
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:45.640]  Gaelic Pibb outfits with bows and arrows on your side as your force fed on Twitter, dreaming about
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:51.240]  taking people offline because they're Voldemort. And then now you've diminished them that my last
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:28:04.360]  gasp was going to Congress. Oh my God, you better believe this lady runs around
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.440]  circles around a fire and, you know, thinks that she's got magical powers. I mean, look at that
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:14.280]  little witchy poo outfit. Hey, lady, why don't you get your ass back on an airplane and fly back
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:19.720]  over to Turkey or the Mente to keep your damn mouth shut? We don't do that over here. We're the West.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.080]  Now, I understand your ancestors raided beautiful Constantinople and crapped all over.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.960]  So I understand you're IQ is not high. But let me just give you a little newsflash, lady.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.000]  You and your authoritarian trash will never defeat us. You'll never prevail.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.360]  In the name of Jesus, I just hope that God brings justice to you in a loving way.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:47.320]  God is merciful and loving. But you got somebody from the authoritarian regime where she wouldn't
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:53.480]  be allowed to shoot her mouth off over here trying to dominate men. She's like a big old fat Turkish
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.200]  Islamist. Attention, parents and grandparents, have you ever wanted to give a gift that would
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.080]  have lasting value and provide spiritual benefits long after Christmas is over? A gift you could
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.960]  even call an investment in the next generation? If so, this is going to be the single most important
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.200]  message you'll hear this holiday season. Hi, I'm Bill Hyde, and I want to tell you about an exciting
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.200]  gift. One you can give your kids or grandkids that's going to teach Christian history, build up
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.520]  their faith, provide extraordinary role models, and it's all done with a distinctive Christian
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.320]  worldview. I'm talking about the award winning Movies for the Mind CD sets based on the extraordinary
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:30.200]  adventures of G.A. Hendy Audio Series. The best part? You can finally give a Christian gift to
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.240]  the kids that's not boring, dull, or cheesy. The audio adventures also build vocabulary,
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.960]  focus, and attention span, but they're not sold in stores and you can't get the adventures at
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.920]  any big internet retailers either. So to learn more, even get below wholesale pricing and a whole
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:50.760]  bunch of Christmas bonuses, go to GiveTheAdventure.com. That's GiveTheAdventure.com. The perfect gift for
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:30:00.920]  kids of all ages from 6 to 100, go to GiveTheAdventure.com. We need to go back and revisit the foundations
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:06.360]  of our freedom. Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.760]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights,
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:16.760]  the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.720]  and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals. You better understand
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:29.000]  that because they're taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.320]  UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:40.920]  want people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:47.880]  is easiest for them to control everyone. It's The David Knight Show. Never miss your show

[01:32:51.960 --> 01:33:08.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:24.760]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:34.600]  Alex Jones. So, we are in the middle of an epic move by different powers and different forces
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.560]  to openly take control of the internet and censor nationalist conservatives, Christians,
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.800]  you name it, and then use it for a social score that tracks everything you do and only favors
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.280]  elite corporations and it's being now promoted everywhere. We first told you about this six
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:56.600]  years ago. Now, they have the New York Times, all of them today, Wired Magazine, you name it,
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:01.400]  saying he who must not be named with Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common. Then it has me
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.720]  being snatched and grabbed and drug off into the dark pit. So, I love how it's some woman who
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:11.080]  fled authoritarian Turkey to come over here and be a professor and do it here. But that's what
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.040]  they're pushing. That's what they are bringing in. Now, you get all these Democratic senators
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.920]  saying, oh, Google hasn't done enough to censor pro-Trump people. Oh, Facebook, you know,
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.880]  you're going down because you let Cambridge Analytica publicly scrape some names when that's
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.920]  nothing compared to what Facebook, Google and Twitter have done. So, I wanted to get Dr. Steve
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.000]  Pachinicon, because he's talked about a lot of this. He's predicted a lot of it. He was on a few
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.360]  months ago with Owen and said that, I mean, it was pretty obvious to him, he talked about before
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:44.920]  that, that Facebook was being prepared to be taken down. It was obviously set up as a pump
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.840]  and dump a long time ago and to spy on people. But out of that process, they're going to try
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.920]  to sell all this censorship. So, there's a war for the internet happening right now.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.000]  And because Trump hasn't come in and put prohibitions on it,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.400]  that's allowed other outside interests in my view to come in like the Chai comms, the EU,
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.760]  with their own regulations and basically take control of the web. So, I wanted to get Steve
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:11.640]  Pachinic's take on this because he knows a lot of folks that are involved at the upper levels,
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.400]  with at least how this was created and what it was supposed to do versus how it's been
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.680]  hijacked for authoritarianism. And to me, this is one of the biggest issues globally right now.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:27.960]  So, Doc, thanks for joining us. No problem. What I told you well over a year ago was that
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:34.760]  Facebook was in financial trouble. I don't need any information from above or elsewhere.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:42.120]  I was tracking it and I was shorting a lot of that stock. Right now, Facebook is not in great
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:50.520]  shape. The maximum value of Facebook was 212 and now it's at 138 at the bottom. That's the
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.360]  fifth 52-week high and low. And what I was saying well a couple of months ago is that
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:03.880]  Zuckerberg doesn't know how to run the company. Sandberg doesn't know how to run it. She has
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.960]  been a serious problem to this company and other people. And as a woman, she wanted to talk about
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:15.080]  how great it was as a woman, how she could lead a company and how smart she was and blah, blah,
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:21.080]  blah. Basically, what you got is two Jewish exceedingly narcissistic characters who are very
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:29.480]  self-destructive. I said it years ago. And ironically, she used her Jewishness to basically
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:40.360]  hire the pro-Trump or let's say the opposition party company to create anti-Semitism and then
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:46.920]  make it sound as if they were being attacked for being Jews, which is despicable. I mean,
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.520]  I think that should be enough to get rid of her and to deface her completely. But the other part,
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.720]  that was a real problem for Facebook, which I've been monitoring and I said years ago,
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:03.960]  and that is the concept that Facebook in some ways was a positive force in the world when,
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:10.360]  in fact, it was a facilitator to the genocide that occurred in Minimar. And I have talked about
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.840]  that. And that's when the 700,000 Roangies, the Muslims, were getting killed by another so-called
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:23.480]  liberal who is the prime minister of Minimar Burma named Aung Suu Kyi. So the notion that women
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:30.040]  are especially entitled to run anything and are better than men is really not proven by
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:37.560]  Sandberg or M. Suu Kyi. So what we have here in Facebook is a very serious problem, both financially,
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.320]  politically, and in terms of viability. If I were the board of directors, I would throw out
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:48.840]  Zuckerberg even though he owns 60 percent of the company. But at this rate, the company will go
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:55.640]  probably down to its lowest value right now in 52 weeks, which is 132. And my suspicion is it'll go
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.800]  below 120 and then to 110 and possibly 100. If it does that, then it will bring down the other
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:08.520]  thing stops. So Zuckerberg is not in a position to really run anything right now. The issue of
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:13.880]  Zuckerberg was very interesting to me because eight years ago when I saw a social network,
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:19.720]  it was obvious to me that this was a young man who was self-aggrandizing, who was a misogynist,
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:27.320]  quite frankly, because what he did in order to create Facebook was to basically ask all his
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:34.520]  friends at Harvard to rate the looks of the women at Harvard. And if that's not misogyny,
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:39.560]  I don't know what it is. And in turn, he didn't turn out to be a geek. He really went to Phillips,
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.800]  Exeter, and in New Hampshire, was the head of the fencing team. So everything about him
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:52.840]  bespeaks for grandiosity and narcissism that's so out of control, but has no sense.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.520]  And I should add, you're a psychiatrist too, so we're not just having people randomly up
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.640]  and saying this, but expanding on the bigger picture here. They're going after Facebook for
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:05.880]  supposed spying on people, but they're going after the least of it. And then they're using it to
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.960]  threaten the other tech companies to go along with the Democratic Party and others that won even
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.080]  increased censorship. And this is one reason that the Republicans didn't keep the House in the midterms.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.720]  And now they're saying all over the news, they're going to intensify it. They're even trying to take
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:24.760]  my banking away. They're going after everybody I know. This is real authoritarianism. And so I
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:30.360]  want to get into specifically what you think about what needs to be done to counter the fact
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:35.080]  that this is just green-lighted, even more censorship, that Trump says he's about to take
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:41.080]  action, but we haven't seen it yet. Well, whoa, I'm not sure you've got more censorship here
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:48.360]  than you think. The notion why the Democrats won on the midterms, and I was involved at the local
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:55.080]  level, it was very clear. Nancy Pelosi ran an incredibly effective race, whereas Trump did not.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.640]  And I have to, you know, I'm not a fan of Nancy Pelosi, but I understand national politics.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:08.120]  When they came into every area of the country, she ran a very effective, very streamlined
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:14.520]  campaign, which was highly focused. But that's exactly what I'm saying is that Trump got elected
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.600]  because we had internet superiority and the grassroots went out and did the job for them.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:23.160]  They ran the same campaign because people told him, no, sir, you really want it going and doing
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:28.200]  rallies. One Trump supporter putting a viral video out is bigger than a whole Trump rally.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:35.080]  And so they undercut everything and literally allowed the complete shadow banning basically
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.960]  of everybody and dialing back nationalist conservatives or anybody that is in anti-America
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.520]  96 percent. That's why they lost and then allowed the targeting that Pelosi engaged in.
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.640]  Well, I'm not in agreement. I think we lost. And here in Florida, it was even clear to me,
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:57.880]  I voted for the Sanctus and I gave him money and we came in by only a few points. The same
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.080]  thing with Rick Scott. It had nothing to do with anything other than the fact that the
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:09.400]  campaigns on both sides were not effectively run. The Republican Party had a very poor leadership
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:18.600]  issue. Paul Ryan had left and we had no basic message. It wasn't a type of just censorship
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.840]  that you were talking about. This was really operational problems. And what it meant for
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.160]  the future of the Republican Party is that we're in trouble. The same way I said to you
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.600]  about Facebook, the same way I'm telling you now, the Republican Party is in trouble because it has
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:38.520]  no leadership. If Trump is in fact the leader, which he's not, he's mercurial. He has his own
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:44.520]  problems. He's really out of control in many ways. The Republican Party doesn't know which way to go
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.280]  and it doesn't have a leader. Well, at least he's a cheerleader for the country and is trying to
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.920]  do better deals on trade and things. But I agree that he doesn't have people around him
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.880]  that are really trying to turn the country around. Most of them are just trying to be
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:00.680]  popular with both sides and make a bunch of money. And the fact that, take campaigns out of this,
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.880]  the fact that they're letting the Democrats come in with this mass targeting by cartels and censorship
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.920]  of certain groups is discriminatory, is very, very dangerous, and it's a dereliction of duty
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:17.000]  if they don't start doing something. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, from the very beginning,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  I told you, he has a problem. If you want to put Jared Kushner in there who has supported
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.960]  Mohamed Ben Salman, who had turned kill Posadji, if you want to put in Ivana Trump, who has done
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.640]  absolutely nothing. Well, you're right. You did say two years ago that you liked Trump,
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.800]  but the fact that Jared Kushner, you believe could destroy Trump, and now continually.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.480]  I was right. I was right. We got a war in Yemen. My generals do not want that war. They want to
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:50.520]  pull out and that's what's happening. We had a prime minister of Lebanon who was taken hostage.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.680]  Let's talk about it when we come back. Let's talk about it when we come back.

[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.240]  The Globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:04.600]  bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.200]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:16.360]  out in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.840]  but hard to source. And The Globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:26.600]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and rockUX2. That's been incredible. Now,
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.400]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.840]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:43.320]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:49.080]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.360]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at infowarslife.com.

[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:08.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:29.880]  You may be an ambassador to England or France. You may like to gamble. You might like to dance.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:38.120]  You may be the heavyweight champion of the world. You may be a socialite with a long
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:46.920]  string of pearls, but you're going to have to save somebody.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.960]  If you know about history sometime, really interesting stories you can tell,
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.680]  but specifically looking at internet censorship, I understand you can sit there and say the
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:03.400]  Republicans ran incompetent campaigns. Yeah, Hillary said, you shut down Alex Jones,
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.520]  you shut down the conservatives, you kick them off YouTube and Facebook. They had heritage,
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:14.280]  and they did it. And it wasn't me they were really blocking. It was all the little old ladies that
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.240]  might put out 20, 30 videos that one of them gets 50 million views. We were getting 20, 30 million
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:25.240]  views on videos on Facebook or Trump. And then Carl Rope doesn't want that. He'd rather get a
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:32.200]  $5 million package on Fox News and run those ads that only reach maybe the same 5 million,
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.800]  6 million viewers over and over again who were already going to vote Republican. So I get it,
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.200]  Dr. Pachennick, yeah, targeted. The Democrats actually went after swing voters in key areas.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.720]  I get it. The Republicans didn't even really do that. I get the incompetence. They're going to
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.680]  continue to be incompetent because the blue bloods just want the money. I'm saying Trump coming in
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.400]  with some anti-trust busting or threatening he's going to go after them, like the Democrats threatened
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.440]  Senator Warner and others to take over Facebook, Google and Twitter, and they rolled over and peed
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:06.360]  all over themselves like a dog. And that's why the Democrats were able to win. Okay, because
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:12.840]  Trump had his legs cut out from under him. So I agree. It is incompetent that the Republicans
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:20.760]  have allowed this. That's what I was getting at. The censorship of the internet is something that
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.760]  you correctly brought out and you've been part of it and I've been part of it. So I'll give you
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:33.720]  an example. When I have my own YouTube and we have 50 or 60,000 people who view it,
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.280]  we're getting demonetized. Are we getting less money? Is there a fascist element to Google,
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:47.080]  YouTube, Facebook and the others? The answer is absolutely yes. To what degree is that fascist
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.920]  element? It's to the degree that people like myself who will trade on a daily basis will
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:59.160]  either start shorting the stock or anonymous will come in or the others in the intelligence
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:05.480]  community will say it's enough. This no longer serves our national service. The truth of the
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:11.960]  matter is the Chinese are ahead of us. They have quantum encryption. We're not anywhere near them.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.400]  But at the same time, we're wasting money on F-38s, a fight of jets that are sitting there
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:25.720]  for $385 million with parts that came from China. But I don't have enough money to make a senior
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:31.960]  general the secretary of cyber war instead of putting in them on their homeland security.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:39.560]  You are absolutely correct. But the problem also lies in the White House. He is now changing
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:47.320]  elements and relying on his own family, Kushner, Ivana. Melania correctly fired a woman who
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:53.800]  was anti-Maddox. But if John Kelly leaves and you bring in Nick Ayers, who's a Republican
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:58.840]  operative and is going to run the White House, you're going to have troubles. I can predict that.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:04.680]  If you keep John Bolton there, and he has been a neocon his whole life, has had no national
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:11.160]  security experience on the ground, avoided the draft, avoided going into Vietnam, although he
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:16.040]  he was a proponent of war. And I've worked with John. I don't personally dislike him,
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:21.880]  but I don't admire him. I think he's a coward, as is the neocons. Then you will have trouble.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:30.200]  And the problem is we have put in Maddox, Kelly, Nakasone, Abazaid, all these generals and Pompeo
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:36.040]  because the civilians have not done a good job. I don't know how many times I've had to say it
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:41.480]  since the beginning of the Obama administration, the Bush Jr. administration. The fact that we
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:48.040]  have military generals is not an accident. And I will repeat it again. If civilians intend to go
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:54.280]  to war, and if the president does not know what he's doing, we will keep squeezing on the military
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:59.240]  side. And it's as simple as that. You can call me treasonous. You can call me whatever you want.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:05.000]  But I said it years ago, I wrote about it a maximum vigilance. 20 years ago, we can no longer
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:10.680]  force civilians who have had no military experience. It's not that they're warlike. It's the other way
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:16.520]  around. Maddox wants to get out of Afghanistan. And who do we appoint? Zalmi Khaliza, one of the
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.880]  most corrupt, incompetent... No, I understand. Here's the difference. You have the Democrats
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:28.280]  openly out alive with the Chai comms, out to get the country... Alex, the liberals have nothing to
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.280]  do with the... No, I know the neocons are... I get it. I know the neocons are heavily involved,
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:36.040]  too. So the neocons are bad. The liberal establishment's bad. All I'm saying is at least
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:42.040]  Trump's trying to get jobs back and promote that a nation state exists. So I'm not even here
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:48.440]  defending Trump. I'm very upset that more isn't happening and that people like Jared Kushner,
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.080]  having dinner with the head of Google, who sits there and glad hands him. And so I'm not enemies
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:59.800]  with Jared Kushner, but certainly he's the guy that sold Trump, reportedly, on this whole deal
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.760]  with this prince, whoever. And then it looks like this whole thing has blown up spectacularly.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:12.760]  Correct. The point is, Alex, you have to direct some of your attacks to really where the incompetency
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:18.920]  lies within our own administration. Trump can only do what he can do. He came in,
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:25.800]  he's charismatic, he's mercurial. We've tried to stabilize that mercurial, but he will continue.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:31.800]  But if he cannot build an infrastructure, and he did a brilliant job of appointing Nancy Pelosi,
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:38.520]  who's 80 years old to say, look, she has to remain the speaker at the house. Why? Because she and he
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:44.200]  are very much alike. They both come out of a background of the mafia construction. I remember
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:51.000]  Pelosi's father was the mayor of Baltimore when I had hotels there. Trump's father was in the mob.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.280]  He had to build construction in Queens and Brooklyn. They both understand what it takes to
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:02.520]  create a unity function, but they have to build infrastructure. We don't have it. We need to
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:08.200]  keep moving on. We need to put more money into cyber command. I need more money into schools.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:15.640]  I have kids whose education level is so bad. I'm in a state where the kids' education is the 46th
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.480]  in the state in Florida. And they say to me, oh, give the teachers more money.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.360]  Well, Rick Scott didn't do anything. Bill Nelson hasn't done it. Let's see what the state-
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  What I'm saying is, Soros is a figurehead of it, obviously, but the whole UN-globalist
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:36.280]  combine wants to collapse nation-states, discredit the borders, discredit any ethos of believing
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:41.000]  in your nation. If we lose that, we're done. And so the big thing that Trump's doing versus the
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.560]  Democrats is he's being pro-America. The Democrats have radicalized with Eric Swallowell saying,
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.480]  we're going to confiscate all the guns. If you don't like it, we'll nuke your ass. I mean,
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:57.560]  the Democrats have literally degenerated into a group of like day-of-the-dead zombies.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:05.880]  Alex, I always enjoy your analogies in your description. The truth of the matter is,
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:14.200]  Soros was one of the few people who went after Facebook and said this is a very dangerous entity.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.080]  And he particularly went after Zuckerberg and Sandberg, saying she has no idea-
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:21.640]  Because he wanted to bully them into letting him direct them?
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:28.120]  No, not direct him, but telling them exactly where the problem would lie in terms of the
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:36.200]  ongoing genocide. Look, I met him 40 years ago when we were in the Soviet Union. I didn't know
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:41.320]  who he was. He used his own money to take Satorov off out of the Soviet Union.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:45.080]  No, I know he was used during the Cold War and I get all that, but it came out in the WikiLeaks.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:51.480]  He wants to control what can be published. He has a database. Google and people are using him
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.520]  to say what should be up and what should be down. He's the real threat.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:02.760]  I look, he's been in and out of so many things. There's no one man. I mean,
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.600]  honestly, he's not the threat. No, I know what he represents, though.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.280]  But what does he represent? The accounts on foreign relations, which I left,
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:18.280]  isn't even relevant. Do you understand? I mean, the relevancy of all these institutions are gone
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:24.120]  thanks to you, others, myself. They're not relevant. No, I agree. That's going on. But still,
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.720]  when they give orders, things happen. It doesn't mean it does what they want,
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:32.600]  but it still has repercussions. They thought censoring me would get rid of us. It actually
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.720]  caused us to mutate, get even more powerful in a way, but I didn't want to tell them that.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:44.280]  The point is, is that the point is, you are more powerful. They made a big, that's my point.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.640]  They made a serious judgment call. And I said it when you were on the air, we would not let you
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:55.400]  go off the air. But in fact, what happened is you became even more popular than before.
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:00.680]  And people talk about it. But the answer is, how are you getting transmitted?
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.480]  You know how you're getting transmitted. We know how you're getting transmitted.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:11.800]  But the truth is, Soros isn't the problem. The Democrats are finished. That's not an issue.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:15.560]  Even the Republicans do five more minutes, then we're going to come back, give me your view on
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:18.840]  that. Because you were the guy, remember, like you were coming on 18 years ago, but 15 years ago,
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:22.920]  you go, the East was going to collapse and the West Coast is all going to move into the Midwest
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:26.920]  and Texas will be the new capital and, you know, all that stuff. So I knew you're a smart guy.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.480]  So I want to get where you think. The way we keep the country going and we don't have a nuclear war,
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.720]  and I agree that Madison and people have been trying to stop wars. That's a good thing. And I
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:40.040]  agree the neocons are a big problem. In fact, really, if you look at it, in fact, the neocons
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.800]  were bragging at a defense field in Germany last month that they're going to take even more
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:49.480]  conservatives out. I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.480]  23 years on air. Obviously, water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing. And I've had
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:58.280]  water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air. And over the years, I learned a lot about
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:02.920]  water filtration. I learned what the best was. Now, the Alexa Pure pros their biggest,
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:06.920]  nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing. It's got all the
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:11.160]  bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.520]  my page's supply that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year. He has
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:22.040]  a glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted,
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:30.200]  usually $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us at cost and we're making $27 bucks on them. So
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.440]  they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:43.640]  It's amazing. Alexa Pure pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call AAA-253-3139.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:50.200]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:55.800]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives,
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:59:00.440]  the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say,
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:04.440]  why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:09.400]  into the ground. And I knew we had no future. We didn't do this. So we've already had incredible
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:15.400]  success. But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:20.440]  and why we've been made the main target. And if you financially support us and if you spread the
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:26.600]  word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:32.440]  brutal scompags. We'll win. We have huge sales, infowarsstore.com right now. And we're still able
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:36.120]  to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:41.160]  block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:45.800]  Soros, the global Spain win. This is infowars.com. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:35.560]  You know, I tend to do research for the broadcast and they get so wound up before I go on air that I
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:40.200]  just go in 100 directions. A lot of times in the first hour, if I start settling down with the
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  second and third hour, and when we come back, I want to open the phones up to just in general
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:54.040]  to discuss the election fraud. And what do you think the president should do? What should we do
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:01:01.400]  when brazenly Democrats all across the country in famous counties who've been convicted for fraud?
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:07.880]  The same individuals are involved and they're doing it in front of the whole world
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:15.480]  nakedly. What do we do when we're faced with criminal activity that is stealing control of our
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:24.280]  nation so they can carry out even bigger enterprises? What do you do with Debbie Washerman Schultz
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:31.480]  and people like this known for their criminal activity
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:43.960]  are willing to carry this out? And all it's doing is making them more brazen, more arrogant,
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:50.520]  more full of huspa. How do you counter something like this? And what does the president
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.520]  need to do? That's the question I'm asking you. I'm going to give the number out.
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:04.920]  877-789-2539. Let's do first-time callers. 877-789-2539. 877-789 Alex.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.480]  Also, when we come back, I played part of this at the very start of the show, but I'm going to play
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:15.800]  all six minutes of it because it's really powerful. Tucker Carlson goes to bat for
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:22.280]  Imple Wars last night and he went to bat for his own children's free speech and the future of this
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:33.240]  country and just points out it's not hypocrisy because CNN is not being censored. So they lie
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.280]  and say they're being censored when they're not by the president and others. They act like they're
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.480]  the bastion of defending it when they're the ones that are really attacking.
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.360]  Articles up on infowars.com. It's very important to share it. If you don't share it, nobody will.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:53.560]  It's also on newswars.com. Tucker Carlson's epic take down of CNN, one of free speech's greatest
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:03:06.040]  enemies. So that's the start of next segment because it ties in to the control corporate press
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:13.880]  acting like Trump's this dictator who's coming after the media and it's just all lies. And I was
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.280]  watching Tucker Carlson this morning from last night and while he was talking about and his
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:24.920]  guest was talking about all the horrible things that the Democrats and Obama and CNN has done to
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:30.760]  the free press, arresting reporters you name it, it was making me think of all these other things
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:38.360]  they didn't even get to. I mean they have done a lot of really, really horrible stuff
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:45.320]  and it was making me sick to my stomach when I was listening to it this morning and literally
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:52.360]  Carlson then goes, it makes you nauseated. Because when you know all this stuff and you
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:57.240]  know all their lies and you and I heard Carlson reminding everybody of the chain of lies with
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:04.040]  his guest, it really is. I was getting nauseated and getting a headache because it's just thinking
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:09.800]  about all the crap they've done and then they got the guts, the bravada.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:25.720]  Guts didn't even the word. They've just got no respect for anybody and they sit there and they
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.920]  tell the most fantastic lies you've ever seen that are verifiably not true when they're saying
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:39.480]  them. This is called gaslight and it really makes me angry. When we come back we're gonna play
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:47.640]  the report and tie it into CNN bitching and complaining that they're being censored by Trump
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:53.000]  which again is another lie. They're the censors. They're the pigs. They're the liars.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.800]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:03.480]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:09.080]  dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:15.240]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:19.720]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:25.480]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible. Now,
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:30.280]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:35.720]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:42.200]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:48.200]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:56.200]  to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:34.600]  We are now into the second hour of the global broadcast, the most censored, most demonized,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.920]  most lied about transmission in the world for good reason. We've got the globalist number,
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:46.360]  we know their in-game, we know how they operate, we know how to stop them. So again, Monday through
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:52.200]  Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. central, we're here at the war room with Owen Schreuer and others
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:56.680]  comes up three o'clock central standard time, David Knight, 8 a.m. central. And remember,
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:00.920]  we're on hundreds of AM and FM stations, hundreds of TV stations and cable stations,
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.160]  however you're watching or listening, you are the power of free speech, you are the power of
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:12.120]  getting the word out to everyone you know, you are the ones that are overpowering the sensors
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:20.200]  and big text attempt to silence us. Go to infowars.com forward slash show, where you can

[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:36.040]  And I want to thank you all for spreading the word, despite their attempts to destroy us and
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:42.200]  shut us down, they have failed so far. Thank you for standing with us. And I want to say thank you
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:47.400]  to Tucker Carlson for standing with the First Amendment and his birthright and your birthright.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:54.680]  He's been the strongest in any mainstream media format to defend free speech. Michael
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:08:01.480]  Savage has as well. Matt Drudge has online been a powerful force for free speech.
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:05.560]  And he also predicted years ago in the studio in an exclusive interview, what was coming in the
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:10.040]  future, because he was told by members of the Supreme Court and others, we're now witnessing
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:15.080]  that in game. They were going to carry out whether Hillary got elected or not. They're going to have
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:20.600]  hearings in January claiming that Trump has violated the rights of the Washington Post and CNN
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.960]  is trying to destroy the First Amendment. None of that's happening. He's speaking out when they lie
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:31.640]  about him and say he's a Nazi or all these other horrible names. They're now claiming countering
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:42.760]  them is a violation of their free speech. They're now suing the president and federal court saying
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.920]  that Jim Acosta did not touch a woman and that Trump has no right to kick him out because of
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.840]  his heckling and violating decorum. Anybody else would be thrown out acting like this.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:09:00.520]  CNN lobbied last year to have us removed and it was done. CNN put pressure on the press secretary.
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.840]  He had a big national story and so our press passes were revoked no reason given. Dr. Corsi
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:15.480]  was our reporter there, two number one New York Times bestselling books, PhD in political science
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:23.800]  and international finance and they said CNN says you should not have it and so you're taken off the
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:30.600]  air. So this is their attitude. This is what they're doing and now they're the paragon of free
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:36.760]  speech defense when they lobbied and harassed our sponsors and mercilessly lied and went after
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:41.320]  publishing companies and got one of the head publisher guys fired because they were trying to
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:48.120]  do a book deal with me. It's just they are true authoritarians and then their little attack dog
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:53.880]  gets thrown out lies about it. The whole press joins him including Fox News Court itself joined
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:58.520]  the lawsuit against the president saying you will let Jim Acosta run around and scream and yell at
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:03.880]  everyone and you will let him stay in there and manhandle women and you have no right. Well,
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.920]  Trump knows this judge may say yes it costs us God but the Supreme Court will shoot it down.
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.720]  Just like the Supreme Court said no the president does control the borders oh and that caravan
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:19.320]  started arriving in San Diego want all the free goods and taunting the military and border patrol
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:25.160]  yesterday oh but it didn't exist remember first it existed but when we didn't want it they said oh
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:29.720]  it doesn't exist you're crazy. This is the level of deception. So here's Tucker Carlson last night
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:33.480]  going to bat for all of our basic free speech and going to bat for reality.
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:39.480]  Well there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington right now. Good. We're for free
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:46.120]  speech. The question is are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:51.800]  of speech. Hashtag Basta whatever that means. Well anyway we'll investigate the assault on free
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:11:01.480]  speech after the break. In the past couple of days you've heard a lot of huffing and puffing
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:05.560]  about free speech and freedom of the press and how those freedoms are currently imperiled by the
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:12.920]  White House. And to be clear we are for free speech unfettered absolute free speech. The kind
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:16.840]  of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment and ratified consistently by the Supreme Court. We've
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:22.040]  defended that kind of free speech almost every night here for the past two years. Many others
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.960]  mostly on the left have attacked speech. So we know who's for free speech and who's against it
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:33.560]  and we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:39.880]  defenders all of a sudden. Take CNN for example. It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:44.920]  campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the grounds that they didn't
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:50.280]  like what Jones had to say. Ultimately CNN succeeded in doing that. The network convinced
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.360]  every major tech platform to ban Jones in his outlet Infowars. You don't have to like Alex Jones
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:03.000]  to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech because it was exactly that. But CNN was not done
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.800]  trying to silence its critics. Last year the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:14.360]  creating an anti-CNN meme. CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:21.000]  criticized by him again. Now CNN is claiming to defend free speech only when it's their speech.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.720]  You'll notice by the way that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:31.400]  to the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents. Yes RT is owned by a foreign
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.360]  government so is the BBC. Until last year much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.160]  national. This is true of other news organizations none of which has ever registered as a foreign
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:46.680]  agent. But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected,
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:52.360]  it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced. So call CNN what you will but don't
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:57.560]  pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment. They are not. Victor Davis Hansen is a fellow at
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:02.520]  the Hoover Institution and a close watcher of all as he joins us tonight. So I just want to be clear
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:08.360]  we're always for free speech especially speech that's offensive even by obnoxious White House
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:12.520]  correspondents. But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say what
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.680]  they think is true to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the First Amendment is nauseating.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.920]  Yeah I think when people saw the suit they asked themselves was there anything in the past
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.480]  that Jim Acosta had said negatively that got him kicked out and the answer was no. Is there anybody
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:31.800]  MSNBC do they get kicked out? The answer is no. Do other CNN reporters get kicked out? No they have
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.640]  passed it so it was a particular type of behavior. I mean if you're arguing a case before the Supreme
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.760]  Court you can't go in there and take pictures or interrupt the justice they'll kick you out and if
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.800]  you do it another time they'll say we don't want you pleading a case before the Supreme Court. Jim
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.800]  he Jim Acosta can't go in there barefooted and say I want to express myself. There are certain
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:57.880]  protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated them. That's one issue and then it's not this is
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:03.560]  sort of a psychodrama Tucker I mean we remember that the prior administration monitored 20 AP
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:11.240]  reporters and Fox's own James Rosen nobody filed a suit on behalf of James Rosen from CNN. Thanks
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:19.000]  uh yeah they prosecuted hundreds of journalists and whistleblowers at a level worse than Abraham
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:29.320]  Lincoln did in a war. He broke Abraham Lincoln's records using Trading with the Enemy Act on
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:34.280]  people reporting on Obama's corruption and working with the Taliban and groups like that.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:42.280]  They tried to put Fox News reporters in jail for reporting on North Korea and public info and
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:47.000]  going to defense briefings that were public at the Pentagon and then they tried to put multiple
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:56.760]  Fox reporters in prison for going to public defense talks. Oh but oh the press oh Trump's
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:01.960]  kidding and oh he's remember when they went to the older lady's house who is a listener but didn't
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.840]  want to come on and they said your Facebook's got a couple hundred people on it here in Broward
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:11.000]  County they didn't want anybody voting there against them. You're a Russian agent she goes I know
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.760]  every person on there well a Russian bot posted something on there oh a Russian bot sent a link
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.240]  turned out 80% of the Russian bot were hired by the Democrats because you can go hire a Russian
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:27.240]  company to spam bring come back and play a little bit more of this but this is just crazy and play
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:34.280]  that clip reminding everybody they're bullying but this guy's really smart Victor Davis Hanson
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:39.400]  he rattles off a bunch of stuff I've forgotten about and it's just like it'd be like Hitler
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:45.000]  being the chief judge at Nuremberg and passing judgment on Nazis that follow his orders I mean
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.760]  CNN is the most anti-free speech group in the world they are anti-american filthy criminals

[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:46.040]  that trump was wrestling they didn't just threaten to fire him and get him to lose his job by doxing
[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:50.680]  him they would go to people's houses in houston being a russian agents because they were getting
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:58.600]  people organized in florida to vote remember this video this real harassment uh the russians i don't
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:04.680]  care if they were uh involved or not that that to me is the least important thing but they were
[02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:11.160]  involved with you did you guys know that they weren't involved with us you know just make sure
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:16.600]  that you report it correctly that you know but you guys were involved with being patriotic right
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:22.200]  very very patriotic but not being patriotic was the group that contacted and helped organize some
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:28.280]  of these activities that you posted on your own facebook account those were legitimate those were
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:34.680]  russians they were not russians i don't go with the russians that group was russian i have nothing
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:41.240]  to do with the russians well apparently you did no maybe you didn't know it but you did when you're
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:45.720]  talking like this i don't want to have anything to do with you well i'm talking with those people
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:52.520]  that were with me were all trump supporters very very much so and all apparently following the
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:59.480]  direction of groups that were associated with russians who were actually infiltrating bs and
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:04.840]  please please report that i don't believe that that's bullshit i know all the people that were with
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:12.440]  me okay they were at my meetings they're all trump supporters okay but did you realize that you
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:17.880]  guys were in communication electronically with with russians me not me i don't know you were
[02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:25.320]  posting stuff on the facebook hillary clinton was and so was all her uh bandits some of the stuff
[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:30.040]  that you you were in charge of the facebook account right you were posting and reposting almost
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:37.080]  word for word the information that was coming out of this internet research agency now in st
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:47.320]  petersburg no you don't believe that nope thank you all right let's stop right there there's the
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:53.000]  american flag they go show her address her name where she lives and it turned out of course none
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.680]  of that was truly internet research agency is really a westward intelligence front interfacing
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:03.800]  with russia they put billions in a year trying to overthrow russia through these different projects
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:08.520]  soros has huge operations in russia then they'll point at those almost all of it's supporting
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:14.200]  hillary and then come back and say that then russians are involved that's like saying americans
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:20.120]  are involved in in russia or japanese are involved in america russia's huge there's all these businesses
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:26.360]  going back and forth the truth is 80 percent of campaign spending that went on with any russian
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:32.280]  companies was against donald j trump because 80 percent of the campaign money got spent by hillary
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.080]  simply mind blowing and again we now know the russia thing was made up we knew it at the time
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:44.520]  it was all a canard a red herring to cover up what hillary and mewler and the rest of them were
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:49.080]  involved in but there's the real doxing there's the real harassment everything they accused me of
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:54.600]  they said i was talked to a cnn reporter rudely and said he was a horrible person for getting
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:59.960]  us banned off all those platforms which was true he's a public figure in a public space i was talking
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:10.040]  to him oliver darcy they go that's why you're banned you talk to the royal cnn but they can go
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:14.200]  harass a woman in her house and accuse her of being a russian which turned out wasn't even true
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:18.760]  here's tucker carlson breaking it down with an expert from the hoover institute
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:25.640]  my god we only learned in 2013 that three years ago the man was being surveilled by the attorney
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:29.880]  general this is a violation of press freedom we didn't hear that and you're not hearing cnn
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:36.120]  say anything about the voices being silenced now online by the big tech companies because they have
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:42.440]  unfashionable views can you as a philosophical matter support free speech in some cases but not
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:47.720]  in others i don't think you can and then we get to another week if we want to talk about ethics
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:53.800]  and the protocols of the white house cnn 93 percent of their coverage according to shorenstein is
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.400]  biased and trump had no problem with that he has no problem when a cnn host kathy griffin holds a
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:04.520]  decapitated facsimile of his head they have no problem when anderson cooper uses obscenity or
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:10.760]  res resa aslan says he's a piece of crap or people that are guests and panelists say that he's a
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:17.320]  a russian asset or agent or they invoke the holocaust for comparison or people say that he's
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:22.040]  radicalized more people than isis remember that and they have these stories they keep running you
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:29.400]  know that scaramucci has uh involved with the russian hedge fund false that uh trump knew in
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:35.080]  advance of the russian meeting that don trump jr had access to the wiki because i remember when cnn
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:40.120]  was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that he never gets to this there's just so many
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:45.320]  hundreds of other ones when cnn and abc said general flan admits they're under russian command
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.520]  unbelievable toy bayhard we've got the documents they're a russian operation he's plain guilty
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:55.560]  they're russian agents the russians command to them all uh no general flan only had about 100
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.080]  thousand dollars in the bank you know paying for his kids college everything and a modest house
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:03.880]  and he lost his house everything else the preliminary and said okay i'll plead guilty
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:09.800]  i you say i made misleading statements which weren't even true fine i plead guilty
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.440]  which wasn't even true but he just said fine i plead guilty i don't have money
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:20.280]  i know roger stone spent a million bucks he's now out of the behind the scenes stuff has no money
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:29.000]  it's been all his money sold his house had his other place doxxed this is what they do to you folks
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:34.920]  i put some akerns away for winter so i could fight these folks but they've gone through most
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:41.000]  our akerns it's a real war let's go back to it meeting that donald trump jr had access to
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:46.600]  the wiki glicks i remember and cnn was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.160]  james comey with a matter of hours was going to go into a congressional testimony and swear
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.880]  that donald trump had missed characterized their private meeting about whether he was subject to
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:27:00.360]  problems it doesn't make sense though because it was all fault cnn has argued that others should
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.560]  lose their voice should be silenced because they're quote conspiracy theorists but you're listing
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:10.360]  conspiracy theories that they have promulgated on their air yeah and they're also arguing that
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:16.360]  their type of behavior should not be subject to public scrutiny being only the own trump's good
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.960]  protocol manners politeness and that's what trump's argument is it's not the content it's not the
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:27.320]  prejudice it's not the unprofessionalism in the past it's this particular time you went over the
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:32.360]  edge and you disrupted you were rude you took over an optional press conference nothing in the
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.680]  constitution that says he has to have a press conference i can remember president regency
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:42.680]  and i can't hear you and when somebody yells to donald trump he runs over and talks so it's not
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.640]  only hypocritical on their fact but it's a it's a journalistic organization that has violated
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:53.320]  the ethos of reporting in general journalism then calling the kettle black and saying you can't do
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:58.520]  this this is against white house and now it's a it's a shame yeah to see a buffoon elevated to
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:02.760]  do understatus but look now that cnn's on the side of free speech i'm sure they'll be advocating
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:07.000]  for the right of all people to see what they think they could have sued in 2013 on the behalf of
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:15.080]  fox and the ap picture davis hanson a man with a long memory man that is the smartest show on
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:20.040]  television you look at cnn and msnbc it's just talking points then carlson just has all these
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:30.040]  super smart people on then he has left us on and they can hardly talk and they just lie lie lie
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:37.480]  there is no caravan there is no soros involved there is no there is no we're gonna come back

[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.280]  cover in the russia thing we have to but it's all a bunch of bs our whole audience knows we're not
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:09.960]  involved with the russians other than you get a bunch of them arrested in the 80s we know hillary's
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:15.640]  the culprit we know miller is but new developments here bombshell info that they knew they were uh
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:21.320]  your muller and his prosecutors hillary's personal attack dog i mean this is ridiculous and now
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:26.120]  trump's gone off the chain i've got his quotes here we'll get into some of those then we'll go to
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:30.520]  phone calls but he's saying that they're interrogating screaming at people acting like criminals trying
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.400]  to make them lie and saying this is destroying our country which it is when all this comes out to not
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:40.520]  be true we need to see these people getting some trouble robert moeller he needs his time in the
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:46.840]  barrel well alex you're absolutely right it's almost as if the president has been reading the
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:54.040]  coverage of what's been going on with me and of course dr jerry coursey yesterday i released
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:39:01.400]  a substantial number of text exchanges with randy credeco which proved beyond any dispute that he
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:08.040]  was indeed my source who told me about the explosive nature of the wiki links disclosures
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:15.960]  that julien assange himself had announced in june on cnn of 2016 and who told me that they would come
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:22.600]  in october and then when they didn't come on october 6 second told me to be patient they were
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:29.800]  coming in a few days and they did he also reveals in these text messages that his source was not
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:37.320]  julien assange but a woman lawyer who worked for julien assange thus his defense that he couldn't
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:43.400]  have been my source in june because he didn't meet and interview assange until late august is irrelevant
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:49.720]  uh in other words to put it another way alex it appears to me that randy credeco perjured himself
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:56.280]  before the moeller grand jury will he be held responsible for lying under oath let's hope so
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:00.680]  well i don't have any dog in the fight other than justice i just don't know
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:05.720]  why he told all these people this i knew you had the text messages a while back
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.640]  and why he would be doing this and why moeller would bring him in there when moeller has
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:14.440]  obviously been parallel constructing all this and was surveilling everyone before moeller
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:20.360]  already knows all this isn't true so why in the hell did he do this it's kind of like that old bob
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:27.800]  dillon lied the order i think mr mother gave his staff is everybody must get stoned exactly look i'm
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:34.760]  a target because i supported down for president because i appear regularly on info wars because
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:40.520]  i help you bring people the truth and because i was effective in helping defeat hillary clinton
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:46.440]  by writing the book the clinton's war on women available at the info wars dot com store because
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:53.000]  i co-produced the uh the documentary the danie williams story banished the the danie williams story
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.400]  well sure and and and get me roger stone was pretty powerful documentary was a huge hit on
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:03.000]  net ledge that was like waving a red cape in a bull's face yeah so now they're saying get
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:08.760]  roger stone as opposed to get me roger stone look i know it grows tedious it's tedious for me too
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:13.720]  but there is no evidence whatsoever that i knew in advance about the source or kind of we all know
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:18.760]  that we know that the reason i've got you on is what's the word do they say it's going to be over
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:23.960]  in a few days or maybe it's going to keep going forever i mean how long is this idiocy going to
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.440]  continue so we can obviously move on to the fake congressional investigations they're about to have
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:34.760]  it's very hard to know alex i mean that for me this has been over two years of my life having
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:41.880]  the federal government and robert moeller and his band of cutthroats digging into every microscopic
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.720]  detail detail of my private life questioning people over and over again what about roger stone's
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:53.160]  relationship with alex jones how often does roger stone talk to alex jones you think roger
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:58.840]  stone passed any of the wiki leaks material on to alex jones i never even had the material to
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:05.000]  pass on but they're looking at every aspect of my life my family life my social life my personal
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:11.880]  life my business so let's bring this up i mean i think trump here's the deal what when we learned
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:17.160]  from the grand jury that hillary's top attack dog that literally helped cover up uranium one
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:24.280]  one materially is involved with the russians and is now the prosecutor this is like having hitler
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:29.960]  run a nuremberg trial i mean this is insane i've never heard of conflicts of interest material
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:35.880]  conflicts like this roger yeah it's extraordinarily political uh and as tyler nixon made the case
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:42.280]  it's an egregious actual conflict of interest having hillary's henchwoman run the investigation
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:49.240]  into roger stone the nemesis when she's involved with the russians i mean she literally is involved
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:54.360]  with hillary running all this with the russians it's insane in full war's life is launching

[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:25.960]  thursday i'm alex jones your host rodin shotgun here with me is roger stone from rower county
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:31.000]  florida he's gonna be able to get into election fraud and take your phone calls and that really is
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.080]  the big issue right now in my view at the latest on the caravan that harrison smith here as well
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:39.800]  he'll be going to the next hour with some box day joints us we're going to be looking at most shocking
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.960]  anti-white brainwashing going on in schools that you've ever seen that the left is going
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:50.520]  into pure race-based politics like they're the kkk or something they hold up pictures of white people
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:58.120]  they go oh they go why don't you like their white i mean this is america ladies and gentlemen
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:03.720]  this is true marxist liberation theology roger though putting bookends on this thing i was
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:07.160]  asking during the break you can repeat it what is it like them saying you're going to be indicted
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.840]  friday you know they've said that so many times last year meanwhile trump tears in the muller
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:17.160]  investigation calls russia probe absolutely nuts talks about all the criminal things they've done
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:22.520]  and then there's this hillary's henchwoman heads miller's probe of stone and then she's involved
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:29.720]  with the losses for racketeering with her foundation with uranium one i mean this this lady is involved
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:37.720]  in all of this and then now so is muller it's clear they they chose the russia thing to cover for
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:42.520]  themselves because it would be so insane that people that did it are the ones accusing you of it
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:47.240]  this is like beyond any movie you've ever heard of truth is stranger than fiction so
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:53.000]  something closing on that roger well alex it's it's part of the psychological game they try to
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:59.400]  play virtually every friday they will have a reporter call me or my lawyer usually from cnn saying
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:04.920]  do you think it's this weekend that you'll be arrested uh it's designed to unsettle you and
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:10.200]  upset your weekend i of course never take it terribly seriously because i know i've committed
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:16.120]  no crime in connection with the 26th election 16 election could they frame me for some process
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:22.360]  crime yeah i guess so but if they do i will plead not guilty and i will fight because i'm being
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:28.200]  targeted because i'm on info wars i'm being targeted because i supported donald from i'm being
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:33.560]  targeted because i opposed hillary clinton and i was quite effective at it so uh this is payback
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:40.120]  for 40 years of beating liberal democrats at the polls and nothing more and that's the next issue
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:44.760]  harrison smith we're not just saying they're stealing it's famous counties that steal
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:50.440]  the illegal ballots they admit just keep coming in they get caught admit a bunch of them are totally
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:55.560]  provisional and fake you have women like running with bags and hiding acting totally suspiciously
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:00.760]  and then putting walls up so you can't see it and you've got all the races going for democrats
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:05.880]  magically where republicans barely win and then suddenly famous counties for corruption
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:10.680]  hold things open for weeks break all the laws and then magically the democrats are winning
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:15.720]  very powerful michael schneider article in full wars dot com post-election blue wave democrats
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:22.040]  have flipped two senate seats and a large number of house seats since election night we need to get
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:27.000]  this fixed this is the real emergency here well i mean just look at brinda snipes why was she ever
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.080]  allowed to continue after 2016 when she was caught uh illegally destroying ballots why is she still
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:38.920]  in charge of anything let alone uh you know walking free she's messing with the elections this is
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:44.200]  she was famous in 2000 for this crap and and and now she says she's gonna ride off on the sunset
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:48.840]  after this one well look they're trying to undermine the one outlet that is legitimate
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:54.280]  outward they want us they want to degrade our uh belief in the voting system they want people to
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:59.800]  believe that they have no choice but to rebel and cause violence and chaos and riot and all of this
[02:50:59.800 --> 02:51:04.440]  stuff because the one outlet we still have is our ability to vote if they steal that from us if they
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:10.520]  degrade our confidence in that then uh you know we have no other opportunity or no other option
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:15.000]  but uh you know absolutely now we've got chuckie schumer and obama saying everyone should be able
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.600]  to vote if you're in the country you should be able to vote roger i want to go to some calls
[02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:23.240]  on this subject and others about what trump needs to do uh here in just a moment but just
[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:28.920]  you're in rower county supposedly today's the last day of the recount or whatever uh chuckie schumer
[02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:33.960]  saying oh don't worry you know uh we're gonna get that governorship we're gonna get the senate
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:40.200]  we're gonna get everything just the arrogance of these monsters you know alex you've been on radio
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:46.600]  a long time have you ever heard anybody who sounds less sincere than chuck schumer who sounds
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:53.240]  swarmier and phonier than chuck schumer it's really something to behold uh look i actually
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:57.560]  think that the republicans will hold on to the governorship here in florida because i think
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:02.760]  former congressman ronda santis's margin is too great to overcome even with the shenanigans in
[02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:08.760]  brower county that means within 10 seconds of his taking his hand off the bible he will fire
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:13.960]  renda snipes which the previous governor the current governor should have done four months ago
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:19.480]  when i called for it based on her involvement with voter fraud two years ago and in the most
[02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:26.280]  recent republican congressional primaries so uh you weep what you so had this woman been removed
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:31.800]  when we called for it here on info wars you wouldn't have this quagmire going on in florida
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:37.960]  meanwhile uh republican observers are not allowed to observe the recount in brower county a violation
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:44.280]  of florida's state sunshine law uh and uh they are continuing to count votes that have been
[02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:49.800]  disallowed that have already been declared illegal by the election board so you have widespread
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:55.400]  election fraud going on in this one county uh whether or not rick scott can hold on to a
[02:52:55.400 --> 02:53:01.480]  sentencing is an open question i do think we'll hold on to the governorship uh and i'm i'm very
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:07.160]  concerned about the uh race force commissioner of agriculture only because the candidates in
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:13.240]  that race are both thoroughbreds with a great future well the republicans shouldn't concede in
[02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:17.400]  arizona they shouldn't concede on any of these we have real fraud here and they should stop
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:23.320]  conceding let's go to matt in texas on florida election fraud matt you're on the air with myself
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:29.880]  roger stone and of course uh harrison smith go ahead hey alec hey all three y'all roger and harrison
[02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:35.160]  hey harrison uh i was with harrison and oh and the other night we were just talking about this
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:42.040]  uh i was asking them that everybody else was holding their breath on the uh the florida results
[02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:49.240]  as as i was and uh and and the numbers were off and of course it's broward county it always comes
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:53.480]  down to what it's it's like the roger was saying that night when we you know when we were even like
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:58.120]  wanting us i'm really surprised they conceded they always steal it when they're close and then
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:02.520]  they were just waiting knowing we were watching until they did a fake concession and then went
[02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:10.200]  and started stuffing absolutely and it's like i can only it's it's like the movie indiana
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:15.240]  jones where they open the tomb and they know where the ark is and and he throws the torch down
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:19.480]  onto the floor there's a bunch of snakes and the guy says why is the floor moving indeed
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:25.640]  and it snakes why did it have to be snakes that's exactly what's going on so we're coming up on
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:33.800]  on the witching hour here uh i think we're we're probably within an hour but i guess uh as it nears
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:40.360]  so we'll figure it out um but uh um it'll be interesting to see what they're pull off like
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:45.480]  i mean i guarantee you they're not finding republican ballots oh no they she's been caught
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:50.520]  putting provisionals and well they were all for democrats and they weren't real votes but it's okay
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:56.360]  it's okay she's on video oh no big deal exactly and what's with the medical glow we're we're
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:01.800]  turning this broad into a medical scheme now well they just do that to act like it's like
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:07.320]  something scientific they're doing i appreciate you calling in good points uh roger again
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:15.080]  hillary and i said this a week ago matt gate said two days ago this is a test run for 2020
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:18.760]  now hillary's saying oh i may run because she sees the republicans bending over
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:23.880]  her with a big giant green light to let american voting rights be gang raped
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:29.880]  in all honesty let's take arizona for example if i were the republican majority i would not
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:34.920]  allow the seating of this elected senator and i would challenge those those uh those results
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:40.200]  in the state courts in arizona and i we have the majority we can decide who is seated i believe
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:46.200]  that election is fraudulent and until the courts rule otherwise i wouldn't see exactly arizona
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:51.000]  i mean they want to play hardball let's play hardball it's about time but look this is very
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.920]  clear the democrats say count every vote the republicans say count every legal vote you see
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:00.760]  the difference and let's be clear you went in there and and and again i don't like to work
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:05.640]  to be a bush al gore i hate even more but you were there you helped take it away from them
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:09.800]  when they were trying to steal it before in broward county you went in there and kicked their ass
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:15.240]  and that's what we need is some freaking wavos here man well that's exactly true we prevented
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:21.080]  the democrats in miami dead county from counting the same chief of ballots for the third time
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:26.360]  we didn't shut down the recount that's false we stopped them from recounting the same ballots
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:31.320]  the third time by taking them to a an area that was private where there was no observers from the
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:36.200]  media or the republican party where they could tamper with them in violation of the state's
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:43.240]  sunshine laws so the brooks brothers riot was an act of civic action to to uh to support the
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:49.320]  state's sunshine law and stop them from stealing that's the truth that the mainstream media
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:54.040]  doesn't like to tell you we're going to jam a few more calls and when we come back here and then
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:58.120]  after roger leaves i'm going to continue with calls vox day is going to be here we have at the
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:03.400]  start of the next hour the most insane race-based brainwashing going on uh we're going to show you
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:09.160]  the shocking video uh coming up uh in the next hour as well we'll look at the eu uh brexit
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:14.360]  they're stealing the vote of three years ago paul watson is in parliament right now he's part of
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.840]  ukeb you know he'll be calling in or we'll have him on tomorrow with the latest but this is amazing
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:23.960]  it's all about ignoring the popular vote it's all about ignoring the people wanting to be sovereign
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:28.040]  but they can steal it a few times but you know that'll only wake folks up and make them that much
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:32.360]  more angry so don't give up they're stealing they're having to steal in front of everybody

[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:32.360]  antifa style people or antifa leaning people well if you have a box of roosters and worms
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:37.720]  and you take the roosters out of that box by force the worms are going to look around and
[03:00:37.720 --> 03:00:42.680]  see only other worms and think they're winning this is what happened on twitter and facebook
[03:00:42.680 --> 03:00:48.680]  when they banned conservatives everyone going into twitter saw nothing but liberals and thought oh
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:53.960]  well the whole world must be liberal so that swings people's decisions in certain ways because
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:58.760]  if they never hear from our side they're never going to have all the information and that's why
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:02.760]  they're trying to ban and eradicate proud boys because proud boys goes out and defends women
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:06.600]  and children being attacked kicks the ass and the little professors that want to beat up women and
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:14.200]  children and so now they still won't show up and still proud boys is still showing up amen okay my

[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:44.920]  after the election the department of homeland security is going to have a report on election fraud
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:51.080]  showing foreign interference now the definition of foreign interference is largely illegal aliens

[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:29.640]  want to comment i mean trump's got to get serious he's got to sort of dress in the nation he's got
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:33.800]  to admit democrats aren't americans they say you can't be a nationalist they fundamentally hate the
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:38.760]  country we have to admit this is a outside invasion force not just the illegals but the democrats
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:43.880]  themselves we have to go after this illegitimate election uh he has to start indicting uh the
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:49.800]  the the the democratic leadership these are criminals i mean that's what his duty is we're at war
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:56.600]  with an outside force what do we do well the single most important thing he can do is to ensure uh
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:02.600]  free and full access to an unfettered internet i mean in all honesty if we don't have the ability
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:10.360]  to communicate then we cannot possibly win in any realm that's why our project right trump.com
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:15.400]  which by the way is really moving along in which we are trying to collect right here at info wars
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:22.200]  one million individual letters to the president demanding that he order the uh justice department
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:30.280]  to take antitrust action to stop the mon monopolistic racketeering pro uh practices of the big tech

[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:41.640]  jerome and marco and everybody when we come back though the most shocking racist brainwashing
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:49.000]  of children by leftist basically a communist girl scout group funded by the left wait till you see
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:54.120]  what they're teaching young minority children the globalists know that if they suppress the
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:58.920]  good halogen and pump the environment from the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:05.720]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:11.640]  and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[03:05:11.640 --> 03:05:16.200]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply
[03:05:16.200 --> 03:05:22.040]  of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:27.880]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:33.080]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the
[03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:39.160]  research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:45.400]  super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:51.240]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at enforce live.com
[03:06:00.200 --> 03:06:06.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:15.640]  front lines of the influence well vox today the best-selling author of sjw is always lying sjw
[03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:23.080]  is always doubled down and he's a very popular successful rebel comic book company owner and
[03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:27.080]  that's where the real fight for the minds of our young people is going on he's been riding
[03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:30.520]  shotgun with us here just a few minutes he'll be with us for the rest of the segment uh
[03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:36.440]  harrison smith and we've got your calls coming up too on the election stealing on brexit being
[03:06:36.440 --> 03:06:41.800]  stolen uh on what should trump do next we're all going to have this discussion fast moving
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:47.320]  uh here in the third hour today then in the fourth hour doug hagman always informative
[03:06:47.320 --> 03:06:51.800]  the hagman report will be host of the fourth hour but right now harrison smith you did a
[03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:56.520]  report on the shesh tater in the war room it's up on info wars dot com tell people what they're
[03:06:56.520 --> 03:07:01.560]  about to see well you're about to see a video called the radical cram school it's a video series
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:06.040]  that's documenting sort of the reaction of this like communist girl scout group it's by a comedian
[03:07:06.040 --> 03:07:11.400]  but this is not a satire this is them indoctrinating kids in real time you see their real reactions
[03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:17.800]  and as outrageous as it is as this is you it's not far off from what's being taught in our schools
[03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:23.240]  everywhere and so just so this is reeducation camp stuff like hillary said we need camps for
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:27.080]  you know conservatives and adults to make them you know learn that they get you in these groups
[03:07:27.080 --> 03:07:31.480]  or they introduce these horrible ideas this is what's cnn saying white people are inherently bad
[03:07:31.480 --> 03:07:37.480]  uh the west is inherently bad having a nation is evil uh every other country for other people
[03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:42.600]  but you know nothing for americans so so this is this is them completely rolling out the culture
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:47.400]  war that the democrats talked about in wiki leach oh yeah no this is nazi level indoctrination
[03:07:47.400 --> 03:07:52.040]  and this is without hyperbole the most racist video i've ever seen in my entire well they do
[03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:56.040]  is they they do things like hold up a harvey weinstein so he's been demonized for other people
[03:07:56.040 --> 03:08:00.600]  go well they'll agree he's bad he's a serial sex abuser but for the kids they don't like him
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:05.000]  because he's a white man oh you and but it's okay because they're asian kids and black kids
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:10.360]  so it's so avant-garde and so cool and again even most minorities aren't races like this this is
[03:08:10.360 --> 03:08:16.200]  the globalist literally trying to create total division here's part of the sickening youtube series
[03:08:17.080 --> 03:08:23.080]  welcome to radical cram school we're going to learn about social justice revolution and how
[03:08:23.080 --> 03:08:34.280]  to be powerful in the bodies that you have hello my young comrades hi i'm going to show picture this
[03:08:34.280 --> 03:08:41.240]  is my way of figuring out if you've been tainted by the patriarchy patriarchy what oh who's that
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:47.240]  who do you think it is creepy it looks creepy why there's just like this thing about white people
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:57.240]  that just makes me feel this is real we're going to get vox days taken on in a moment what is the
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:02.200]  new board member who's also an asian woman there at the new york times said whites are inherently
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:08.360]  evil goblin creatures that live in the holes she can't wait till we're all extinct and this is kind
[03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:12.920]  of the new ruling class it's gonna be like asian women that are leftist but then harvard says
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:16.520]  they've got too many asians and asians are bad so again they want to divide every group against
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:23.320]  each other this is truly sickening continue like right there in a pool and i'm just like walking
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:27.240]  into the pool and they just give me the death stare that i'm just like so this guy with that's
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:30.920]  an important thing well we back up in a second yeah they're they're teaching children to act weird
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:34.360]  and creepy when you see a white person yeah then that person's going to think you're looking at me
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:39.720]  weird which creates that confirmation thing where these kids really think white people are inherently
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:43.320]  bad right i mean this is this is like a cute little seven-year-old asian girl she's back
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:47.480]  it up 15 seconds she's never gotten a death stare because she's asian she lives in america
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:51.880]  she's never gotten that what she has gotten is constant indoctrination telling her white people
[03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:55.960]  hate you white people think you're gross so then when she sees maybe a facial expression maybe someone
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:10:00.840]  looks at her you know anything like that they're putting massive chips on her shoulder yeah exactly
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:05.080]  exactly yeah and it's right there you can see that it's her natural if you go to asia all the
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:09.000]  different asian groups hate each other china's killed 115 million of its own people but no
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:14.280]  discussion that it's all how the big open christian society is bad well but we've got to go to our
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.440]  guests here but i'll get this take but just let's let's try to not respond too much go ahead and roll
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:23.880]  it okay they're like right there and a pool and i'm just like walking into the pool and they just
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:30.280]  give me the death stare that i'm just like so this guy was in the pool you would moonwalk out
[03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:36.280]  does he look like a good guy or a bad guy bad guy who who do we think this is make a guess oh
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:46.760]  jumbledore jumbledore who's he married to who's your guest kate harry
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:56.760]  uh he's darnell dust what do we know about him what do we know about him he's bad he's bad
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.360]  he's a president i want to fire him imagine this is a group of white kids being shown
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:06.360]  black people how do we feel about this wall it is blocking opportunity for people that don't live in
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:11.000]  america to come here for a better opportunity and that part's pretty poignant too they've been loaded
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:17.240]  with these yeah exactly my dad came here and my mom came here too they pause again my dad my mom
[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:21.320]  are good yeah this country let you in and now you're an american which hates america and has
[03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:25.480]  been taught that we're trying to block opportunities from you which are being taught everything belongs
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:32.120]  to them for the communist takeover continue my dad came here and my mom came here too they came here
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:38.040]  from where cambodia oh wow we pause where where where the communists killed almost everybody
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:41.720]  chimera is killing fields yep but now you've been turned into heading the country that saved you
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:45.560]  okay let's continue that they came from all the way to cambodia and this is what they get to look
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:55.000]  it on the tv show hello kitty what is she missing where's her mouth her mouth why doesn't she have
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:00.520]  a mouth the people who created her if you didn't want asian girls um it just speaks up about their
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:07.320]  to speak up about who they were very profound very very profound so they're rewarded for repeating
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:13.320]  the mantras and the platitudes and this goes on to the colleges the high schools they're teaching
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:16.760]  your kids that you're not a boy you're not a girl this is total abuse this is a criminal
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:20.920]  psychological warfare takeover it's absolutely child abuse it's absolutely and and you'll notice that
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:29.080]  you know oh that's really it grandpa meanwhile it was communism you know killed her grandparents
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:34.120]  in cambodia but it's okay ah yeah what are you gonna say well uh you heard that other girl when
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:38.520]  they uh when when they said what do you think about the wall and she said uh it stops people
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:42.840]  from enjoying the opportunities of america it's like i don't think it was rehearsed i think this is
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:47.560]  just the mantra this is the you know uh indoctrination the platitudes that they're taught if you
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:52.120]  sure don't they're they were indoctrinated at home right and mama's watching msnbc all piss
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:56.360]  god the whites are out to get me this country so freaking horrible yeah he's becoming this even though
[03:12:56.360 --> 03:13:03.640]  i flood that let's go to box day box i tell you this is so far gone that if the left of the globalist
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:09.080]  win it's making whites become racially based it's destroying the egalitarian contract and whites
[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:14.200]  will have to form white homelands so this this is the absolute attempted destruction of the country
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:25.320]  box well yeah it's been baked in the cake since 1965 um when you look at the opening of the united
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:32.440]  states to the rest of the world and the the change of the immigration laws and naturalization laws
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:40.680]  this was the inevitable outcome you know this is what the norm for most of the rest of the world
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:47.800]  is and has always been exactly they're all racially or culturally based and they all whether they're
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:52.840]  asian or whatever kill the group that isn't in their tribe and so we are christians we bring
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:57.720]  people in and think oh you'll be like us but the left comes in and goes no we're gonna program them
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:03.320]  to go back to what they came from which will be a winning strategy yeah no i mean look at
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:06.760]  just the beginning of that they're literally holding up pictures of jewish people and having
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:12.760]  all the kids go you gross look i mean that's literal nazi and that was exactly very sickeningly
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:17.880]  done box this is next level well there's no question and what i think was particularly
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:25.000]  interesting about it and it's something that i think that those who are focused on the left right
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:34.600]  dichotomy and the white black dichotomy tend to miss is that there is absolutely a jewish asian
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:42.360]  rivalry in general and a jewish-chinese rivalry in specific that is beginning to play out
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:47.800]  in the united states and canada if you look at the lawsuit that is taking place
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:54.920]  against harvard if you look at what is beginning to take place in both the video game and the
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:15:05.000]  movie industry what you see is uh chinese money coming in and competing with uh the the traditional
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:12.840]  jewish money interests while at the same time there are that there's a pretty intense rivalry
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:17.880]  going on for the limited number of places at the ivy league universities stop right there
[03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:22.520]  this is why vox day is so smart and and and you are as well harrison i was told this 10
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:27.800]  50 years ago high-level hollywood and now it's coming out but it's in the chinese news
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:33.480]  they kind of carry the hitlerian idea that jews run everything and they see that as the rival
[03:15:33.480 --> 03:15:38.200]  group they're targeting and now you're even seeing it in a group of young asians being brainwashed this
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:43.480]  is so sophisticated this is the real stuff folks you're getting it this is not the whole pop thing
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:48.840]  you see or the cool ultra right wing thing hating jews this is what's really going on we'll be right
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:56.760]  back hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:03.880]  and what they don't steal will be destroyed this year resolve not to be the next victim of a break
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:09.480]  in go to fake tv dot com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching

[03:20:16.760 --> 03:20:20.440]  told the truth and done the right things to have the establishment give us this designation
[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:24.920]  we are the most demonized the most lied about the most hated group because with our guests and the

[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:41.640]  competing groups that want the general public to be totally unaware of this and the fact that the
[03:20:41.640 --> 03:20:46.040]  globalists have decided to bring down the west now vox you got us some intriguing things you
[03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:55.000]  should there vox day joins us again you can go to voxday.blogspot.com and vox versity on youtube
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:00.120]  and he's got alt hero the comic book company that we sell his great comic books that sell off
[03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:06.200]  and sell out constantly when they come in alt hero we'll cover that more and take some calls
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:11.400]  coming up the next segments but vox getting into everybody thinks about america is the only place
[03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:16.920]  in the world but there's seven plus billion people outside of this and the real rivalries and the
[03:21:16.920 --> 03:21:23.720]  real tribalism that goes on and you were getting into china and its rivalry with with uh planetary
[03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:29.000]  and their word jewelry and all the rest of this so from your deep research what's really going on
[03:21:31.080 --> 03:21:40.360]  well the west is in decline the west has been in decline more or less since the early 20th century
[03:21:40.360 --> 03:21:48.680]  and so this is a topic of a great deal of concern from the leaders of the west
[03:21:49.560 --> 03:21:56.280]  this is also a great deal of concern to the various tribes and nations outside the west
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:03.640]  because some of them see this as an opportunity and they see it as a a way to exercise their
[03:22:03.640 --> 03:22:11.160]  national ambitions others see it as something to fear because they have perhaps been defended
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:18.680]  by the dominance of the west and so it's happened so subtly that a lot of people
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:26.120]  don't even recognize that it's happened but the united states is no longer a global superpower
[03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:34.200]  you know even during the cold war the united states had more ability to effectively intervene
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:42.120]  around the world than it does now but we've now reached a point where uh china is a regional power
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:46.520]  that is stronger in its region than the united states and by the way the pentagon put a report
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:51.880]  out yesterday saying just this that we're no longer the dominant force yeah i mean they're
[03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:56.440]  acknowledging what those of us who have been paying attention to this for the last 20 years
[03:22:56.440 --> 03:23:03.560]  already knew you know um the late jerry pornell created an excellent science fiction series it was
[03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:10.920]  part um it was part fiction and part real he would get you know leading uh military thinkers to
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:16.120]  contribute actual articles and then you'd have short stories that would sort of illustrate them
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:22.280]  it was called it's called there will be war and we published uh he published nine of them we revived
[03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:28.920]  the series and he and i put out volume 10 and we're planning to continue the series in his honor
[03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:36.520]  with volume 11 but when you look at the way that the military balance changed over time you can even
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:46.120]  see in the late eighties how the uh balance of power was beginning to shift and so now the united
[03:23:46.120 --> 03:23:55.640]  states is not only not the global superpower but it's not even a power equivalent to what it used to
[03:23:55.640 --> 03:24:01.320]  be around the after the end of world war two and let's be clear we could have been the total power
[03:24:01.320 --> 03:24:05.880]  and we promoted freedom and strength it didn't sell out but it was parlayed into a global order
[03:24:05.880 --> 03:24:10.120]  for corporations to try to have some type of dominance into the future but really they've
[03:24:10.120 --> 03:24:15.720]  just handed power to the communist chinese uh and others and i want your view on this but expanding
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:23.160]  on that if you pull back and you look at it when china gets dominance which the cfr has been planning
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:30.760]  as we just showed on screen by 2030 that means we acquiesce to their regulations their censorship
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:35.000]  and we see big tech already doing it so it just doesn't mean that we're not the dominant power it
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:41.160]  means the best part of the west freedom private property all of it it's it's gone it's going to
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:46.600]  be gone it's going to be hellish and i see trump trying to stomp the brakes on this and i just see
[03:24:46.600 --> 03:24:51.800]  the psychically poisoned population basically begging for their own destruction it's very very
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:25:00.120]  sad box well i think that you need to keep in mind that the globalists are not as in control
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:05.560]  as we sometimes imagine them to be i totally agree kessinger says they're always trying to
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:13.800]  control and get power out of a new order well not only that but to a certain extent they have
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:19.960]  that they're riding a tiger and you know when when you put yourself at the front of the parade
[03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:26.600]  and you're riding on the back of a tiger uh it looks really impressive but that doesn't mean
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:31.160]  that the parade is necessarily following you and it doesn't mean that the tiger isn't going to eat
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:43.480]  you i agree and so i think that china in particular is a very very dangerous uh game for the globalists
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:49.000]  of the west to be trying they should have never allowed it to have all of our energy and power i
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.800]  mean they set it up well well well give me your view then on how they set it up and said chinese
[03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:57.720]  century coming and did all this and then of course they thought they had seats at the table
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:01.080]  i think the tiger's already thrown them off or the dragon's already thrown them off
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:09.240]  yeah i think that that if you look at the way they were totally focused on trying to
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:16.120]  break the dominance of the christian west yes and so that's why you've seen this this centuries
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:25.400]  long assault on christianity and so it's very common when you have a dominant and powerful enemy
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:32.120]  to not really pay too much attention to whoever you have to team up with in order to defeat them
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:41.240]  and so i think that to the to the uh globalists who wanted to overturn the the western order the
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:47.960]  christian european order they were thinking well you know the chinese they're just you know they're
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:53.800]  they're uh communists or atheists they're not europeans um you know we can we can handle them
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:59.320]  because you got to keep in mind as powerful as china looks to us today you know china was
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:06.120]  prostate before the european powers tens of millions of years broken up by european powers
[03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:11.240]  for hundreds of years in colonial sectors uh no running water in 98 percent of the country
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:16.120]  just 60 years ago exactly and and and so there was such a spiritual obsession with dominating the
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:20.120]  power of the west by the globalists taking it over that even though they'd already taken it over
[03:27:20.120 --> 03:27:25.400]  they still had to spike their own weapon and some dumb ritual of their power and then they just
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:32.200]  destroyed the main engine they had well exactly and i think that the biggest mistake that they made
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:38.360]  and i i think this is very typical um i think the biggest mistake that they made was one of
[03:27:38.360 --> 03:27:44.520]  arrogance they thought well we're just so much smarter than everyone else but what what people
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:50.920]  have never realized is that the the chinese have a very high level of average intelligence
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:28:01.160]  you know they they are a very smart people and simply uh being able to access the information
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:09.480]  base of the west was really all they needed in order to catch up very rapidly and so and
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:13.880]  we're very easy to buy off now because we're not christian anymore and really have no values
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:19.480]  other than hating america so the left is taylor made to help merge with the chai comms and destroy
[03:28:19.480 --> 03:28:28.040]  their own families well not only that but the west has been really weakened and and yeah uh
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:34.280]  just to understand you know i've i've been a uh civic nationalist myself you know for many years
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:41.720]  um we all are to a certain extent and that puts all of the peoples of the west in a weaker position
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:49.000]  when you compare it to the very uh highly tribalistic uh nations that are coming out of the east
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  oh that's right let's talk about that when we come back pain in my neck back and shoulders has

[03:32:03.960 --> 03:32:08.840]  quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through two
[03:32:08.840 --> 03:32:14.680]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist
[03:32:14.680 --> 03:32:19.720]  tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent
[03:32:19.720 --> 03:32:25.080]  iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that
[03:32:25.080 --> 03:32:30.040]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[03:32:30.840 --> 03:32:35.080]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[03:32:35.080 --> 03:32:41.560]  compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it even more
[03:32:42.280 --> 03:32:47.160]  bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[03:32:47.160 --> 03:33:03.080]  discovery x3 now available at enforce life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:06.600 --> 03:33:14.440]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[03:33:14.440 --> 03:33:20.040]  war you know box day is a really smart guy and he doesn't do a lot of other interviews so i'm glad
[03:33:20.040 --> 03:33:26.600]  he comes on with us and i've read a lot of what the globalist right and i've read a lot of what the
[03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:31.400]  communist chinese right i've read a lot with the russians right and there really is this weird
[03:33:31.400 --> 03:33:38.120]  leftist anti christian system because that was the old dominant system was christianity in the
[03:33:38.120 --> 03:33:43.080]  west where they just are always at war with that when that's a system that creates wealth and
[03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:51.560]  innovation and success so they're destroying the very system that actually let the occultist and
[03:33:52.360 --> 03:33:57.560]  the weirdos everybody do what they want but now they want control over speech they want control
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:03.080]  of everything they want their own weird authoritarianism it's all diametrically opposed to christianity
[03:34:03.080 --> 03:34:08.280]  it's really satanism and then meanwhile here come the chai comms who won't let any of their leftist
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:13.720]  propaganda and any of it who kill gays who you know everything and they're just marching in
[03:34:13.720 --> 03:34:20.120]  buying up hollywood buying up the debt buying up control of everything and this clash is coming
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:25.160]  this clash is expanding and the chai comms are allied with the authoritarian e you
[03:34:25.160 --> 03:34:30.520]  we've seen the big briggs at betrayal vox is in europe uh so vox big picture then these different
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:34.840]  power structures get into the most important points you want to make to people because
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:42.520]  folks understand we tune into cnbc or msnbc or abc you're getting politically total dribble
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:47.160]  that has nothing to do with anything except confusing people and sabotaging culture they
[03:34:47.160 --> 03:34:51.880]  admit their own documents and then it's so frustrating to to read what the actual controllers
[03:34:51.880 --> 03:34:58.200]  say as you do as i do to know the reality that no one should be for this not even anti christian
[03:34:58.200 --> 03:35:04.840]  you know crazies but they still just don't care because they have been raised into this cult
[03:35:04.840 --> 03:35:11.240]  of heading the west so how do you see all this unfolding well you first asked me to give my
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:21.080]  advice and so my advice is to let go of your assumptions all the assumptions that you have
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:28.680]  about how people should behave and start looking at how people actually do behave
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:37.080]  you know especially those of us on the right we tend to have a very romanticized view of
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:44.120]  enlightenment ideals uh american revolutionary ideals the constitution etc and that's fine
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:52.440]  you know that that's ideals exist for a reason but where you make a mistake and where you get
[03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:58.520]  into danger is where you start submitting or start substituting your ideals for reality
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:06.840]  and so what we are beginning to see is that a lot of the ideas and the ideals that
[03:36:06.840 --> 03:36:14.520]  that we in the christian west believed were universal are not in fact valued by most of the
[03:36:14.520 --> 03:36:23.880]  rest of the globe and so we also need to recognize that we don't make the rules anymore the game
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:30.680]  that we're playing has different rules than the rules that applied when the west was completely
[03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:37.640]  in charge and so that's going to be a very difficult process and maybe an impossible one for people of
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:43.560]  our generation you know for the average person of our generation um you know our assumption has
[03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:49.640]  always been that well nobody would want to do something that stupid because everyone would
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:56.840]  be worse off everyone would be more poor but if you look at what the big tech companies have done
[03:36:56.840 --> 03:37:03.960]  to you if you look at what uh the companies like facebook and twitter and paypal are doing
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:11.960]  they have essentially transformed the digital economy into a third world economy and what
[03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:19.400]  i mean by that is they have created an economy where contracts don't exist uh reliability
[03:37:19.400 --> 03:37:25.640]  does not exist accountability does not exist you have to simply you don't know one day to the next
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:33.320]  whether you're going to be able to buy something or pay something uh you know that that is literally
[03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:38.760]  the description of a third world country a third world economy you know hernando de soto the
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:44.760]  economist has won a number of awards for pointing out that one reason why the third world is so poor
[03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:52.840]  is because they have no contract law and there is no reliability to business transactions and that
[03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:58.600]  is what we have created with the internet economy now and it's it's not just a third world model
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:05.080]  they're going to a third world authoritarian uh almost uh strong man rule or or you know after
[03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:09.800]  the fall of the roman empire when it just became emperors where the left from any time it wants to
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:15.400]  now can just punish whoever it wants along ideological lines which creates an echo chamber
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:20.280]  in the left to make them even more extreme more bullying and more out of control and the slippery
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:24.360]  slope just in six months there's been more censorship and more harassment and more deep
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:29.480]  platforming and more removal of people's right to commerce than we saw in the last hundred years
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:36.040]  combined so we're going down the slope now and if and if we could you know stop it punish them pull
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:41.720]  back engage in economic warfare against the chinese at this point uh and cut them off at their legs
[03:38:41.720 --> 03:38:47.720]  we we could have some chance to parlay in the future but instead the majority of our people
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:51.960]  either don't care or actually have been trained like baby ducks who've imprinted on globalist
[03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:56.600]  propaganda to hate their own mother and father and those that take care of them they literally
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:03.800]  want to cut their own heads off despite their face yeah there's a a cartoon that expresses it very
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:11.640]  well where there's a individual sitting on the branch of a tree and he's he's high up off the
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:16.520]  ground and he's busily sawing at the branch of the tree because he hates the branch of the tree
[03:39:16.520 --> 03:39:23.560]  but he doesn't realize that he's gonna fall down as soon as he finishes cutting through it and that's
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:31.320]  the position that the left is in but the problem that that we face on the right is that we cannot
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:37.640]  and will not be able to convince them that cutting off the branch is a bad idea they don't believe us
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:44.200]  and they wouldn't be on the left if they actually had the capability of
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:51.960]  accepting logic and being able to correctly anticipate the consequences of their actions
[03:39:52.680 --> 03:40:01.080]  and so uh you know a lot of people describe me as being you know this far right extremist whatever
[03:40:02.120 --> 03:40:09.080]  but the reality is i'm simply watching what's happening comparing it to what's happened in the
[03:40:09.080 --> 03:40:16.040]  past and making and just observing the obvious you know the the things that i'm talking about are
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:21.640]  not things that i want to happen they're things that are happening and are going to happen well
[03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:26.360]  sure take the like the globalists left they think they're going to ally with radical islam
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:30.440]  into the future and dominate the world when radical islam is going to slip their throat so fast
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:37.320]  it'll make their head spin well that's you know that's one bizarre thing another bizarre thing is
[03:40:37.320 --> 03:40:44.200]  you see writers like uh david spangler um he calls it or he called himself spangler his name is david
[03:40:44.200 --> 03:40:51.000]  golbert actually and you know he's constantly writing about this amazing respect that the
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:59.400]  chinese have for the jews and every time i read his article i think david they see you as their main
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:05.640]  rival you know they're not they're not going to team up with you against the united states
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:12.520]  it's they're going their whole goal is to is to dominate both parties and so you know it just
[03:41:12.520 --> 03:41:19.000]  it boggles my mind that so many people somehow think that they're going to finesse and maneuver
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:26.120]  their way around these massive historical forces and these these great nations that have survived
[03:41:26.120 --> 03:41:35.480]  for millennia is there any path out of this is there any way to reach a brainwash left
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:39.000]  just to stop sabotaging their own nest is there any way to get through to them
[03:41:40.680 --> 03:41:47.560]  i don't believe so and let me explain my justification for saying this i was interviewed
[03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:55.720]  by the largest comics uh site um about two weeks ago two or three weeks ago
[03:41:56.920 --> 03:42:04.520]  and they wrote a seven it was a 17 000 word interview where they went into incredible
[03:42:04.520 --> 03:42:10.120]  detail mostly because they wanted to inoculate themselves against being accused of somehow
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:14.680]  sympathizing with me so basically they would ask a question i would answer it and then they would
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:20.440]  explain that why they disagreed with it so it's very long and one of the things that we disagreed
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:27.320]  about was i said that there's no way to negotiate or compromise with the sjw's with the with the
[03:42:27.320 --> 03:42:35.240]  radical left and this this poor editor um he said no i think you're wrong i think you know you know
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:43.320]  we can talk like this if we can talk everybody can talk and so forth so the article ran and the next
[03:42:43.320 --> 03:42:47.800]  day the article ran next day we'll recap this straight ahead and i meant to go to calls i
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:52.120]  apologize we're out of time we're gonna come back more vox day this is riveting living in volcano
[03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:57.960]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:42:57.960 --> 03:43:02.920]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash
[03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:09.240]  and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[03:43:09.240 --> 03:43:15.880]  ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:43:15.880 --> 03:43:21.800]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:28.440]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only
[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:34.360]  were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:41.000]  as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:47.640]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[03:43:47.640 --> 03:43:53.560]  water filtration system will purify it please whatever you do realize that we're all getting
[03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:58.600]  punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 twitter accounts they say affiliated with info wars
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:02.520]  yes some of them are like little side accounts they even know we had like info were stored that
[03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:07.640]  just showed our products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that i beat a trump
[03:44:07.640 --> 03:44:12.040]  rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us your excitement about america your
[03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:15.800]  excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:21.000]  but the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:27.720]  the future i want to be troublesome and pesky i want to keep going i want to make them do the
[03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:33.400]  ultimate not just destroy us financially i want to push all the way i've committed to do that i've
[03:44:33.400 --> 03:44:38.040]  prayed for that and i've been told that's going to happen but you've got a back ash and i promise
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:44.120]  you this i will never falter i will never waver at the spiritual level i physically will but i give

[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:19.800]  we're getting into all these subjects we carry all the hard copies of the great comic books that
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:23.880]  are very politically incorrect they're not even really that hardcore but that's why they're so
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:29.160]  triggering but they're very well done and we carry the first four in the series some new ones are
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:33.880]  coming out they sell out very very quickly but we do have more in stock he's got a new book coming
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:37.640]  out next week in the digital copy we'll be carrying it as soon as it's a hard copy and that's
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:43.160]  geordian netics a journey into the mind of humanity's greatest thinker you know they claim he got
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:47.640]  censored at his university for saying that there are men and women and no other genders i think the
[03:47:47.640 --> 03:47:52.840]  guy sounds pretty smart on many levels but then i noticed that they never censoring and they push
[03:47:52.840 --> 03:47:58.200]  him and they promote him and then you know he said oh alex jones they better more they could
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:03.400]  choose censoring him but i but then i also see his little cohort people that run with him working
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:07.320]  with him you know really not saying a word about the censorship and going along with all this i
[03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:12.440]  have no heart on for you know in a bad way for you know geordian peterson but i i i do think it's
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:18.360]  important to see the system really embracing him it's kind of like peter joseph that's a fake name
[03:48:19.320 --> 03:48:24.040]  with the whole zeitgeist movement that we were told was the you know second coming of christ
[03:48:24.040 --> 03:48:27.800]  and the u n having him at meetings and all this and there's gonna be a magic computer that puts you
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:32.920]  in a plastic sports stadium and there'll be no more money but the technocrats will run everything
[03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:36.360]  well that's what the globalists want that's what michael bloomberg wants and that guy said
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:42.600]  you'll be sent to a reeducation camp he talks in a voice like this alex i'll come back on if you
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:49.880]  apologize i never said it'd be sent to a reeducation camp though he did say it on air so i mean i do see
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:55.880]  when something's being pushed kind of like the q movement was being pushed and said that you know
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:59.880]  stay with the plan sessions is great i'll never be fired and then oh but i'm a fed i'm gonna be
[03:48:59.880 --> 03:49:05.160]  arrested i mean i talked to high level folks as high as you can go they they they couldn't stand
[03:49:05.160 --> 03:49:12.360]  sessions what was going on but oh magic q magic show i mean there is a q smell to to uh
[03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:16.360]  jordan peterson's let's let's spend a few minutes on that and then back into big picture and where
[03:49:16.360 --> 03:49:24.280]  do you think trumps going well i think that uh the book might change your mind about jordan peterson
[03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:33.000]  in fact uh as we speak uh he is at the 42nd annual european meeting of the trilateral commission
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:40.440]  and so if you want to talk about globalists uh jordan peterson is essentially constructing
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:48.120]  their new religion their post christian ethic and so uh that's what the book delves into
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:53.640]  well no no i mean i understand the establishment like seem and and i understand that he's enticing
[03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:59.000]  conservatives and nationals right now with one construct but you're saying he's someone else
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:03.720]  entirely so and i believe you and i see evidence of that quantify why you're saying
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:07.960]  he's so dangerous being set up is there a new timothy larry or their new super guru
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:12.680]  and i can't wait to read the book i mean quantify and i am aware he is at the trilateral meeting
[03:50:12.680 --> 03:50:24.200]  right now yeah jordan peterson's primary goal is to save the human race by ending war and he has
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:31.640]  decided that the cause for war is group identity so therefore the way that you stop war and bring
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:38.680]  peace is to eliminate all group identity and bind everyone together well that's the exact
[03:50:38.680 --> 03:50:42.840]  globalist plan but then he attacks all these fake identity politics groups that are left
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:49.000]  us that makes us think he's our ally but really all the identities must go precisely he's a gate
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:56.520]  keeper he's like ben Shapiro if you notice ever since william f buckley the right keeps being
[03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:08.520]  offered these opinion leaders whose sympathies are at least partially in line with the globalists
[03:51:08.520 --> 03:51:16.200]  and so that's why you know you log into youtube and it constantly throws jordan peterson and
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:22.520]  ben Shapiro videos even though you've never you've never watched one i mean you know i i log on to
[03:51:22.520 --> 03:51:29.640]  youtube and it's got ben Shapiro this jordan peterson that you know i only watch you oh and
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:37.160]  benjamin and and uh stefan molyneux and mike cernovich and yet their videos are never ever
[03:51:37.160 --> 03:51:44.040]  recommended to me so we know who's being pushed and what i wanted to do with jordan edex and what
[03:51:44.040 --> 03:51:51.720]  i i believe that we've done is you know simply show exactly what it is that he's talking about
[03:51:51.720 --> 03:51:58.200]  and what it is that he's advocating because he hides his real message under this word salad
[03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:03.000]  that is very very difficult for the average individual to penetrate i'll tell you this he
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:10.440]  does have that super arrogance of the left and that just super ego thing i mean i could sit here
[03:52:10.440 --> 03:52:16.920]  into the show and put on those mannerisms and meet the whole time and you can see when someone
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:22.680]  is just like trying to project and i and i only see the type of behavior from bad actors generally
[03:52:23.800 --> 03:52:31.720]  well you can't fully understand jordan peterson unless you see this 1977 article from an edmonton
[03:52:31.720 --> 03:52:42.200]  newspaper and he's he's 14 years old and he's he has this incredibly punchable expression on his face
[03:52:42.200 --> 03:52:49.800]  and the headline is i won't be happy until i'm elected prime minister and so this is somebody
[03:52:49.800 --> 03:53:00.520]  who is pathologically ambitious and yet pretends to be uh post ideological not interested in
[03:53:00.520 --> 03:53:07.960]  politics above it all very yeah there it is you know and the amazing thing is he came within 13
[03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:15.160]  votes of being elected the vice president of the regional party so this is a highly highly
[03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:21.720]  political highly ambitious guy he's actually the equivalent of the really annoying person
[03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:28.040]  on your student body that's what i'm saying is he has he has that spirit of people lusting for power
[03:53:28.040 --> 03:53:33.800]  arm precisely and so he fits in so i didn't even know that about him in the 14-year-old
[03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:38.600]  Illinois so you can tell obviously for that position there's been grooming going on behind
[03:53:38.600 --> 03:53:44.680]  the scenes and notice how he just explodes onto the scene like like taking fours it took
[03:53:45.720 --> 03:53:50.280]  15 years to get it to a big level and all these other you know people that took all this time
[03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:56.520]  this is suddenly just boom and he's supposedly anti-establishment but then he's not well the
[03:53:56.520 --> 03:54:02.200]  thing that's kind of funny is that uh peterson's been trying to sell out most of his life he just
[03:54:02.200 --> 03:54:11.320]  couldn't find any takers until recently um so you know if if you are a fan of jordan peterson or if
[03:54:11.320 --> 03:54:16.200]  you're close to someone who's a fan of jordan peterson i would highly recommend that you
[03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:21.640]  read jordan edX we're going to put it on kindle unlimited and everything just to make sure that
[03:54:21.640 --> 03:54:29.320]  that as many people can get access to it as possible um but you know you can't possibly
[03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:37.400]  understand how crazy the guy is and how crazy his ideas are until you actually
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:44.040]  read them for yourself no i get it like like like any cult group or or any political system
[03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:48.360]  you're coming up it puts out something that's the outer area that's telling you it's about
[03:54:48.360 --> 03:54:53.000]  once it gets you lured in and i've i've certainly seen that but but as you said i know when
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:56.760]  something's being force fed and i know when something's being blocked they're fighting
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:55:01.080]  around the clock to try to block us they're totally trying to block all the guys you also named
[03:55:01.880 --> 03:55:06.280]  and that's because we're not conforming to this and and that's really the big guide i mean look
[03:55:06.280 --> 03:55:11.960]  any killing on crap was being force fed everywhere uh so i mean now look where that went
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:20.440]  well yeah i think i mean i think a lot of us wanted to believe that that q was correct
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:26.520]  and we wanted to believe that there was uh that that trump was going to do actually do something
[03:55:26.520 --> 03:55:32.680]  as opposed to you know constantly threaten and bluster and then in the end not necessarily
[03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:38.200]  deliver like for example today uh the headline and drudge was talking about how uh you know
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:44.600]  trump says he can throw out the entire press corps well okay great but um go ahead and do it
[03:55:45.160 --> 03:55:52.120]  you know just go ahead and don't don't argue this stuff you know take exercise the power
[03:55:53.480 --> 03:56:00.440]  exactly because the all the posture i mean don't get me wrong donald trump is a great president
[03:56:00.440 --> 03:56:05.480]  donald he's a great guy absolutely he's he's facing such aggressive criminality from the
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:11.160]  globalist he's got to really take the gloves off exactly and i think that that that's difficult
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:16.840]  for somebody who is by nature a negotiator and exactly and he keeps thinking hey this is good
[03:56:16.840 --> 03:56:20.200]  for everybody why would you want to sell america out like you said at the start of the show this
[03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:24.200]  doesn't make sense we have the power we could parlay it to something better they're like no
[03:56:24.200 --> 03:56:28.840]  we we we are a spirit we want to mount america's head on the wall we hate you too because you're
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:34.040]  strong and smart and and and actually negotiate and are chivalrous we aren't chivalrous we are
[03:56:34.040 --> 03:56:40.440]  scumbags we are part of the chicken crap dimension and we're here to f everyone over well that's why
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:45.560]  i keep telling people you need to play by whatever the rules of the game are you know i'm a gamer
[03:56:46.120 --> 03:56:50.520]  so that's second so that means we've all got to become election officials and pick big counties
[03:56:50.520 --> 03:56:54.200]  that we control and then absolutely you steal the election because that's what the democrats say
[03:56:55.160 --> 03:56:59.320]  if that's what the rules are then play by the rules it's not a difficult concept that the
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:05.000]  important thing is to stop claiming that you know the only correct way to play football
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:09.320]  is to run the ball and we can't use this unfair technique called the forward pass
[03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:13.960]  you know can you imagine no no i agree they work in the social contract doesn't mean we're
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:17.560]  gonna now do what they do but we're in a new ball game and that's what i've been saying it's like
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:23.160]  these people are in now in total criminal mode we've got a serious situation in our hands box
[03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:28.440]  day thanks for all the time amazing come back anytime we can get you congratulations on everything
