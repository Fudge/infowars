[00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.231]  We're good to go.
[00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.120]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.962]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:47.606]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.547]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:51.688]  Who won the president?
[00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:29.490]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:51.368]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Monday, November 19th, 2018 Global Transmission.
[00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:56.390]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and you will get next year's news today here.
[00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:11.236]  As we speak, there in the control room, printing off news articles from a year ago, and two months ago, and about a week ago, when I said that Facebook's collapse will signal the new digital dark age coming in,
[00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:20.771]  Where the globalists are going to then terrorize these companies into going under full deep state control and the merger with the shy comps.
[00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:26.176]  And that if Trump doesn't get ahead of this curve, we're going to lose it all.
[00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:29.800]  I predicted that I would be totally deplatformed as the beta test.
[00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:35.033]  To make the debate about Alex Jones being taken off and not everyone else.
[00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:51.722]  Now, they've got top professors, top globalist operatives, all over the news in elite publications like Wired Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, the New York Times, today, saying the takedown of Jones is only the beginning.
[00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:54.424]  We're taking everyone down.
[00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:58.386]  And we're taking them down by the time the Democrats take office in the House.
[00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.876]  In two months, in January.
[00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:04.078]  January 20th.
[00:03:04.078 --> 00:03:11.244]  And they have got incredible graphics and wired of me being basically grabbed by hand and drug into the darkness.
[00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:18.030]  Like I'm being thrown in the back of a van, a snatch and grab operation.
[00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.854]  This is real authoritarian behavior.
[00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:22.534]  And who wrote it?
[00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:25.417]  An authoritarian out of Turkey, now working in
[00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:27.668]  U.S.
[00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:37.475]  so-called academia in that special group countering Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:40.157]  So these people are here.
[00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:42.098]  They've brought in foreign operatives.
[00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:44.580]  They've even hired former Stasi.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.023]  Google's even moving into the former Stasi headquarters in East Germany.
[00:03:49.023 --> 00:03:51.965]  You cannot make this up!
[00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.189]  Unbelievable.
[00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:07.152]  You know, I was going to tell them when I mentioned this, showing me being thrown in the back of a van, a snatch and grab, to get Scanner Darkly to show a clip of that from Fiction.
[00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:09.973]  And I didn't tell them to do it, but great minds think alike.
[00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:11.694]  Great job to the crew in there doing that.
[00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.874]  If you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this, you're hearing it.
[00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:17.316]  I'll go over all of it today.
[00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:18.496]  This is the next big move.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.276]  It's been announced.
[00:04:19.276 --> 00:04:23.698]  And we can sit here like idiots and let them do it, or we can call the White House, call Congress, call Talk Radio.
[00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:24.598]  You can make a big noise.
[00:04:25.763 --> 00:04:26.764]  We can stop this.
[00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:28.025]  They want me off the air.
[00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:29.626]  They want us curtailed back to nothing.
[00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.708]  They thought I'd already give up.
[00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:32.228]  Give up?
[00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:36.852]  I've only begun to fight.
[00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:40.094]  While you're looking at my ship on fire, you might turn around and look at yours.
[00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:42.616]  It's going under the water right now.
[00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:47.340]  And over the horizon, new fleets are on their way, flying my flag.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.021]  Your flag.
[00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:51.303]  The blood red flag of 1776 worldwide.
[00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:55.086]  I'm Alex Jones, and we are the resistance.
[00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:07.350]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.212]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:16.256]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:23.181]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:29.486]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:36.412]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:50.575]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:54.816]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:54.816 --> 00:06:02.838]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:06.819]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:20.985]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:29.492]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:51.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this 7-19th day of November 2018.
[00:06:51.410 --> 00:07:00.157]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:13.247]  And let me just now tell you what's on the plate and then beg you to stay tuned and beg you to take notes and beg you to take action because we have the absolute, total,
[00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:25.849]  Complete battle plan of the globalists to take down the West, to take down our prosperity, to take our free speech, to take your pension funds, to take control of your life, your children, everything.
[00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:30.711]  And it's all coming up here today.
[00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:39.615]  I'm going to air Paul Joseph Watson's blistering report dealing with the race brainwashing of children
[00:07:40.706 --> 00:07:49.754]  via YouTube programs put on by the left, but understand this is actually what's shown in the public schools.
[00:07:49.754 --> 00:07:55.199]  This is the actual training that is going on.
[00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.342]  We covered some of this Friday, but Paul's done a bigger report on it.
[00:07:58.342 --> 00:08:00.264]  Kids brainwashed to hate white people.
[00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:05.982]  It's up on Infowars.com and I suggest everyone get this out to everybody you know.
[00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:11.265]  There's another even more devastating report that I mentioned yesterday that I'm going to get to.
[00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:26.533]  A 22 page report out of the Daily Mail where they are taking mentally retarded children in the UK, it's happening here too, and telling them you're transgendered so they can then basically sterilize them.
[00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:32.442]  But let's go to Paul Joseph Watson's report, where they're also teaching these little girls this as well.
[00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:38.147]  And just understand, this is the most hardcore Marxist brainwashing you can get.
[00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:40.789]  This is how you create weathermen terrorists.
[00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.010]  Here it is.
[00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.332]  Welcome to Radical Cram School.
[00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:47.194]  We're going to learn about social justice revolution.
[00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:50.157]  Hello, my young comrades.
[00:08:50.157 --> 00:08:50.197]  Hi!
[00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:59.031]  Just when you thought we'd run out of cancer, along comes a fresh supply.
[00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:02.094]  Now to be clear, I'm not being mean to these kids.
[00:09:02.094 --> 00:09:03.475]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:05.517]  They're victims of brainwashing.
[00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:10.942]  They've obviously been coached on what to say by either their parents, Christina Wong, or both.
[00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:12.463]  I'm gonna show a picture.
[00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:15.466]  This is my way of figuring out if you've been tainted by the patriarchy.
[00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:16.667]  Patriarchy?
[00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:17.167]  What?
[00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:18.728]  Oh!
[00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:19.029]  I knew that!
[00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:20.290]  Who do you think it is?
[00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.991]  It's Harvey Weinstein!
[00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:27.215]  Because inside every white man there's a serial rapist just fighting to get out, right?
[00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:29.517]  All these white rape gangs everywhere.
[00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:31.278]  It's an epidemic!
[00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:32.739]  Wait, it gets worse.
[00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:43.347]  There's just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel like... I'm like right there in a pool and I'm just like walking into the pool and they just give me the death stare and then I'm just like...
[00:09:43.867 --> 00:09:44.348]  What?
[00:09:44.348 --> 00:09:53.654]  There's just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel... What kind of parent would teach their child to be afraid of a person based on their skin color?
[00:09:53.654 --> 00:09:57.777]  What kind of person could possibly do such a thing?
[00:09:57.777 --> 00:09:59.258]  Oh yeah, a racist!
[00:09:59.258 --> 00:10:04.722]  So in a class for teaching kids that racism is bad, you're actually teaching them to be racist?
[00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:05.722]  Genius!
[00:10:05.722 --> 00:10:07.203]  Hello Kitty!
[00:10:07.203 --> 00:10:09.385]  It is Hello Kitty, what is she missing?
[00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:11.126]  Imagine being such a pathetic f***ing
[00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:26.810]  snowflake that you think hello kitty not having a mouth is some vast racist sexist conspiracy her mouth why doesn't she have a mouth the people who created her didn't want asian girls um to speak up about their who they are to speak up about who they were
[00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.430]  Very profound.
[00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.431]  Very profound.
[00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:31.672]  Yeah, you obviously just told her to say that.
[00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:32.832]  Very profound.
[00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:36.853]  The person who designed Hello Kitty is an Asian woman.
[00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:40.094]  She explained why it was designed without a mouth years ago.
[00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:43.135]  It's got nothing to do with silencing Asian women.
[00:10:43.135 --> 00:10:44.396]  Again, the designer
[00:10:45.308 --> 00:10:46.209]  Is an Asian woman.
[00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:48.751]  I mean Hello Kitty doesn't have feet either.
[00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.415]  Is that a racist throwback to Asian women having bound feet?
[00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:56.438]  Or is it just a harmless design feature and you're a hysterical moron?
[00:10:56.438 --> 00:10:58.100]  I'm guessing it's the latter.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.040]  Very profound.
[00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:04.760]  What do we know about him?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:13.704]  What do we know about him?
[00:11:13.704 --> 00:11:14.445]  He's bad!
[00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:17.926]  How do we feel about this wall?
[00:11:17.926 --> 00:11:24.309]  It is blocking opportunity for people that don't live in America to come here for a better opportunity.
[00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:27.811]  And we all came at some point from some other place.
[00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:29.732]  Yeah, so let me teach you something.
[00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:40.399]  If you don't have any borders and you allow everyone from some other place to come to America, it stops being like America and starts being like some other place.
[00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:45.021]  Meaning the opportunities afforded to all those who came legally disappear.
[00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:48.243]  My daddy came here and my mom came here too.
[00:11:48.243 --> 00:11:48.964]  They came here from where?
[00:11:49.464 --> 00:11:50.405]  Cambodia.
[00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.125]  Oh, wow.
[00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:56.007]  What do you think they think that they came from all the way to Cambodia and this is what they get to look at on the TV screen all the time?
[00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:58.929]  Right, because I'm sure they'd prefer to look at something else.
[00:11:58.929 --> 00:11:59.649]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:09.414]  Maybe the 23,000 mass graves containing the bodies of 1.3 million Cambodians who were all slaughtered as a result of a left-wing government genocide.
[00:12:13.228 --> 00:12:17.050]  Now that I think of it, Christina and Pol Pot have similar tastes in headwear.
[00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:27.595]  Oh yeah, and after Cambodia's communist regime got done killing a quarter of its own population, the United States accepted 158,000 Cambodian refugees.
[00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:29.556]  You know, because it's so racist and all.
[00:12:29.556 --> 00:12:30.897]  What does gender fluid mean?
[00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:33.258]  Like, you can be any gender you want to be.
[00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:36.219]  You're not a boy, you're not just a boy, you're just a girl.
[00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:36.680]  Yeah.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.981]  Does anybody know anyone who's gender non-binary?
[00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:40.652]  El?
[00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:42.874]  I am gender fluid.
[00:12:42.874 --> 00:12:43.814]  You're gender fluid?
[00:12:43.814 --> 00:12:44.475]  Yeah.
[00:12:44.475 --> 00:12:45.515]  That's a wonderful thing.
[00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.456]  Yeah, sounds more like child abuse to me.
[00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:54.881]  I have friends in the pool and I was telling them that I wanted to be a boy or girl.
[00:12:54.881 --> 00:13:00.124]  And one of my friends said I can't because I was born as a girl and God made you as a girl.
[00:13:00.124 --> 00:13:02.826]  What does a six-year-old know about anything?
[00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:06.708]  Yet you're imposing sexuality and your warped ideas about gender.
[00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:08.569]  On a six-year-old?
[00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:10.131]  That's just creepy!
[00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:11.091]  Stop!
[00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:14.534]  I have lived in America my whole life!
[00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:18.717]  This is a case of structural racism.
[00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:19.938]  Say it with me.
[00:13:19.938 --> 00:13:22.200]  Structural racism!
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.681]  Structural racism.
[00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:32.388]  So structural, it gives non-white people giant public corporate-sponsored media platforms to endlessly lecture white people about how evil they are.
[00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:35.571]  When Danny the Bully was calling Hannah Rochelle Ching Chong true,
[00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:39.834]  No it didn't.
[00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:45.017]  So that kind of suggests that America is nowhere near as racist as you relentlessly claim it to be.
[00:13:45.017 --> 00:13:48.079]  White women earn 75% of what white men earn.
[00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:49.620]  Why do they get to earn more?
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.404]  Because they work longer hours and when that factor is eliminated the gender wage gap virtually disappears.
[00:13:55.404 --> 00:13:58.106]  That's what we would have to do to get a full cookie is form a union.
[00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:00.368]  No, you just have to work the same hours.
[00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:06.252]  Because in most evil white western countries, gender employment discrimination is illegal.
[00:14:06.252 --> 00:14:09.055]  So what are the few things that fathers have to think about?
[00:14:09.055 --> 00:14:11.156]  Well, baby, rest.
[00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:15.980]  Resting, yeah.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.142]  Now I'm not calling Christina Wong a c**t.
[00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:24.910]  But she did literally dress up as a vagina before proceeding to reel off politically correct statements.
[00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.333]  Always ask what someone's preferred gender pronoun is.
[00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:31.474]  And called it comedy.
[00:14:31.474 --> 00:14:32.315]  Yeah, really.
[00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:35.818]  My aging vagina does have the power to end racism.
[00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:38.420]  I'm gonna have sex with the entire state of Alabama now!
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.101]  Weird flex, but okay.
[00:14:40.101 --> 00:14:46.349]  Believe it or not, according to Salon.com, that video was one of the funniest political comedy moments of 2014.
[00:14:46.349 --> 00:14:49.572]  Yeah, I had funnier bowel movements in 2014.
[00:14:49.572 --> 00:14:53.196]  But then again, Salon's number one political comedy moment of 2014.
[00:14:53.837 --> 00:14:58.280]  It was a stand-up show about white people in the United States becoming a minority.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.982]  Because racism is so hilarious!
[00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:01.983]  Here's the point.
[00:15:01.983 --> 00:15:04.605]  This is just some crappy YouTube web series.
[00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:05.145]  Oof!
[00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:06.826]  Look at that ratio!
[00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:08.167]  Comments disabled!
[00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:10.909]  But wait, I thought people being silenced was a bad thing.
[00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.311]  Except when they're trying to criticize you!
[00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:14.092]  Imagine that!
[00:15:14.092 --> 00:15:16.133]  So it's just a crappy YouTube web series.
[00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:21.817]  But schools and colleges across the West are already imposing elements of this on your kids.
[00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:22.758]  This is what they want.
[00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:29.141]  Your children brainwashed, indoctrinated, and turned into NPCs.
[00:15:29.141 --> 00:15:30.702]  Orange man.
[00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:32.683]  Bad.
[00:15:32.683 --> 00:15:34.784]  Teaching hatred to fight hatred.
[00:15:34.784 --> 00:15:37.325]  Teaching racism to fight racism.
[00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:48.010]  There's just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel... Using kids as political weapons to amplify racist regressive lies that foster more division and more bigotry.
[00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.992]  Yet another perfect illustration of why everyone should homeschool.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.602]  We'll be right back with a live global transmission.
[00:15:57.602 --> 00:15:58.803]  Hear that?
[00:15:58.803 --> 00:16:04.186]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:04.186 --> 00:16:07.088]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:10.670]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:18.235]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:19.516]  Security is a mindset.
[00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:22.826]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[00:16:22.826 --> 00:16:25.254]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:32.128]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:32.128 --> 00:16:38.011]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:38.011 --> 00:16:44.514]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:16:44.514 --> 00:16:48.577]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:17:58.032 --> 00:18:01.637]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:03.399]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:14.693]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:15.454 --> 00:18:24.625]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:35.158]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:35.678 --> 00:18:38.300]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.021]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:50.029]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:52.670]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.374]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.852]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.453]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:19:05.453 --> 00:19:06.093]  It's a good thing.
[00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:09.694]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:19:09.694 --> 00:19:12.075]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:19:12.075 --> 00:19:13.576]  I learned what the best was.
[00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:18.718]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:19:18.718 --> 00:19:19.218]  It's amazing.
[00:19:19.418 --> 00:19:22.001]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:19:22.001 --> 00:19:28.847]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:19:28.847 --> 00:19:30.509]  He has a glut of them.
[00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.791]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:33.692]  When it's discounted usually $200, it's $127!
[00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:43.039]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making twenty-something bucks on them.
[00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.161]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:19:45.161 --> 00:19:47.483]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:48.084]  It's amazing.
[00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:54.149]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:56.231]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:22.876]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.876 --> 00:20:26.722]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[00:20:26.722 --> 00:20:28.865]  I work from 9 to 5.
[00:20:28.865 --> 00:20:29.947]  Hell, I pay the price.
[00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:49.731]  It is November 19, 2018 on this Monday Global Broadcast as we head into National Turkey Day, Thanksgiving.
[00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:59.759]  Celebrating the original successful mission to begin the development of this continent by our illustrious ancestors.
[00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:14.206]  Let's do this in this segment, because when I'm about to cover something so momentous, I have trouble getting into it, because I want to be calm about it, but I also want to cover all the facets.
[00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:20.550]  It'd be much easier if I just told the audience what's happening and what I believe is going to happen next.
[00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:25.232]  And a lot of folks do pay attention, because they know that I know what I'm talking about on most issues.
[00:21:25.232 --> 00:21:28.734]  Establishments certainly ain't paying attention, that's why they don't want me to be able to reach new people.
[00:21:29.477 --> 00:21:33.378]  That's where you come in, carrying the football down the field, by word of mouth.
[00:21:33.378 --> 00:21:35.079]  When you take action, you're unstoppable.
[00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.260]  When you don't, we're done.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:53.406]  I was told, covering Bilderberg, in 2006, that the whole meeting was basically about, large portions of it, was about social media being the future of things.
[00:21:54.497 --> 00:21:59.141]  And then the next year, we covered it in Istanbul, and Zuckerberg was there.
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:00.622]  We had a reporter there.
[00:22:00.622 --> 00:22:03.884]  Jim Tucker, rest in peace.
[00:22:03.884 --> 00:22:12.611]  And so, I heard a lot of this then, and Tucker's asked me on the phone when he gets back from Turkey, he goes, what do you know about them internets?
[00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:22.078]  They got this young whippersnapper, they think this thing will spy on everybody, so they'll be able to control all the elections with this thing, and that's what I got from the sources in there.
[00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:27.894]  Only guy with more of a gravelly voice than me was old Jim, smoking those filterless Paul Mahls.
[00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:32.958]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:37.020]  That's at Voderberg, a few years later.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.344]  And, maybe a radio listener, they're putting images up on TV.
[00:22:42.344 --> 00:22:43.725]  To the TV viewers.
[00:22:43.725 --> 00:22:53.371]  And, now in hindsight, and now with what we know, and now what Steve Pachinick said a year ago, and two months ago here on air, and what we've broken down, we know
[00:22:55.009 --> 00:23:00.491]  What's going to happen to Facebook and we know what that's going to trigger.
[00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:06.014]  Now obviously if people would have listened to us a couple years ago, you'd have made a lot of money in the stock market knowing this.
[00:23:06.014 --> 00:23:08.134]  But people always remember that we were right later.
[00:23:08.134 --> 00:23:21.200]  Because we actually go crawl around the ground and sneak into buildings and get thrown off and get arrested and Jim Tucker's been shot at.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.941]  So the system is doing everything it can
[00:23:24.784 --> 00:23:26.585]  To keep you from getting this information.
[00:23:26.585 --> 00:23:31.468]  Because the average political talk is nothing but a distraction.
[00:23:31.468 --> 00:23:34.770]  It's nothing but a diversion.
[00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.051]  From the real things going on in the world.
[00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:42.675]  I mean, people will look at Jim Acosta clearly pushing the woman's arm down, jerking the mic back from her, and he says, I didn't touch her.
[00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:45.396]  It's meant just to create a debate about, did he touch her or not?
[00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:51.560]  And while we're debating whether he touched her or not, and I can't help it because I'm in the middle of it, they're claiming we're lying.
[00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:54.807]  They give us offers we can't refuse.
[00:23:54.807 --> 00:24:02.411]  When they make it about us, almost all the time, we've got to respond or people will believe we actually lied.
[00:24:02.411 --> 00:24:15.058]  So while we're delayed fighting with the disinfo, the roadblocks they throw out there, the whole future's being stolen from us.
[00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:19.721]  So it's very frustrating to know what's going to happen.
[00:24:22.802 --> 00:24:27.783]  Don't know exactly when or exactly how, but we know in the main what's going down.
[00:24:27.783 --> 00:24:31.965]  Real accurate.
[00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:34.626]  The globalists hear this and they say, you gotta get that off the air.
[00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:38.647]  You gotta shut that down, whatever you do, or we're screwed.
[00:24:38.647 --> 00:24:47.329]  Everybody ought to go, oh, if this is what they want shut down so bad, maybe something's getting said here that's important.
[00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:49.550]  And I know most of you understand that, but folks,
[00:24:51.013 --> 00:24:55.995]  This isn't a thing now of where we write about Facebook.
[00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:58.516]  A lot of people say, good, I hope Facebook goes belly up.
[00:24:58.516 --> 00:24:59.836]  I hope.
[00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:01.397]  That's one dimensional thinking.
[00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:08.519]  Yes, I told you when they were first setting up Facebook, it was going to be a pump and dump.
[00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:15.762]  And we were sure of it then, like eight years ago, when Zuckerberg went again over in Germany.
[00:25:15.762 --> 00:25:18.623]  So we've been laying it all out for you here.
[00:25:20.197 --> 00:25:46.563]  But out of the collapse of Facebook and the reorganization of it is going to come the new rules of the internet and a global social score and draconian censorship and the web will now be a surveillance grid commanded by the new officer class, professors and corporate operatives who will oversee armies of bots, armies of censors,
[00:25:47.603 --> 00:25:52.944]  To shut down all thought they don't agree with.
[00:25:52.944 --> 00:26:04.006]  There's a Chinese gentleman running in New York for national office, presidency.
[00:26:04.006 --> 00:26:07.227]  He's already getting all this big hype, but he's just there to put these issues in.
[00:26:07.227 --> 00:26:10.127]  And he wants us to adopt the Chinese communist social score.
[00:26:10.127 --> 00:26:13.168]  Oh, but you'll be paid a thousand dollars a month to do it.
[00:26:13.168 --> 00:26:13.628]  Universal
[00:26:14.637 --> 00:26:16.978]  Income, which then is meant to control your whole life.
[00:26:16.978 --> 00:26:18.678]  It's called slavery.
[00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:22.720]  We surveil everything you do and you get a thousand dollars, you young idiots.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:30.363]  And they're just here, pitching it to all the young millenniums that want something free.
[00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:30.963]  That's named what?
[00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:33.264]  Andrew Yang.
[00:26:33.264 --> 00:26:35.044]  So, it's here.
[00:26:35.044 --> 00:26:36.385]  This is the invasion.
[00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:37.785]  This is the takeover.
[00:26:37.785 --> 00:26:41.887]  And Trump can win on jobs, and he can win on the economy, and he can do so many things.
[00:26:41.887 --> 00:26:42.707]  He can defend the border.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:50.245]  But if he doesn't stop the digital invasion and the digital usurpation and the takeover of the Internet, we'll lose everything.
[00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:58.911]  Because the Internet is the industry, it is the communications, it is the jobs, it is the whole system!
[00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:03.455]  And there are sickening articles in the New York Times and Wired Magazine and others today
[00:27:05.035 --> 00:27:13.699]  Salivating over how they're going to shut everybody's communications down and how they're going to shut nationalists and Christians and conservatives banking down when they're done.
[00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:16.220]  They're coming for you.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.841]  And there's no amount of submission that'll get you out of it.
[00:27:18.841 --> 00:27:22.162]  We're going to have to fight our way out of this one, folks.
[00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:24.723]  So get ready.
[00:27:24.723 --> 00:27:26.984]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to get into the nuts and bolts of this.
[00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:34.255]  Then we've got incredible SJW footage we're going to premiere here of our crew down at the border, showing the caravan invasion that they said didn't exist.
[00:27:34.255 --> 00:27:36.156]  And the local Antifa shows up.
[00:27:36.156 --> 00:27:39.478]  So we're going to show you this bleeped video, but it is unbelievable.
[00:27:39.478 --> 00:27:41.500]  No one's seen it yet.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.962]  Meanwhile, Mexicans agree with Trump, call migrant caravan an invasion.
[00:27:44.962 --> 00:27:46.984]  The mayor in Tijuana says they're a bunch of criminals.
[00:27:46.984 --> 00:27:49.125]  They're waving foreign flags.
[00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:50.426]  They're burning American flags.
[00:27:50.426 --> 00:27:53.929]  And Trump's like, they want to get in, and they're burning flags.
[00:27:55.006 --> 00:28:00.389]  And now the Mexicans are marching against the Hondurans because they know an invasion when they see one.
[00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:05.091]  They've got their heads screwed on straighter than the average dumbass American.
[00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:07.132]  Which is a real shame.
[00:28:07.132 --> 00:28:08.433]  So good for the Mexicans.
[00:28:08.433 --> 00:28:10.054]  It's all coming up.
[00:28:10.054 --> 00:28:12.115]  Now.
[00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:14.356]  And it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:14.356 --> 00:28:14.696]  Article.
[00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:15.556]  Mexicans agree with Trump.
[00:28:15.556 --> 00:28:16.817]  Call migrant caravan an invasion.
[00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:17.918]  Get this out there.
[00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:19.318]  I was at a barber shop this morning.
[00:28:19.318 --> 00:28:20.679]  I got to South Austin.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.662]  I have a blue-collar barbershop.
[00:28:23.662 --> 00:28:25.122]  Most of the folks work there are Hispanics.
[00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:27.464]  Get great haircuts, really nice people.
[00:28:27.464 --> 00:28:34.469]  And they don't really know who I am, but they're bringing up to me about, yeah, the Mexicans want them out, and they're burning American flags, and why are we letting these people in?
[00:28:34.469 --> 00:28:36.770]  And they're criminals.
[00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.152]  And those Mexicans, by the way, a lot of them are like 60-year-old guys.
[00:28:39.152 --> 00:28:41.793]  They were not virtually signaling at me, because they're Americans.
[00:28:41.793 --> 00:28:44.035]  They just have a Mexican background.
[00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:46.476]  So that's what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:47.357]  All right, when we come back,
[00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:50.085]  You want to know how Facebook's going to collapse?
[00:28:50.085 --> 00:28:51.629]  And how it's all going to play out?
[00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.230]  I'm going to tell you.
[00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.615]  You're going to hear the future when we come back.
[00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:59.647]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:28:59.647 --> 00:29:00.767]  Get back to nature.

[00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:30.556]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[00:29:30.556 --> 00:29:37.918]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:42.799]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:43.640]  There is.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.220]  It's RightSocial.net.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.580]  RightSocial.net.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.921]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.202]  RightSocial.net.
[00:29:51.202 --> 00:29:53.442]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[00:29:53.442 --> 00:29:54.783]  RightSocial.net.
[00:29:54.783 --> 00:29:56.023]  The right place to be.
[00:29:58.311 --> 00:30:02.535]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:30:02.535 --> 00:30:06.017]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:30:06.017 --> 00:30:07.799]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:11.201]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:17.847]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:30:17.847 --> 00:30:22.931]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:29.377]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:32.360]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.441]  I want to keep going.
[00:30:33.441 --> 00:30:37.285]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:39.307]  I want to push all the way.
[00:30:39.307 --> 00:30:40.588]  I've committed to do that.
[00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:43.331]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.753]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:49.894]  I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:30:49.894 --> 00:30:50.834]  I physically will.
[00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:57.995]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarStore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[00:30:57.995 --> 00:31:06.377]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:06.377 --> 00:31:07.837]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:07.837 --> 00:31:12.118]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:12.118 --> 00:31:15.619]  But thanks to super male vitality at InfoWarStore.com,
[00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:17.780]  I still have that energy.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:37.931]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:31:38.431 --> 00:31:42.094]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[00:31:42.094 --> 00:31:46.098]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[00:31:46.098 --> 00:31:51.082]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:31:51.082 --> 00:31:53.744]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[00:31:53.744 --> 00:31:56.627]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:57.893 --> 00:32:01.357]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:01.357 --> 00:32:05.142]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:05.142 --> 00:32:11.410]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.194]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:14.914 --> 00:32:18.718]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:18.718 --> 00:32:25.205]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:30.170]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:30.914 --> 00:32:34.837]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:34.837 --> 00:32:42.043]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:46.707]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:46.707 --> 00:32:52.952]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:52.952 --> 00:32:56.936]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:01.059 --> 00:33:20.724]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.724 --> 00:33:26.166]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[00:33:26.166 --> 00:33:28.166]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:30.047]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:33.417 --> 00:33:50.956]  Well, super-brain and super-model, Savannah Hernandez was out there with our intrepid cameraman, Brube, and I told him, I said, take the Action 7 mic flag, don't go to the border with an M4 Wars flag.
[00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:55.841]  But they're tough, they did it, insubordination, they'll probably get a bonus for it, for that insubordination, seriously.
[00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:04.877]  And we're going to play this coming up next segment because it dovetails with the Mexicans over the side of the border and their mayor saying, we've never seen such criminals.
[00:34:04.877 --> 00:34:12.583]  And that's what other Mexican towns said when these people are coming through by the tens of thousands, robbing, stealing, raping, smuggling kids.
[00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.624]  It's insane.
[00:34:13.624 --> 00:34:16.426]  The Mexicans are saying, get the hell out of here.
[00:34:16.426 --> 00:34:17.407]  This is out of control.
[00:34:17.407 --> 00:34:19.789]  Here's a little snippet of what's coming up with Savannah.
[00:34:21.454 --> 00:34:22.274]  What racist agenda?
[00:34:22.274 --> 00:34:23.335]  Look at my skin tone.
[00:34:23.335 --> 00:34:24.315]  Do you think I'm a ****?
[00:34:24.315 --> 00:34:30.438]  Dude, we just had a **** black guy over here come over and tell us he's hunting **** people and gave us a Nazi salute.
[00:34:30.438 --> 00:34:31.998]  You think **** color matters?
[00:34:31.998 --> 00:34:33.659]  You think your people aren't ****?
[00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:34.819]  Check it out.
[00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:40.481]  You guys are all, I'm standing here and I am trying to show everyone **** what's going on out here.
[00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:44.243]  You know what, **** this is an important issue to me as a **** Alex Jones.
[00:34:44.243 --> 00:34:46.624]  Because I **** have a bunch of **** members.
[00:34:46.624 --> 00:34:48.465]  Y'all are part of a racist organization.
[00:34:48.465 --> 00:34:49.465]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:34:50.074 --> 00:34:52.055]  Yeah, you're funded by George Soros, a real Nazi.
[00:34:52.055 --> 00:34:53.595]  You're the one spewing race.
[00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:57.197]  Why do you have to look like a meth head to be an Antifa?
[00:34:57.197 --> 00:35:17.245]  So we're going to be getting to this exchange coming up, and then tying it in with all the amazing footage that they got, but also local news, what Mexico is actually saying about tens of thousands of people, 80 plus percent military age men, engaging in all sorts of crime, attacking police, killing people, you name it.
[00:35:17.245 --> 00:35:18.065]  It's simply
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.461]  Crazy.
[00:35:20.461 --> 00:35:27.026]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:35:27.026 --> 00:35:29.048]  And I always have this quandary.
[00:35:29.048 --> 00:35:31.390]  Should I just get into all the proof?
[00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:35.593]  Or should I just get directly to what's about to happen?
[00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:45.162]  Or should I point out that we told you this was coming?
[00:35:45.162 --> 00:35:45.462]  Because
[00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:48.063]  This is bigger than Facebook.
[00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.604]  It's bigger than the economy.
[00:35:49.604 --> 00:35:53.925]  This is the next domino to fall to get our free speech.
[00:35:53.925 --> 00:36:04.188]  And you just saw how they were able to steal many of the elections because they totally shut down all their opposition, which became an in-kind donation to the Democrats by big tech.
[00:36:04.188 --> 00:36:08.950]  And you saw how that's now emboldened the Democrats to call for even more censorship.
[00:36:10.882 --> 00:36:12.043]  We're going to get to that.
[00:36:12.043 --> 00:36:14.625]  But how is Facebook going to go down?
[00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:17.848]  Why would the establishment do this to Facebook?
[00:36:17.848 --> 00:36:23.192]  Why were we able to predict the pump and dump you're about to see a long time ago?
[00:36:23.192 --> 00:36:25.534]  Because we watch the globalists, we study them.
[00:36:25.534 --> 00:36:33.521]  We also talk to insiders like Dr. Steve Pchenik, former head of Psychological Warfare Operations for a three-letter word agency.
[00:36:33.521 --> 00:36:38.065]  He doesn't like it when I say the name of the agency, even though it's in history books, which agency he's worked for.
[00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:40.909]  He'll be joining us to get into this as well.
[00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:43.130]  One of the founders of Delta Force.
[00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.710]  And let's just say he knows where a lot of the bodies are buried.
[00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:49.191]  So that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:50.431]  We'll continue with this discussion.
[00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:55.272]  So we're going to plunge into this here in just a moment.
[00:36:55.272 --> 00:37:05.934]  And then, at the start of the next hour, I'm going to specifically get into
[00:37:07.572 --> 00:37:16.675]  How the new censorship will be implemented and the phases it's going to be rolled out in until everyone realizes it wasn't just censorship of conservatives.
[00:37:16.675 --> 00:37:27.778]  It's a total social score of everything you're doing being surveilled in live time to then literally oppress and control everyone.
[00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:35.621]  No amount of submission is going to be enough because this is a post-industrial economy killing form of siege
[00:37:36.423 --> 00:37:40.406]  Or a post-industrial world, technotronic, technocracy era.
[00:37:40.406 --> 00:37:44.290]  So how do I know exactly where we're going?
[00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.272]  Because the destination's been announced by the globalists.
[00:37:47.272 --> 00:37:54.238]  Now they can drive the train faster or slower, maybe make a few more stops or a few less stops, but we know where this train track grows.
[00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:58.702]  This is not like a highway with a car where you go wherever you want.
[00:37:58.702 --> 00:38:02.005]  This is, the driver takes you where he was told to take you.
[00:38:06.665 --> 00:38:09.846]  So again, I suggest everyone pay particular attention.
[00:38:09.846 --> 00:38:16.648]  We'll go to that information here in just a moment.
[00:38:16.648 --> 00:38:22.810]  I was about to do a plug this weekend for the Black Friday specials that run all week.
[00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.210]  And I just come up with the specials.
[00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.491]  Not really even a formula to it.
[00:38:26.491 --> 00:38:32.933]  I just make sure they're massive in the belief that if we have the best prices out there, people will buy more and that that'll equal out.
[00:38:32.933 --> 00:38:34.433]  It's certainly been the case so far.
[00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:45.937]  But I was doing an ad about how Black Friday usually is the best time to buy products that stores raise their retail than lower on the day before and or they have a really sought after item in a limited amount.
[00:38:45.937 --> 00:38:47.197]  When you get there, it's not really there.
[00:38:47.197 --> 00:38:52.939]  But you go ahead and impulse buy things that say they're a sale, but they're not really as big a sale as they say.
[00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:55.179]  Plus, there's the big crowds and all the rest of it.
[00:38:55.179 --> 00:38:58.580]  And I was saying, so this isn't our best sale of the year, but it's one of our biggest.
[00:38:59.429 --> 00:39:10.337]  And, you know, the best time of the year is generally right after Christmas, when any inventory we have left, we need to shell so we don't have to pay income tax on it, which is basically inventory tax.
[00:39:10.337 --> 00:39:12.278]  And in Texas, they say we don't have an income tax.
[00:39:12.278 --> 00:39:13.619]  If you've got a company, they do.
[00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:15.200]  It's called a franchise tax.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.605]  And I've got to pay on every desk, every light bulb, everything in here, I've got to pay a few percentage points on.
[00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:22.686]  And over the years, it's growing.
[00:39:22.686 --> 00:39:23.827]  That's how they did it.
[00:39:23.827 --> 00:39:26.849]  So Texas is lower than some states, but it ain't as good as they tell you.
[00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:27.709]  But I'm digressing.
[00:39:27.709 --> 00:39:28.130]  Excuse me.
[00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.410]  I'm sorry.
[00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:35.691]  So I'm sitting there reading the specials I came up with a few days before, while I'm cutting the live ad.
[00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:38.873]  And by ad, I mean I cut a lot of these ads like it's live.
[00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:39.953]  There's not a lot of editing.
[00:39:39.953 --> 00:39:43.435]  Maybe we put a few articles over it, but it's usually just a two-minute ad, one-minute ad, four-minute ad.
[00:39:43.435 --> 00:39:47.198]  I just have a clock and I talk for four minutes.
[00:39:47.198 --> 00:39:49.899]  And halfway through, I go, wait a minute.
[00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:51.160]  This is the best sale we've ever offered.
[00:39:51.826 --> 00:39:52.507]  You're like, well, wait a minute.
[00:39:52.507 --> 00:39:54.348]  The one you had a few weeks ago was the best ever.
[00:39:54.348 --> 00:39:57.310]  Yeah, because they're trying to take our credit card processing away and shut us down.
[00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:02.413]  So I want to sell everything we've got in the warehouse, including stuff that I had for us to go into February.
[00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:10.739]  There'll probably be a situation here where we don't even have any products really for a few months at the new year.
[00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:13.401]  But that's better than them taking our credit card processing
[00:40:14.088 --> 00:40:18.551]  And things like that, well, I file lawsuits and stuff, and for a few months can't sell anything.
[00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:22.013]  It's better to have those nuts for winter to be able to fund the operations.
[00:40:22.013 --> 00:40:35.801]  That's why you are getting the best sales we've ever had, because if the Army's coming over the hill to destroy you, and you got a shop, you might as well, a dry good place, you know, back in the old West, might as well sell everything you got before the Union Army slams in and burns your ass to the ground.
[00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:38.902]  Then they're just getting a building, not your goods.
[00:40:38.902 --> 00:40:39.983]  Now, we don't think that's going to happen.
[00:40:39.983 --> 00:40:41.404]  We think we're going to beat all this, but we're not.
[00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.111]  We're not going to just sit here on our thumbs, as they say.
[00:40:45.111 --> 00:40:51.014]  So, this is, with the double Patriot points, the biggest sale we've ever had.
[00:40:51.014 --> 00:40:56.096]  Because it's the sale we had earlier, everything must go, Christmas, Black Friday, Rolled in One.
[00:40:56.096 --> 00:40:59.978]  Plus, it's double Patriot points, so instead of 5%, you get 10% on your next purchase.
[00:41:02.924 --> 00:41:04.165]  So it's literally money in the bank.
[00:41:04.165 --> 00:41:06.306]  So instead of 5%, it's 10%.
[00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:14.009]  You add all these specials in, like, sign up for auto, ship an additional 10%, a bunch of these are big loss leaders.
[00:41:14.009 --> 00:41:17.210]  So, this is, everything must go, biggest sale ever.
[00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:21.452]  It's not a secret they're trying to shut us down, and I'm not believing they are going to be able to shut us down.
[00:41:21.452 --> 00:41:27.175]  But they're all over the news today, licking their lips, saying, here's how we're going to do it, and after we get his ass, everybody else.
[00:41:27.175 --> 00:41:28.115]  Wait till I cover this stuff.
[00:41:28.115 --> 00:41:31.657]  They have images of me being choked and pulled into darkness and killed.
[00:41:32.671 --> 00:41:40.814]  By horrible, evil Turkish writers that come from a dictatorship where they do that to you if you are a political dissident.
[00:41:40.814 --> 00:41:44.435]  I mean, they are important people, folks, that are very wicked.
[00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:48.116]  There are a lot of good Turkish people I know as well who fled the evil.
[00:41:48.116 --> 00:41:59.260]  A lot of Armenians can tell you about, you know, they've been enslaving and taking people down and silencing them since the Muslims took over Turkey when it was the Byzantine Empire.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.461]  Yeah, zoom out of that for folks and show them Wired Magazine.
[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.731]  And the Turkish writer doing all this for TV viewers.
[00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:07.252]  You can just show it full screen if you'd like.
[00:42:07.252 --> 00:42:09.753]  There it is.
[00:42:09.753 --> 00:42:11.214]  He who must not be named.
[00:42:11.214 --> 00:42:13.495]  What Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common.
[00:42:13.495 --> 00:42:21.038]  And then they image themselves as a big dark blackness sucking me in to a snatch and grab.
[00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.038]  I think that's Voldemort.
[00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:23.419]  So that's coming up.
[00:42:23.419 --> 00:42:25.719]  So we have 50% off storewide.
[00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:27.820]  Up to 50% off the high quality storable food.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.161]  That's unbelievable.
[00:42:29.161 --> 00:42:31.062]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration System at $1.27.
[00:42:32.501 --> 00:42:34.943]  49% off, because that's an overstock issue with them.
[00:42:34.943 --> 00:42:36.164]  We've never gone that low.
[00:42:36.164 --> 00:42:37.345]  It's the very best system.
[00:42:37.345 --> 00:42:43.130]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 40% off, the air purification, and a bunch of other huge specials.
[00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.514]  Up to 75% off, store-wide, everything must go.
[00:42:47.514 --> 00:42:51.177]  Fund our spacecraft engines for the next jump.
[00:42:51.177 --> 00:42:53.979]  We've already launched the new 1776 Revolution.
[00:42:53.979 --> 00:42:55.641]  When we come back, I'll tell you, the next
[00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:56.962]  Level!
[00:42:56.962 --> 00:43:06.273]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:06.273 --> 00:43:09.136]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:09.136 --> 00:43:15.183]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:22.087]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:22.087 --> 00:43:28.391]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:28.391 --> 00:43:35.316]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:47.122]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[00:43:47.876 --> 00:43:49.477]  Bioavailable.
[00:43:49.477 --> 00:43:53.761]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:56.963]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:43:56.963 --> 00:43:59.665]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[00:44:58.084 --> 00:45:03.747]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:45:03.747 --> 00:45:05.348]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:45:05.348 --> 00:45:05.988]  It's a good thing.
[00:45:05.988 --> 00:45:09.590]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.951]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:45:11.951 --> 00:45:13.452]  I learned what the best was.
[00:45:13.452 --> 00:45:18.595]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:45:18.595 --> 00:45:19.115]  It's amazing.
[00:45:19.315 --> 00:45:21.878]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:45:21.878 --> 00:45:28.745]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:30.406]  He has a glut of them.
[00:45:30.406 --> 00:45:32.688]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:33.469]  When it's discharged, usually $200.
[00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:33.589]  It's $127!
[00:45:38.792 --> 00:45:42.918]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making twenty-something bucks on them.
[00:45:42.918 --> 00:45:45.061]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:47.384]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:45:47.384 --> 00:45:47.985]  It's amazing.
[00:45:47.985 --> 00:45:54.033]  Alexa Pure Pro at Imple Wars Life dot com or Imple Wars Store dot com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:05.600]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.885]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:46:09.885 --> 00:46:14.691]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.

[00:46:29.337 --> 00:46:30.498]  That's right at Lost Leader.
[00:46:30.498 --> 00:46:31.898]  Again, to get rid of inventory.
[00:46:31.898 --> 00:46:32.859]  So take advantage of that.
[00:46:32.859 --> 00:46:33.599]  It's an amazing system.
[00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:35.501]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:36.562]  They're trying to defund us.
[00:46:36.562 --> 00:46:39.305]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:43.549]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:48.674]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:48.674 --> 00:46:49.675]  Support the InfoWars.

[00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:55.902]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:55.902 --> 00:46:57.143]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:47:01.025 --> 00:47:09.773]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.773 --> 00:47:25.628]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:47:32.717 --> 00:47:47.509]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:48.890]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:55.575]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live November 19, 2018 global transmission.
[00:47:55.575 --> 00:47:59.598]  Okay, now remember, liberty and freedom is not a spectator sport.
[00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:03.947]  And that's why they hate this show, and that's why they hate this audience, because you are the info war.
[00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:06.488]  If I'm not telling you something you're not already doing, great job.
[00:48:06.488 --> 00:48:07.929]  Let's keep doing it.
[00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:11.312]  Let's absolutely go into the thick of battle every time.
[00:48:11.312 --> 00:48:12.252]  We're going to win this thing.
[00:48:12.252 --> 00:48:13.113]  We're promoting freedom.
[00:48:13.113 --> 00:48:18.037]  The globalists are promoting authoritarianism, poverty, lies, fraud.
[00:48:18.037 --> 00:48:25.622]  Big corporations have set up the internet that DARPA designed to control and track and consolidate power and shut down their competition.
[00:48:25.622 --> 00:48:28.184]  They're going into that phase faster than they were planning,
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:39.606]  Because the internet has been taken away from them and is being used by human intelligence to go out and actually educate and inform others.
[00:48:39.606 --> 00:48:43.047]  And so nationalists and populists are being elected everywhere.
[00:48:43.047 --> 00:48:57.735]  And so when you read these different CIA-funded professors that are in the news from the leftist stay-behind network, just like they left the Justice Department, they left the CIA and funded the John Warner Defense Authorization Act 2017 that Obama signed before he left office.
[00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:05.121]  In December 2016, it says we have a global crisis of nationalists.
[00:49:05.121 --> 00:49:08.142]  We're going to fix our global order.
[00:49:08.142 --> 00:49:17.044]  Google gave speeches that was sent out in the internal Google video that got released a few months ago, two years ago, saying, oh my God, we're going to start censoring to stop the conservatives.
[00:49:17.044 --> 00:49:21.765]  They were already doing it, but they said we've got to do it completely.
[00:49:21.765 --> 00:49:25.346]  Now, in the midst of all this, I had been told that Facebook
[00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:39.564]  Set up whatever it was, 14 years ago or whatever, and then promoted to the top of the food chain in the last 8-9 years, was meeting with Bilderberg, meeting with top globalists, and we later confirmed Zuckerberg had been going to these meetings right out of Harvard.
[00:49:39.564 --> 00:49:51.147]  He wasn't on the list, he was an unannounced guest at a few of the earlier ones, but by about 10 years ago, he was at the front of Bilderberg.
[00:49:51.147 --> 00:49:53.148]  Then they went public.
[00:49:53.148 --> 00:49:54.988]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars came in.
[00:49:56.118 --> 00:50:00.622]  The top people at Facebook now for about three years have been quietly taking their money out.
[00:50:00.622 --> 00:50:02.203]  That's the pump.
[00:50:02.203 --> 00:50:04.045]  Now here comes the dump.
[00:50:04.045 --> 00:50:08.689]  And so we said, they don't just have people in there because they've set up a social system to track people.
[00:50:08.689 --> 00:50:10.811]  They're going to want this for social control.
[00:50:10.811 --> 00:50:14.033]  They're going to want this for political control.
[00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:18.838]  They're going to want this to track and trace everything you're doing for behavioral modification.
[00:50:18.838 --> 00:50:23.482]  That's what we heard from sources over 10 years ago that were inside the meetings.
[00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:23.722]  Then,
[00:50:26.428 --> 00:50:32.571]  Six years ago, we get documents that Google is helping China design a social credit score that will track everything you do in real time.
[00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:35.812]  InfoWords is first to publish.
[00:50:35.812 --> 00:50:38.873]  As usual.
[00:50:38.873 --> 00:50:41.615]  Outside of academic circles.
[00:50:41.615 --> 00:50:42.875]  That pisses them off.
[00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:55.841]  Now you see, oh, the guy from China, who loves Communist China, he says we need a social score like China, and he's running for president, and oh, the New York Times, Washington Post, oh, Zuckerberg's gonna have a social score, and face scanning, even, you know, park your car.
[00:50:57.535 --> 00:51:04.137]  And see, if you're not a good globalist, your face scan turns off, and you can't park your car, you can't get on a bus, you can't get on a plane, and China is already doing it.
[00:51:04.137 --> 00:51:11.858]  This year, 11 million flights for people cancelled because they got lowered in their social score.
[00:51:11.858 --> 00:51:21.041]  So this is the most naked, out-of-control authoritarianism the galaxy's ever seen.
[00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:26.222]  I use that term because lawyers in, like, contracts for rights, they will say, in all known universes and this galaxy,
[00:51:31.129 --> 00:51:43.176]  So imagine, and then it's a pump and dump, meaning they pump it up, they get all the schmucks in it, they quietly take their money out of the Ponzi scheme, and then they decide when to implode it, but you don't stop there.
[00:51:43.176 --> 00:51:50.880]  You then say it happened because they helped Trump win, when that was like not even 1% of what went on with people paying Facebook for analytics.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.242]  Trump just publicly scraped names of conservatives to contact him.
[00:51:54.242 --> 00:51:57.564]  Facebook in live time, and it's in the WikiLeaks, said the Democrats own us.
[00:51:58.806 --> 00:52:00.948]  He told Merkel, you own us, whatever you want.
[00:52:00.948 --> 00:52:05.031]  They give them everything.
[00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:09.994]  But see, they let the EU come in and start regulating Facebook and Twitter and Google.
[00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:22.663]  By Trump and the Republicans not regulating for two years and saying no regulation, it's allowed the EU, because our government hasn't protected our companies, to come in and take over regulation by fiat.
[00:52:22.663 --> 00:52:26.926]  And Trump gets that now.
[00:52:26.926 --> 00:52:27.707]  But we gotta get moving.
[00:52:28.425 --> 00:52:32.686]  And so, then when they implode Facebook, saying, oh, it spies on people.
[00:52:32.686 --> 00:52:34.347]  It won't be for all the real reasons.
[00:52:34.347 --> 00:52:46.691]  And out of that will come these new laws and regulations that the Democrats have written up, and the EU have written up, and the China have written up, that will allow the Internet globally, under EU, Chinese, and US rules, to merge.
[00:52:46.691 --> 00:52:49.251]  Under a new, censored, controlled system.
[00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:51.232]  And this has all been announced now.
[00:52:51.232 --> 00:52:52.672]  We first saw it coming.
[00:52:52.672 --> 00:52:54.473]  We first knew about it.
[00:52:54.473 --> 00:52:57.494]  We first went to bars and local hotels and said,
[00:52:59.306 --> 00:53:06.091]  After work hours, we go there at midnight, buy people drinks, and say, hey, so you work over there at that hotel.
[00:53:06.091 --> 00:53:07.712]  It's going to be closed next week, we hear.
[00:53:07.712 --> 00:53:10.594]  You got to have advance teams go to these things.
[00:53:10.594 --> 00:53:12.115]  They'd say, oh, we already told us, we can't talk to you.
[00:53:12.115 --> 00:53:13.676]  I'd say, here's my number.
[00:53:13.676 --> 00:53:21.822]  When you see how evil they are and how you can't look them in the eyes, when you hear all the evil things they say, I want you to get stuff out of the trash can.
[00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:24.302]  I want you to bring it to me.
[00:53:24.302 --> 00:53:24.862]  We've got flows.
[00:53:24.862 --> 00:53:34.287]  Your car's following us and chasing us and, you know, Tucker in Istanbul and, you know, guys on walkie-talkies, I mean, and ducking in and out of things trying to get documents and they tell you, go here to get it.
[00:53:34.287 --> 00:53:35.668]  And I mean, this is, this really goes on.
[00:53:37.913 --> 00:53:42.395]  And you find out they're going to have a social score system and control everything and track everything you do.
[00:53:42.395 --> 00:53:46.076]  And if you don't comply, they'll not even allow you to operate in society.
[00:53:46.076 --> 00:53:47.357]  And I'm like, this is Mark of the Beach.
[00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.817]  So I'm on the air.
[00:53:48.817 --> 00:53:57.921]  And I put the film out 11 years ago, Endgame, when I say they're going to have a cashless society, Mark of the Beach, where everything you do is track live time on the Internet with a score you have.
[00:53:57.921 --> 00:53:59.702]  This is in the film.
[00:53:59.702 --> 00:54:00.642]  A score you have.
[00:54:01.937 --> 00:54:08.380]  That they can then stop you from having a job or getting on an airplane or buying food if you're not a good globalist.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:15.204]  That's in the three-hour film because it's from the Bilderberg Group!
[00:54:15.204 --> 00:54:17.485]  Now, it's all over the news, it's here.
[00:54:17.485 --> 00:54:22.247]  Take microchips, microchip your kids, blah blah blah.
[00:54:22.247 --> 00:54:27.550]  And they now have a huge article written by an authoritarian from Turkey where they put people in dungeons saying
[00:54:29.765 --> 00:54:32.367]  Alex Jones should not even be allowed to be on the air, period.
[00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:35.429]  He lies and says vaccines can hurt you.
[00:54:35.429 --> 00:54:37.290]  The damn insert says that.
[00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.391]  And they lie to you and don't tell you.
[00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:41.412]  And they list all these things I've supposedly done.
[00:54:41.412 --> 00:54:45.075]  They either lie about what I say or they twist it.
[00:54:45.075 --> 00:54:50.118]  But the point is, it has me being grabbed by a black hand and drug into darkness.
[00:54:50.118 --> 00:54:56.842]  And, again, they've got an authoritarian from Turkey who specializes in annihilating free speech.
[00:54:56.842 --> 00:54:58.543]  Zeynep Tufekci.
[00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:02.091]  And what's the message?
[00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:13.216]  And they say, we're taking control of the internet, we're going to censor everybody, for everyone's good, and Alex Jones is the devil.
[00:55:13.216 --> 00:55:19.860]  But they're the devil, coming in the dark to grab you and pull you into the dark and saying you don't have speech and then lying about you.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.440]  But see, they get to be ruling class now.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:28.184]  They've been prepared and trained at the universities, they're really intelligence operatives of the deep state, to come in
[00:55:30.678 --> 00:55:36.161]  And take control of civilization.
[00:55:36.161 --> 00:55:38.783]  They're going to come in and they're going to run your life.
[00:55:38.783 --> 00:55:40.244]  They're going to dominate you.
[00:55:40.244 --> 00:55:42.765]  They are rightful rulers of you.
[00:55:42.765 --> 00:55:43.966]  And they will control your speech.
[00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:47.448]  There it is, ex-Stasi agent hired to censor xenophobic Facebook posts.
[00:55:47.448 --> 00:55:49.229]  That was four years ago.
[00:55:49.229 --> 00:55:54.512]  Now, last week, Google is looking at moving into the former Stasi headquarters in East Berlin.
[00:55:54.512 --> 00:55:56.493]  You cannot make this up.
[00:55:56.493 --> 00:55:57.334]  So here's the big news.
[00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:04.239]  They're going to take Facebook in to be the new MySpace.
[00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:08.381]  It's going to go way down, then it's going to go back up some, and then it's going to go down again.
[00:56:08.381 --> 00:56:14.364]  Within two years, it will be a dead stock at their current rate.
[00:56:14.364 --> 00:56:16.966]  But there'll be some more hills and valleys.
[00:56:16.966 --> 00:56:25.590]  But out of this, they'll terrorize everyone else, all the other tech companies, everyone else, that you better get in line or this will happen to you.
[00:56:26.744 --> 00:56:31.167]  But not because they were spying, only because they were designed to be a pop-and-dump.
[00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:37.971]  This will be the cover of someone being punished for spying while Apple and Google and Twitter spy and do whatever they want.
[00:56:37.971 --> 00:56:41.613]  So it's a big spectacle.
[00:56:41.613 --> 00:56:47.977]  And it's designed to be a huge distraction from everyone of what's really going on.
[00:56:47.977 --> 00:56:48.598]  Let's look at it.
[00:56:48.598 --> 00:56:49.779]  InfoWars was right.
[00:56:49.779 --> 00:56:53.341]  Facebook using ChaiCom social score for users.
[00:56:53.341 --> 00:56:53.861]  August 21st.
[00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:54.982]  Dr. McCamshot, please.
[00:56:57.823 --> 00:56:58.865]  Intelligence Insider.
[00:56:58.865 --> 00:57:03.297]  Google, Facebook, and Twitter are about to collapse and are desperately seeking Chinese help.
[00:57:03.297 --> 00:57:03.818]  September.
[00:57:03.818 --> 00:57:05.162]  Dr. Steve McShannock's coming on later.
[00:57:07.572 --> 00:57:12.416]  World-exclusive Facebook to completely collapse in pre-planned operation to end free speech as we know it.
[00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:20.341]  Insiders told Alex Jones over a year ago that the globals are going to use Facebook as a sacrificial lamb to terrorize other tech companies into adopting total censorship.
[00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:24.304]  And now we've got Senator Warner and all of them calling for it and doing it.
[00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:28.067]  Oh, survival of our democracy depends on banning sites like InfoWars.
[00:57:28.067 --> 00:57:31.549]  Dem Senator says, isn't that sweet?
[00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:33.631]  Oh my gosh, isn't it just cute?
[00:57:34.608 --> 00:57:42.870]  It's all coming up, and now Facebook is posting its longest losing streak ever, as they prepare to bring it down.
[00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:47.231]  Tomorrow's news today, straight ahead, NewsWaters.com.

[00:59:51.094 --> 00:59:58.016]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.016 --> 00:59:59.136]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.136 --> 01:00:00.957]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:02.838]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.838 --> 01:00:04.518]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.178]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.178 --> 01:00:14.941]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.941 --> 01:00:16.421]  Okay.
[01:00:16.421 --> 01:00:18.162]  I just spent much of the last hour
[01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:22.691]  Getting into the establishment, getting ready to take down Facebook.
[01:00:22.691 --> 01:00:27.875]  It'll take about two years, but it'll be gone.
[01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:33.840]  And they might decide to change course and resurrect it, but they generally don't do things like that.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.524]  We have Dr. Steve Pachetnik joining us that predicted a lot of this on air at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:41.006]  And again, a lot of folks will say, good, I hope Facebook goes away.
[01:00:41.006 --> 01:00:41.746]  They're corrupt and bad.
[01:00:41.746 --> 01:00:43.047]  It's not about that.
[01:00:43.047 --> 01:00:45.669]  It's about a pump and dump on investors.
[01:00:45.669 --> 01:00:47.311]  The big boys getting their money out years ago.
[01:00:48.044 --> 01:01:16.193]  And it's about using the spectacle of its ongoing collapse to sell new forms of censorship and to muddy the waters and act like Facebook's being punished for surveilling people by focusing in on things that weren't even illegal to cover up all the real crimes that Facebook and others have been engaged in and to create fear in the other tech giants that they could be regulated because there's fear
[01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:34.541]  In the tech giants, that they could be taken over by government, but government has acted so pliant and pliable with it, that now big tech's gotten big britches and thinks that it actually runs things.
[01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:47.104]  So, you've got corporate powers vying with each other, you've got the Chi-Coms, the EU, Russia, the United States, and the globalists hate anybody who has allegiance to their country, allegiance to free market,
[01:01:48.763 --> 01:01:52.524]  Allegiance to anything decent.
[01:01:52.524 --> 01:02:05.426]  We've got top Dem Senator, the one that's been running the censorship in the Senate, who demanded I be taken off the internet four months ago, and you saw the effect one month after he gave the order, because he represents the globalists, Mark Warnham.
[01:02:05.426 --> 01:02:10.107]  Google must do more to censor YouTube.
[01:02:10.107 --> 01:02:12.127]  And other Dem Senators are saying the same thing.
[01:02:12.127 --> 01:02:14.908]  So, they're making their move.
[01:02:17.614 --> 01:02:23.337]  Because the establishment's decided that an open and somewhat free internet will destroy them.
[01:02:23.337 --> 01:02:27.880]  And so we have to know what's next and get Trump and the Congress to take action.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.522]  Because the Republicans are, hey, you're free market companies, we're going to leave you alone.
[01:02:31.522 --> 01:02:38.966]  But the Democrats are working through the EU and the CHICOMS to put regulations from overseas on these companies.
[01:02:38.966 --> 01:02:43.409]  And so you're allowing them, by not coming into the vacuum, Mr. President, to take control.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:53.546]  And they're also fearful that ignorance by the Republican leadership, how the internet works, may allow them to get regulation through regardless.
[01:02:53.546 --> 01:03:01.472]  So the Republican establishment are extremely stupid.
[01:03:01.472 --> 01:03:03.593]  Trump's not.
[01:03:03.593 --> 01:03:14.561]  And I sat there in a committee hearing, headed up with Warner a few months ago, and I watched the only Senator Cotton bring up the shycoms and the spy chips and all of our electronics and how
[01:03:15.279 --> 01:03:22.002]  This is so dangerous, and now Google won't even work with the Pentagon on things now, but it'll work with China on AI.
[01:03:22.002 --> 01:03:25.143]  Yeah, the globalists are anti-America.
[01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:27.924]  Google's moved there.
[01:03:27.924 --> 01:03:31.506]  Apple's moved there.
[01:03:31.506 --> 01:03:36.308]  Turns out, as big tech makes bigger profits, they cut the pay to their own employees.
[01:03:36.308 --> 01:03:37.508]  They don't pay taxes.
[01:03:37.508 --> 01:03:40.589]  They're the most ruthless, evil, godless people.
[01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:41.950]  They own the worst factories.
[01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:46.622]  These tech companies are run by demons!
[01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:50.585]  But because they dress like hippies.
[01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:53.948]  And you know, Jack Dorsey has a little nose ring, a little booger collector.
[01:03:53.948 --> 01:04:00.653]  I'm not saying you're bad if you like nose rings, it's just like, oh, I'm an average guy, I have a nose ring.
[01:04:00.653 --> 01:04:04.756]  Look, I have tattoos.
[01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:11.261]  It's like that deal where billionaires will drive some old Ford Taurus, meanwhile they jump on some seven million dollar, you know, jet copter.
[01:04:12.009 --> 01:04:15.170]  It flies them to the airport where they get in their $100 million jet.
[01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:19.632]  It's all just virtue signaling crap.
[01:04:19.632 --> 01:04:22.773]  These people are ruthless authoritarians.
[01:04:22.773 --> 01:04:26.055]  Absolutely enjoy making you poor.
[01:04:26.055 --> 01:04:27.776]  Want to suppress you.
[01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:32.758]  Want to take away your liberties and freedoms, and then give you race-based identities.
[01:04:32.758 --> 01:04:38.500]  While they say they're fighting racism, 180 degrees different from Martin Luther King.
[01:04:41.454 --> 01:04:46.076]  Yeah, China's been executing more gays, but Tim Cook, it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:04:46.076 --> 01:04:50.798]  Look, if you support China, the slave factories and killing gays, as long as you're gay, it's cool.
[01:04:50.798 --> 01:04:54.100]  I mean, everybody knows some gay people are mean to other gay people.
[01:04:56.215 --> 01:05:00.459]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:05:00.459 --> 01:05:03.922]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:05:03.922 --> 01:05:05.704]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:05:05.704 --> 01:05:08.967]  They know we have like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[01:05:08.967 --> 01:05:15.773]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:05:15.773 --> 01:05:20.838]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:27.261]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:30.262]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:30.262 --> 01:05:31.343]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:31.343 --> 01:05:35.185]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:35.185 --> 01:05:37.206]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:38.486]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:38.486 --> 01:05:39.567]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:41.207]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:41.207 --> 01:05:44.149]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:45.469]  I will never falter.
[01:05:45.469 --> 01:05:47.791]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:48.471]  I physically will.
[01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:58.714]  I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWars4.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:05:58.714 --> 01:06:04.316]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.768 --> 01:06:36.391]  So, in case you didn't hear, I'm sure you did, it's the top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:41.454]  For three straight quarters, Facebook's been going straight down and a lot of people say it's not really profitable.
[01:06:41.454 --> 01:06:43.915]  It's a giant pump and dump.
[01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:51.359]  And there's a big fight taking place over who's gonna control Facebook.
[01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:52.380]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.082]  Facebook was shut up over a decade ago with Bilderberg money.
[01:06:56.082 --> 01:06:58.083]  Back when Zuckerberg just got out of Harvard.
[01:06:58.627 --> 01:07:13.322]  He was going to Bilderberg meetings and they were planning it as a social control mechanism that would then basically privatize illegal NSA spying and get people to opt into illegal spying.
[01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:22.611]  And then if they wanted to use NSA data on somebody illegally, they would just go pay Facebook to reverse engineer it so they could have claims in court that it came from that.
[01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:31.015]  And, you know, you saw the judge just ordered a Lexus last week with Amazon, its little spy droid, in a double murder case.
[01:07:31.015 --> 01:07:38.278]  And Amazon had to confirm, yeah, it was recording from the day they plugged it in, even when it's off, to the day it was unplugged by the police.
[01:07:38.278 --> 01:07:40.559]  And it's got the audio, everyone being murdered, recorded.
[01:07:42.924 --> 01:07:45.727]  That's the whole point of AI.
[01:07:45.727 --> 01:07:49.149]  And, you know, beware Greeks bearing gifts.
[01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:55.815]  They bring you the Trojan horse, you put it in your house, and then you wonder what's going on.
[01:07:55.815 --> 01:07:57.677]  You're like, well, I'm not murdering anybody.
[01:07:57.677 --> 01:07:58.838]  That doesn't matter.
[01:07:58.838 --> 01:08:06.605]  It's run so they get a detailed profile on you and know everything about you and have high tech AI scanning it all, putting it into a database.
[01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:06.805]  So,
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.781]  They are getting ready to destroy Facebook.
[01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:17.083]  They'll drive it way down, it'll go back up a little bit the next year, and then finally plain out forever.
[01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:19.984]  They'll want to sucker the suckers again.
[01:08:19.984 --> 01:08:25.006]  Remember Zuckerberg said, our users trust us, they're dumb effers.
[01:08:25.006 --> 01:08:27.007]  I can't believe how pathetic they are.
[01:08:27.007 --> 01:08:28.268]  They're so stupid.
[01:08:28.268 --> 01:08:28.708]  That's a quote.
[01:08:29.409 --> 01:08:31.710]  He just loves screwing you over.
[01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.610]  And he will, don't you?
[01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:34.451]  Because he acts liberal.
[01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:36.411]  I'm a liberal.
[01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:41.153]  But as long as you go, then everything's OK, literally.
[01:08:41.153 --> 01:08:45.454]  Just like Tim Cook, just like all of it, it's very, very funny.
[01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.454]  It's very, very funny.
[01:08:47.454 --> 01:08:52.576]  And then if you want to censor the Internet and take over, well, you first demonize somebody for
[01:08:53.303 --> 01:08:59.385]  Two years saying they're the dark heart, they're the worst person on the planet, they're a Nazi.
[01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:07.108]  And then finally, oh, they have their moral moment, the slave factory owning Apple that's given all the code keys to communist China.
[01:09:07.108 --> 01:09:10.249]  Tim Cook bans me and then everyone else follows suit.
[01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:18.372]  And then all these other little virtue signaling companies, they come along and they do the same thing.
[01:09:18.372 --> 01:09:22.854]  Show that no one stands up for me except Matt Rudge and Tucker Carlson and our listeners.
[01:09:24.176 --> 01:09:27.038]  And then the precedent set for everyone else.
[01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:33.622]  And it's wild how, when they were calling for me to be taken off a year ago and six months ago, it was because I'd done horrible things.
[01:09:33.622 --> 01:09:34.642]  They never showed what I did.
[01:09:34.642 --> 01:09:36.183]  They'd lie about it.
[01:09:36.183 --> 01:09:41.727]  But now they just say, oh, we're in a crisis against nationalists.
[01:09:41.727 --> 01:09:45.229]  We've got to shut them all down.
[01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:48.811]  And Alex Jones was just the beginning.
[01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:55.429]  And they have major academic papers working with the federal government.
[01:09:55.429 --> 01:09:56.690]  You say, well, Trump's the federal government.
[01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:57.110]  No, he's not.
[01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:03.912]  90 plus percent of it does not follow his orders.
[01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:07.473]  This is called mutiny against the nation.
[01:10:07.473 --> 01:10:08.694]  Against the people.
[01:10:08.694 --> 01:10:13.716]  By these multinational corporations allied with the most murderous regimes on earth.
[01:10:13.716 --> 01:10:17.137]  So this is the whole shooting game, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:17.137 --> 01:10:20.398]  I've got lots of other incredible news, but this right now is everything.
[01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:33.673]  Because if they take your communications away, if they can selectively control what you can see and what you can do, it's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[01:10:33.673 --> 01:10:37.475]  So let's go over the latest news and then Senator Warner, but let's first look back a little bit.
[01:10:37.475 --> 01:10:50.641]  Because when I come back, I'm going to read you the most sickening authoritarian babble you've ever heard out of a foreigner that comes from an authoritarian country licking their lips about silencing you.
[01:10:55.672 --> 01:11:02.114]  They create authoritarian regimes in the universities, they bring in the controllers, and then they deploy them to run your life.
[01:11:02.114 --> 01:11:07.575]  Horrible, spoiled, rotten, evil, little authoritarians.
[01:11:07.575 --> 01:11:11.776]  Does the banning of Alex Jones signal a new era of big tech responsibility?
[01:11:11.776 --> 01:11:12.736]  The Guardian.
[01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:17.357]  Oh, the liberals, the leftists are suddenly, oh, they're so responsible!
[01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:20.938]  The Guardians are bringing
[01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:26.994]  Jihadi's back to kill women and children to the UK, giving them free housing to rehabilitate them.
[01:11:26.994 --> 01:11:27.915]  They mean to run the country.
[01:11:27.915 --> 01:11:32.859]  But, oh, Alex Jones, he, it's such a good thing to take him off air.
[01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:34.200]  Here's another one.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.284]  Does the ban, oh, InfoWars, how Alex Jones lost the InfoWars.
[01:11:39.284 --> 01:11:42.506]  Remember, Colbert and all of them celebrated, yay!
[01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.308]  He's gone, oh.
[01:11:44.308 --> 01:11:48.411]  InfoWars was right, Facebook using ChiCom social score for users, we told you.
[01:11:50.117 --> 01:11:51.818]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:11:51.818 --> 01:11:58.082]  World exclusive Facebook completely collapsed in pre-planned operation in free speech as we know it.
[01:11:58.082 --> 01:12:01.325]  Dem Senator demands more censorship of conservative media.
[01:12:01.325 --> 01:12:05.888]  Survival of our democracy depends on banning sites like InfoWars.
[01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:10.211]  Yes, you must defend people's open right.
[01:12:10.211 --> 01:12:12.852]  Speech being first most in a supposed democracy.
[01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:15.974]  We're a republic that guards the minority rights even more.
[01:12:15.974 --> 01:12:18.196]  It's like a super democracy, but a protected one.
[01:12:19.452 --> 01:12:22.113]  You can't have 51% say enslave the other 49%.
[01:12:22.113 --> 01:12:26.473]  Oh, but notice that being a patriot means you don't like your nation.
[01:12:26.473 --> 01:12:27.814]  Macron.
[01:12:27.814 --> 01:12:29.134]  Up is down, down is up.
[01:12:29.134 --> 01:12:33.875]  Survival of our democracy depends on banning sites like InfoWars as a Dem Senator.
[01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:35.175]  And now they've done it.
[01:12:35.175 --> 01:12:36.615]  Alex Jones calls out Tim Cook.
[01:12:36.615 --> 01:12:40.096]  Everything you're doing in China will come to America.
[01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:43.036]  Wikileaks points to Democrats after InfoWars takedown.
[01:12:43.036 --> 01:12:46.097]  Warns it could be next.
[01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:46.477]  And now?
[01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:47.940]  It's happening.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.241]  Soros issues death threat to Google and Facebook.
[01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:53.863]  Totally censor, let my people run what you're doing, or all implode your stock.
[01:12:53.863 --> 01:12:55.104]  Which he's now doing.
[01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.365]  That's what this is about.
[01:12:56.365 --> 01:13:09.194]  Use them, make them do the illegal stuff, and then when they won't totally ban everybody and commit suicide, Soros says, I will pump and dump you faster if you don't submit to me.
[01:13:09.194 --> 01:13:13.536]  We told you months ago, tech investors start to panic as Facebook stock price plunged more than 20%.
[01:13:13.536 --> 01:13:14.337]  That was a few months ago.
[01:13:15.237 --> 01:13:24.161]  So, here we are in 2012 at Infowars.com calling Facebook a pump and dump in the future.
[01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:25.941]  So there's some background for you.
[01:13:25.941 --> 01:13:37.926]  And now it's here, and now it's happening, and now they're going to bring in a social score where every... because that's what the... suddenly the professors are all proposing it, and the New York Times is proposing it, and a nice man from China who's running for
[01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:42.420]  President, you know, to be on the stage and call for censorship being a good thing.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.300]  You'll be paid $1,000 a month.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:48.882]  You don't have to work, but everything you do will be tracked by your smartphone the government gives you.
[01:13:48.882 --> 01:13:51.242]  It's called slavery.
[01:13:51.242 --> 01:13:54.083]  That's all over the news.
[01:13:54.083 --> 01:14:00.345]  And then the senators come out and act like they're pressuring big tech to do it when it's all part of the larger plan.
[01:14:00.345 --> 01:14:02.185]  Top Dem Senator Mark Warner.
[01:14:02.185 --> 01:14:07.327]  Google must do more to censor YouTube.
[01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:08.127]  That's out today.
[01:14:10.422 --> 01:14:18.504]  YouTube is one of the most censored places out there now unless you're promoting child molestation or devil worship or teaching six-year-old Asian girls that white people are inherently bad.
[01:14:18.504 --> 01:14:22.365]  We played video last hour.
[01:14:22.365 --> 01:14:24.345]  You can't allow stuff like that to be challenged.
[01:14:24.345 --> 01:14:28.606]  It has to be in an echo chamber to succeed.
[01:14:28.606 --> 01:14:30.787]  And so now he's come out and he's pushing this whole thing.
[01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:32.992]  We must act against this.
[01:14:32.992 --> 01:14:45.482]  We're allowing China and the EU and Big Tech with the Democrats to come in by fiat with regulation, take total control of the Internet, censor everyone, and then say that we're bad people.
[01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:55.249]  And when I read when we come back this article and I play the clip, he who must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common, it is the most incredible projection I've ever heard.
[01:14:55.249 --> 01:14:57.991]  We need to drag Alex Jones off into the darkness and silence him.
[01:14:59.255 --> 01:15:03.797]  She comes from an authoritarian country where they do that, Turkey.
[01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:11.900]  She goes on to tell all these lies and twist things and then talks about how we need to move to censor everyone that opposes us in this emergency we're in.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:19.623]  Yes, some people in Brazil and Italy and the United States and even Mexico and other areas are upset about this.
[01:15:19.623 --> 01:15:21.124]  And people know this is bad.
[01:15:21.124 --> 01:15:27.286]  And so you're calling it an emergency that people want to run their own countries and not have the globalists run them from afar.
[01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:36.391]  It's just astounding.
[01:15:36.391 --> 01:15:37.653]  It's completely incredible.
[01:15:37.653 --> 01:15:39.535]  But you can override the censors.
[01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.379]  You can override these tyrants.
[01:15:42.379 --> 01:15:47.766]  They'd like to bring people in from foreign regimes, former Stasi and authoritarians out of Turkey to rule us.
[01:15:49.073 --> 01:15:55.522]  All you gotta do is share the link, share the article, spread the word, call C-SPAN, calls up radio, newswars.com, newswars.com, infowars.com.
[01:15:55.522 --> 01:15:56.703]  Hear that?
[01:15:56.703 --> 01:16:02.091]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.455]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:04.975 --> 01:16:08.556]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:08.556 --> 01:16:16.118]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:16.118 --> 01:16:20.719]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:23.140]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.320]  Faketv.com
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:31.423]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:31.423 --> 01:16:34.465]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:40.368]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:40.368 --> 01:16:44.170]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:45.430]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:46.771]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:46.771 --> 01:16:52.994]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:52.994 --> 01:16:54.415]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:55.135 --> 01:16:59.919]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:05.803]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:17:05.803 --> 01:17:12.308]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:12.308 --> 01:17:16.371]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:22.616]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[01:17:22.616 --> 01:17:23.816]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[01:17:24.972 --> 01:17:26.873]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.701]  They're trying to defund us.

[01:19:54.076 --> 01:20:01.282]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.801 --> 01:20:13.902]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.902 --> 01:20:15.843]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:15.843 --> 01:20:23.227]  For your mind.
[01:20:23.227 --> 01:20:25.388]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:25.388 --> 01:20:29.250]  Very powerful article by Jamie White just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:34.413]  Veteran GOP congressman schools Dems who claim Trump attacks press freedom.
[01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:36.815]  That video's coming up.
[01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:41.137]  Also Democrat presidential candidate wants government-sponsored social credit system.
[01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:45.238]  Compatible to China's.
[01:20:45.238 --> 01:20:46.938]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:46.938 --> 01:20:48.999]  And if you're on welfare, you'll have to be on it.
[01:20:48.999 --> 01:20:51.680]  But you can opt in and get $1,000 a month to be totally trapped.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.400]  That's just a beginning.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.320]  It's called slavery.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.701]  It's how you domesticate wild animals.
[01:20:55.701 --> 01:20:57.781]  You start feeding them a little bit.
[01:20:57.781 --> 01:20:59.022]  You build a cage, a pen.
[01:20:59.022 --> 01:21:00.142]  You put the food inside the pen.
[01:21:00.142 --> 01:21:00.622]  They go in.
[01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.602]  You close the gate.
[01:21:02.602 --> 01:21:05.223]  The circle is now complete.
[01:21:05.223 --> 01:21:06.584]  All right.
[01:21:06.584 --> 01:21:08.184]  So, bringing this to a head.
[01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:16.946]  They're trying to bring down Facebook right now to terrorize the other big tech companies to get in line for total censorship.
[01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:23.929]  George Soros is threatening Google and others that you'll go like Facebook if you don't submit, we will absolutely take your stock down.
[01:21:23.929 --> 01:21:26.110]  This is economic terrorism.
[01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:33.333]  And the President and others going, oh we're a free market, we'll leave it alone, is allowing the vacuum of the CHICOMS, the EU, Soros and others to come in.
[01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:39.436]  Meanwhile, Obama declared an emergency, signed the emergency into law in the Defense Authorization Act,
[01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:43.764]  In December of 2016, for the next fiscal year.
[01:21:43.764 --> 01:21:47.686]  That's done before the year.
[01:21:47.686 --> 01:21:56.992]  And recruited stay-behind networks of operatives for the emergency to stop the Russian takeover.
[01:21:56.992 --> 01:21:58.894]  And that's just, they know it's all a joke.
[01:21:58.894 --> 01:21:59.454]  That's the cover.
[01:21:59.454 --> 01:22:02.056]  Then they had congressional hearings that said, Jones is a Russian operative.
[01:22:02.056 --> 01:22:03.617]  We must get him off the internet in 2017.
[01:22:03.617 --> 01:22:04.817]  By the middle of 2018, they'd begun to do that.
[01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:16.885]  So if you're outside globalist taking down the country, you call the loyal nationalists the outsiders.
[01:22:16.885 --> 01:22:22.666]  Because the Achilles heel of the globalist is, they are the outsiders usurping and enslaving the country.
[01:22:22.666 --> 01:22:31.007]  And now, the president says we're a nation, we shouldn't have one-sided trade deals where Canada has a 280% tariff on milk and we don't.
[01:22:31.007 --> 01:22:33.248]  They go, that's the most racist, evil thing.
[01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:34.308]  Your nation doesn't exist.
[01:22:35.552 --> 01:22:38.043]  But Alex Jones is evil, and he works for the Russians.
[01:22:38.043 --> 01:22:40.353]  Because he's red, white, and blue and loves the country.
[01:22:40.353 --> 01:22:40.473]  See?
[01:22:42.179 --> 01:22:45.320]  I know you know this as an audience, but this is what they're doing.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.981]  Then they bring in a bunch of former Stasi, they bring in people out of Turkey, out of the Middle East.
[01:22:49.981 --> 01:22:50.861]  Real authoritarians.
[01:22:50.861 --> 01:22:53.102]  A lot of Chinese operatives are brought in.
[01:22:53.102 --> 01:23:00.304]  Most of these Democrat senators actually have a Chinese officer from the intelligence board as part of the Chinese funding of any high-level dim.
[01:23:00.304 --> 01:23:07.826]  You have to have one of their operatives, usually as a chief of staff or as their top assistant, like Dianne Feinstein, who then runs the whole op.
[01:23:07.826 --> 01:23:10.327]  We, of course, were the first to expose that she was Chinese-run.
[01:23:11.347 --> 01:23:15.369]  We already knew that was known, but we've got that out there.
[01:23:15.369 --> 01:23:16.850]  Let me continue here.
[01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:37.860]  So, He Who Must Not Be Named, and then it shows me, and it's going to be reportedly one of the cover stories, on the December Wired Magazine coming out here in just a week, is total darkness with a black hand, that means an assassin's hand, this image means, in intelligence operations, this image
[01:23:39.989 --> 01:23:46.174]  But it's normally just a normal-looking face, not my face, is the symbol of a snatch-and-grab.
[01:23:46.174 --> 01:23:53.740]  When it's a total darkness and a black hand grabbing over the mouth, it means you're going into a dungeon, which Turkey is very famous for.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:59.364]  So we have this Turkish individual over here, whose thesis is about women's rights, of course.
[01:23:59.364 --> 01:24:01.226]  Don't the Islamists always do that?
[01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:09.092]  He who must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common, this demon snake creature from Harry Potter.
[01:24:09.884 --> 01:24:12.806]  That I'm not into magical thinking so I haven't followed Harry Potter.
[01:24:12.806 --> 01:24:15.067]  If you want to be into that, that's fine.
[01:24:15.067 --> 01:24:18.249]  I've seen pieces of them.
[01:24:18.249 --> 01:24:21.150]  But you read this, she's the one calling for censorship.
[01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:22.911]  She's part of the big evil cabal.
[01:24:22.911 --> 01:24:26.493]  And then she's talking about how I'm the devil and the one that must not be named.
[01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:30.775]  Remember David Hogg talking about this?
[01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:33.257]  And said, ooh, I'm not supposed to say his name because you're not supposed to say my name.
[01:24:33.257 --> 01:24:33.577]  Here it is.
[01:24:34.933 --> 01:24:38.596]  Um, saying Alex Jones... Sorry, I don't want to mention his name.
[01:24:38.596 --> 01:24:44.601]  Um, when individuals say these things to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them.
[01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:50.125]  For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of, but as you said, is from InfoWars.
[01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:52.007]  Um, he shouts a lot.
[01:24:52.007 --> 01:24:52.747]  I'll just give you that hint.
[01:24:52.747 --> 01:24:53.568]  He looks red.
[01:24:53.568 --> 01:24:53.628]  Um...
[01:24:55.695 --> 01:25:05.518]  He's advertising many of these things, and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear-mongering, hate-loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America.
[01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:16.341]  For example, on Infowars, one of the main things that he spoke, one of his famous things is saying that, uh, one of his most famous statements was saying that, Topwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[01:25:16.341 --> 01:25:18.062]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[01:25:18.062 --> 01:25:19.902]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[01:25:19.902 --> 01:25:22.103]  And secondly, if you noticed at the end of that video,
[01:25:23.012 --> 01:25:26.255]  He advertises water filters.
[01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:30.579]  Interesting.
[01:25:30.579 --> 01:25:31.379]  Yeah, that's the point.
[01:25:31.379 --> 01:25:35.283]  The water's toxic and here's the best water filter at the best price, by the way, with the best deal ever on...
[01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:37.437]  Alexa Pure Pro.
[01:25:37.437 --> 01:25:39.219]  That's their biggest, nicest stainless steel model.
[01:25:39.219 --> 01:25:40.740]  The one that does the most water.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.102]  The best model out there.
[01:25:42.102 --> 01:25:43.223]  $127,000.
[01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:45.065]  Leading competitors for something similar are $350,000, $400,000.
[01:25:45.065 --> 01:25:47.087]  They're normally a great deal at $240,000.
[01:25:47.087 --> 01:25:50.090]  They're selling it to us at cost because they ordered too many of them.
[01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:52.993]  They don't want to get hit, obviously, with the end-of-year inventory tax.
[01:25:52.993 --> 01:25:55.636]  So it's never been a better time to get Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:25:56.176 --> 01:26:01.718]  It is literally 1-27 right now at Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:26:01.718 --> 01:26:06.099]  See, he is an actor, not a crisis actor.
[01:26:06.099 --> 01:26:07.199]  The shooting happened.
[01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:09.680]  He's an actor on the acting deal, a Democrat.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:18.683]  He admits he's given lines, and his lines are, don't say Alex Jones's name, and you know, turn the frogs gay, even though the chemicals are actually sterilizing the frogs, is what we said.
[01:26:18.683 --> 01:26:21.284]  Now, he who must not be named.
[01:26:21.284 --> 01:26:24.865]  I got Dr. Steve Pachinick coming back on the broadcast.
[01:26:25.732 --> 01:26:26.833]  And he's predicted a lot of this.
[01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.955]  We're going to look at how big this is and what this really means to everything.
[01:26:29.955 --> 01:26:31.897]  This is a lot bigger than just Facebook.
[01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:36.540]  And then when he leaves, I'll get into all the latest Antifa and the rest of it.
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:41.884]  But to read this authoritarian's article, she says the most ridiculous things in here.
[01:26:41.884 --> 01:26:47.849]  It shows how childlike their minds are.
[01:26:47.849 --> 01:26:50.211]  These wannabe authoritarians.
[01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:53.353]  She goes on to say, I will now say his name.
[01:26:53.911 --> 01:26:57.214]  Because now he has no more Voldermort power.
[01:26:57.214 --> 01:26:59.555]  He has been banished and is nothing.
[01:26:59.555 --> 01:27:01.797]  And I think she must believe in Harry Potter.
[01:27:01.797 --> 01:27:03.478]  Like, she's saying this?
[01:27:03.478 --> 01:27:05.600]  She's a five-year-old girl and it just happened?
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.862]  Hey, Cupcake!
[01:27:07.862 --> 01:27:10.284]  I have some smart advisors, but I do what I think I should do.
[01:27:10.284 --> 01:27:13.906]  They've begged me not to tell you this.
[01:27:13.906 --> 01:27:16.488]  But I will, because my weapon is the truth.
[01:27:16.488 --> 01:27:21.512]  Lady, we're on fire, like a sun exploding.
[01:27:21.512 --> 01:27:22.513]  You're a moron!
[01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:27.509]  But you evil people never get it, do you?
[01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:50.434]  I mean, you're a grown woman talking about shutting down all nationalist conservatives' free speech in a giant Big Brother grid beyond anything Orwell ever dreamed of, and you've got yourself all dressed up in, like, Gaelic pib outfits with bows and arrows on your side as you're force-fed on Twitter, dreaming about taking people offline because they're Voldemort, and then now you've diminished them.
[01:27:50.434 --> 01:27:51.914]  My last gasp!
[01:27:55.157 --> 01:28:07.747]  Oh my god, you better believe this lady runs around in circles around a fire and you know thinks that she's got magical powers.
[01:28:07.747 --> 01:28:10.369]  I mean look at that little witchy poo outfit.
[01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:18.416]  Hey lady, why don't you get your ass back on an airplane to fly back over to Turkey where the men tell you to keep your damn mouth shut.
[01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:19.236]  We don't do that over here.
[01:28:19.236 --> 01:28:19.797]  We're the West.
[01:28:20.603 --> 01:28:25.928]  I understand your ancestors raided the beautiful Constantinople and crapped all over it.
[01:28:25.928 --> 01:28:30.972]  So, I understand your IQ isn't that high, but let me just give you a little newsflash, lady.
[01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:34.115]  You and your authoritarian trash will never defeat us.
[01:28:34.115 --> 01:28:36.977]  You'll never prevail.
[01:28:36.977 --> 01:28:40.320]  In the name of Jesus, I just hope that God brings justice to you in a loving way.
[01:28:42.078 --> 01:28:45.063]  God is merciful and loving.
[01:28:45.063 --> 01:28:50.811]  But you got somebody from the authoritarian regime where she wouldn't be allowed to shoot her mouth off over here trying to dominate men.
[01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:54.056]  She's like this big ol' fat Turkish Islamist.
[01:28:54.933 --> 01:28:56.594]  Attention parents and grandparents!
[01:28:56.594 --> 01:29:02.399]  Have you ever wanted to give a gift that would have lasting value and provide spiritual benefits long after Christmas is over?
[01:29:02.399 --> 01:29:05.721]  A gift you could even call an investment in the next generation?
[01:29:05.721 --> 01:29:09.864]  If so, this is going to be the single most important message you'll hear this holiday season.
[01:29:09.864 --> 01:29:12.746]  Hi, I'm Bill Hyde and I want to tell you about an exciting gift.
[01:29:12.746 --> 01:29:21.133]  One you can give your kids or grandkids that's going to teach Christian history, build up their faith, provide extraordinary role models, and it's all done with a distinctive Christian worldview.
[01:29:21.133 --> 01:29:24.135]  I'm talking about the award-winning Movies for the Mind CD sets.
[01:29:24.155 --> 01:29:26.536]  It's based on the extraordinary adventures of G.A.
[01:29:26.536 --> 01:29:27.657]  Henty Audio Series.
[01:29:27.657 --> 01:29:28.297]  The best part?
[01:29:28.297 --> 01:29:32.860]  You can finally give a Christian gift to the kids that's not boring, dull, or cheesy.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:36.862]  The audio adventures also build vocabulary, focus, and attention span.
[01:29:36.862 --> 01:29:41.785]  But they're not sold in stores, and you can't get the adventures at any big internet retailers either.
[01:29:41.785 --> 01:29:48.209]  So to learn more, even get below wholesale pricing and a whole bunch of Christmas bonuses, go to givetheadventure.com.
[01:29:48.729 --> 01:29:49.930]  GiveTheAdventure.com.
[01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:53.051]  The perfect gift for kids of all ages from 6 to 100.
[01:29:53.051 --> 01:29:54.551]  Go to GiveTheAdventure.com.
[01:29:54.551 --> 01:30:03.395]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:30:03.395 --> 01:30:06.516]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:30:06.516 --> 01:30:08.457]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:30:09.173 --> 01:30:13.479]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:30:13.479 --> 01:30:20.989]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:30:20.989 --> 01:30:23.412]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:30:26.844 --> 01:30:29.045]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:30:29.045 --> 01:30:32.087]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:30:32.087 --> 01:30:43.995]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:30:43.995 --> 01:30:46.336]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:30:46.336 --> 01:30:48.397]  I've never missed your show, any day.

[01:31:07.354 --> 01:31:14.077]  It is you, the InfoWarriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats.
[01:31:14.824 --> 01:31:16.086]  That have now changed the world.
[01:31:16.086 --> 01:31:18.109]  And that's why you've been on the team.

[01:31:22.094 --> 01:31:25.619]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.

[01:32:59.539 --> 01:33:02.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:20.649]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:20.649 --> 01:33:23.632]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:27.535]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:41.487]  So, we are in the middle of a epic move by different powers and different forces to openly take control of the internet and censor nationalists, conservatives, Christians, you name it.
[01:33:41.487 --> 01:33:44.370]  And then use it for a social score that tracks everything you do
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:48.964]  And only favors elite corporations, and it's being now promoted everywhere.
[01:33:48.964 --> 01:33:51.707]  We first told you about this six years ago.
[01:33:51.707 --> 01:34:00.956]  Now they have the New York Times, all of them today, Wired Magazine, you name it, saying, he who must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common.
[01:34:00.956 --> 01:34:04.539]  Then it has me being snatched and grabbed and drug off into the dark pit.
[01:34:04.539 --> 01:34:09.084]  So I love how some woman who fled authoritarian Turkey to come over here and be a professor and do it here.
[01:34:10.586 --> 01:34:12.167]  But that's what they're pushing.
[01:34:12.167 --> 01:34:14.127]  That's what they are bringing in.
[01:34:14.127 --> 01:34:19.250]  Now you've got all these Democratic Senators saying, oh, Google hasn't done enough to censor pro-Trump people.
[01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:28.213]  Oh, Facebook, you're going down because you let Cambridge Analytica publicly scrape some names, when that's nothing compared to what Facebook, Google, and Twitter have done.
[01:34:28.213 --> 01:34:31.054]  So I wanted to get Dr. Steve Pucinich on, because he's talked about a lot of this.
[01:34:31.054 --> 01:34:32.595]  He's predicted a lot of it.
[01:34:32.595 --> 01:34:39.578]  He was on a few months ago with Owen and said that, I mean, it was pretty obvious then, but he talked about it before that, that Facebook
[01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:42.820]  He's being prepared to be taken down.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.402]  It was obviously set up as a pump-and-dump a long time ago and to spy on people.
[01:34:47.402 --> 01:34:50.363]  But out of that process, they're going to try to sell all this censorship.
[01:34:50.363 --> 01:34:53.865]  So there's a war for the Internet happening right now.
[01:34:53.865 --> 01:35:03.389]  And because Trump hasn't come in and put prohibitions on it, that's allowed other outside interests in my view to come in, like the Chi-Coms, the EU, with their own regulations.
[01:35:04.312 --> 01:35:04.912]  No problem.
[01:35:04.912 --> 01:35:07.573]  What I told you well over a year ago was that Facebook was in financial trouble.
[01:35:07.573 --> 01:35:07.974]  I don't need any
[01:35:32.223 --> 01:35:34.964]  Uh, information from above or elsewhere.
[01:35:34.964 --> 01:35:39.185]  I was tracking it, and I was shorting a lot of that stock.
[01:35:39.185 --> 01:35:42.666]  Right now, Facebook is not in great shape.
[01:35:42.666 --> 01:35:49.968]  The maximum value of Facebook was $212, and now it's at $138 at the bottom.
[01:35:49.968 --> 01:35:52.709]  That's the fifth 52-week high and low.
[01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:59.891]  And what I was saying, well, a couple of months ago is that Zuckerberg doesn't know how to run the company.
[01:36:01.530 --> 01:36:03.433]  Sandberg doesn't know how to run it.
[01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:06.977]  She has been a serious problem to this company and other people.
[01:36:07.956 --> 01:36:15.518]  As a woman she wanted to talk about how great it was as a woman how she could lead a company and how smart she was and blah blah blah.
[01:36:15.518 --> 01:36:22.780]  Basically what you get is two Jewish exceedingly narcissistic characters who are very self-destructive.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:30.382]  I said it years ago and ironically she used her Jewishness to basically hire the
[01:36:32.139 --> 01:36:46.764]  Pro-Trump or let's say the opposition party company to create anti-Semitism and then make it sound as if they were being attacked for being Jews, which is despicable.
[01:36:46.764 --> 01:36:51.646]  I mean, I think that should be enough to get rid of her and to deface it completely.
[01:36:51.646 --> 01:36:57.268]  But the other part that was a real problem for Facebook, which I've been monitoring, and I said years ago,
[01:36:57.888 --> 01:37:11.744]  And that is the concept that Facebook in some ways was a positive force in the world when in fact it was a facilitator to the genocide that occurred in Myanmar and I had talked about that and that's when the 700,000 Rwandese
[01:37:13.926 --> 01:37:21.789]  The Muslims were getting killed by another so-called liberal who is the Prime Minister of Myanmar, Burma, named Aung Suu Kyi.
[01:37:21.789 --> 01:37:31.833]  So the notion that women are specially entitled to run anything and are better than men is really not proven by Sandberg or Aung Suu Kyi.
[01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:41.175]  So what we have here in Facebook is a very serious problem, both financially, politically, and in terms of viability.
[01:37:41.175 --> 01:37:46.836]  If I were the board of directors, I would throw out Zuckerberg, even though he owns 60% of the company.
[01:37:46.836 --> 01:37:54.177]  But at this rate, the company will go probably down to its lowest value right now in 52 weeks, which is 132.
[01:37:54.177 --> 01:37:57.278]  And my suspicion is it'll go below 120 and then to 110 and possibly 100.
[01:37:59.519 --> 01:38:02.768]  If it does that, then it will bring down the other fang stops.
[01:38:02.768 --> 01:38:07.040]  So Zuckerberg is not in a position to really run anything right now.
[01:38:07.822 --> 01:38:32.889]  The issue of Zuckerberg was very interesting to me because eight years ago, when I saw his social network, it was obvious to me that this was a young man who was self-aggrandizing, who was a misogynist, quite frankly, because what he did in order to create Facebook was to basically ask all his friends at Harvard to rate the looks of the women at Harvard.
[01:38:32.889 --> 01:38:35.610]  And if that's not misogyny, I don't know what it is.
[01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:38.332]  And in turn, he didn't turn out to be a geek.
[01:38:38.332 --> 01:38:44.578]  He really went to Phillips Exeter and in New Hampshire was the head of the fencing team.
[01:38:44.578 --> 01:38:53.546]  So everything about him bespeaks for a grandiosity and a narcissism that's so out of control but has no sense.
[01:38:53.546 --> 01:38:57.750]  And I should add, you're a psychiatrist too, so we're not just having people randomly up here saying this.
[01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:59.251]  But expanding on the bigger picture here,
[01:39:00.323 --> 01:39:05.267]  They're going after Facebook for supposed spying on people, but they're going after the least of it.
[01:39:05.267 --> 01:39:11.811]  And then they're using it to threaten the other tech companies to go along with the Democratic Party and others that won't even increase censorship.
[01:39:11.811 --> 01:39:15.274]  And this is one reason that the Republicans didn't keep the House in the midterms.
[01:39:15.274 --> 01:39:18.936]  And now they're saying all over the news they're going to intensify it.
[01:39:18.936 --> 01:39:21.178]  They're even trying to take my banking away.
[01:39:21.178 --> 01:39:22.639]  They're going after everybody I know.
[01:39:22.639 --> 01:39:24.500]  This is real authoritarianism.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:28.323]  And so I want to get into specifically what you think about what needs to be done
[01:39:29.103 --> 01:39:37.689]  To counter the fact that this is just green-lighted, even more censorship, that Trump says he's about to take action, but we haven't seen it yet.
[01:39:37.689 --> 01:39:42.253]  Well, whoa, I'm not sure you've got more censorship here than you think.
[01:39:42.253 --> 01:39:50.619]  The notion why the Democrats won on the midterms, and I was involved at the local level, it was very clear.
[01:39:50.619 --> 01:39:55.142]  Nancy Pelosi ran an incredibly effective race, whereas Trump did not.
[01:39:56.036 --> 01:40:02.320]  And I have to, you know, I'm not a fan of Nancy Pelosi, but I understand national politics.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:11.145]  When they came into every area of the country, she ran a very effective, very streamlined campaign, which was highly focused.
[01:40:11.325 --> 01:40:19.295]  But that's exactly what I'm saying is that Trump got elected because we had internet superiority and the grassroots went out and did the job for him.
[01:40:19.295 --> 01:40:24.721]  They ran the same campaign because his people told him, no sir, you really want it, going and doing rallies.
[01:40:24.721 --> 01:40:28.666]  One Trump supporter putting a viral video out is bigger than a whole Trump rally.
[01:40:28.986 --> 01:40:40.257]  And so they undercut everything and literally allowed the complete shadow banning basically of everybody and dialing back nationalist, conservatives, or anybody that is an anti-America 96%.
[01:40:40.257 --> 01:40:44.541]  That's why they lost and then allowed the targeting that Pelosi engaged in.
[01:40:46.727 --> 01:40:47.948]  Well, I'm not in agreement.
[01:40:47.948 --> 01:40:51.893]  I think we lost and here in Florida it was even clearer to me.
[01:40:51.893 --> 01:40:57.619]  I voted for DeSantis and I gave him money and we came in by only a few points.
[01:40:57.619 --> 01:40:59.721]  The same thing with Rick Scott.
[01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:05.988]  It had nothing to do with anything other than the fact that the campaigns on both sides were not effectively run.
[01:41:06.548 --> 01:41:10.211]  The Republican Party had a very poor leadership issue.
[01:41:10.211 --> 01:41:14.654]  Paul Ryan had left, and we had no basic message.
[01:41:14.654 --> 01:41:19.878]  It wasn't a type of, you know, just censorship that you were talking about.
[01:41:19.878 --> 01:41:22.100]  This was really operational problems.
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:26.203]  And what it meant for the future of the Republican Party is that we're in trouble.
[01:41:26.203 --> 01:41:31.387]  The same way I said to you about Facebook, the same way I'm telling you now, the Republican Party is in trouble.
[01:41:31.907 --> 01:41:33.689]  Because it has no leadership.
[01:41:33.689 --> 01:41:41.375]  If Trump is in fact the leader, which he's not, he's mercurial, he has his own problems, he's really out of control in many ways.
[01:41:41.972 --> 01:41:45.735]  The Republican Party doesn't know which way to go, and it doesn't have a leadership.
[01:41:45.735 --> 01:41:49.618]  Well, at least he's a cheerleader for the country, and is trying to do better deals on trade and things.
[01:41:49.618 --> 01:41:54.742]  But I agree that he doesn't have people around him that are really trying to turn the country around.
[01:41:54.742 --> 01:41:58.385]  Most of them are just trying to be popular with both sides and make a bunch of money.
[01:41:58.385 --> 01:42:00.887]  And the fact that... Take campaigns out of this.
[01:42:00.887 --> 01:42:07.792]  The fact that they're letting the Democrats come in with this mass targeting by cartels and censorship of certain groups is discriminatory.
[01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:13.976]  It's very, very dangerous, and it's a dereliction of duty if they don't start doing something.
[01:42:13.976 --> 01:42:15.537]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:42:15.537 --> 01:42:19.700]  Look, from the very beginning, I told you, he has a problem.
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:26.245]  If you want to put Jared Kushner in there, who has supported Mohammed bin Salman, who in turn killed Basaji,
[01:42:27.319 --> 01:42:31.302]  If you want to put in Ivana Trump, who has done absolutely nothing... Boy, you're right.
[01:42:31.302 --> 01:42:39.086]  You did say two years ago that you liked Trump, but the fact that Jared Kushner, you believe, could destroy Trump, and now continually... And I was right!
[01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:39.647]  I was right!
[01:42:39.647 --> 01:42:41.128]  We got a war in Yemen.
[01:42:41.128 --> 01:42:43.189]  My generals do not want that war.
[01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:45.711]  They want to pull out, and that's what's happening.
[01:42:45.711 --> 01:42:51.854]  We had a Prime Minister of Lebanon who was taken hostage... Well, let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:51.854 --> 01:42:52.775]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:55.297 --> 01:43:02.767]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.

[01:43:26.487 --> 01:43:27.647]  That's right at Lost Leader.
[01:43:27.647 --> 01:43:29.048]  Again, to get rid of inventory.
[01:43:29.048 --> 01:43:30.008]  So take advantage of that.
[01:43:30.008 --> 01:43:30.749]  It's an amazing system.
[01:43:31.269 --> 01:43:32.650]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:43:32.650 --> 01:43:33.711]  They're trying to defund us.
[01:43:33.711 --> 01:43:36.453]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[01:43:36.453 --> 01:43:40.697]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[01:43:40.697 --> 01:43:45.821]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:43:45.821 --> 01:43:46.822]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:43:46.822 --> 01:43:47.823]  Get great products.
[01:43:47.823 --> 01:43:49.664]  Get your Christmas shopping done early.
[01:43:49.664 --> 01:43:50.785]  And battle the globalists.
[01:43:50.785 --> 01:43:53.047]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:53.047 --> 01:43:54.288]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:43:54.907 --> 01:44:04.212]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:04.212 --> 01:44:07.073]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:07.073 --> 01:44:13.116]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:13.796 --> 01:44:20.040]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:26.344]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:26.344 --> 01:44:33.269]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:34.412 --> 01:44:47.440]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.682]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:51.682 --> 01:44:56.145]  X3, now available at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:56.145 --> 01:45:02.809]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.
[01:45:03.593 --> 01:45:12.859]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure Krill Oil concentrate.
[01:45:12.859 --> 01:45:21.925]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Atazanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[01:45:22.868 --> 01:45:34.301]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[01:45:34.301 --> 01:45:43.472]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[01:45:43.872 --> 01:45:50.278]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately, it's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:45:50.278 --> 01:45:56.163]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:56.163 --> 01:45:59.266]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[01:45:59.266 --> 01:46:02.168]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:02.168 --> 01:46:05.131]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:05.131 --> 01:46:09.695]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[01:46:10.749 --> 01:46:19.877]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:19.877 --> 01:46:25.241]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:25.241 --> 01:46:27.503]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:27.503 --> 01:46:31.026]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:46:31.026 --> 01:46:32.507]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:32.507 --> 01:46:34.589]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies.
[01:46:35.169 --> 01:46:38.492]  Weak emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there.
[01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.253]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:40.253 --> 01:46:42.235]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:42.235 --> 01:46:44.777]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:44.777 --> 01:46:49.761]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:49.761 --> 01:46:59.089]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods, powered by my Patriot supply.
[01:46:59.089 --> 01:47:01.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.096 --> 01:47:34.940]  Alright, we're back.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:41.943]  We're talking to Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[01:47:41.943 --> 01:47:43.303]  StevePachinick.com.
[01:47:43.303 --> 01:47:44.804]  Co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy.
[01:47:44.804 --> 01:47:45.544]  Really smart guy.
[01:47:45.544 --> 01:47:46.065]  Worked in the U.S.
[01:47:46.065 --> 01:47:47.725]  Intelligence State Department.
[01:47:47.725 --> 01:47:48.926]  You should know about history sometime.
[01:47:48.926 --> 01:47:50.487]  Really interesting stories you can tell.
[01:47:50.487 --> 01:47:53.788]  But specifically looking at internet censorship.
[01:47:54.839 --> 01:47:58.902]  I understand you can sit there and say the Republicans ran incompetent campaigns.
[01:47:58.902 --> 01:48:07.207]  Yeah, Hillary said you shut down Alex Jones, you shut down the conservatives, you kick them off YouTube and Facebook.
[01:48:07.207 --> 01:48:12.431]  They had heritage and they did it and it wasn't me they were really blocking.
[01:48:12.431 --> 01:48:17.695]  It was all the little old ladies that might put out 20-30 videos but one of them gets 50 million views.
[01:48:17.695 --> 01:48:22.578]  We were getting 20-30 million views on videos on Facebook for Trump and then
[01:48:23.504 --> 01:48:24.665]  Karl Rove doesn't want that.
[01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:35.351]  He'd rather get a $5 million package on Fox News and run those ads that only reach maybe the same 5 million, 6 million viewers over and over again who are already going to vote Republican.
[01:48:35.351 --> 01:48:36.632]  So I get it, Dr. Pacino.
[01:48:36.632 --> 01:48:37.292]  Yeah, targeted.
[01:48:37.292 --> 01:48:40.334]  The Democrats actually went after swing voters in key areas.
[01:48:40.334 --> 01:48:41.655]  I get it.
[01:48:41.655 --> 01:48:43.156]  The Republicans didn't even really do that.
[01:48:44.401 --> 01:48:45.522]  I get the incompetence.
[01:48:45.522 --> 01:48:48.843]  They're going to continue to be incompetent because the blue bloods just want the money.
[01:48:48.843 --> 01:49:04.652]  I'm saying Trump coming in with some anti-trust busting or threatening he's going to go after him, like the Democrats threatened Senator Warner and others to take over Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and they rolled over and peed all over themselves like a dog, and that's why the Democrats were able to win.
[01:49:05.316 --> 01:49:05.997]  The censorship of the internet
[01:49:19.765 --> 01:49:25.888]  Is something that you correctly brought out and you've been part of it and I've been part of it.
[01:49:25.888 --> 01:49:27.548]  So I'll give you an example.
[01:49:27.548 --> 01:49:37.012]  When I have my own YouTube and we have 50 or 60,000 people who view it, we're getting demonetized or we're getting less money.
[01:49:37.012 --> 01:49:42.834]  Is there a fascist element to Google, YouTube, Facebook and the others?
[01:49:42.834 --> 01:49:44.435]  The answer is absolutely yes.
[01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:47.672]  To what degree is that fascist element?
[01:49:47.672 --> 01:50:01.864]  It's to the degree that people like myself who will trade on a daily basis will either start shorting the stock or anonymous will come in or the others in the intelligence community will say it's enough.
[01:50:01.864 --> 01:50:04.906]  This no longer serves our national service.
[01:50:04.906 --> 01:50:08.369]  The truth of the matter is the Chinese are ahead of us.
[01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:10.291]  They have quantum encryption.
[01:50:10.291 --> 01:50:11.572]  We're not anywhere near them.
[01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:22.058]  But at the same time, we're wasting money on F-38s and fighter jets that are sitting there for $385 million with parts that came from China.
[01:50:22.058 --> 01:50:32.100]  But I don't have enough money to make a senior general the secretary of cyber war instead of putting him on the homeland security.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.580]  You are absolutely correct.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.141]  But the problem also lies in the White House.
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:42.373]  He is now changing elements and relying on his own family.
[01:50:42.373 --> 01:50:49.479]  Kushner, Ivana, Melania correctly fired a woman who was anti-Mattis.
[01:50:49.479 --> 01:50:57.725]  But if John Kelly leaves and you bring in Nick Ayers, who's a Republican operative and is going to run the White House, you're going to have troubles.
[01:50:57.725 --> 01:50:58.546]  I can predict that.
[01:50:59.046 --> 01:51:14.736]  If you keep John Bolton there, and he has been a neocon his whole life, has had no national security experience on the ground, avoided the draft, avoided going into Vietnam, although he was a proponent of war, and I've worked with John.
[01:51:14.736 --> 01:51:17.298]  I don't personally dislike him, but I don't admire him.
[01:51:17.298 --> 01:51:20.180]  I think he's a coward, as is the neocons.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.441]  Then you will have trouble.
[01:51:22.022 --> 01:51:33.284]  And the problem is we have put in Mattis, Kelly, Nakasone, Abizaid, all these generals and Pompeo because the civilians have not done a good job.
[01:51:33.909 --> 01:51:40.031]  I don't know how many times I've had to say it since the beginning of the Obama administration, the Bush Jr.
[01:51:40.031 --> 01:51:40.812]  administration.
[01:51:40.812 --> 01:51:44.913]  The fact that we have military generals is not an accident.
[01:51:44.913 --> 01:51:54.856]  And I will repeat it again, if civilians intend to go to war, and if the President does not know what he is doing, we will keep squeezing on the military side.
[01:51:54.856 --> 01:51:56.077]  And it's as simple as that.
[01:51:56.577 --> 01:52:00.902]  You can call me treasonous, you can call me whatever you want, but I said it years ago.
[01:52:00.902 --> 01:52:04.006]  I wrote about it in Maximum Vigilance 20 years ago.
[01:52:04.006 --> 01:52:08.451]  We can no longer force civilians who have had no military experience.
[01:52:08.451 --> 01:52:11.114]  It's not that they're warlike, it's the other way around.
[01:52:11.694 --> 01:52:13.876]  Mattis wants to get out of Afghanistan.
[01:52:13.876 --> 01:52:14.917]  And who do we appoint?
[01:52:14.917 --> 01:52:16.318]  Zalmay Khalilzad.
[01:52:16.318 --> 01:52:20.541]  One of the most corrupt, incompetent... No, I understand all that.
[01:52:20.541 --> 01:52:21.082]  Here's the difference.
[01:52:21.082 --> 01:52:23.984]  You have the Democrats openly allied with the Qaikoms.
[01:52:23.984 --> 01:52:26.105]  Out to get the country.
[01:52:26.105 --> 01:52:29.108]  Alex, the liberals have nothing to do with the Qaikoms.
[01:52:29.108 --> 01:52:30.489]  No, I know the neo-cons are... I get it.
[01:52:31.115 --> 01:52:32.596]  I know the neocons are heavily involved too.
[01:52:32.596 --> 01:52:35.358]  So the neocons are bad, the liberal establishment's bad.
[01:52:35.358 --> 01:52:41.502]  All I'm saying is at least Trump's trying to get jobs back and promote that a nation-state exists.
[01:52:41.502 --> 01:52:43.543]  I'm not even here defending Trump.
[01:52:43.543 --> 01:52:51.629]  I'm very upset that more isn't happening and that people like Jared Kushner having dinner with the head of Google who sits there and glad hands him.
[01:52:52.469 --> 01:53:05.675]  And so I'm not enemies with Jared Kushner, but certainly he's the guy that sold Trump, reportedly, on this whole deal with this Prince whoever, and then it looks like this whole thing has blown up spectacularly.
[01:53:05.675 --> 01:53:06.255]  Correct.
[01:53:06.255 --> 01:53:15.019]  The point is, Alex, you have to direct some of your attacks to really where the incompetency lies within our own administration.
[01:53:16.232 --> 01:53:18.294]  Trump can only do what he can do.
[01:53:18.294 --> 01:53:22.138]  He came in, he's charismatic, he's mercurial.
[01:53:22.138 --> 01:53:25.962]  We've tried to stabilize that mercurial, but he will continue.
[01:53:25.962 --> 01:53:36.512]  But if he cannot build an infrastructure, and he did a brilliant job of appointing Nancy Pelosi, who's 80 years old, to say, look, she has to remain the Speaker of the House.
[01:53:36.512 --> 01:53:36.833]  Why?
[01:53:37.333 --> 01:53:39.836]  Because she and he are very much alike.
[01:53:39.836 --> 01:53:43.839]  They both come out of a background of the mafia construction.
[01:53:43.839 --> 01:53:49.445]  I remember Pelosi's father was the mayor of Baltimore when I had hotels there.
[01:53:49.445 --> 01:53:51.166]  Trump's father was in the mob.
[01:53:51.166 --> 01:53:54.129]  He had to build construction in Queens and Brooklyn.
[01:53:54.129 --> 01:54:00.635]  They both understand what it takes to create a unity function, but they have to build infrastructure.
[01:54:00.635 --> 01:54:01.356]  We don't have it.
[01:54:01.952 --> 01:54:03.553]  We need to keep moving on.
[01:54:03.553 --> 01:54:06.135]  We need to put more money into Cyber Command.
[01:54:06.135 --> 01:54:08.416]  I need more money into schools.
[01:54:08.416 --> 01:54:11.558]  I have kids whose education level is so bad.
[01:54:11.558 --> 01:54:20.203]  I'm in a state where the kids' education is the 46th in the state in Florida, and they say to me, oh, give the teachers more money.
[01:54:20.203 --> 01:54:22.004]  Well, Rick Scott didn't do anything.
[01:54:22.004 --> 01:54:23.565]  Bill Nelson hasn't done it.
[01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:25.346]  Let's see what the state... What I'm saying is,
[01:54:27.009 --> 01:54:37.259]  Soros is a figurehead of it, obviously, but the whole UN-Globals combine wants to collapse nation states, discredit the borders, discredit any ethos of believing in your nation.
[01:54:37.259 --> 01:54:38.960]  If we lose that, we're done.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:41.683]  And so the big thing that Trump's doing versus the Democrats...
[01:54:42.023 --> 01:54:44.124]  Alex, I always enjoy your analogies in your description.
[01:54:44.124 --> 01:54:45.704]  The truth of the matter is,
[01:55:06.878 --> 01:55:14.389]  Soros is one of the few people who went after Facebook and said this is a very dangerous entity.
[01:55:14.389 --> 01:55:19.236]  And he particularly went after Zuckerberg and Sandberg saying she has no idea what's going on.
[01:55:19.236 --> 01:55:21.700]  Because he wanted to bully them into letting him direct them.
[01:55:22.575 --> 01:55:31.000]  No, not direct him, but telling them exactly where the problem would lie in terms of the ongoing genocide.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.883]  Look, I met him 40 years ago when we were in the Soviet Union.
[01:55:35.883 --> 01:55:37.423]  I didn't know who he was.
[01:55:37.423 --> 01:55:40.105]  He used his own money to take Sakharov off.
[01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:45.233]  No, I know he was used during the Cold War, and I get all that, but it came out in the WikiLeaks.
[01:55:45.233 --> 01:55:48.355]  He wants to control what can be published.
[01:55:48.355 --> 01:55:49.556]  He has a database.
[01:55:49.556 --> 01:55:53.779]  Google and people are using him to say what should be up and what should be down.
[01:55:53.779 --> 01:55:56.681]  He's the real threat.
[01:55:56.681 --> 01:56:01.325]  Look, he's been in and out of so many things.
[01:56:01.325 --> 01:56:02.526]  There's no one man.
[01:56:02.526 --> 01:56:04.988]  I mean, honestly, he's not the threat that you think.
[01:56:04.988 --> 01:56:06.669]  No, I know what he represents, though.
[01:56:07.481 --> 01:56:08.842]  But what does he represent?
[01:56:08.842 --> 01:56:14.104]  The Council on Foreign Relations, which I left, isn't even relevant.
[01:56:14.104 --> 01:56:14.824]  Do you understand?
[01:56:14.824 --> 01:56:20.907]  I mean, the relevancy of all these institutions are gone, thanks to you, others, myself.
[01:56:20.907 --> 01:56:21.807]  They're not relevant.
[01:56:21.807 --> 01:56:26.169]  No, no, I agree that's going on, but still, when they give orders, things happen.
[01:56:26.169 --> 01:56:29.251]  Doesn't mean it does what they want, but it still has repercussions.
[01:56:29.251 --> 01:56:31.572]  Like, they thought censoring me would get rid of us.
[01:56:32.296 --> 01:56:37.901]  It actually caused us to, like, mutate, get even more powerful in a way, but I don't even want to tell them that.
[01:56:37.901 --> 01:56:42.564]  The point is, is that... But the point is, you are more powerful.
[01:56:42.564 --> 01:56:44.426]  They made a big... That's my point.
[01:56:44.426 --> 01:56:48.769]  They made a serious judgment call, and I said it when you were on the air.
[01:56:48.769 --> 01:56:56.235]  We would not let you go off the air, but in fact, what happened is, you became even more popular than before.
[01:56:56.235 --> 01:56:58.177]  And people talked about it.
[01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:00.739]  But the answer is, how are you getting transmitted?
[01:57:01.528 --> 01:57:04.131]  You know how you're getting transmitted.
[01:57:04.131 --> 01:57:05.613]  We know how you're getting transmitted.
[01:57:05.613 --> 01:57:09.117]  But the truth is, Soros isn't the problem.
[01:57:09.117 --> 01:57:10.999]  The Democrats are finished.
[01:57:10.999 --> 01:57:12.020]  That's not an issue.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:12.660]  Even the Republicans...
[01:57:19.835 --> 01:57:25.679]  The East is going to collapse, and the West Coast is all going to move into the Midwest, and Texas will be the new capital, and you know, all that stuff.
[01:57:25.679 --> 01:57:38.107]  So, I know you're a smart guy, so I want to get where you think, the way we keep the country going, and we don't have a nuclear war, and I agree that Mattis and people have been trying to stop wars, that's a good thing, and I agree the neocons are a big problem.
[01:57:38.107 --> 01:57:44.652]  In fact, really, if you look at it, in fact the neocons were bragging at a defense field in Germany last month that they're going to take even more conservatives out.
[01:57:45.312 --> 01:57:50.978]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:57:50.978 --> 01:57:52.580]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:53.221]  It's a good thing.
[01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:56.824]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:57:56.824 --> 01:57:59.187]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:57:59.187 --> 01:58:00.708]  I learned what the best was.
[01:58:00.708 --> 01:58:05.833]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:58:05.833 --> 01:58:06.334]  It's amazing.
[01:58:06.554 --> 01:58:09.117]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:58:09.117 --> 01:58:15.963]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:58:15.963 --> 01:58:17.625]  He has a glut of them.
[01:58:17.625 --> 01:58:20.027]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:58:20.027 --> 01:58:21.688]  When it's discounted usually $200, it's $127!
[01:58:25.968 --> 01:58:30.150]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:32.270]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:34.591]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:58:34.591 --> 01:58:35.211]  It's amazing.
[01:58:35.211 --> 01:58:46.335]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:58:46.335 --> 01:58:51.617]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:58:51.617 --> 01:58:53.958]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party.
[01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:59.674]  Leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:58:59.674 --> 01:59:02.276]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:59:02.276 --> 01:59:05.718]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:59:05.718 --> 01:59:08.340]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:10.642]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:59:10.642 --> 01:59:23.050]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com,
[01:59:24.207 --> 01:59:27.929]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:59:27.929 --> 01:59:29.090]  We'll win.
[01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:31.931]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:39.155]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:59:39.155 --> 01:59:42.857]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[01:59:42.857 --> 01:59:44.418]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:59:44.418 --> 01:59:45.278]  We need your support.
[01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:49.060]  I'm counting on you.
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.722]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.687 --> 01:59:59.308]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:59:59.308 --> 02:00:03.090]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.807 --> 02:00:37.848]  You know, I tend to do research for the broadcast and they get so wound up before I go on air that I just go in a hundred directions.
[02:00:37.848 --> 02:00:42.229]  A lot of times the first hour and I start settling down at the second and third hour.
[02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:53.231]  And when we come back, I want to open the phones up too, just in general, to discuss the election fraud and what do you think the president should do?
[02:00:53.231 --> 02:00:56.632]  What should we do when brazenly Democrats all across the country
[02:00:58.755 --> 02:01:09.080]  In famous counties who've been convicted for fraud, the same individuals are involved and they're doing it in front of the whole world nakedly.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:22.486]  What do we do when we're faced with criminal activity that is stealing control of our nation so they can carry out even bigger enterprises?
[02:01:22.486 --> 02:01:24.327]  What do you do with Debbie Washerman Schultz?
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:37.825]  And people like this, known for their criminal activity, are willing to carry this out.
[02:01:37.825 --> 02:01:48.290]  And all it's doing is making them more brazen, more arrogant, more full of chutzpah.
[02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.731]  How do you counter something like this?
[02:01:49.731 --> 02:01:52.132]  And what does the President need to do?
[02:01:52.132 --> 02:01:53.692]  That's the question I'm asking you.
[02:01:53.692 --> 02:01:54.593]  I'm going to give the number out.
[02:01:57.136 --> 02:01:57.496]  877-789-2539.
[02:01:57.496 --> 02:02:00.017]  Let's do first-time callers.
[02:02:00.017 --> 02:02:00.958]  877-789-2539.
[02:02:00.958 --> 02:02:01.498]  877-789-Alex.
[02:02:01.498 --> 02:02:14.363]  Also, when we come back, I played part of this at the very start of the show, but I'm going to play all six minutes of it because it's really powerful.
[02:02:14.363 --> 02:02:26.307]  Tucker Carlson goes to bat for Infowars last night, and he went to bat for his own children's free speech and the future of this country, and just points out
[02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:30.108]  It's not hypocrisy.
[02:02:30.108 --> 02:02:32.790]  Because CNN's not being censored.
[02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:35.952]  So they lie and say they're being censored when they're not by the President and others.
[02:02:35.952 --> 02:02:42.516]  They act like they're the bastion of defending it, when they're the ones that are really attacking.
[02:02:42.516 --> 02:02:44.057]  Article's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:44.057 --> 02:02:45.217]  It's very important to share it.
[02:02:45.217 --> 02:02:46.478]  If you don't share it, nobody will.
[02:02:46.478 --> 02:02:48.199]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[02:02:48.199 --> 02:02:52.221]  Tucker Carlson's epic takedown of CNN.
[02:02:52.221 --> 02:02:54.023]  One of free speech's greatest enemies.
[02:02:54.023 --> 02:02:56.404]  So that's, that's the start.
[02:02:57.765 --> 02:03:11.511]  Of next segment because it ties in to the control corporate press acting like Trump's this dictator who's coming after the media.
[02:03:11.511 --> 02:03:13.672]  And it's just all lies.
[02:03:13.672 --> 02:03:16.993]  And I was watching Tucker Carlson this morning from last night.
[02:03:16.993 --> 02:03:25.957]  And while he was talking about and his guest was talking about all the horrible things that the Democrats and Obama and CNN has done to the free press,
[02:03:26.767 --> 02:03:28.729]  Arresting reporters, you name it.
[02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:35.093]  It was making me think of all these other things they didn't even get to.
[02:03:35.093 --> 02:03:41.738]  I mean, they have done a lot of really, really horrible stuff.
[02:03:41.738 --> 02:03:44.820]  And it was making me sick to my stomach when I was listening to it this morning.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.543]  And literally, Carlson then goes, it makes you nauseated.
[02:03:50.583 --> 02:03:59.810]  Because when you know all this stuff, and you know all their lies, and I heard Carlson reminding everybody of the chain of lies with his guest, it really is.
[02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:15.803]  I was getting nauseated and getting a headache, because it's just thinking about all the crap they've done, and then they've got the guts, the bravado.
[02:04:15.803 --> 02:04:19.306]  Guts isn't even the word.
[02:04:19.306 --> 02:04:20.207]  They've just got...
[02:04:21.835 --> 02:04:24.196]  No respect for anybody.
[02:04:24.196 --> 02:04:32.941]  And they sit there, and they tell the most fantastic lies you've ever seen, that are verifiably not true when they're saying them.
[02:04:32.941 --> 02:04:35.142]  This is called gaslighting.
[02:04:35.142 --> 02:04:37.003]  And it really makes me angry.
[02:04:37.003 --> 02:04:39.524]  When we come back, we're gonna play...
[02:04:40.763 --> 02:04:42.306]  The report.
[02:04:42.306 --> 02:04:47.814]  And tie it in to CNN bitching and complaining that they're being censored by Trump.
[02:04:47.814 --> 02:04:49.496]  Which again is another lie.
[02:04:49.496 --> 02:04:51.059]  They're the censors.
[02:04:51.059 --> 02:04:52.321]  They're the pigs.
[02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:53.062]  They're the liars.
[02:04:53.815 --> 02:05:03.101]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:03.101 --> 02:05:05.962]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:05.962 --> 02:05:12.006]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:12.686 --> 02:05:18.930]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:25.234]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:25.234 --> 02:05:32.159]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:33.303 --> 02:05:46.337]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:46.337 --> 02:05:50.601]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:50.601 --> 02:05:53.284]  X3, now available at mpullerslife.com.
[02:06:07.882 --> 02:06:11.564]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:06:11.564 --> 02:06:14.506]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:14.506 --> 02:06:17.367]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:17.367 --> 02:06:20.309]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:06:20.309 --> 02:06:24.952]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:06:24.952 --> 02:06:27.073]  Go tell that long-tongued lie.
[02:06:27.073 --> 02:06:36.378]  We are now into the second hour of the global broadcast, the most censored, most demonized, most lied-about transmission in the world.
[02:06:37.242 --> 02:06:37.884]  For good reason.
[02:06:37.884 --> 02:06:39.067]  We've got the Globalist number.
[02:06:39.067 --> 02:06:40.551]  We know they're in-game.
[02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:41.614]  We know how they operate.
[02:06:41.614 --> 02:06:43.379]  We know how to stop them.
[02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:48.292]  So again, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:48.292 --> 02:06:49.352]  until 3 p.m.
[02:06:49.352 --> 02:06:49.672]  Central.
[02:06:49.672 --> 02:06:52.334]  We're here at the War Room with Owen Schroyer and others.
[02:06:52.334 --> 02:06:54.775]  Comes up 3 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[02:06:54.775 --> 02:06:55.796]  David Knight, 8 a.m.
[02:06:55.796 --> 02:06:56.156]  Central.
[02:06:56.156 --> 02:07:01.139]  And remember, we're on hundreds of AM and FM stations, hundreds of TV stations and cable stations.
[02:07:01.139 --> 02:07:04.361]  However you're watching or listening, you are the power of free speech.
[02:07:04.361 --> 02:07:08.863]  You are the power of getting the word out to everyone you know.
[02:07:08.863 --> 02:07:14.066]  You are the ones that are overpowering the censors and big techs attempt to silence us.
[02:07:16.793 --> 02:07:28.258]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show where you can subscribe to the free podcast, where you can find all the special live events, where you can find all the special video feeds, affiliate pages and so much more.
[02:07:28.258 --> 02:07:32.599]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:32.599 --> 02:07:37.321]  And I want to thank you all for spreading the word despite their attempts to destroy us and shut us down.
[02:07:37.321 --> 02:07:39.082]  They have failed so far.
[02:07:39.082 --> 02:07:41.343]  Thank you for standing with us.
[02:07:41.343 --> 02:07:44.564]  And I want to say thank you to Tucker Carlson for standing with the First Amendment.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:48.721]  And he is birthright and you're birthright.
[02:07:48.721 --> 02:07:54.502]  He's been the strongest in any mainstream media format to defend free speech.
[02:07:54.502 --> 02:07:56.262]  Michael Savage has as well.
[02:07:56.262 --> 02:08:02.984]  Matt Drudge has online been a powerful force for free speech.
[02:08:02.984 --> 02:08:10.325]  And he also predicted years ago in the studio in an exclusive interview what was coming in the future because he was told by members of the Supreme Court and others.
[02:08:10.325 --> 02:08:12.426]  We're now witnessing that endgame.
[02:08:12.426 --> 02:08:14.726]  They were going to carry out whether Hillary got elected or not.
[02:08:15.919 --> 02:08:23.722]  They're going to have hearings in January claiming that Trump has violated the rights of the Washington Post and CNN and is trying to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:08:23.722 --> 02:08:24.742]  None of that's happening.
[02:08:24.742 --> 02:08:31.384]  He's speaking out when they lie about him and say he's a Nazi or all these other horrible names.
[02:08:31.384 --> 02:08:40.627]  They're now claiming countering them is a violation of their free speech.
[02:08:40.627 --> 02:08:42.988]  They're now suing the President in federal court
[02:08:43.797 --> 02:08:49.959]  Saying that Jim Acosta did not touch a woman and that Trump has no right to kick him out because of his heckling and violating decorum.
[02:08:49.959 --> 02:08:52.020]  Anybody else would be thrown out acting like this.
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:57.461]  CNN lobbied last year to have us removed and it was done.
[02:08:57.461 --> 02:09:02.183]  CNN put pressure on the press secretary.
[02:09:02.183 --> 02:09:03.883]  Came a big national story.
[02:09:03.883 --> 02:09:05.964]  And so our press passes were revoked.
[02:09:05.964 --> 02:09:08.425]  No reason given.
[02:09:08.425 --> 02:09:10.345]  Dr. Corsi was our reporter there.
[02:09:10.345 --> 02:09:12.206]  Two number one New York Times best-selling books.
[02:09:14.031 --> 02:09:14.731]  Ph.D.
[02:09:14.731 --> 02:09:19.014]  in political science and international finance.
[02:09:19.014 --> 02:09:22.496]  And they said, CNN says you should not have it.
[02:09:22.496 --> 02:09:26.139]  And so you're taken off the air.
[02:09:26.139 --> 02:09:27.399]  So this is their attitude.
[02:09:27.399 --> 02:09:28.300]  This is what they're doing.
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.842]  And now they're the paragon of free speech defense.
[02:09:31.842 --> 02:09:42.269]  When they lobbied and harassed our sponsors and mercilessly lied and went after publishing companies and got one of the head publisher guys fired because they were trying to do a book deal with me.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:50.005]  It's just, they are true authoritarians, and then their little attack dog gets thrown out, lies about it.
[02:09:50.005 --> 02:09:59.732]  The whole press joins him, including Fox News Corp itself, joined the lawsuit against the President, saying, you will let Jim Acosta run around and scream and yell at everyone.
[02:09:59.732 --> 02:10:03.015]  And you will let him stay in there and manhandle women.
[02:10:03.015 --> 02:10:03.836]  And you have no right.
[02:10:03.836 --> 02:10:05.437]  Well, Trump knows this, Judge May say.
[02:10:06.323 --> 02:10:09.165]  Yes, the cost is God, but the Supreme Court will shoot it down.
[02:10:09.165 --> 02:10:12.406]  Just like the Supreme Court said, no, the President does control the borders.
[02:10:12.406 --> 02:10:20.231]  Oh, and that caravan started arriving in San Diego, wanting all the free goods, and taunting the military and Border Patrol yesterday.
[02:10:20.231 --> 02:10:22.832]  Oh, but it didn't exist, remember?
[02:10:22.832 --> 02:10:26.614]  First it existed, but when we didn't want it, they said, oh, it doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[02:10:26.614 --> 02:10:28.035]  This is the level of deception.
[02:10:28.035 --> 02:10:33.478]  So here's Tucker Carlson last night, going to bat for all of our basic free speech, and going to bat for reality.
[02:10:34.681 --> 02:10:38.104]  Well, there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington right now.
[02:10:38.104 --> 02:10:38.845]  Good.
[02:10:38.845 --> 02:10:40.226]  We're for free speech.
[02:10:40.226 --> 02:10:47.412]  The question is, are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech?
[02:10:47.412 --> 02:10:50.095]  Hashtag Basta, whatever that means.
[02:10:50.095 --> 02:10:58.922]  We'll investigate the assault on free speech after the break.
[02:10:58.922 --> 02:11:01.084]  In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and
[02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:03.742]  I don't know.
[02:11:25.824 --> 02:11:35.727]  So we know who's for free speech and who's against it, and we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all of a sudden.
[02:11:35.727 --> 02:11:37.588]  Take CNN, for example.
[02:11:37.588 --> 02:11:47.231]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the Internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[02:11:47.231 --> 02:11:49.172]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing
[02:11:51.764 --> 02:12:01.947]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech because it was exactly that.
[02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:04.528]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[02:12:04.528 --> 02:12:10.229]  Last year the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme.
[02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:15.671]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him again.
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:21.266]  Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech, only when it's their speech.
[02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:29.475]  You'll notice, by the way, that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents.
[02:12:29.475 --> 02:12:32.278]  Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government.
[02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:32.979]  So is the BBC.
[02:12:33.869 --> 02:12:36.951]  Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national.
[02:12:36.951 --> 02:12:42.155]  This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign agent.
[02:12:42.155 --> 02:12:50.841]  But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.
[02:12:50.841 --> 02:12:55.065]  So call CNN what you will, but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment.
[02:12:55.065 --> 02:12:55.585]  They are not.
[02:12:56.374 --> 02:13:01.177]  Victor Davis Hanson is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close watcher of all this, he joins us tonight.
[02:13:01.177 --> 02:13:04.438]  So I just want to be clear, we're always for free speech.
[02:13:04.438 --> 02:13:09.461]  Especially speech that's offensive, even by obnoxious White House correspondents.
[02:13:09.461 --> 02:13:16.325]  But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say what they think is true, to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the First Amendment is nauseating.
[02:13:16.765 --> 02:13:24.491]  Yeah, I think when people saw the suit, they asked themselves, was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta had said negatively that got him kicked out?
[02:13:24.491 --> 02:13:25.312]  And the answer was no.
[02:13:25.312 --> 02:13:27.934]  Is there anybody, MSNBC, do they get kicked out?
[02:13:27.934 --> 02:13:29.094]  The answer is no.
[02:13:29.094 --> 02:13:31.476]  Do other CNN reporters get kicked out?
[02:13:31.476 --> 02:13:32.417]  No, they have passes.
[02:13:32.417 --> 02:13:34.939]  So, it was a particular type of behavior.
[02:13:35.859 --> 02:13:42.402]  I mean, if you're arguing a case before the Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or interrupt the justice.
[02:13:42.402 --> 02:13:48.244]  They'll kick you out, and if you do it another time, they'll say, we don't want you pleading a case before the Supreme Court.
[02:13:48.244 --> 02:13:51.425]  Jim Costa can't go in there barefooted and say, I want to express myself.
[02:13:51.425 --> 02:13:55.147]  There are certain protocols and norms of behavior, and he's violated them.
[02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:59.529]  That's one issue, and then it's not, this is sort of a psychodrama, Tucker.
[02:13:59.529 --> 02:14:06.373]  I mean, remember that the prior administration monitored 20 AP reporters and Fox's own James Rosen.
[02:14:06.373 --> 02:14:09.514]  Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James Rosen from CNN.
[02:14:09.514 --> 02:14:12.396]  Thanks.
[02:14:12.396 --> 02:14:23.301]  Yeah, they prosecuted hundreds of journalists and whistleblowers at a level worse than Abraham Lincoln did in a war.
[02:14:23.301 --> 02:14:25.042]  He broke Abraham Lincoln's records.
[02:14:27.256 --> 02:14:35.484]  Using Trading with the Enemy Act on people reporting on Obama's corruption and working with the Taliban and groups like that.
[02:14:35.484 --> 02:14:45.393]  They tried to put Fox News reporters in jail for reporting on North Korea and public info and going to defense briefings that were public at the Pentagon.
[02:14:45.393 --> 02:14:52.840]  And then they tried to put multiple Fox reporters in prison for going to public defense talks.
[02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:56.309]  Oh, but all the press!
[02:14:56.309 --> 02:14:57.770]  Oh, Trump's getting it!
[02:14:57.770 --> 02:15:02.572]  Oh, he's... Remember when they went to the older lady's house who is a listener but didn't want to come on?
[02:15:02.572 --> 02:15:07.293]  And they said, your Facebook's got a couple hundred people on it here in Broward County.
[02:15:07.293 --> 02:15:09.474]  They didn't want anybody voting there against them.
[02:15:09.474 --> 02:15:10.714]  You're a Russian agent!
[02:15:10.714 --> 02:15:11.975]  She goes, I know every person on there.
[02:15:11.975 --> 02:15:14.916]  Well, a Russian bot posted something on there.
[02:15:14.916 --> 02:15:16.936]  Oh, a Russian bot sent a link.
[02:15:16.936 --> 02:15:22.218]  Turned out 80% of the Russian bots were hired by the Democrats, because you can go hire Russian companies to spam.
[02:15:24.059 --> 02:15:26.961]  We're gonna come back and play a little bit more of this, but this is just crazy.
[02:15:26.961 --> 02:15:30.865]  And play that clip, reminding everybody they're bullying.
[02:15:30.865 --> 02:15:33.707]  But this guy's really smart, Victor Davis.
[02:15:33.707 --> 02:15:34.448]  Handsome.
[02:15:34.448 --> 02:15:36.790]  He rattles off a bunch of stuff I've forgotten about.
[02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:44.616]  And it's just like, it'd be like Hitler being the chief judge at Nuremberg and passing judgment on Nazis that followed his orders.
[02:15:44.616 --> 02:15:47.979]  I mean, CNN is the most anti-free speech group in the world.
[02:15:47.979 --> 02:15:51.602]  They are anti-American, filthy criminals.
[02:15:51.602 --> 02:15:52.143]  They're sick!
[02:15:52.777 --> 02:15:59.142]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:15:59.142 --> 02:16:02.185]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:16:02.185 --> 02:16:08.089]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:11.893]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:16:11.893 --> 02:16:13.154]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:16:13.154 --> 02:16:14.495]  Who do we fight for?
[02:16:14.495 --> 02:16:20.700]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:22.141]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:16:22.995 --> 02:16:24.216]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:24.216 --> 02:16:28.137]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:28.137 --> 02:16:29.678]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:29.678 --> 02:16:32.639]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:32.639 --> 02:16:38.182]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:38.182 --> 02:16:39.382]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:39.382 --> 02:16:42.324]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:42.324 --> 02:16:44.545]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:16:48.987 --> 02:16:51.328]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:16:52.609 --> 02:16:56.251]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[02:16:56.251 --> 02:17:03.615]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:08.518]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:17:08.518 --> 02:17:09.358]  There is.
[02:17:09.358 --> 02:17:10.939]  It's RightSocial.net.
[02:17:10.939 --> 02:17:12.300]  RightSocial.net.

[02:17:22.445 --> 02:17:25.067]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:17:25.067 --> 02:17:26.208]  Get back to nature.

[02:17:58.286 --> 02:18:01.749]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:01.749 --> 02:18:03.531]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:03.531 --> 02:18:06.794]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[02:18:06.794 --> 02:18:13.580]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:18.665]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:18:19.005 --> 02:18:25.110]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:28.092]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:28.092 --> 02:18:29.173]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:29.173 --> 02:18:32.996]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:32.996 --> 02:18:35.038]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:35.038 --> 02:18:36.339]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:36.339 --> 02:18:37.400]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:39.061]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:39.061 --> 02:18:41.983]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:41.983 --> 02:18:43.304]  I will never falter.
[02:18:43.304 --> 02:18:45.626]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:45.626 --> 02:18:46.307]  I physically will.
[02:18:46.647 --> 02:18:49.510]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:18:49.510 --> 02:18:55.237]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:22.428]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:19:23.576 --> 02:19:27.419]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[02:19:56.898 --> 02:19:59.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:16.297 --> 02:20:22.200]  You know, CNN didn't just dox a man that made a funny meme of CNN's head on top of a wrestler that Trump was wrestling.
[02:20:42.825 --> 02:20:46.928]  They didn't just threaten to fire him and get him to lose his job by doxing him.
[02:20:46.928 --> 02:20:52.712]  They would go to people's houses and accuse them of being Russian agents because they were getting people organized in Florida to vote.
[02:20:52.712 --> 02:20:53.793]  Remember this video?
[02:20:53.793 --> 02:20:57.535]  This real harassment?
[02:20:57.535 --> 02:20:58.356]  The Russians?
[02:20:58.356 --> 02:21:02.078]  I don't care if they were involved or not.
[02:21:02.078 --> 02:21:04.400]  That, to me, is the least important thing.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:06.501]  But they were involved with you.
[02:21:06.501 --> 02:21:07.442]  Did you guys know that?
[02:21:08.658 --> 02:21:10.219]  They weren't involved with us.
[02:21:10.219 --> 02:21:16.724]  You know, just make sure that you report it correctly, that, you know... But you guys were involved with Being Patriotic, right?
[02:21:16.724 --> 02:21:25.210]  Very, very patriotic, but not... Being Patriotic was the group that contacted and helped organize some of these activities that you posted on your own Facebook account.
[02:21:26.204 --> 02:21:27.925]  Those were legitimate.
[02:21:27.925 --> 02:21:29.386]  Those were Russians.
[02:21:29.386 --> 02:21:30.446]  They were not Russians.
[02:21:30.446 --> 02:21:32.127]  I don't go with the Russians.
[02:21:32.127 --> 02:21:34.208]  That group was Russian.
[02:21:34.208 --> 02:21:35.969]  I have nothing to do with the Russians.
[02:21:35.969 --> 02:21:37.830]  Well, apparently you did.
[02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:38.451]  No.
[02:21:38.451 --> 02:21:41.052]  Maybe you didn't know it, but you did.
[02:21:41.052 --> 02:21:43.934]  When you're talking like this, I don't want to have anything to do with you.
[02:21:43.934 --> 02:21:49.397]  Well, I'm talking what's based on the... Those people that were with me were all Trump supporters.
[02:21:49.397 --> 02:21:51.118]  Very, very much so.
[02:21:51.118 --> 02:21:53.139]  And all apparently following the direction
[02:21:53.949 --> 02:21:58.811]  Of groups that were associated with Russians who were actually infiltrated.
[02:22:08.985 --> 02:22:11.347]  Trump supporters, okay?
[02:22:11.347 --> 02:22:16.891]  But did you realize that you guys were in communication electronically with Russians?
[02:22:16.891 --> 02:22:17.712]  Not me, I don't know.
[02:22:17.712 --> 02:22:19.553]  You were posting stuff on the Facebook.
[02:22:19.553 --> 02:22:25.678]  Hillary Clinton was, and so was all her bandits.
[02:22:25.678 --> 02:22:27.799]  You were in charge of the Facebook account, right?
[02:22:27.799 --> 02:22:30.461]  You were posting and reposting almost word for word
[02:22:32.091 --> 02:22:37.254]  The information that was coming out of this Internet Research Agency in St.
[02:22:37.254 --> 02:22:38.275]  Petersburg.
[02:22:38.275 --> 02:22:39.636]  You don't believe that?
[02:22:39.636 --> 02:22:41.157]  Nope.
[02:22:41.157 --> 02:22:46.040]  Thank you!
[02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:47.160]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:48.061]  There's the American flag.
[02:22:48.061 --> 02:22:50.542]  They go show her address, her name, where she lives.
[02:22:50.542 --> 02:22:53.644]  And it turned out, of course, none of that was true.
[02:22:53.644 --> 02:22:59.308]  The Internet Research Agency is really a Western intelligence front interfacing with Russia.
[02:22:59.989 --> 02:23:03.931]  They put billions in a year trying to overthrow Russia through these different projects.
[02:23:03.931 --> 02:23:05.792]  Soros has huge operations in Russia.
[02:23:05.792 --> 02:23:13.095]  Then they'll point at those, almost all of it supporting Hillary, and then come back and say that then Russians are involved.
[02:23:13.095 --> 02:23:18.297]  That's like saying Americans are involved in Russia, or Japanese are involved in America.
[02:23:18.297 --> 02:23:19.378]  Russia's huge.
[02:23:19.378 --> 02:23:21.639]  There's all these businesses going back and forth.
[02:23:21.639 --> 02:23:24.720]  The truth is, 80% of campaign spending that went on
[02:23:25.675 --> 02:23:32.261]  With any Russian companies was against Donald J. Trump because 80% of the campaign money got spent by Hillary.
[02:23:34.247 --> 02:23:36.468]  Simply mind-blowing.
[02:23:36.468 --> 02:23:38.348]  And again, we now know the Russia thing was made up.
[02:23:38.348 --> 02:23:39.189]  We knew it at the time.
[02:23:39.189 --> 02:23:40.949]  It was all a canard.
[02:23:40.949 --> 02:23:45.090]  A red herring to cover up what Hillary and Mueller and the rest of them were involved in.
[02:23:45.090 --> 02:23:46.811]  But there's the real doxing.
[02:23:46.811 --> 02:23:47.931]  There's the real harassment.
[02:23:47.931 --> 02:23:49.232]  Everything they accused me of.
[02:23:49.232 --> 02:23:56.234]  They said I was talked to a CNN reporter rudely and said he was a horrible person for getting us banned off all those platforms.
[02:23:56.234 --> 02:23:57.234]  Which was true!
[02:23:57.234 --> 02:23:59.515]  He's a public figure in a public space.
[02:23:59.515 --> 02:24:00.275]  I was talking to him.
[02:24:04.241 --> 02:24:05.862]  Oliver Darcy.
[02:24:05.862 --> 02:24:07.203]  They go, that's why you're banned.
[02:24:07.203 --> 02:24:09.625]  You talk to the Royal CNN.
[02:24:09.625 --> 02:24:15.070]  But they can go harass a woman in her house and accuse her of being a Russian, which turned out wasn't even true.
[02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:18.813]  Here's Tucker Carlson breaking it down with an expert from the Hoover Institute.
[02:24:20.062 --> 02:24:26.145]  My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General.
[02:24:26.145 --> 02:24:27.766]  This is a violation of press freedom.
[02:24:27.766 --> 02:24:28.806]  We didn't hear that.
[02:24:28.806 --> 02:24:34.869]  And you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices being silenced now online by the
[02:24:34.929 --> 02:24:35.951]  I don't think you can.
[02:24:51.592 --> 02:24:54.333]  93% of their coverage, according to Shorenstein, is biased.
[02:24:54.333 --> 02:24:55.733]  And Trump had no problem with that.
[02:24:55.733 --> 02:25:01.335]  He has no problem when a CNN host, Kathy Griffin, holds a decapitated facsimile of his head.
[02:25:01.335 --> 02:25:19.100]  They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses obscenity, or Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap, or people that are guests and panelists say that he's a Russian asset or agent, or they invoke the Holocaust for comparison, or people say that he's radicalized more people than ISIS.
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:19.560]  Remember that?
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:27.442]  And they have these stories they keep running, you know, that Scaramucci is involved with a Russian hedge fund, false.
[02:25:27.442 --> 02:25:32.184]  That Trump knew in advance of the Russian meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:25:32.184 --> 02:25:34.205]  had access to the Wikileaks.
[02:25:34.205 --> 02:25:38.406]  I remember when CNN was just explaining to us, as a matter of fact.
[02:25:38.406 --> 02:25:39.747]  He never gets to this.
[02:25:39.747 --> 02:25:40.907]  There's just so many hundreds of other ones.
[02:25:41.267 --> 02:25:45.549]  When CNN and ABC said, General Flynn admits they were under Russian command.
[02:25:45.549 --> 02:25:46.429]  Unbelievable!
[02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:48.210]  Toy Behard, we've got the documents!
[02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:49.871]  They're a Russian operation!
[02:25:49.871 --> 02:25:50.691]  He's pled guilty!
[02:25:50.691 --> 02:25:51.632]  They're Russian agents!
[02:25:51.632 --> 02:25:54.153]  The Russians commanded them all!
[02:25:54.153 --> 02:26:00.776]  No, General Flynn only had about $100,000 in the bank, you know, paying for his kids' college and everything, and a modest house.
[02:26:00.776 --> 02:26:05.298]  And he lost his house and everything else, the preliminary, and said, okay, I'll plead guilty.
[02:26:05.298 --> 02:26:09.240]  You say I made misleading statements, which weren't even true, fine.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:09.780]  I plead guilty.
[02:26:11.624 --> 02:26:13.985]  Which wasn't even true, but he just said, fine, I plead guilty.
[02:26:13.985 --> 02:26:14.486]  I don't have money.
[02:26:14.486 --> 02:26:18.248]  I know Roger Stone spent a million bucks.
[02:26:18.248 --> 02:26:22.150]  He's now out of the behind-the-scenes stuff, has no money.
[02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:24.231]  Spent all his money.
[02:26:24.231 --> 02:26:25.712]  Sold his house.
[02:26:25.712 --> 02:26:27.673]  Had his other place doxxed.
[02:26:27.673 --> 02:26:29.854]  This is what they do to you, folks.
[02:26:29.854 --> 02:26:36.257]  I put some acorns away for winter so I could fight these folks, but they've gone through most our acorns.
[02:26:36.257 --> 02:26:37.258]  It's a real war.
[02:26:37.258 --> 02:26:37.878]  Let's go back to it.
[02:26:38.718 --> 02:26:40.360]  ...meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.401]  had access to the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:56.514]  I remember when CNN was just explaining to us, as a matter of fact, that James Comey, within a matter of hours, was going to go into a congressional testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution.
[02:26:56.514 --> 02:26:58.536]  This doesn't make sense, though, because... It was all false.
[02:26:58.536 --> 02:27:04.341]  CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be silenced, because they're, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[02:27:04.961 --> 02:27:08.544]  But you're listing conspiracy theories that they promulgated on their air.
[02:27:35.302 --> 02:27:35.662]  It's a shame.
[02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:57.101]  Yeah.
[02:27:57.101 --> 02:27:59.382]  To see a buffoon elevated to murder status.
[02:27:59.382 --> 02:28:04.783]  But look, now that CNN's on the side of free speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right of all people to say what they think.
[02:28:04.783 --> 02:28:10.064]  They could have sued in 2013 on behalf of Fox and the AP.
[02:28:10.064 --> 02:28:11.984]  Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.
[02:28:11.984 --> 02:28:15.645]  Man, that is the smartest show on television.
[02:28:15.645 --> 02:28:18.525]  You look at CNN, MSNBC, it's just talking points.
[02:28:18.525 --> 02:28:22.426]  Then Carlson just has all these super smart people on.
[02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:25.667]  Then he has leftists on and they can hardly talk.
[02:28:27.708 --> 02:28:30.169]  And they just lie, lie, lie.
[02:28:30.169 --> 02:28:32.090]  There is no caravan.
[02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:33.431]  There is no Soros involved.
[02:28:33.431 --> 02:28:35.072]  There is no, there is no.
[02:28:35.072 --> 02:28:40.995]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone because the whole Russian thing is coming to a head.
[02:28:40.995 --> 02:28:41.575]  What's next?
[02:28:41.575 --> 02:28:45.877]  We're going to look at Trump taking the gloves off, the election fraud, and your phone calls.
[02:28:45.877 --> 02:28:48.598]  Callers, we're going to you straight ahead.
[02:28:48.598 --> 02:28:50.099]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:50.099 --> 02:28:51.520]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:28:53.186 --> 02:28:54.407]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:54.407 --> 02:28:58.328]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:28:58.328 --> 02:28:59.869]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:28:59.869 --> 02:29:02.830]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:08.392]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:08.392 --> 02:29:09.593]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:09.593 --> 02:29:12.514]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:12.514 --> 02:29:14.735]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:14.735 --> 02:29:19.177]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:19.177 --> 02:29:21.478]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:22.814 --> 02:29:29.435]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.
[02:29:29.435 --> 02:29:33.276]  For over 14 years, thousands have depended on Berkey Clean Water.
[02:29:33.276 --> 02:29:40.098]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home, work, and on the go with water filtration systems of every size for every budget.

[02:29:46.459 --> 02:29:46.919]  GoBerkey.com.
[02:29:54.128 --> 02:29:59.789]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:29:59.789 --> 02:30:01.390]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:30:01.390 --> 02:30:02.030]  It's a good thing.
[02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:05.631]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:30:05.631 --> 02:30:08.011]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:30:08.011 --> 02:30:09.492]  I learned what the best was.
[02:30:09.492 --> 02:30:14.633]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:30:14.633 --> 02:30:15.173]  It's amazing.
[02:30:15.353 --> 02:30:17.936]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:30:17.936 --> 02:30:24.784]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:30:24.784 --> 02:30:26.446]  He has a glut of them.
[02:30:26.446 --> 02:30:28.849]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:30:28.849 --> 02:30:30.511]  When it's discounted usually $200, it's $127!
[02:30:34.813 --> 02:30:38.979]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making twenty-something bucks on them.
[02:30:38.979 --> 02:30:41.102]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:30:41.102 --> 02:30:43.425]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:30:43.425 --> 02:30:44.026]  It's amazing.

[02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:29.450]  It's an amazing system.
[02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:31.351]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[02:32:31.351 --> 02:32:32.412]  They're trying to defund us.
[02:32:32.412 --> 02:32:39.396]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year so that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[02:32:39.396 --> 02:32:44.519]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[02:32:51.723 --> 02:32:56.446]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:32:56.446 --> 02:32:59.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.135 --> 02:33:30.230]  You know, I'm not suicidal, I love life, but when I hear about the Russiagate stuff, I want to jump off a cliff.
[02:33:37.034 --> 02:33:44.860]  But it is coming to a head, supposedly tomorrow or the next day or sometime next week, and Roger Stone's right in the crosshairs.
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:52.286]  I'm literally calling Roger this morning saying, I'm sick of hearing about Russia, and then I call him back and he'll actually come on about Russia, because that's really coming into view.
[02:33:52.286 --> 02:33:53.848]  He'll be with us in the next segment.
[02:33:53.848 --> 02:33:59.172]  We'll start taking some of your calls too on election fraud, what should Trump do, but I wanted to just quickly get an update.
[02:34:00.276 --> 02:34:03.578]  That Trump really has torn into Mueller like never before today.
[02:34:03.578 --> 02:34:05.599]  We're going to be looking at that.
[02:34:05.599 --> 02:34:09.922]  Stone released all his text messages that Mueller's already had.
[02:34:09.922 --> 02:34:13.445]  Proving that Randy Credico was saying he was the back channel.
[02:34:13.445 --> 02:34:14.585]  I remember!
[02:34:14.585 --> 02:34:15.866]  I could have testified.
[02:34:15.866 --> 02:34:16.507]  He wouldn't tell me.
[02:34:16.507 --> 02:34:21.790]  He said, oh, it's a talk show host in New York that knows him and I'm going to try to see what it is.
[02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:25.793]  And by then, Assange was on TV saying it's very damning for the Democrats.
[02:34:25.793 --> 02:34:27.974]  There were investigative reports about
[02:34:29.051 --> 02:34:34.693]  John Podesta and Latin America and the Panama Papers.
[02:34:34.693 --> 02:34:38.134]  We were trying to guess here what it was.
[02:34:38.134 --> 02:34:41.975]  I never thought it was going to be devil worship and blood drinking in New York.
[02:34:41.975 --> 02:34:44.656]  Remember all that?
[02:34:44.656 --> 02:34:46.477]  We didn't know what was in there.
[02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:47.137]  Good Lord.
[02:34:47.137 --> 02:34:48.397]  I mean, I guess I should have imagined.
[02:34:48.397 --> 02:34:50.238]  We're going to go to Roger in a moment.
[02:34:50.238 --> 02:34:50.818]  But first off,
[02:34:53.548 --> 02:35:01.071]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:35:01.071 --> 02:35:02.672]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:35:02.672 --> 02:35:03.312]  It's a good thing.
[02:35:03.312 --> 02:35:07.614]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:35:07.614 --> 02:35:09.995]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:35:09.995 --> 02:35:11.796]  I learned what the best was.
[02:35:11.796 --> 02:35:18.819]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there
[02:35:20.169 --> 02:35:26.731]  And took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[02:35:26.731 --> 02:35:32.332]  It's just remarkably high quality and essential.
[02:35:32.332 --> 02:35:38.554]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:35:38.554 --> 02:35:43.975]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[02:35:43.975 --> 02:35:46.316]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:35:48.363 --> 02:35:56.866]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsApply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:35:56.866 --> 02:35:59.166]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[02:35:59.166 --> 02:36:06.589]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming, and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[02:36:06.589 --> 02:36:10.070]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:12.210]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[02:36:12.210 --> 02:36:13.531]  Texas has that too.
[02:36:13.531 --> 02:36:17.272]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[02:36:17.865 --> 02:36:18.365]  Show.
[02:36:18.365 --> 02:36:21.648]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:36:21.648 --> 02:36:27.592]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[02:36:27.592 --> 02:36:30.274]  We normally sell for $249, and it's a great deal.
[02:36:30.274 --> 02:36:33.777]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[02:36:33.777 --> 02:36:34.837]  It's $127.
[02:36:34.837 --> 02:36:38.600]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:40.661]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[02:36:40.661 --> 02:36:42.803]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[02:36:42.803 --> 02:36:45.526]  I mean, I'm all for great deals, but this is insane.
[02:36:45.526 --> 02:36:48.569]  This will cut out the entire water filter market, what you've done here.
[02:36:48.569 --> 02:36:49.890]  He says, well, it's a one-time deal.
[02:36:49.890 --> 02:36:51.592]  And there's a couple thousand of them.
[02:36:51.592 --> 02:36:56.196]  And he called this morning and said, whoa, you are really moving these.
[02:36:56.196 --> 02:36:57.498]  And I go, yeah, this is the best deal ever.
[02:36:57.498 --> 02:36:59.700]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:03.003]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family, get the best, the best deal.
[02:37:04.606 --> 02:37:05.187]  We're good to go.
[02:37:21.858 --> 02:37:25.862]  At InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:37:25.862 --> 02:37:28.324]  This is the best deal in 23 years I've ever heard of.
[02:37:28.324 --> 02:37:29.565]  The best system, the best price.
[02:37:35.111 --> 02:37:40.573]  And it funds the Infowar, though not much, doing us a favor to help move all these out for them, and I understand.
[02:37:40.573 --> 02:37:44.794]  So, we're doing it, even though I'm forgiving you a good deal, but not this good.
[02:37:44.794 --> 02:37:46.115]  This undercuts the whole market.
[02:37:46.115 --> 02:37:48.316]  This is the best deal ever!
[02:37:48.316 --> 02:37:49.296]  It's insane!
[02:37:49.296 --> 02:37:52.137]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsware.com.
[02:37:52.137 --> 02:37:53.037]  Please support the broadcast.
[02:37:53.037 --> 02:37:57.999]  A bunch of other big specials in this weekend, so check those out, and thanks for funding the operation.
[02:37:57.999 --> 02:37:58.279]  All right.
[02:37:59.386 --> 02:38:00.307]  Go to Roger Stone.
[02:38:00.307 --> 02:38:03.190]  Roger, you know it's a love-hate thing here with covering the Russia thing.
[02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:05.212]  We have to, but it's all a bunch of BS.
[02:38:05.212 --> 02:38:09.456]  Our whole audience knows we're not involved with the Russians, other than you're getting a bunch of them arrested in the 80s.
[02:38:09.456 --> 02:38:10.537]  We know Hillary's the culprit.
[02:38:10.537 --> 02:38:11.979]  We know Mueller is.
[02:38:11.979 --> 02:38:19.587]  But new developments here, bombshell info that they knew they were... Mueller and his prosecutors, Hillary's personal attack dog.
[02:38:19.587 --> 02:38:21.108]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:38:21.108 --> 02:38:22.570]  And now Trump's gone off the...
[02:38:23.223 --> 02:38:24.884]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:38:24.884 --> 02:38:28.727]  It's almost as if the President has been reading the coverage of what's been going on with me and, of course, Dr. Jerry Corsi.
[02:38:52.145 --> 02:39:12.437]  Yesterday, I released a substantial number of text exchanges with Randy Credico, which proved beyond any dispute that he was indeed my source, who told me about the explosive nature of the WikiLeaks disclosures that Julian Assange himself had announced in June on CNN in 2016.
[02:39:13.958 --> 02:39:25.706]  And who told me that they would come in October, and then when they didn't come on October 2nd, told me to be patient, they were coming in a few days, and they did.
[02:39:25.706 --> 02:39:35.333]  He also reveals in these text messages that his source was not Julian Assange, but a woman lawyer who worked for Julian Assange.
[02:39:35.333 --> 02:39:43.438]  Thus his defense that he couldn't have been my source in June because he didn't meet and interview Assange until late August is irrelevant.
[02:39:44.858 --> 02:39:52.321]  In other words, to put it another way Alex, it appears to me that Randy Credico perjured himself before the Mueller Grand Jury.
[02:39:52.321 --> 02:39:55.642]  Will he be held responsible for lying under oath?
[02:39:55.642 --> 02:39:57.562]  Let's hope so.
[02:39:57.562 --> 02:40:00.023]  Well, I don't have any dog in the fight other than justice.
[02:40:00.023 --> 02:40:03.764]  I just don't know why he told all these people this.
[02:40:03.764 --> 02:40:09.646]  I knew you had the text messages a while back and why he would be doing this and why Mueller would bring him in there when Mueller has
[02:40:11.005 --> 02:40:14.268]  Obviously he's been parallel constructing all this and was surveilling everyone before.
[02:40:14.268 --> 02:40:16.129]  Mueller already knows all this isn't true.
[02:40:16.129 --> 02:40:18.832]  So why in the hell did he do this?
[02:40:18.832 --> 02:40:21.874]  It's kind of like that old Bob Dylan line.
[02:40:21.874 --> 02:40:26.438]  The order I think Mr. Mueller gave his staff is everybody must get stoned.
[02:40:26.438 --> 02:40:26.898]  Exactly.
[02:40:26.898 --> 02:40:37.027]  Look, I'm a target because I supported Donald Trump for president, because I appear regularly on InfoWars, because I help you bring people the truth,
[02:40:37.487 --> 02:40:46.253]  And because I was effective in helping defeat Hillary Clinton by writing the book, The Clinton's War on Women, available at the Infowars.com store.
[02:40:46.253 --> 02:40:53.138]  Because I co-produced the documentary, the Danny Williams story, banished the Danny Williams story.
[02:40:53.138 --> 02:40:58.362]  Well sure, and Get Me Roger Stone was a pretty powerful documentary, it was a huge hit on Netflix.
[02:40:58.362 --> 02:41:00.283]  That was like waving a red cape and a bull's face.
[02:41:01.491 --> 02:41:05.794]  Yeah, so now they're saying get Roger Stone as opposed to get me Roger Stone.
[02:41:05.794 --> 02:41:07.395]  Look, I know it grows tedious.
[02:41:07.395 --> 02:41:08.936]  It's tedious for me too.
[02:41:08.936 --> 02:41:13.239]  But there is no evidence whatsoever that I knew in advance about the source or content.
[02:41:13.239 --> 02:41:14.039]  I know, we all know that.
[02:41:14.039 --> 02:41:14.400]  We know that.
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.001]  The reason I've got you on is, what's the word?
[02:41:17.001 --> 02:41:20.103]  Do they say it's going to be over in a few days?
[02:41:20.103 --> 02:41:21.624]  Or maybe it's going to keep going forever?
[02:41:21.624 --> 02:41:24.466]  I mean, how long is this idiocy going to continue?
[02:41:24.466 --> 02:41:28.549]  So we can obviously move on to the fake congressional investigations they're about to have.
[02:41:29.591 --> 02:41:31.253]  It's very hard to know, Alex.
[02:41:31.253 --> 02:41:44.050]  I mean, for me, this has been over two years of my life, having the federal government and Robert Mueller and his band of cutthroats digging into every microscopic detail of my private life.
[02:41:44.611 --> 02:41:46.771]  Questioning people over and over again.
[02:41:46.771 --> 02:41:49.812]  What about Roger Stone's relationship with Alex Jones?
[02:41:49.812 --> 02:41:52.633]  How often does Roger Stone talk to Alex Jones?
[02:41:52.633 --> 02:41:56.854]  You think Roger Stone passed any of the WikiLeaks material on to Alex Jones?
[02:41:56.854 --> 02:41:59.954]  I never even had the material to pass on.
[02:41:59.954 --> 02:42:06.656]  But they're looking at every aspect of my life, my family life, my social life, my personal life, my business life.
[02:42:06.656 --> 02:42:07.336]  So let's bring this up.
[02:42:09.316 --> 02:42:10.998]  Here's the deal.
[02:42:10.998 --> 02:42:25.614]  When we learned from the grand jury that Hillary's top attack dog, that literally helped cover up Uranium One, materially is involved with the Russians, and is now the prosecutor, this is like having Hitler run a Nuremberg trial.
[02:42:25.614 --> 02:42:27.336]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:42:27.336 --> 02:42:29.158]  I've never heard of conflicts of interest.
[02:42:29.158 --> 02:42:31.180]  Material conflicts like this, Roger.
[02:42:32.239 --> 02:42:34.381]  Yeah, it's extraordinarily political.
[02:42:34.381 --> 02:42:39.085]  And as Tyler Nixon made the case, it's an egregious, actual conflict of interest.
[02:42:39.085 --> 02:42:51.355]  Having Hillary's henchwoman run the investigation into Roger Stone, the nemesis of Hillary Clinton... When she's involved with the Russians... I mean, she literally is involved with Hillary, running all this with the Russians.
[02:42:51.355 --> 02:42:53.077]  I mean, it's insane!
[02:42:53.077 --> 02:42:55.419]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:42:55.419 --> 02:42:57.561]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:44:57.899 --> 02:45:03.622]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:03.622 --> 02:45:11.485]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:11.485 --> 02:45:14.827]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:14.827 --> 02:45:19.909]  A unique, natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms,
[02:45:20.109 --> 02:45:22.871]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:45:22.871 --> 02:45:32.015]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.

[02:45:53.753 --> 02:45:56.114]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:45:56.114 --> 02:46:02.356]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:46:57.454 --> 02:47:00.095]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.456 --> 02:47:12.717]  Monday through Friday, we're here.
[02:47:12.717 --> 02:47:15.579]  And Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:47:15.579 --> 02:47:19.321]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday.
[02:47:19.321 --> 02:47:21.582]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:21.582 --> 02:47:23.243]  Riding a shotgun.
[02:47:23.243 --> 02:47:27.084]  Here with me is Roger Stone from Broward County, Florida.
[02:47:27.084 --> 02:47:30.506]  He's going to be able to get into election fraud and take your phone calls.
[02:47:30.506 --> 02:47:33.528]  And that really is the big issue right now, in my view, at the latest on the paravan.
[02:47:33.528 --> 02:47:35.269]  We've got Harrison Smith here as well.
[02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:36.449]  He'll be going to the next hour with us.
[02:47:36.449 --> 02:47:37.310]  Vox Day joins us.
[02:47:37.310 --> 02:47:39.891]  And we're going to be looking at the most shocking
[02:47:41.025 --> 02:47:45.290]  Anti-white brainwashing going on in schools that you've ever seen.
[02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:49.355]  The left is going into pure race-based politics like they're in the KKK or something.
[02:47:49.355 --> 02:47:52.018]  They hold up pictures of white people and they go, eww!
[02:47:52.018 --> 02:47:52.999]  They go, why don't you like it?
[02:47:52.999 --> 02:47:54.861]  They're white!
[02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:58.305]  I mean, this is America, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:58.305 --> 02:48:00.548]  This is true Marxist liberation theology.
[02:48:01.986 --> 02:48:03.667]  Roger, though, putting bookends on this thing.
[02:48:03.667 --> 02:48:07.650]  I was asking during the break, you can repeat it, what is it like them saying you're going to be indicted Friday?
[02:48:07.650 --> 02:48:09.572]  You know, they've said that so many times last year.
[02:48:09.572 --> 02:48:16.897]  Meanwhile, Trump tears into Mueller investigation, calls Russia probe absolutely nuts, talks about all the criminal things they've done.
[02:48:16.897 --> 02:48:21.420]  And then there's this, Hillary's henchwoman heads Mueller's probe of Stone.
[02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:27.805]  And then she's involved with the lawsuits for racketeering, with her foundation, with Uranium One.
[02:48:27.805 --> 02:48:30.787]  I mean, this this lady is involved in all of this.
[02:48:31.678 --> 02:48:35.182]  And then now, so is Mueller.
[02:48:35.182 --> 02:48:43.490]  It's clear they chose the Russia thing to cover for themselves because it would be so insane that the actual people that did it are the ones accusing you of it.
[02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:45.412]  This is like beyond any movie you've ever heard of.
[02:48:45.412 --> 02:48:47.174]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:48:47.174 --> 02:48:48.455]  So in closing on that, Roger.
[02:48:49.949 --> 02:48:53.653]  Well, Alex, it's part of the psychological game they try to play.
[02:48:53.653 --> 02:49:01.581]  Virtually every Friday, they will have a reporter call me or my lawyer, usually from CNN, saying, do you think it's this weekend that you'll be arrested?
[02:49:02.222 --> 02:49:02.463]  I don't
[02:49:22.146 --> 02:49:25.008]  I'm being targeted because I'm on InfoWars.
[02:49:25.008 --> 02:49:28.010]  I'm being targeted because I supported Donald Trump.
[02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:32.192]  I'm being targeted because I opposed Hillary Clinton and I was quite effective at it.
[02:49:32.192 --> 02:49:39.116]  So this is payback for 40 years of beating liberal Democrats at the polls and nothing more.
[02:49:39.116 --> 02:49:41.838]  And that's the next issue, Harrison Smith.
[02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.459]  We're not just saying they're stealing.
[02:49:43.459 --> 02:49:45.801]  It's famous counties that steal.
[02:49:45.801 --> 02:49:48.542]  The illegal ballots they admit just keep coming in.
[02:49:48.542 --> 02:49:51.404]  They get caught, admit a bunch of them are totally provisional and fake.
[02:49:51.934 --> 02:49:58.795]  You have women running with bags and hiding, acting totally suspiciously, and then putting walls up so you can't see it.
[02:49:58.795 --> 02:50:10.818]  You've got all the races going for Democrats, magically, where Republicans barely win, and then suddenly famous counties for corruption hold things open for weeks, break all the laws, and then magically the Democrats are winning.
[02:50:10.818 --> 02:50:14.059]  Very powerful Michael Snyder article at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:14.059 --> 02:50:20.500]  Post-election blue wave, Democrats have flipped two Senate seats and a large number of House seats since election night.
[02:50:21.534 --> 02:50:22.655]  We need to get this fixed.
[02:50:22.655 --> 02:50:24.395]  This is the real emergency here.
[02:50:24.395 --> 02:50:26.156]  Well, I mean, just look at Brenda Snipes.
[02:50:26.156 --> 02:50:32.039]  Why was she ever allowed to continue after 2016 when she was caught illegally destroying ballots?
[02:50:32.039 --> 02:50:36.360]  Why is she still in charge of anything, let alone, you know, walking free?
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.281]  She's messing with the elections.
[02:50:38.281 --> 02:50:42.023]  She was famous in 2000 for this crap, and now...
[02:50:42.839 --> 02:50:45.241]  She said she's going to ride off on the sunset after this one though.
[02:50:45.241 --> 02:50:49.664]  Well look, they're trying to undermine the one outlet that is legitimate.
[02:50:49.664 --> 02:50:53.707]  They want to degrade our belief in the voting system.
[02:50:53.707 --> 02:51:03.255]  They want people to believe that they have no choice but to rebel and cause violence and chaos and riot and all of this stuff because the one outlet we still have is our ability to vote.
[02:51:03.255 --> 02:51:08.679]  If they steal that from us, if they degrade our confidence in that, then we have no other option.
[02:51:11.861 --> 02:51:15.363]  Absolutely, and now we've got Chuckie Schumer and Obama saying everyone should be able to vote.
[02:51:15.363 --> 02:51:17.403]  If you're in the country, you should be able to vote.
[02:51:17.403 --> 02:51:28.228]  Roger, I want to go to some calls on this subject and others about what Trump needs to do here in just a moment, but just, you're in Broward County, supposedly today's the last day of the recount or whatever.
[02:51:28.228 --> 02:51:35.171]  Chuckie Schumer's saying, oh don't worry, you know, we're going to get that governorship, we're going to get the Senate, we're going to get everything.
[02:51:35.171 --> 02:51:37.132]  Just the arrogance of these monsters.
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:41.022]  You know, Alex, you've been on radio a long time.
[02:51:41.022 --> 02:51:45.766]  Have you ever heard anybody who sounds less sincere than Chuck Schumer?
[02:51:45.766 --> 02:51:50.231]  Who sounds swarmier and phonier than Chuck Schumer?
[02:51:50.231 --> 02:51:51.632]  It's really something to behold.
[02:51:52.548 --> 02:52:04.032]  Look, I actually think that the Republicans will hold on to the governorship here in Florida, because I think former Congressman Ron DeSantis' margin is too great to overcome, even with the shenanigans in Broward County.
[02:52:04.032 --> 02:52:14.976]  That means within ten seconds of his taking his hand off the Bible, he will fire Brenda Snipes, which the previous governor, the current governor, should have done four months ago when I called for it.
[02:52:15.416 --> 02:52:22.279]  Based on her involvement with voter fraud two years ago and in the most recent Republican congressional primaries.
[02:52:22.279 --> 02:52:24.741]  So you weep what you sow.
[02:52:24.741 --> 02:52:31.444]  Had this woman been removed when we called for it here on InfoWars, you wouldn't have this quagmire going on in Florida.
[02:52:31.904 --> 02:52:48.458]  Meanwhile, Republican observers are not allowed to observe the recount in Broward County, a violation of Florida state sunshine law, and they are continuing to count votes that have been disallowed, that have already been declared illegal by the election board.
[02:52:48.458 --> 02:52:52.342]  So you have widespread election fraud going on in this one county.
[02:52:53.422 --> 02:52:57.884]  Whether or not Rick Scott can hold on to a Senate seat is an open question.
[02:52:57.884 --> 02:53:11.089]  I do think we'll hold on to the governorship, and I'm very concerned about the race for Commissioner of Agriculture, only because the candidates in that race are both thoroughbreds with a great future.
[02:53:11.089 --> 02:53:13.990]  I'll tell you, the Republicans shouldn't concede in Arizona.
[02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:15.170]  They shouldn't concede on any of these.
[02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:18.032]  We have real fraud here and they should stop conceding.
[02:53:18.032 --> 02:53:21.355]  Let's go to Matt in Texas on Florida election fraud.
[02:53:21.355 --> 02:53:26.199]  Matt, you're on the air with myself, Roger Stone, and of course, Harrison Smith.
[02:53:26.199 --> 02:53:27.680]  Go ahead.
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:30.042]  Hey Alex, hey all three of y'all, Roger and Harrison.
[02:53:30.042 --> 02:53:33.845]  Hey Harrison, I was with Harrison and Owen the other night.
[02:53:33.845 --> 02:53:36.407]  We were just talking about this.
[02:53:36.407 --> 02:53:43.853]  I was asking them if everybody else was holding their breath on the Florida results, as I was.
[02:53:45.019 --> 02:53:47.500]  And, uh, and the numbers were off.
[02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:49.281]  And of course, it's Broward County.
[02:53:49.281 --> 02:53:51.742]  It always comes down to what it's like.
[02:53:51.742 --> 02:53:56.664]  Oh, Roger was saying that night when we, you know, when we were living like one, he goes, I'm really surprised they conceded.
[02:53:56.664 --> 02:53:58.704]  They always steal it when they're close.
[02:53:58.704 --> 02:54:05.227]  And then they were just waiting, knowing we were watching until they did a fake concession and then went in and started stuffing.
[02:54:05.227 --> 02:54:06.287]  Absolutely.
[02:54:06.287 --> 02:54:13.210]  And it's like, I can only, it's, it's like the movie Indiana Jones where they open the tomb and they know where the Ark is.
[02:54:14.009 --> 02:54:16.551]  And he throws the torch down onto the floor.
[02:54:16.551 --> 02:54:17.712]  There's a bunch of snakes.
[02:54:17.712 --> 02:54:19.634]  And the guy says, why is the floor moving?
[02:54:19.634 --> 02:54:21.275]  Indeed, it's snakes.
[02:54:21.275 --> 02:54:23.016]  Why did it have to be snakes?
[02:54:23.016 --> 02:54:24.898]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:54:24.898 --> 02:54:27.480]  So we're coming up on the witching hour here.
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:33.965]  I think we're probably within an hour of it, I guess, as it nears.
[02:54:33.965 --> 02:54:35.126]  So we'll figure it out.
[02:54:38.655 --> 02:54:40.596]  It'll be interesting to see what they pull off.
[02:54:40.596 --> 02:54:43.337]  I guarantee you they're not signing Republican ballots.
[02:54:43.337 --> 02:54:44.817]  Oh no!
[02:54:44.817 --> 02:54:47.058]  She's been caught putting provisionals.
[02:54:47.058 --> 02:54:50.679]  Well, they were all for Democrats and they weren't real votes, but it's okay.
[02:54:50.679 --> 02:54:51.399]  It's okay.
[02:54:51.399 --> 02:54:52.200]  She's on video.
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:53.900]  Oh, no big deal.
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:54.340]  Exactly.
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:55.921]  And what's with the medical gloves?
[02:54:55.921 --> 02:54:59.702]  We're turning this fraud into a medical scheme now?
[02:54:59.702 --> 02:55:04.104]  Well, they just do that to act like it's something scientific they're doing.
[02:55:04.104 --> 02:55:05.044]  I appreciate you calling in.
[02:55:05.044 --> 02:55:06.365]  Good points.
[02:55:06.365 --> 02:55:07.365]  Roger, again,
[02:55:08.257 --> 02:55:15.224]  Hillary, and I said this a week ago, Matt Gaetz said it two days ago, this is a test run for 2020.
[02:55:15.224 --> 02:55:23.913]  Now Hillary's saying, oh I may run because she sees the Republicans bending over with a big giant green light to let American voting rights be gang raped.
[02:55:25.562 --> 02:55:27.784]  In all honesty, let's take Arizona for example.
[02:55:27.784 --> 02:55:37.273]  If I were the Republican majority, I would not allow the seating of this elected senator, and I would challenge those results in the state courts in Arizona.
[02:55:37.273 --> 02:55:38.234]  We have the majority.
[02:55:38.234 --> 02:55:39.975]  We can decide who is seated.
[02:55:39.975 --> 02:55:45.901]  I believe that election is fraudulent, and until the courts rule otherwise, I wouldn't seat the senator from Arizona.
[02:55:46.361 --> 02:55:47.782]  I mean, they want to play hardball?
[02:55:47.782 --> 02:55:48.803]  Let's play hardball.
[02:55:48.803 --> 02:55:49.684]  It's about time.
[02:55:49.684 --> 02:55:51.666]  But, look, this is very clear.
[02:55:51.666 --> 02:55:53.547]  The Democrats say count every vote.
[02:55:53.547 --> 02:55:56.370]  The Republicans say count every legal vote.
[02:55:56.370 --> 02:55:57.551]  You see the difference.
[02:55:57.551 --> 02:56:04.516]  And let's be clear, you went in there, and again, I don't like George W. Bush, Al Gore I hate even more, but you were there.
[02:56:04.516 --> 02:56:07.839]  You helped take it away from them when they were trying to steal it before in Broward County.
[02:56:07.839 --> 02:56:10.021]  You went in there and kicked their ass.
[02:56:10.021 --> 02:56:12.263]  And that's what we need is some frickin' huevos here, man.
[02:56:13.004 --> 02:56:14.265]  Well, that's exactly true.
[02:56:14.265 --> 02:56:21.250]  We prevented the Democrats in Miami-Dade County from counting the same sheaf of ballots for the third time.
[02:56:21.250 --> 02:56:22.951]  We didn't shut down the recount.
[02:56:22.951 --> 02:56:24.012]  That's false.
[02:56:24.012 --> 02:56:35.921]  We stopped them from recounting the same ballots the third time by taking them to an area that was private where there was no observers from the media or the Republican Party where they could tamper with them in violation of the state's
[02:56:36.341 --> 02:56:37.162]  Sunshine Law.
[02:56:37.162 --> 02:56:47.172]  So the Brooks Brothers Riot was an act of civic action to support the state's Sunshine Law and stop them from stealing.
[02:56:47.172 --> 02:56:50.435]  That's the truth that the mainstream media doesn't like to tell you.
[02:56:57.569 --> 02:57:02.736]  We have at the start of the next hour the most insane race-based brainwashing going on.
[02:57:02.736 --> 02:57:07.301]  We're going to show you the shocking video coming up in the next hour as well.
[02:57:07.301 --> 02:57:09.304]  We'll look at the EU Brexit.
[02:57:09.304 --> 02:57:12.248]  They're stealing the vote of three years ago.
[02:57:12.248 --> 02:57:14.050]  Paul Watson is in Parliament right now.
[02:57:14.050 --> 02:57:14.791]  He's part of UKIP.
[02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:18.973]  He'll be calling in or we'll have him on tomorrow with the latest, but this is amazing.
[02:57:18.973 --> 02:57:20.874]  It's all about ignoring the popular vote.
[02:57:20.874 --> 02:57:24.136]  It's all about ignoring the people wanting to be sovereign.
[02:57:24.136 --> 02:57:29.078]  But they can steal it a few times, but that'll only wake folks up and make them that much more angry.
[02:57:29.078 --> 02:57:30.899]  So don't give up if they're stealing.
[02:57:30.899 --> 02:57:34.221]  They're having to steal in front of everybody because they're so desperate.
[02:57:34.221 --> 02:57:36.122]  Please don't forget also we're listener supported.
[02:57:36.122 --> 02:57:39.784]  You get great products and support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:39.784 --> 02:57:42.386]  One of our biggest sales ever ends this Sunday.
[02:57:42.386 --> 02:57:43.026]  Check it out today.
[02:57:44.108 --> 02:57:52.652]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[02:57:52.652 --> 02:57:56.154]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[02:57:56.154 --> 02:58:05.678]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[02:58:05.678 --> 02:58:13.882]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product
[02:58:14.182 --> 02:58:15.443]  We're good to go.
[02:58:43.755 --> 02:58:47.859]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:58:47.859 --> 02:58:54.966]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[02:58:54.966 --> 02:58:59.751]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[02:58:59.751 --> 02:59:06.658]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[02:59:07.218 --> 02:59:07.799]  We're good to go!
[02:59:31.476 --> 02:59:32.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:00.274 --> 03:00:09.262]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.262 --> 03:00:15.487]  Let's go to Greg in Oregon.
[03:00:15.487 --> 03:00:19.530]  Greg, let's talk about Antifa, social media, executive orders, and the election.
[03:00:19.530 --> 03:00:21.092]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:00:21.092 --> 03:00:27.437]  Okay, number one, the reason why there are so many Antifa-style people or Antifa-leaning people
[03:00:29.031 --> 03:00:40.462]  Well, if you have a box of roosters and worms, and you take the roosters out of that box by force, the worms are going to look around and see only other worms and think they're winning.
[03:00:40.462 --> 03:00:42.844]  This is what happened on Twitter and Facebook.
[03:00:42.844 --> 03:00:50.372]  When they banned conservatives, everyone going into Twitter saw nothing but liberals and thought, oh, well, the whole world must be liberal.
[03:00:51.092 --> 03:00:58.339]  So that swings people's decisions in certain ways, because if they never hear from our side, they're never going to have all the information.
[03:00:58.339 --> 03:01:12.812]  And that's why they're trying to ban and eradicate Proud Boys, because Proud Boys goes out and defends women and children being attacked, kicks the ass of the little professors that want to beat up women and children, and so now they still won't show up, and still Proud Boys is still showing up.
[03:01:12.812 --> 03:01:13.693]  Amen.
[03:01:13.693 --> 03:01:14.974]  Okay, my second point.
[03:01:15.649 --> 03:01:26.433]  Is that V-O-A-T dot C-O forward slash V forward slash Q-R-V forward slash 2-8-5-0-2-5-3.
[03:01:26.433 --> 03:01:35.816]  A very well written article regarding an executive order written on December 21st, 2018, which allows 45 days after the election
[03:01:39.969 --> 03:01:46.912]  The Department of Homeland Security is going to have a report on election fraud showing foreign interference.
[03:01:46.912 --> 03:01:52.015]  Now, the definition of foreign interference is largely illegal aliens voting.
[03:01:52.015 --> 03:01:57.898]  This will come before the new Congress convenes and it's a sting operation.
[03:01:57.898 --> 03:01:59.358]  Well, let me say this.
[03:01:59.358 --> 03:02:01.800]  Yes, Trump needs to take action and I want to ask Roger Reed.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:06.402]  The best way to give out stuff is not its URL, if it's a long URL.
[03:02:06.402 --> 03:02:08.623]  The best way to give it out is the name of the article.
[03:02:09.085 --> 03:02:10.671]  So we can pull up what you're talking about.
[03:02:10.671 --> 03:02:11.655]  What's the name of the article?
[03:02:12.598 --> 03:02:15.219]  What will happen to address voter fraud?
[03:02:15.219 --> 03:02:16.660]  We have it all.
[03:02:16.660 --> 03:02:19.701]  It's on vote.
[03:02:19.701 --> 03:02:21.662]  What will happen to address voter fraud?
[03:02:21.662 --> 03:02:22.222]  We have it all.
[03:02:22.222 --> 03:02:22.463]  Thank you.
[03:02:22.463 --> 03:02:23.883]  We'll look that up.
[03:02:23.883 --> 03:02:25.384]  Thank you, sir.
[03:02:25.384 --> 03:02:26.524]  Roger Harrison, you want to comment?
[03:02:26.524 --> 03:02:27.845]  I mean, Trump's got to get serious.
[03:02:27.845 --> 03:02:29.446]  He's got to start addressing the nation.
[03:02:29.446 --> 03:02:31.407]  He's got to admit Democrats aren't Americans.
[03:02:31.407 --> 03:02:33.087]  They say you can't be a nationalist.
[03:02:33.087 --> 03:02:34.308]  They fundamentally hate the country.
[03:02:34.308 --> 03:02:39.350]  We have to admit this is a outside invasion force, not just the illegals, but the Democrats themselves.
[03:02:39.350 --> 03:02:41.131]  We have to go after this illegitimate election.
[03:02:41.671 --> 03:02:45.535]  Well, the single most important thing he can do is to ensure free and full access to an unfettered internet.
[03:03:00.177 --> 03:03:07.405]  I mean, in all honesty, if we don't have the ability to communicate, then we cannot possibly win in any realm.
[03:03:07.405 --> 03:03:18.617]  That's why our project, WriteTrump.com, which, by the way, is really moving along, in which we are trying to collect, right here at InfoWars, one million individual letters to the President,
[03:03:19.057 --> 03:03:46.778]  Demanding that he order the Justice Department to take antitrust action to stop the monopolistic racketeering practices of the big tech giants who are seeking to shut down not just InfoWars, but all conservative sites, all Trump supporters, whacking, decapitating conservatives and Republicans at Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, not to mention what's being done to InfoWars.
[03:03:46.778 --> 03:03:48.419]  You can take direct action.
[03:03:48.439 --> 03:03:50.161]  Take action right now.
[03:03:50.161 --> 03:03:54.865]  Alex Jones personally has agreed to pay for the postage for your letter.
[03:03:54.865 --> 03:03:58.109]  Go online, write, sign your letter to the president.
[03:03:58.109 --> 03:04:02.073]  You can even write in your personal PS and we will print it out.
[03:04:02.073 --> 03:04:09.040]  You can print it out and mail it in, but we will also print it out, put it in an envelope and mail it to the president.
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:09.981]  Take action.
[03:04:09.981 --> 03:04:11.242]  You can do it right now.
[03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:13.430]  That's right, Roger.
[03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:21.361]  I will be talking to you, obviously, during the war room today at 3 o'clock, and as this all unfolds with Mueller and all the craziness, but what a time to be alive.
[03:04:21.361 --> 03:04:21.922]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:04:22.952 --> 03:04:23.912]  Good to be here.
[03:04:23.912 --> 03:04:26.813]  And all these callers are on subjects that Vox Day can get into.
[03:04:26.813 --> 03:04:30.514]  We're gonna get into the EU, the Brexit theft, huge developments.
[03:04:30.514 --> 03:04:33.234]  We'll get to everybody that's holding now, I'll get to you.
[03:04:33.234 --> 03:04:37.275]  Cameron and Michael and Chase and Kim and Jerome and Marco and everybody.
[03:04:37.275 --> 03:04:47.737]  When we come back though, the most shocking racist brainwashing of children by leftist, basically a communist Girl Scout group funded by the left.
[03:04:47.737 --> 03:04:51.038]  Wait till you see what they're teaching young minority children.
[03:04:51.798 --> 03:04:58.949]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[03:04:59.557 --> 03:05:01.098]  That it lowers IQ.
[03:05:01.098 --> 03:05:03.960]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:10.685]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:10.685 --> 03:05:16.950]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:22.534]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:23.244 --> 03:05:30.270]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:30.270 --> 03:05:44.341]  But, chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:44.341 --> 03:05:48.605]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:48.605 --> 03:05:51.287]  X3, now available at mpulveragelife.com.
[03:06:00.321 --> 03:06:12.429]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:06:12.429 --> 03:06:24.376]  Well, Vox Dei, the best-selling author of SJW's Always Lie and SJW's Always Double Down, and he's a very popular, successful rebel comic book company owner, and that's where the real fight for the
[03:06:25.038 --> 03:06:26.719]  Minds of our young people's going on.
[03:06:26.719 --> 03:06:28.881]  He's been riding shotgun with us here in just a few minutes.
[03:06:28.881 --> 03:06:30.722]  He'll be with us for the rest of the segment.
[03:06:30.722 --> 03:06:33.203]  Harrison Smith, we've got your calls coming up too.
[03:06:33.203 --> 03:06:39.588]  On the election stealing, on Brexit being stolen, on what should Trump do next.
[03:06:39.588 --> 03:06:43.930]  We're all going to have this discussion fast moving here in the third hour today.
[03:06:43.930 --> 03:06:49.214]  Then in the fourth hour, Doug Hagman, always informative of the Hagman Report, will be host of the fourth hour.
[03:06:49.955 --> 03:06:53.528]  But right now, Harrison Smith, you did a report on this yesterday in the War Room.
[03:06:53.528 --> 03:06:54.492]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:55.524 --> 03:06:57.505]  Tell people what they're about to see.
[03:06:57.505 --> 03:07:00.287]  Well, you're about to see a video called The Radical Cram School.
[03:07:00.287 --> 03:07:05.370]  It's a video series that's documenting sort of the reaction of this, like, communist Girl Scout group.
[03:07:05.370 --> 03:07:07.831]  It's by a comedian, but this is not a satire.
[03:07:07.831 --> 03:07:10.072]  This is them indoctrinating kids in real time.
[03:07:10.072 --> 03:07:11.593]  You see their real reactions.
[03:07:11.593 --> 03:07:18.817]  And as outrageous as it is, as this is, it's not far off from what's being taught in our schools everywhere.
[03:07:18.817 --> 03:07:21.179]  So this is re-education camp stuff.
[03:07:21.739 --> 03:07:26.064]  Like Hillary said, we need camps for conservatives and adults to make them learn.
[03:07:26.064 --> 03:07:28.987]  They get you in these groups and they introduce these horrible ideas.
[03:07:28.987 --> 03:07:30.268]  This is what CNN is saying.
[03:07:30.268 --> 03:07:32.190]  White people are inherently bad.
[03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:33.311]  The West is inherently bad.
[03:07:33.311 --> 03:07:36.474]  Having a nation is evil.
[03:07:36.474 --> 03:07:39.978]  Every other country for other people, but nothing for Americans.
[03:07:39.978 --> 03:07:44.903]  So this is them completely rolling out the culture war that the Democrats talked about in WikiLeaks.
[03:07:45.063 --> 03:07:51.925]  Oh yeah, no, this is Nazi-level indoctrination, and this is, without hyperbole, the most racist video I've ever seen in my entire life.
[03:07:51.925 --> 03:08:02.408]  What they do is they do things like hold up Harvey Weinstein, so he's been demonized for other people, go, well, they'll agree he's bad, he's a serial sex abuser, but for the kids, they don't like him because he's a white man.
[03:08:02.408 --> 03:08:06.990]  But it's okay because they're Asian kids and black kids, so it's so avant-garde and so cool
[03:08:07.799 --> 03:08:10.040]  And again, even most minorities aren't racist like this.
[03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:13.602]  This is the globalist literally trying to create total division.
[03:08:13.602 --> 03:08:17.224]  Here's part of the sickening YouTube series.
[03:08:17.224 --> 03:08:19.545]  Welcome to Radical Cram School.
[03:08:19.545 --> 03:08:27.989]  We're going to learn about social justice, revolution, and how to be powerful in the bodies that you have.
[03:08:27.989 --> 03:08:30.531]  Hello, my young comrades.
[03:08:32.536 --> 03:08:34.278]  I'm going to show a picture.
[03:08:34.278 --> 03:08:37.300]  This is my way of figuring out if you've been tainted by the patriarchy.
[03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:38.501]  Patriarchy?
[03:08:38.501 --> 03:08:41.404]  What?
[03:08:41.404 --> 03:08:42.144]  Who do you think it is?
[03:08:42.144 --> 03:08:44.767]  It looks creepy.
[03:08:44.767 --> 03:08:45.247]  Why?
[03:08:45.247 --> 03:08:52.413]  There's just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel... Stop right there.
[03:08:52.413 --> 03:08:54.355]  This is real.
[03:08:54.355 --> 03:08:56.576]  We're going to get Vox Tase taken on in a moment.
[03:08:56.576 --> 03:08:59.439]  What is the new board member, who's also an Asian woman,
[03:09:00.285 --> 03:09:14.621]  There at the New York Times said whites are inherently evil, goblin creatures that live in holes, she can't wait till we're all extinct, and this is kind of the new ruling class is gonna be like Asian women that are leftist, but then Harvard says they've got too many Asians and Asians are bad.
[03:09:14.621 --> 03:09:17.004]  So again, they want to divide every group against each other.
[03:09:17.004 --> 03:09:18.685]  This is truly sickening.
[03:09:18.685 --> 03:09:19.086]  Continue.
[03:09:19.634 --> 03:09:28.279]  Like they're like right there in a pool and I'm just like walking into the pool and they just give me the death stare and then I'm just like... So this guy was in the pool... So that's an important thing.
[03:09:28.279 --> 03:09:29.420]  Hold on, we back it up 10 seconds.
[03:09:29.420 --> 03:09:32.502]  Yeah, they're teaching children to act weird and creepy when you see a white person.
[03:09:32.502 --> 03:09:32.822]  Yeah.
[03:09:32.822 --> 03:09:40.167]  Then that person's gonna think you're looking at me weird, which creates that confirmation thing where these kids really think white people are inherently bad.
[03:09:40.167 --> 03:09:43.328]  Right, I mean this is like a cute little seven-year-old Asian girl.
[03:09:43.328 --> 03:09:44.009]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:46.790]  She's never gotten a death stare because she's Asian.
[03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:47.591]  She lives in America.
[03:09:47.591 --> 03:09:48.371]  She's never gotten that.
[03:09:48.371 --> 03:09:53.294]  What she has gotten is constant indoctrination telling her white people hate you, white people think you're gross.
[03:09:53.294 --> 03:09:57.856]  So then when she sees maybe a facial expression, maybe someone looks at her, you know, anything like that.
[03:09:57.856 --> 03:10:00.177]  They're putting massive chips on her shoulder.
[03:10:00.177 --> 03:10:00.997]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:10:00.997 --> 03:10:01.358]  Exactly.
[03:10:01.358 --> 03:10:02.318]  Yeah.
[03:10:02.318 --> 03:10:02.878]  And it's right there.
[03:10:02.878 --> 03:10:04.159]  You can see that is her natural reaction.
[03:10:04.159 --> 03:10:07.021]  But if you go to Asia, all the different Asian groups hate each other.
[03:10:07.021 --> 03:10:08.901]  China's killed 115 million of its own people.
[03:10:08.901 --> 03:10:09.602]  But no discussion of that.
[03:10:09.602 --> 03:10:11.723]  It's all how the big open Christian society
[03:10:12.543 --> 03:10:13.464]  Is bad.
[03:10:13.464 --> 03:10:15.986]  But we've got to go to our guest here and get his take.
[03:10:15.986 --> 03:10:18.047]  But let's try to not respond too much.
[03:10:18.047 --> 03:10:19.568]  Go ahead and roll it.
[03:10:19.568 --> 03:10:30.196]  They're like right there in a pool and I'm just like walking into the pool and they just give me the death stare that I'm just like... So if this guy was in the pool, you would moonwalk out.
[03:10:30.196 --> 03:10:32.317]  Does he look like a good guy or a bad guy?
[03:10:32.317 --> 03:10:33.958]  Bad guy.
[03:10:33.958 --> 03:10:35.359]  Who do we think this is?
[03:10:35.359 --> 03:10:36.140]  Make a guess.
[03:10:36.140 --> 03:10:37.561]  Oh, Jumbledore!
[03:10:37.561 --> 03:10:38.902]  Jumbledore.
[03:10:38.902 --> 03:10:39.743]  Who is he married to?
[03:10:39.743 --> 03:10:41.304]  Who's your guess?
[03:10:42.293 --> 03:10:43.134]  Katy Perry.
[03:10:43.134 --> 03:10:51.159]  Donald Trump!
[03:10:51.159 --> 03:10:52.060]  Donald Duck!
[03:10:52.060 --> 03:10:53.841]  What do we know about him?
[03:10:53.841 --> 03:10:54.782]  What do we know about him?
[03:10:54.782 --> 03:10:55.962]  He's dead!
[03:10:55.962 --> 03:10:56.943]  He's dead!
[03:10:58.681 --> 03:11:01.002]  Imagine this is a group of white kids being shown black people.
[03:11:01.002 --> 03:11:02.302]  How do we feel about this wall?
[03:11:02.302 --> 03:11:09.345]  It is blocking opportunities for people that don't live in America to come here for a better opportunity.
[03:11:09.345 --> 03:11:10.565]  See, that part's pretty poignant too.
[03:11:10.565 --> 03:11:11.545]  They've been loaded with these.
[03:11:11.545 --> 03:11:12.226]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:12.226 --> 03:11:15.727]  My dad came here and my mom came here too.
[03:11:15.727 --> 03:11:16.527]  Pause again.
[03:11:16.527 --> 03:11:17.648]  My dad and my mom are good.
[03:11:17.648 --> 03:11:23.990]  Yeah, and this country let you in and now you're an American which hates America and has been taught that we're trying to block opportunities from you.
[03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:27.271]  Which are being taught everything belongs to them for the communist takeover.
[03:11:27.271 --> 03:11:27.571]  Continue.
[03:11:33.024 --> 03:11:33.965]  Cambodia.
[03:11:33.965 --> 03:11:34.945]  Oh, wow.
[03:11:34.945 --> 03:11:35.366]  Cambodia.
[03:11:35.366 --> 03:11:35.966]  Wait, pause.
[03:11:35.966 --> 03:11:38.187]  Where the communists killed almost everybody.
[03:11:38.187 --> 03:11:39.428]  Khmer Rouge killing fields, yep.
[03:11:39.428 --> 03:11:41.870]  But now you've been turned into heading the country that saved you.
[03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:43.411]  Okay, let's continue.
[03:11:43.411 --> 03:11:46.893]  They came from all the way to Cambodia and this is what they get to look at on the TV screen all the time.
[03:11:46.893 --> 03:11:47.634]  Hello Kitty!
[03:11:47.634 --> 03:11:50.716]  It is Hello Kitty.
[03:11:50.716 --> 03:11:51.496]  What is she missing?
[03:11:51.496 --> 03:11:53.498]  Where's her mouth?
[03:11:53.498 --> 03:11:54.498]  Her mouth?
[03:11:54.498 --> 03:11:55.919]  Why doesn't she have a mouth?
[03:11:55.919 --> 03:12:00.682]  The people who created her didn't want Asian girls to speak up about who they are.
[03:12:03.184 --> 03:12:04.325]  Very profound.
[03:12:04.325 --> 03:12:05.706]  Very profound.
[03:12:05.706 --> 03:12:08.968]  They're rewarded for repeating the mantras and the platitudes.
[03:12:08.968 --> 03:12:12.690]  And this goes on in the colleges, the high schools.
[03:12:12.690 --> 03:12:14.892]  They're teaching your kids that you're not a boy, you're not a girl.
[03:12:14.892 --> 03:12:15.832]  This is total abuse.
[03:12:15.832 --> 03:12:18.474]  This is a criminal, psychological warfare takeover.
[03:12:18.474 --> 03:12:19.575]  It's absolutely child abuse.
[03:12:19.575 --> 03:12:20.395]  It's absolutely.
[03:12:20.395 --> 03:12:30.042]  And you'll notice that, you know... Meanwhile, as communism, you know, killed her grandparents in Cambodia, but it's okay.
[03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.870]  Yeah.
[03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:32.971]  What were you going to say?
[03:12:32.971 --> 03:12:36.753]  Well, you heard that other girl when they said, what do you think about the wall?
[03:12:36.753 --> 03:12:41.076]  And she said, it stops people from enjoying the opportunities of America.
[03:12:41.076 --> 03:12:42.477]  It's like, I don't think it was rehearsed.
[03:12:42.477 --> 03:12:43.818]  I think this is just the mantra.
[03:12:43.818 --> 03:12:47.500]  This is the, you know, indoctrination, the platitudes that they're taught.
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:48.321]  Sure don't.
[03:12:48.321 --> 03:12:49.641]  They were indoctrinated at home.
[03:12:49.641 --> 03:12:49.842]  Right.
[03:12:49.842 --> 03:12:50.062]  Exactly.
[03:12:50.062 --> 03:12:52.283]  And mama's watching MSNBC all pissed.
[03:12:52.283 --> 03:12:53.424]  God, the whites are out to get me.
[03:12:53.424 --> 03:12:54.945]  This country is so freaking horrible.
[03:12:54.945 --> 03:12:56.166]  Let's go to Vox Day, Vox.
[03:12:56.166 --> 03:12:56.406]  I tell you.
[03:13:00.788 --> 03:13:10.975]  This is so far gone that if the left and the globalists win, it's making whites become racially based, it's destroying the egalitarian contract, and whites will have to form white homelands.
[03:13:10.975 --> 03:13:15.999]  So this is the absolute attempt at destruction of the country, Vox.
[03:13:15.999 --> 03:13:20.942]  Well, yeah, it's been baked in the cake since 1965.
[03:13:20.942 --> 03:13:26.706]  When you look at the opening of the United States to the rest of the world,
[03:13:27.698 --> 03:13:35.263]  And the change of the immigration laws and naturalization laws, this was the inevitable outcome.
[03:13:35.263 --> 03:13:43.848]  This is what the norm for most of the rest of the world is and has always been.
[03:13:43.848 --> 03:13:44.268]  Exactly.
[03:13:44.268 --> 03:13:50.011]  They're all racially or culturally based and they all, whether they're Asian or whatever, kill the group that isn't in their tribe.
[03:13:51.599 --> 03:13:52.519]  We are Christians.
[03:13:52.519 --> 03:13:55.000]  We bring people in and think, oh, you'll be like us.
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.582]  But the left comes in and goes, no, we're going to program them to go back to what they came from, which will be a winning strategy.
[03:14:01.582 --> 03:14:02.062]  Yeah.
[03:14:02.062 --> 03:14:04.362]  No, I mean, look at just the beginning of that.
[03:14:04.362 --> 03:14:08.424]  They're literally holding up pictures of Jewish people and having all the kids go, ew, gross.
[03:14:08.424 --> 03:14:10.624]  Look, I mean, that's literal Nazi.
[03:14:10.624 --> 03:14:13.165]  And that was exactly very sickeningly done.
[03:14:13.165 --> 03:14:15.505]  Vox, this is next level.
[03:14:15.505 --> 03:14:16.406]  Well, there's no question.
[03:14:16.406 --> 03:14:20.867]  And what I think was particularly interesting about it, and it's something that I think that
[03:14:21.787 --> 03:14:45.141]  Those who are focused on the left-right dichotomy and the white-black dichotomy tend to miss is that there is absolutely a Jewish-Asian rivalry in general and a Jewish-Chinese rivalry in specific that is beginning to play out in the United States and Canada.
[03:14:45.141 --> 03:14:48.563]  If you look at the lawsuit that is taking place against Harvard,
[03:14:49.503 --> 03:15:09.322]  If you look at what is beginning to take place in both the video game and the movie industry, what you see is Chinese money coming in and competing with the traditional Jewish money interests, while at the same time there's a pretty
[03:15:11.687 --> 03:15:17.035]  Intense rivalry going on for the limited number of places at the Ivy League universities.
[03:15:17.035 --> 03:15:18.096]  Stop right there.
[03:15:18.096 --> 03:15:21.842]  This is why Vox Day is so smart, and you are as well, Harrison.
[03:15:21.842 --> 03:15:27.871]  I was told this 10, 15 years ago, high-level Hollywood, and now it's coming out, but it's in the Chinese news.
[03:15:29.367 --> 03:15:38.109]  They kind of carry the Hitlerian idea that Jews run everything and they see that as the rival group they're targeting and now you're even seeing it in a group of young Asians being brainwashed.
[03:15:38.109 --> 03:15:40.290]  This is so sophisticated.
[03:15:40.290 --> 03:15:41.470]  This is the real stuff, folks.
[03:15:41.470 --> 03:15:41.910]  You're getting it.
[03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:46.791]  This is not the whole pop thing you see or the cool ultra right-wing thing hating Jews.
[03:15:46.791 --> 03:15:48.552]  This is what's really going on.
[03:15:48.552 --> 03:15:49.152]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:52.530]  Hear that?
[03:15:52.530 --> 03:15:57.915]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:15:57.915 --> 03:16:00.817]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:00.817 --> 03:16:04.400]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[03:17:20.868 --> 03:17:22.089]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:22.089 --> 03:17:26.012]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:26.012 --> 03:17:27.533]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:27.533 --> 03:17:30.496]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:30.496 --> 03:17:36.060]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:36.060 --> 03:17:37.261]  I can help you, too.

[03:18:51.984 --> 03:18:57.649]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:18:57.649 --> 03:18:59.251]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:18:59.251 --> 03:18:59.891]  It's a good thing.
[03:18:59.891 --> 03:19:03.495]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:19:03.495 --> 03:19:05.877]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:19:05.877 --> 03:19:07.378]  I learned what the best was.
[03:19:07.378 --> 03:19:12.503]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:19:12.503 --> 03:19:13.023]  It's amazing.
[03:19:13.223 --> 03:19:15.786]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:19:15.786 --> 03:19:22.634]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPaperSupply, that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:19:22.634 --> 03:19:24.316]  He has a glut of them.
[03:19:24.316 --> 03:19:26.599]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:19:26.599 --> 03:19:27.480]  When it's this child using $200, it's $127!
[03:19:32.677 --> 03:19:36.819]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making twenty-something bucks on them.
[03:19:36.819 --> 03:19:38.940]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:41.280]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:41.881]  It's amazing.
[03:19:41.881 --> 03:19:47.923]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:19:47.923 --> 03:19:50.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.526 --> 03:20:20.630]  You know, I'm not really proud of this designation, but at the same time I'm proud that we've told the truth and done the right things to have the establishment give us this designation.
[03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:40.158]  We are the most demonized, the most lied about, the most hated group because with our guests and the whole compendium of what we do at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, the radio, the TV, the films, the special reports, is exposed the real power structure of the world and the different competing groups that want the general public to be totally unaware of this.
[03:20:40.894 --> 03:20:43.755]  And the fact that the globalists have decided to bring down the West.
[03:20:43.755 --> 03:20:46.635]  Now, Vox, you got us some intriguing things there.
[03:20:46.635 --> 03:20:48.455]  Vox Day joins us.
[03:20:48.455 --> 03:20:52.536]  Again, you can go to voxday.blogspot.com.
[03:20:52.536 --> 03:20:55.117]  And VoxVersity on YouTube.
[03:20:55.117 --> 03:21:03.218]  And he's got Alt Hero, the comic book company that we sell his great comic books that sell out constantly when they come in.
[03:21:03.218 --> 03:21:04.758]  Alt Hero.
[03:21:04.758 --> 03:21:07.299]  We'll cover that more and take some calls coming up in the next segments.
[03:21:08.251 --> 03:21:26.383]  Vox, getting into, everybody thinks about America as the only place in the world, but there's seven plus million people outside of this, and the real rivalries and the real tribalism that goes on, and you were getting into China and its rivalry with planetary, in their word, Jewry, and all the rest of this.
[03:21:26.383 --> 03:21:31.206]  So from your deep research, what's really going on?
[03:21:31.206 --> 03:21:34.628]  Well, the West is in decline.
[03:21:34.628 --> 03:21:37.550]  The West has been in decline more or less
[03:21:38.343 --> 03:21:49.693]  Since the early 20th century, and so this is a topic of a great deal of concern from the leaders of the West.
[03:21:49.693 --> 03:22:04.706]  This is also a great deal of concern to the various tribes and nations outside the West, because some of them see this as an opportunity and they see it as a way to exercise their national ambitions.
[03:22:05.783 --> 03:22:14.148]  Others see it as something to fear because they have perhaps been defended by the dominance of the West.
[03:22:14.148 --> 03:22:27.175]  And so, it's happened so subtly that a lot of people don't even recognize that it's happened, but the United States is no longer a global superpower.
[03:22:27.175 --> 03:22:34.959]  You know, even during the Cold War, the United States had more ability to effectively intervene around the world
[03:22:35.620 --> 03:22:37.140]  Then it does now.
[03:22:37.140 --> 03:22:45.122]  But we've now reached a point where China is a regional power that is stronger in its region than the United States.
[03:22:45.122 --> 03:22:51.083]  And by the way, the Pentagon put a report out yesterday saying just this that we're no longer the dominant force.
[03:22:51.083 --> 03:22:57.024]  Yeah, I mean, they're acknowledging what those of us who have been paying attention to this for the last 20 years already knew.
[03:22:57.024 --> 03:23:03.406]  You know, the late Jerry Pornell created an excellent science fiction series.
[03:23:03.406 --> 03:23:03.926]  It was part
[03:23:04.851 --> 03:23:07.973]  It was part fiction and part real.
[03:23:07.973 --> 03:23:16.357]  He would get, you know, leading military thinkers to contribute actual articles and then you'd have short stories that would sort of illustrate them.
[03:23:16.357 --> 03:23:21.919]  It's called, it's called There Will Be War and we published, he published nine of them.
[03:23:21.919 --> 03:23:29.543]  We revived the series and he and I put out volume 10 and we're planning to continue the series in his honor with volume 11.
[03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:43.852]  But when you look at the way that the military balance changed over time, you can even see in the late 80s how the balance of power was beginning to shift.
[03:23:43.852 --> 03:23:55.838]  And so now the United States is not only not the global superpower, but it's not even a power equivalent to what it used to be.
[03:23:56.698 --> 03:23:58.499]  After the end of World War II.
[03:23:58.499 --> 03:24:14.008]  And let's be clear, we could have been the total power, and we promoted freedom and strength and didn't sell out, but it was parlayed into a global order for corporations to try to have some type of dominance into the future, but really they've just handed power to the communist Chinese and others.
[03:24:14.008 --> 03:24:24.274]  And I want your view on this, but expanding on that, if you pull back and you look at it, when China gets dominance, which the CFR has been planning, which we just showed on screen,
[03:24:25.555 --> 03:24:32.498]  By 2030, that means we acquiesce to their regulations, their censorship, and we see big tech already doing it.
[03:24:32.498 --> 03:24:34.920]  So, it just doesn't mean that we're not the dominant power.
[03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:40.962]  It means the best part of the West, freedom, private property, all of it, it's gone.
[03:24:40.962 --> 03:24:41.743]  It's going to be gone.
[03:24:41.743 --> 03:24:43.143]  It's going to be hellish.
[03:24:43.143 --> 03:24:51.447]  And I see Trump trying to stomp the brakes on this, and I just see the psychically poisoned population basically begging for their own destruction.
[03:24:51.447 --> 03:24:52.368]  It's very, very sad, Vox.
[03:24:53.777 --> 03:25:03.521]  Well, I think that you need to keep in mind that the globalists are not as in control as we sometimes imagine them to be.
[03:25:03.521 --> 03:25:04.141]  I totally agree.
[03:25:04.141 --> 03:25:10.763]  Kissinger says they're always trying to control and get power out of a new order.
[03:25:10.763 --> 03:25:16.306]  Well, not only that, but to a certain extent, they have, they're riding a tiger.
[03:25:16.306 --> 03:25:22.428]  And, you know, when you put yourself at the front of the parade and you're riding on the back of a tiger,
[03:25:23.734 --> 03:25:31.420]  It looks really impressive, but that doesn't mean that the parade is necessarily following you, and it doesn't mean that the tiger isn't going to eat you.
[03:25:31.420 --> 03:25:32.221]  I agree.
[03:25:32.221 --> 03:25:45.611]  And so I think that China in particular is a very, very dangerous game for the globalists of the West to be trying.
[03:25:45.611 --> 03:25:49.154]  They should have never allowed it to have all of our energy and power.
[03:25:49.154 --> 03:25:50.315]  I mean, they set it up.
[03:25:50.908 --> 03:25:57.850]  Well give me your view then on how they set it up and said Chinese century coming and did all this and then of course they thought they had seats at the table.
[03:25:57.850 --> 03:26:02.732]  I think the Tigers already thrown them off or the Dragons already thrown them off.
[03:26:02.732 --> 03:26:12.235]  Yeah I think that if you look at the way they were totally focused on trying to break the dominance of the Christian West.
[03:26:12.235 --> 03:26:12.676]  Yes.
[03:26:12.676 --> 03:26:19.078]  And so that's why you've seen this this centuries-long assault on Christianity.
[03:26:19.078 --> 03:26:19.398]  And so
[03:26:20.692 --> 03:26:32.259]  It's very common when you have a dominant and powerful enemy to not really pay too much attention to whoever you have to team up with in order to defeat them.
[03:26:32.259 --> 03:26:43.827]  And so I think that to the globalists who wanted to overturn the Western order, the Christian European order,
[03:26:44.998 --> 03:26:50.026]  They were thinking, well, you know, the Chinese, they're just, you know, they're they're communists or atheists.
[03:26:50.026 --> 03:26:51.048]  They're not Europeans.
[03:26:51.048 --> 03:26:57.658]  You know, we can we can handle them because you got to keep in mind as powerful as China looks to us today.
[03:26:57.658 --> 03:26:59.360]  You know, China was.
[03:27:00.225 --> 03:27:02.766]  Prostate before the European powers.
[03:27:02.766 --> 03:27:04.927]  Tens of millions of dead.
[03:27:04.927 --> 03:27:08.789]  Broken up by European powers for hundreds of years in colonial sectors.
[03:27:08.789 --> 03:27:12.250]  No running water in 98% of the country just 60 years ago.
[03:27:12.250 --> 03:27:13.190]  Exactly.
[03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:18.733]  And so there was such a spiritual obsession with dominating the power of the West by the globalists taking it over.
[03:27:18.733 --> 03:27:24.875]  But even though they'd already taken it over, they still had to spike their own weapon in some dumb ritual of their power.
[03:27:24.875 --> 03:27:26.876]  And then they just destroyed the main engine they had.
[03:27:28.484 --> 03:27:29.125]  Well, exactly.
[03:27:29.125 --> 03:27:38.993]  And I think that the biggest mistake that they made, and I think this is very typical, I think the biggest mistake that they made was one of arrogance.
[03:27:38.993 --> 03:27:42.817]  They thought, well, we're just so much smarter than everyone else.
[03:27:42.817 --> 03:27:51.785]  But what people have never realized is that the Chinese have a very high level of average intelligence.
[03:27:51.785 --> 03:27:55.348]  You know, they are a very smart people and
[03:27:56.267 --> 03:28:08.496]  Simply being able to access the information base of the West was really all they needed in order to catch up very rapidly.
[03:28:08.496 --> 03:28:21.726]  And so... And we're very easy to buy off now because we're not Christian anymore and really have no values other than hating America, so the left is tailor-made to help merge with the chi-coms and destroy their own families.
[03:28:22.621 --> 03:28:25.683]  Well, not only that, but the West has been really weakened.
[03:28:25.683 --> 03:28:35.131]  And just to understand, I've been a civic nationalist myself for many years.
[03:28:35.131 --> 03:28:36.932]  We all are to a certain extent.
[03:28:36.932 --> 03:28:46.259]  And that puts all of the peoples of the West in a weaker position when you compare it to the very highly tribalistic
[03:28:47.584 --> 03:28:49.246]  Nations that are coming out of the east.
[03:28:49.246 --> 03:28:49.627]  That's right.
[03:28:49.627 --> 03:28:50.929]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[03:28:50.929 --> 03:28:54.494]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:29:52.174 --> 03:29:55.276]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:29:55.276 --> 03:29:58.178]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:29:58.178 --> 03:30:01.139]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[03:30:45.782 --> 03:30:48.303]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select.
[03:30:48.303 --> 03:30:51.145]  High-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[03:30:51.753 --> 03:31:02.356]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:31:02.356 --> 03:31:04.417]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:31:04.417 --> 03:31:07.138]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:31:07.278 --> 03:31:08.759]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:08.759 --> 03:31:15.586]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:31:15.586 --> 03:31:17.688]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:31:17.688 --> 03:31:27.258]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:27.398 --> 03:31:36.946]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:36.946 --> 03:31:44.191]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:44.191 --> 03:31:47.494]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:47.494 --> 03:31:50.857]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:31:51.537 --> 03:32:00.829]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:00.829 --> 03:32:03.712]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:03.712 --> 03:32:09.740]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:10.420 --> 03:32:16.663]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:16.663 --> 03:32:22.966]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:22.966 --> 03:32:29.890]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:31.033 --> 03:32:44.058]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:44.058 --> 03:32:48.319]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:48.319 --> 03:32:54.902]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:54.902 --> 03:32:57.603]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.733 --> 03:33:09.415]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:09.415 --> 03:33:15.778]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:15.778 --> 03:33:21.882]  You know, Box Day is a really smart guy, and he doesn't do a lot of other interviews, so I'm glad he comes on with us.
[03:33:21.882 --> 03:33:30.147]  And I've read a lot of what the Globalists write, and I've read a lot of what the Communist Chinese write, and I've read a lot of what the Russians write.
[03:33:30.147 --> 03:33:34.950]  And there really is this weird leftist, anti-Christian system
[03:33:35.675 --> 03:33:45.899]  Because that was the old dominant system, was Christianity in the West, where they just are always at war with that, when that's a system that creates wealth and innovation and success.
[03:33:45.899 --> 03:33:56.942]  So they're destroying the very system that actually let the occultist and the weirdos and everybody do what they want, but now they want control over speech.
[03:33:56.942 --> 03:33:58.263]  They want control of everything.
[03:33:58.263 --> 03:34:03.285]  They want their own weird authoritarianism that's all diametrically opposed to Christianity.
[03:34:03.285 --> 03:34:04.265]  It's really Satanism.
[03:34:05.757 --> 03:34:12.161]  And then meanwhile, here come the Chi-Coms, who won't let any of their leftist propaganda in, any of it, who kill gays, who, you know, everything.
[03:34:12.161 --> 03:34:18.845]  And they're just marching in, buying up Hollywood, buying up the debt, buying up control of everything.
[03:34:18.845 --> 03:34:20.926]  And this clash is coming.
[03:34:20.926 --> 03:34:22.387]  This clash is expanding.
[03:34:22.387 --> 03:34:25.349]  And the Chi-Coms are allied with the authoritarian EU.
[03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:27.210]  We've seen the big Brexit betrayal.
[03:34:27.210 --> 03:34:28.851]  Vox is in Europe.
[03:34:28.851 --> 03:34:31.293]  So Vox, big picture then, these different power structures,
[03:34:32.424 --> 03:34:35.685]  Get into the most important points you want to make to people, because folks don't understand.
[03:34:35.685 --> 03:34:47.148]  If you tune into CNBC or MSNBC or ABC, you're getting politically total dribble that has nothing to do with anything except confusing people and sabotaging culture.
[03:34:47.148 --> 03:34:48.948]  They admit their own documents.
[03:34:48.948 --> 03:34:57.110]  And then it's so frustrating to read what the actual controllers say, as you do, as I do, to know the reality that no one should be for this.
[03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:59.231]  Not even anti-Christian, you know, crazies, but
[03:35:00.726 --> 03:35:05.950]  They still just don't care because they have been raised into this cult of hating the West.
[03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:09.452]  So how do you see all this unfolding?
[03:35:09.452 --> 03:35:12.434]  Well, you first asked me to give my advice.
[03:35:12.434 --> 03:35:19.339]  And so my advice is to let go of your assumptions.
[03:35:19.339 --> 03:35:28.745]  All the assumptions that you have about how people should behave and start looking at how people actually do behave.
[03:35:30.183 --> 03:35:43.190]  Especially those of us on the right, we tend to have a very romanticized view of Enlightenment ideals, American Revolutionary ideals, the Constitution, etc.
[03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:46.031]  And that's fine.
[03:35:46.031 --> 03:35:49.032]  Ideals exist for a reason.
[03:35:49.032 --> 03:35:55.716]  But where you make a mistake and where you get into danger is where you start substituting your ideals for reality.
[03:35:59.378 --> 03:36:16.467]  And so, what we are beginning to see is that a lot of the ideas and the ideals that we in the Christian West believed were universal are not in fact valued by most of the rest of the globe.
[03:36:16.467 --> 03:36:23.251]  And so, we also need to recognize that we don't make the rules anymore.
[03:36:23.251 --> 03:36:27.473]  The game that we're playing has different rules
[03:36:28.288 --> 03:36:32.010]  Then the rules that applied when the West was completely in charge.
[03:36:32.010 --> 03:36:40.954]  And so that's going to be a very difficult process and maybe an impossible one for people of our generation for the average person of our generation.
[03:36:40.954 --> 03:36:50.738]  You know, our assumption has always been that, well, nobody would want to do something that stupid because everyone would be worse off.
[03:36:50.738 --> 03:36:53.299]  Everyone would be more poor.
[03:36:53.299 --> 03:36:57.161]  But if you look at what the big tech companies have done to you,
[03:36:58.507 --> 03:37:11.896]  If you look at what the companies like Facebook and Twitter and PayPal are doing, they have essentially transformed the digital economy into a third world economy.
[03:37:11.896 --> 03:37:18.660]  And what I mean by that is they have created an economy where contracts don't exist.
[03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:20.421]  Reliability does not exist.
[03:37:20.421 --> 03:37:22.643]  Accountability does not exist.
[03:37:22.643 --> 03:37:25.645]  You have to simply you don't know one day to the next.
[03:37:26.354 --> 03:37:37.541]  Whether you're going to be able to buy something or pay something, that is literally the description of a third world country, a third world economy.
[03:37:37.541 --> 03:37:52.331]  Hernando de Soto, the economist, has won a number of awards for pointing out that one reason why the third world is so poor is because they have no contract law and there is no reliability to business transactions.
[03:37:52.331 --> 03:37:55.093]  And that is what we have created
[03:37:55.988 --> 03:37:57.249]  With the internet economy now.
[03:37:57.249 --> 03:38:15.889]  And it's not just a third world model, they're going to a third world authoritarian, almost strongman rule, or after the fall of the Roman Empire when it just became emperors, where the left from any time it wants to now can just punish whoever it wants along ideological lines which creates an echo chamber in the left
[03:38:16.289 --> 03:38:19.733]  To make them even more extreme, more bullying, and more out of control.
[03:38:19.733 --> 03:38:30.126]  And the slippery slope just in six months, there's been more censorship, and more harassment, and more de-platforming, and more removal of people's right to commerce than we saw in the last hundred years combined.
[03:38:30.126 --> 03:38:36.333]  So we're going down the slope now, and if we could stop it, punish them, pull back,
[03:38:37.424 --> 03:38:45.289]  Engage in economic warfare against the Chinese at this point, and cut them off at their legs, we could have some chance to parlay in the future.
[03:38:45.289 --> 03:38:56.196]  But instead, the majority of our people either don't care or actually have been trained, like baby ducks who've imprinted on globalist propaganda, to hate their own mother and father and those that take care of them.
[03:38:56.196 --> 03:38:59.478]  They literally want to cut their own heads off to spite their face.
[03:39:00.792 --> 03:39:23.247]  Yeah, there's a cartoon that expresses it very well where there's an individual sitting on the branch of a tree and he's high up off the ground and he's busily sawing at the branch of the tree because he hates the branch of the tree, but he doesn't realize that he's going to fall down as soon as he finishes cutting through it.
[03:39:23.247 --> 03:39:29.331]  And that's the position that the left is in, but the problem that we face on the right is that
[03:39:30.049 --> 03:39:36.734]  We cannot and will not be able to convince them that cutting off the branch is a bad idea.
[03:39:36.734 --> 03:39:52.827]  They don't believe us and they wouldn't be on the left if they actually had the capability of accepting logic and being able to correctly anticipate the consequences of their actions.
[03:39:52.827 --> 03:39:54.629]  And so, you know,
[03:39:55.914 --> 03:40:02.261]  A lot of people describe me as being, you know, this far right extremist, whatever.
[03:40:02.261 --> 03:40:09.588]  But the reality is, I'm simply watching what's happening, comparing it to what's happened in the past.
[03:40:12.695 --> 03:40:14.476]  Observing the obvious.
[03:40:14.476 --> 03:40:17.998]  You know, the things that I'm talking about are not things that I want to happen.
[03:40:17.998 --> 03:40:21.599]  They're things that are happening and are going to happen.
[03:40:21.599 --> 03:40:23.540]  Well sure, take the globalists left.
[03:40:23.540 --> 03:40:28.062]  They think they're going to ally with radical Islam into the future and dominate the world.
[03:40:28.062 --> 03:40:31.524]  But radical Islam is going to slit their throat so fast it'll make their head spin.
[03:40:32.887 --> 03:40:36.089]  Well, that's one bizarre thing.
[03:40:36.089 --> 03:40:41.632]  Another bizarre thing is you see writers like David Spengler.
[03:40:41.632 --> 03:40:43.773]  He called himself Spengler.
[03:40:43.773 --> 03:40:45.695]  His name is David Goldberg, actually.
[03:40:45.695 --> 03:40:53.399]  And he's constantly writing about this amazing respect that the Chinese have for the Jews.
[03:40:53.399 --> 03:40:59.843]  And every time I read his article, I think, David, they see you as their main rival.
[03:41:00.669 --> 03:41:06.611]  You know, they're not going to team up with you against the United States.
[03:41:06.611 --> 03:41:11.273]  Their whole goal is to dominate both parties.
[03:41:11.273 --> 03:41:27.138]  And so, you know, it boggles my mind that so many people somehow think that they're going to finesse and maneuver their way around these massive historical forces and these great nations that have survived for millennia.
[03:41:31.318 --> 03:41:33.300]  Is there any path out of this?
[03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:37.865]  Is there any way to reach a brainwashed leftist to stop sabotaging their own nest?
[03:41:37.865 --> 03:41:40.907]  Is there any way to get through to them?
[03:41:40.907 --> 03:41:46.153]  I don't believe so, and let me explain my justification for saying this.
[03:41:46.153 --> 03:41:55.662]  I was interviewed by the largest comics site about two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago.
[03:41:57.109 --> 03:42:11.081]  And they wrote a 17,000 word interview where they went into incredible detail, mostly because they wanted to inoculate themselves against being accused of somehow sympathizing with me.
[03:42:11.081 --> 03:42:17.566]  So basically, they would ask a question, I would answer it, and then they would explain why they disagreed with it.
[03:42:17.566 --> 03:42:18.227]  So it was very long.
[03:42:19.176 --> 03:42:29.040]  And one of the things that we disagreed about was I said that there's no way to negotiate or compromise with the SJWs, with the radical left.
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:33.842]  And this poor editor, he said, no, I think you're wrong.
[03:42:33.842 --> 03:42:37.124]  I think, you know, we can talk like this.
[03:42:37.124 --> 03:42:40.405]  If we can talk, everybody can talk and so forth.
[03:42:40.405 --> 03:42:42.026]  So the article ran.
[03:42:42.888 --> 03:42:44.469]  And the next day... Hold on!
[03:42:44.469 --> 03:42:45.990]  Cliff Hanger, the article ran next day.
[03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:47.110]  We'll recap this straight ahead.
[03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.831]  I meant to go to calls.
[03:42:47.831 --> 03:42:48.291]  I apologize.
[03:42:48.291 --> 03:42:48.711]  We're out of time.
[03:42:48.711 --> 03:42:50.252]  We're going to come back with more of Vox Day.
[03:42:50.252 --> 03:42:50.953]  This is riveting stuff.
[03:42:50.953 --> 03:42:54.895]  Living in a volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:54.895 --> 03:42:58.197]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:42:58.197 --> 03:43:00.658]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater.
[03:43:00.658 --> 03:43:04.460]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:07.222]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:07.963 --> 03:43:11.768]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:11.768 --> 03:43:18.257]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:18.257 --> 03:43:23.224]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:23.954 --> 03:43:27.896]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:27.896 --> 03:43:35.079]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:35.079 --> 03:43:39.801]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:39.801 --> 03:43:46.003]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:46.003 --> 03:43:49.965]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:51.042 --> 03:43:55.266]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:43:55.266 --> 03:43:58.748]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:43:58.748 --> 03:44:00.530]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:44:00.530 --> 03:44:03.792]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[03:44:03.792 --> 03:44:10.578]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:44:10.578 --> 03:44:15.642]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:44:16.002 --> 03:44:22.089]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:22.089 --> 03:44:25.092]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:25.092 --> 03:44:26.173]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:26.173 --> 03:44:30.017]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:30.017 --> 03:44:32.039]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:32.039 --> 03:44:33.320]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:33.320 --> 03:44:34.402]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:34.402 --> 03:44:36.043]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:36.043 --> 03:44:38.466]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:44:38.966 --> 03:44:40.287]  I will never falter.
[03:44:40.287 --> 03:44:42.609]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:42.609 --> 03:44:43.550]  I physically will.
[03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:50.315]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then fullrestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:44:52.049 --> 03:44:57.690]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:44:57.690 --> 03:44:59.311]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:44:59.311 --> 03:44:59.931]  It's a good thing.
[03:44:59.931 --> 03:45:03.532]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:45:03.532 --> 03:45:05.912]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:45:05.912 --> 03:45:07.413]  I learned what the best was.
[03:45:07.413 --> 03:45:12.554]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:45:12.554 --> 03:45:13.074]  It's amazing.
[03:45:13.254 --> 03:45:15.837]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:45:15.837 --> 03:45:22.705]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:45:22.705 --> 03:45:24.367]  He has a glut of them.
[03:45:24.367 --> 03:45:26.690]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:45:26.690 --> 03:45:27.531]  When it's discharged usually $200, it's $127!
[03:45:32.751 --> 03:45:36.873]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[03:45:36.873 --> 03:45:38.994]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[03:45:38.994 --> 03:45:41.334]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[03:45:41.334 --> 03:45:41.935]  It's amazing.
[03:45:41.935 --> 03:45:47.957]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:45:52.123 --> 03:45:59.585]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[03:45:59.585 --> 03:46:03.867]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:46:03.867 --> 03:46:08.668]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[03:46:09.388 --> 03:46:23.313]  All-Info Wars Life Supplements, 50% off, 127 or 49% off, Alexa Pure Pro, Gravity Fed Filters, Alexa Pure Breeze, Air Filtration, now at 40% off.
[03:46:23.313 --> 03:46:24.634]  That's right at Lost Leader.
[03:46:24.634 --> 03:46:25.874]  Again, to get rid of inventory.
[03:46:25.874 --> 03:46:26.835]  So take advantage of that.
[03:46:26.835 --> 03:46:27.575]  It's an amazing system.
[03:46:28.095 --> 03:46:29.475]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[03:46:29.475 --> 03:46:30.536]  They're trying to defund us.
[03:46:30.536 --> 03:46:33.276]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[03:46:33.276 --> 03:46:37.518]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[03:46:37.518 --> 03:46:42.639]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:42.639 --> 03:46:47.600]  Support the InfoWars, get great products, get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists.
[03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:49.881]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:49.881 --> 03:46:54.422]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:46:54.422 --> 03:46:57.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.551 --> 03:47:16.832]  Box Day, we're getting into all these subjects.
[03:47:16.832 --> 03:47:21.936]  We carry all the hard copies of the great comic books that are very politically incorrect.
[03:47:21.936 --> 03:47:24.679]  They're not even really that hardcore, but that's why they're so triggering.
[03:47:24.679 --> 03:47:26.100]  But they're very well done.
[03:47:26.100 --> 03:47:28.722]  And we carry the first four in the series.
[03:47:28.722 --> 03:47:30.063]  Some new ones are coming out.
[03:47:30.063 --> 03:47:32.965]  These sell out very, very quickly, but we do have more in stock.
[03:47:32.965 --> 03:47:35.207]  He's got a new book coming out next week, a digital copy.
[03:47:35.207 --> 03:47:37.408]  We'll be carrying it as soon as it's a hard copy.
[03:47:37.408 --> 03:47:40.691]  And that's Jordanetics, A Journey into the Mind of Humanity's Greatest Thinker.
[03:47:42.236 --> 03:47:46.558]  You know, they claim he got censored at his university for saying that there are men and women and no other genders.
[03:47:46.558 --> 03:48:03.788]  I think the guy sounds pretty smart on many levels, but then I noticed that they never censor him, and they push him, and they promote him, and then, you know, he said, oh, Alex Jones, they bet off more than they could choose censoring him, but then I also see his little cohort, people that run with him, working with him,
[03:48:04.457 --> 03:48:07.341]  You know, really not saying a word about the censorship and going along with all this.
[03:48:07.341 --> 03:48:11.427]  I have no heart on for, in a bad way for, you know, Jordan Peterson.
[03:48:11.427 --> 03:48:15.053]  But I do think it's important to see the system really embracing him.
[03:48:15.053 --> 03:48:15.654]  It's kind of like...
[03:48:17.003 --> 03:48:33.052]  Peter Joseph, that's a fake name, with the whole Zeitgeist movement that we were told was the second coming of Christ, and the UN having him at meetings and all this, and there's going to be a magic computer that puts you in a plastic sports stadium, and there'll be no more money, but the technocrats will run everything.
[03:48:33.052 --> 03:48:34.112]  Well, that's what the globalists want.
[03:48:34.112 --> 03:48:35.713]  That's what Michael Bloomberg wants.
[03:48:35.713 --> 03:48:39.155]  And that guy said, you'll be sent to a re-education camp.
[03:48:39.155 --> 03:48:44.078]  He talks in a voice like this, Alex, I'll come back on if you apologize, I never said
[03:48:44.801 --> 03:48:48.303]  He'd be sent to re-education camp, though he did say it on air.
[03:48:48.303 --> 03:48:58.489]  So, I mean, I do see when something's being pushed, kind of like the Q movement was being pushed and said that, you know, stay with the plan, Sessions is great, he'll never be fired.
[03:48:58.489 --> 03:49:00.611]  And then, oh, but I'm a Fed, I'm going to be arrested.
[03:49:00.611 --> 03:49:04.573]  I mean, I talked to high-level folks as high as you can go.
[03:49:04.573 --> 03:49:06.234]  They couldn't stand Sessions, what was going on.
[03:49:06.829 --> 03:49:09.650]  But, oh, Magic Q, Magic Show.
[03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:13.452]  I mean, there is a Q-schmell to Jordan Peterson.
[03:49:13.452 --> 03:49:18.995]  Let's spend a few minutes on that and then back into big picture and where you think Trump's going.
[03:49:18.995 --> 03:49:24.358]  Well, I think that the book might change your mind about Jordan Peterson.
[03:49:24.358 --> 03:49:33.823]  In fact, as we speak, he is at the 42nd annual European meeting of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:49:33.823 --> 03:49:36.464]  And so if you want to talk about globalists,
[03:49:37.332 --> 03:49:44.051]  Jordan Peterson is essentially constructing their new religion, their post-Christian ethic.
[03:49:44.810 --> 03:49:49.072]  And so that's what the book delves into.
[03:49:49.072 --> 03:50:00.019]  No, no, I mean, I understand the establishment likes him, and I understand that he's enticing conservatives and nationalists right now with one construct, but you're saying he's someone else entirely.
[03:50:00.019 --> 03:50:02.360]  And I believe you, and I see evidence of that.
[03:50:02.360 --> 03:50:08.203]  Quantify why you're saying he's so dangerous, being set up as their new Timothy Leary or their new super guru.
[03:50:08.203 --> 03:50:09.364]  And I can't wait to read the book.
[03:50:09.364 --> 03:50:10.224]  I mean, quantify.
[03:50:10.224 --> 03:50:13.006]  And I am aware he is at the trilateral meeting right now.
[03:50:14.426 --> 03:50:15.547]  Yeah.
[03:50:15.547 --> 03:50:21.772]  Jordan Peterson's primary goal is to save the human race by ending war.
[03:50:23.258 --> 03:50:37.690]  And he has decided that the cause for war is group identity, so therefore the way that you stop war and bring peace is to eliminate all group identity and bind everyone together.
[03:50:37.690 --> 03:50:43.355]  Well, that's the exact globalist plan, but then he attacks all these fake identity politics groups that are leftist.
[03:50:43.355 --> 03:50:46.538]  That makes us think he's our ally, but really all the identities must go.
[03:50:47.873 --> 03:50:48.454]  Precisely.
[03:50:48.454 --> 03:50:49.434]  He's a gatekeeper.
[03:50:49.434 --> 03:50:51.797]  He's like Ben Shapiro.
[03:50:51.797 --> 03:51:08.391]  If you notice, ever since William F. Buckley, the right keeps being offered these opinion leaders whose sympathies are at least partially in line with the globalists.
[03:51:09.961 --> 03:51:20.505]  That's why, you know, you log into YouTube and it constantly throws Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro videos even though you've never watched one.
[03:51:20.505 --> 03:51:27.007]  I mean, you know, I log on to YouTube and it's got Ben Shapiro this, Jordan Peterson that.
[03:51:27.007 --> 03:51:37.991]  You know, I only watch Owen Benjamin and Stephan Molyneux and Mike Cernovich and yet their videos are never ever recommended to me.
[03:51:39.056 --> 03:52:02.228]  So we know who's being pushed and what I wanted to do with Jordan Edex and what I believe that we've done is, you know, simply show exactly what it is that he's talking about and what it is that he's advocating because he hides his real message under this word salad that is very, very difficult for the average individual to penetrate.
[03:52:02.228 --> 03:52:07.491]  I'll tell you this, he does have that super arrogance of the left and that just
[03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:13.573]  Well, you can't fully understand Jordan Peterson unless you see this 1977 article from an Edmonton newspaper.
[03:52:33.181 --> 03:52:36.702]  And he's, he's 14 years old.
[03:52:36.702 --> 03:52:42.364]  And he's, he has this incredibly punchable expression on his face.
[03:52:42.364 --> 03:52:48.025]  And the headline is, I won't be happy until I'm elected Prime Minister.
[03:52:48.025 --> 03:52:55.968]  And so this is somebody who is pathologically ambitious, and yet pretends to be
[03:52:57.634 --> 03:53:02.595]  Post-ideological, not interested in politics, above it all.
[03:53:02.595 --> 03:53:05.156]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:53:05.156 --> 03:53:12.257]  And the amazing thing is, he came within 13 votes of being elected the vice president of the regional party.
[03:53:12.257 --> 03:53:18.378]  So, this is a highly, highly political, highly ambitious guy.
[03:53:18.378 --> 03:53:23.880]  He's actually the equivalent of the really annoying person on your student body.
[03:53:23.880 --> 03:53:24.940]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:26.060]  He has that spirit.
[03:53:26.736 --> 03:53:29.097]  Of people lusting for power.
[03:53:29.097 --> 03:53:30.178]  Precisely.
[03:53:30.178 --> 03:53:31.218]  And so he fits in.
[03:53:31.218 --> 03:53:34.299]  See, I didn't even know that about him in the 14-year-old Illinois.
[03:53:34.299 --> 03:53:41.162]  So you can tell, obviously, for that position, there's been grooming going on behind the scenes.
[03:53:41.162 --> 03:53:43.263]  And notice how he just explodes onto the scene.
[03:53:43.263 --> 03:53:44.544]  Like, take Infowars.
[03:53:44.544 --> 03:53:47.885]  It took, you know, 15 years to get it to a big level.
[03:53:47.885 --> 03:53:50.426]  And all these other people that took all this time.
[03:53:50.426 --> 03:53:52.467]  This is suddenly just boom!
[03:53:52.467 --> 03:53:54.988]  And he's supposedly anti-establishment, but then he's not.
[03:53:56.420 --> 03:54:02.064]  Well, the thing that's kind of funny is that Peterson's been trying to sell out most of his life.
[03:54:02.064 --> 03:54:05.766]  He just couldn't find any takers until recently.
[03:54:05.766 --> 03:54:18.015]  So, you know, if you are a fan of Jordan Peterson, or if you're close to someone who's a fan of Jordan Peterson, I would highly recommend that you read Jordanetics.
[03:54:18.015 --> 03:54:24.379]  We're going to put it on Kindle Unlimited and everything, just to make sure that as many people can get access to it as possible.
[03:54:27.514 --> 03:54:39.742]  You know, you can't possibly understand how crazy the guy is and how crazy his ideas are until you actually read them for yourself.
[03:54:39.742 --> 03:54:40.983]  No, I get it.
[03:54:40.983 --> 03:54:50.089]  Like any cult group or any political system coming up, it puts out something that's the outer area that it's telling you it's about once it gets you lured in.
[03:54:50.089 --> 03:54:51.890]  And I've certainly seen that.
[03:54:51.890 --> 03:54:54.152]  But as you said, I know when something's being force fed.
[03:54:54.853 --> 03:54:58.856]  And I know when something's being blocked, they're fighting around the clock to try to block us.
[03:54:58.856 --> 03:55:02.058]  They're totally trying to block all the guys you also named.
[03:55:02.058 --> 03:55:04.299]  And that's because we're not conforming to this.
[03:55:04.299 --> 03:55:05.720]  And that's really the big guide.
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:10.543]  I mean, look, any QAnon crap was being force-fed everywhere.
[03:55:10.543 --> 03:55:14.265]  So, I mean, now look where that went.
[03:55:14.265 --> 03:55:20.429]  Well, yeah, I think, I mean, I think a lot of us wanted to believe that Q was correct.
[03:55:21.338 --> 03:55:33.281]  We wanted to believe that Trump was going to actually do something, as opposed to constantly threaten and bluster, and then in the end not necessarily deliver.
[03:55:33.281 --> 03:55:41.243]  For example, today, the headline in Drudge was talking about how Trump says he can throw out the entire press corps.
[03:55:41.243 --> 03:55:45.604]  Well, okay, great, but go ahead and do it.
[03:55:45.604 --> 03:55:49.205]  Just go ahead and don't argue this stuff.
[03:55:50.450 --> 03:55:51.311]  You know, take action.
[03:55:51.311 --> 03:55:53.633]  Exercise the power.
[03:55:53.633 --> 03:56:00.660]  Exactly, because all the posture, I mean, don't get me wrong, Donald Trump is a great president.
[03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:03.603]  Oh, he's a great guy, absolutely.
[03:56:03.603 --> 03:56:08.888]  He's facing such aggressive criminality from the globalists, he's got to really take the gloves off.
[03:56:08.888 --> 03:56:13.753]  Exactly, and I think that that's difficult for somebody who is by nature a negotiator.
[03:56:14.890 --> 03:56:17.731]  And exactly, and he keeps thinking, hey, this is good for everybody.
[03:56:17.731 --> 03:56:20.191]  Why would you want to sell America out like you said at the start of the show?
[03:56:20.191 --> 03:56:21.311]  This doesn't make sense.
[03:56:21.311 --> 03:56:22.092]  We have the power.
[03:56:22.092 --> 03:56:23.672]  We could parlay it to something better.
[03:56:23.672 --> 03:56:25.872]  They're like, no, we are a spirit.
[03:56:25.872 --> 03:56:27.933]  We want to mount America's head on the wall.
[03:56:27.933 --> 03:56:32.774]  We hate you, too, because you're strong and smart and actually negotiate and are chivalrous.
[03:56:32.774 --> 03:56:33.914]  We aren't chivalrous.
[03:56:33.914 --> 03:56:34.914]  We are scumbags.
[03:56:34.914 --> 03:56:37.435]  We are part of the chicken crap dimension.
[03:56:37.435 --> 03:56:38.995]  And we're here to F everyone over.
[03:56:40.086 --> 03:56:44.888]  Well that's why I keep telling people, you need to play by whatever the rules of the game are.
[03:56:44.888 --> 03:56:46.329]  You know, I'm a gamer.
[03:56:46.329 --> 03:56:47.289]  So that's secondary.
[03:56:47.289 --> 03:56:55.372]  So that means we've all got to become election officials and pick big counties that we control and then absolutely steal the election because that's what the Democrats do.
[03:56:55.372 --> 03:56:57.893]  If that's what the rules are, then play by the rules.
[03:56:57.893 --> 03:56:59.294]  It's not a difficult concept.
[03:56:59.294 --> 03:57:09.438]  The important thing is to stop claiming that the only correct way to play football is to run the ball and we can't use this unfair technique called the forward pass.
[03:57:10.126 --> 03:57:11.387]  You know, can you imagine?
[03:57:11.387 --> 03:57:12.067]  No, no, I agree.
[03:57:12.067 --> 03:57:13.608]  They broke the social contract.
[03:57:13.608 --> 03:57:17.290]  Doesn't mean we're going to now do what they do, but we're in a new ballgame and that's what I've been saying.
[03:57:17.290 --> 03:57:21.092]  It's like these people are now in total criminal mode.
[03:57:21.092 --> 03:57:22.933]  We've got a serious situation on our hands.
[03:57:22.933 --> 03:57:24.754]  Box Day, thanks for all the time.
[03:57:24.754 --> 03:57:25.194]  Amazing.
[03:57:25.194 --> 03:57:27.315]  Come back anytime we can get you.
[03:57:27.315 --> 03:57:28.796]  Congratulations on everything.
[03:57:28.796 --> 03:57:29.817]  I want to read Jordanetics.
[03:57:29.817 --> 03:57:31.918]  I want to order 10,000 of these babies.
[03:57:31.918 --> 03:57:34.299]  Give me a really good deal on them and I want to promote this.
[03:57:34.299 --> 03:57:37.041]  Because everybody asks me about Jordan Peterson and all I see is
[03:57:37.661 --> 03:57:38.902]  Demon energy.
[03:57:38.902 --> 03:57:39.783]  We'll be right back.
