[00:00.000 --> 00:07.140]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[00:07.140 --> 00:34.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.740 --> 00:38.060]  could there have been more than one shooter involved in the 1968
[00:38.060 --> 00:43.020]  assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy RFK was shot in Los Angeles shortly
[00:43.020 --> 00:47.060]  after claiming victory in California's Democratic primary the
[00:47.060 --> 00:52.140]  shooter Sirhan Sirhan is serving a life sentence for the assassination but at a
[00:52.140 --> 00:56.580]  forensics conference this weekend in Connecticut new theories he might not
[00:56.580 --> 01:01.080]  have fired the fatal shots is that possible Amy Parmenter from NBC station
[01:01.080 --> 01:07.180]  WVIT in Hartford was there Amy what led experts to this theory well actually it
[01:07.180 --> 01:10.980]  was a very interesting theory that was presented yesterday at this symposium
[01:10.980 --> 01:15.300]  presented by a couple of scientists so of course it was rather complicated and
[01:15.300 --> 01:19.940]  detailed I'm gonna try to simplify it for you a little bit the scientists two
[01:19.940 --> 01:25.580]  independent researchers Dr. Robert Joling and Philip von Prague forensic
[01:25.580 --> 01:29.580]  evidence experts actually had been studying the Kennedy assassination
[01:29.580 --> 01:33.540]  separately they never even met until last year when they met at a seminar and
[01:33.540 --> 01:37.980]  realized that their independent conclusions were almost perfectly matched
[01:37.980 --> 01:42.460]  now Joling what he was able to come up with by studying the forensics evidence
[01:42.460 --> 01:47.500]  was that Sirhan Sirhan could not have fired the fatal shot and that's because
[01:47.500 --> 01:52.980]  according to his findings that fatal shot came from behind Senator Kennedy and
[01:52.980 --> 01:56.860]  of course witnesses all put Sirhan Sirhan face-to-face with Kennedy about
[01:56.860 --> 02:01.100]  four to six feet away so he would not have had the opportunity to shoot from
[02:01.100 --> 02:06.180]  behind now von Prague what he studied was a little more complicated he
[02:06.180 --> 02:10.820]  actually looked at the audio recording known as the Prusinski recording which
[02:10.820 --> 02:14.620]  was made by a Canadian journalist actually inadvertently who had left his
[02:14.620 --> 02:19.740]  tape recording on after recording Kennedy's victory speech and then as he
[02:19.740 --> 02:23.340]  kind of followed the Kennedy entourage into the kitchen pantry there at the
[02:23.340 --> 02:28.380]  ambassador hotel the tape was still still rolling rather welcome ladies and
[02:28.380 --> 02:34.540]  gentlemen it is already Friday the 28th of day of March 2008 and we're gonna be
[02:34.540 --> 02:40.860]  live here for the next three hours and we have a jam-packed broadcast with

[02:47.460 --> 02:55.060]  last 30 minutes of the show we will obviously be talking more about RFK and
[02:55.060 --> 03:05.980]  how he was killed by the CIA today separately NBC News ABC News and BBC have
[03:05.980 --> 03:12.660]  come out with separate evidence showing improving the government killed RFK and
[03:12.660 --> 03:16.820]  incidentally Sunday on the Sunday edition show coming up in two days four to six
[03:16.820 --> 03:23.460]  p.m. central I've got the one of the highest level members of the Japanese
[03:23.460 --> 03:29.860]  Parliament the diet he's the head of the second largest party in Japan he's
[03:29.860 --> 03:34.620]  gonna be joining us from Japan give you a heads up on that on the radio show
[03:34.620 --> 03:41.980]  Sunday and so will Jim Mars Jim is gonna be joining us Sunday to talk about not
[03:41.980 --> 03:49.140]  just the murders of JFK which has now been for all intents and purposes admitted
[03:49.140 --> 03:53.980]  the guy running the operation deathbed confession the evidence just piles to
[03:53.980 --> 04:01.660]  the Sun but now the murder of RFK now the official Los Angeles County
[04:01.660 --> 04:06.620]  coroner said he'd been shot multiple times in the back and that he'd been
[04:06.620 --> 04:10.740]  shot at close range and there were even powder burns on his jacket sir hands
[04:10.740 --> 04:18.740]  with a different caliber shot into the ceiling as he was programmed to do with
[04:18.740 --> 04:22.820]  a completely different caliber I mean it was a no-brainer one caliber was shot
[04:22.820 --> 04:29.100]  into RFK's back at point-blank range the other was a handgun shot into the
[04:29.100 --> 04:35.980]  ceiling and that's always been the fact and we always knew that so now BBC and
[04:35.980 --> 04:43.420]  NBC and oh they're breaking the major news he got that nomination and they
[04:43.420 --> 04:51.780]  killed him that's how they roll and then they told the cattle that they didn't

[09:17.660 --> 09:24.140]  are criminals everyone is a criminal inside the system we are all criminals
[09:24.140 --> 09:32.940]  only the almighty state owned by the private bankers it is God all right
[09:32.940 --> 09:42.220]  let me go over some of the news will be covering in the meantime CIA claim CIA
[09:42.220 --> 09:47.060]  role claim in Kennedy killing new video and photographic evidence that puts
[09:47.060 --> 09:52.460]  three senior CIA operatives at the scene of Robert Kennedy's assassination has
[09:52.460 --> 10:03.660]  been brought to light so this came out three or four days ago in the BBC and
[10:03.660 --> 10:08.820]  then a few days later in the US they decided to focus on a scientific
[10:08.820 --> 10:16.020]  symposium where they have top forensic experts going over the fact that he was
[10:16.020 --> 10:24.660]  clearly shot in the back but the evidence of top CIA officials being at the
[10:24.660 --> 10:32.620]  event which we've always known that's the bigger evidence and then you have the
[10:32.620 --> 10:37.700]  forensics the LA coroner on record said he was shot in the back by a different
[10:37.700 --> 10:47.900]  caliber than what sir and sir and we're shooting from the front RFK Robert
[10:47.900 --> 11:00.980]  Kennedy was not shot in the front he was shot in the back and we are changed
[11:00.980 --> 11:08.380]  questioned his son just a few weeks ago about E Howard Hunt the admitted
[11:08.380 --> 11:12.660]  Watergate chief the admitted CIA section chief the admitted individual that
[11:12.660 --> 11:21.780]  overthrown scores of nations on his deathbed said that he ran the operation
[11:21.780 --> 11:31.660]  to kill JFK and in that same Rolling Stones article he talked about how he
[11:31.660 --> 11:36.900]  wished and couldn't wait till Bobby was killed and then was real happy when he
[11:36.900 --> 11:41.940]  was killed and would he say he just oh that's a you know I don't want to talk
[11:41.940 --> 11:46.020]  about that I don't want to you know I don't want to I don't really care any
[11:46.020 --> 11:55.660]  yeah to hear from what he Howard Hunt has to say completely gelded completely
[11:55.660 --> 12:00.220]  castrated mumbling about how we need global taxes to save us from global
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.900]  warming just effeminate it's not even right to call those type of men effeminate
[12:04.900 --> 12:12.420]  they are because women are tough women are many cases more outspoken than men
[12:12.420 --> 12:16.980]  so it's wrong to call them effeminate but they don't show male characteristics so
[12:16.980 --> 12:27.540]  I guess I mean you kill my daddy I'm gonna be talking about it but I guess
[12:27.540 --> 12:30.340]  from the time he was a little boy they said you keep your mouth shut they'll
[12:30.340 --> 12:38.660]  come get you I bet he cried in bed was scared of shadows outside his window and
[12:38.660 --> 12:47.900]  so hill and we've got letters from JFK's secretary talking about how she knows
[12:47.900 --> 12:55.180]  they killed in the whole family knows it they just keep their mouth shut now the
[12:55.180 --> 13:01.980]  word is that JFK Jr. was preparing in fact he done some even some exposes in
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.580]  his own magazine was preparing to really go public and also run against
[13:05.580 --> 13:10.900]  Hillary so they clearly whacked him the evidence of that is manifest he should
[13:10.900 --> 13:16.140]  have spoken out earlier less time jogging less time acting cool less time
[13:16.140 --> 13:23.900]  socializing more time speaking out you be alive my friend I'm not bashing you
[13:23.900 --> 13:29.820]  I'm just trying to encourage others before they do sleep with the fishes to
[13:29.820 --> 13:35.900]  speak out that's what keeps you safe just like they say in JFK to Jim Garrison
[13:35.900 --> 13:40.820]  by the way that's based on true conversations he had according to the
[13:40.820 --> 13:52.500]  screenwriter Jim Mars and others that I've talked to CIA role claim and Kennedy
[13:52.500 --> 13:55.980]  killing new video and photographic evidence that puts three senior CIA
[13:55.980 --> 13:59.340]  operatives at the scene of Robert Kennedy's assassination has been brought
[13:59.340 --> 14:03.980]  to light the evidence was shown and report by Shane O'Sullivan broadcast on
[14:03.980 --> 14:09.900]  BBC Newsnight it reveals that the operatives and four unidentified
[14:09.900 --> 14:14.060]  associates with the ambassador hotel Los Angeles in the moments before and
[14:14.060 --> 14:21.460]  after the shooting on June 5th 1968 the CIA had no domestic justification and
[14:21.460 --> 14:27.220]  some of the officers were based in Southeast Asia at the time with no
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.900]  reason to be in Los Angeles decoy Kennedy had just won the California
[14:32.900 --> 14:37.500]  Democratic primary on anti-war ticket and was set to challenge Nixon for the
[14:37.500 --> 14:43.340]  White House when he was shot in a kitchen pantry a 24-year-old Palestinian
[14:43.340 --> 14:49.140]  Sirhan Sirhan was arrested as the lone assassin and notebooks at his house
[14:49.140 --> 14:55.140]  seemed to incriminate him and then of course he was a mental patient who'd
[14:55.140 --> 15:00.460]  been under CIA doctor's care at facilities and then everyone witnessed
[15:00.460 --> 15:03.980]  this gorgeous woman in the polka dot address giving him the special coffee
[15:03.980 --> 15:10.700]  clearly his handler he go he goes into the amnesiac probably liquid Halcyon type
[15:10.700 --> 15:16.100]  drug total amnesiac they give it to you when they pull your wisdom teeth you can
[15:16.100 --> 15:19.260]  tell someone as they're coming out of it what has happened to them and they'll
[15:19.260 --> 15:24.700]  repeat it back to you what you mainly are given in sedation dentistry I mean
[15:24.700 --> 15:28.620]  these are just simple drugs been around for 50 years to do this they put it in
[15:28.620 --> 15:32.620]  his drink he went this is saw her putting something in a string and then he
[15:32.620 --> 15:36.860]  walks in and starts shooting at the ceiling as he was programmed to do
[15:36.860 --> 15:40.060]  shooting no because it would have been a problem and more of an investigation if
[15:40.060 --> 15:44.300]  he'd have shot others missing so he shoots up as he's ordered to as you've
[15:44.300 --> 15:48.580]  been carefully programmed to and then happily just goes with them and admits
[15:48.580 --> 15:53.180]  he did it all and it's all incriminated just like the hijackers bags and
[15:53.180 --> 15:59.060]  repeated flights were the only bags that got stuck in the luggage machines they
[15:59.060 --> 16:04.020]  got stuck they fell off the rack they didn't make it to the planes and their
[16:04.020 --> 16:08.460]  cars and with their confessions and their two passports fell out of the
[16:08.460 --> 16:11.620]  fireballs at the north and south tower and fell to the ground and were found
[16:11.620 --> 16:21.260]  not one too it's of course it's all an accident but now it's admitted CIA high
[16:21.260 --> 16:25.980]  level black op commanders involved in Southeast Asian narcotics trafficking
[16:25.980 --> 16:31.220]  fly in and they're there of course witnesses said they saw one of these
[16:31.220 --> 16:34.940]  guys behind him pull a gun out and shoot him in the back but it doesn't matter if
[16:34.940 --> 16:39.980]  you have witnesses that saw them shoot him in the back it doesn't matter if you
[16:39.980 --> 16:46.660]  have the LA coroner saying he was shot in the back by different caliber none of
[16:46.660 --> 16:54.380]  that matters in front of everyone McVeigh is driving erratically the state
[16:54.380 --> 16:58.420]  police pulling him over no license plates on either end of the bizarre you
[16:58.420 --> 17:09.140]  know super old bomber type vehicle kind of off eggshell yellow color with
[17:09.140 --> 17:14.260]  Bondo all over it the most obvious car you can pick he's drooling this was in
[17:14.260 --> 17:18.780]  the daily Oklahoma he stumbles out and begins drooling saying it hurts it hurts
[17:18.780 --> 17:25.620]  tell him take the chip out and see those are keywords in mind control and he
[17:25.620 --> 17:30.740]  also of course had a cell phone with it they just call up and say it's just like
[17:30.740 --> 17:36.500]  the born ultimatum you watch that movie they call in the army captain they say
[17:36.500 --> 17:39.620]  are you committed to this program you've already signed the papers you sure
[17:39.620 --> 17:44.380]  you're committed he says yes sir whom black bag over the head whom hardcore
[17:44.380 --> 17:50.300]  waterboarding torture lsd pcp constant torture six months a year reprogramming
[17:50.300 --> 17:54.380]  training keywords different compartmentalized personalities that was
[17:54.380 --> 17:59.900]  all declassified in the 70s they had that in Korea they were breaking our
[17:59.900 --> 18:04.180]  troops turning them into absolute zombies
[18:04.180 --> 18:12.820]  but as if that isn't enough that he's stumbling around saying I and it isn't
[18:12.820 --> 18:17.100]  like he didn't really have a chip probably that's a key they want to give
[18:17.100 --> 18:20.260]  you something psychological to associate it with it's like they create a
[18:20.260 --> 18:26.780]  schizophrenia they can turn on you understand and then your mind psychosomatically
[18:26.780 --> 18:34.580]  creates the nausea the hysteria the flashbacks the deep pre-programmed areas
[18:34.580 --> 18:43.180]  in your mind from just super intense torture in an hallucinogenic state they
[18:43.180 --> 18:46.140]  also give you drugs to make you nauseous while it's happening and
[18:46.140 --> 18:50.900]  fetamin injections to heighten the awareness so that you're so that you
[18:50.900 --> 18:55.740]  so that you have hyper awareness of pain taking you to levels unknown to the
[18:55.740 --> 19:04.140]  average person unnatural but as if that wasn't obvious enough from the time
[19:04.140 --> 19:09.700]  he's arrested jolly and west in the 1977 MK ultra hearings running the program
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.980]  with dr. Ewing Cameron kidnapping more than 10,000 women and children in the
[19:13.980 --> 19:17.580]  u.s. and canada for CIA mind control programs you know that's declassified
[19:17.580 --> 19:22.700]  more than 10,000 20-plus year program he comes out of retirement goes and lives
[19:22.700 --> 19:27.460]  in Denver for the trial visits him every day in his cell and his with him to the

[24:06.140 --> 24:11.180]  the government tried to have mind control programs to create supermen super
[24:11.180 --> 24:16.260]  soldiers they proved under drugs and hypnosis they could take somebody who
[24:16.260 --> 24:22.820]  could branch press 400 pounds they could branch press a thousand pounds you know
[24:22.820 --> 24:28.780]  somebody that could squat 500 pounds could squat 2,000 pounds because the
[24:28.780 --> 24:34.780]  brain has an automatic switch unit like governor but stuff like born identity
[24:34.780 --> 24:40.460]  born supremacy born ultimatum it doesn't create those type of super soldiers
[24:40.460 --> 24:45.700]  from the info that's leaked out and we've gotten what it does create is is
[24:45.700 --> 24:51.260]  screwed up messed up people who can who will drive a truck in with a bomb in it
[24:51.260 --> 24:55.540]  and then come out and drool or go into a school and shoot a bunch of people and
[24:55.540 --> 25:00.460]  then blow their own head off or or who will just sit I mean you would watch
[25:00.460 --> 25:03.540]  McVannell's interviews he was completely drugged out completely out of his
[25:03.540 --> 25:07.220]  gourd with his mind control doctor sitting right beside him and they got
[25:07.220 --> 25:12.260]  to stay on him just like when our troops would get up and they would believe it in
[25:12.260 --> 25:15.500]  Vietnam and when and when North Korea would capture them they would get up
[25:15.500 --> 25:20.300]  and believe you know and say America was evil and of course at the time it
[25:20.300 --> 25:23.780]  wasn't as evil as is now in a way it was but they in truth thought it was good
[25:23.780 --> 25:29.060]  before but now really believed it was bad and a few of them were hard to break
[25:29.060 --> 25:32.140]  and they would you know the famous cases of blinking with Morse code torture
[25:32.140 --> 25:39.340]  torture torture but you know what is my control
[25:39.980 --> 25:46.020]  well my control is real simple you see this with women who've been beaten a
[25:46.020 --> 25:50.300]  lot by their husband and the guy goes to come his hair and raises his hand to
[25:50.300 --> 25:54.020]  come his hair and the woman flinches you'll see that in restaurants you'll
[25:54.020 --> 25:58.660]  see that on the street or parents that beat their kids a lot you'll see little
[25:58.660 --> 26:02.380]  kids that you've been around people where they'll move to comb their hair or move
[26:02.380 --> 26:09.220]  to put their glasses on the kid flinches or the dogs been beaten a lot and you
[26:09.220 --> 26:13.980]  move your hand it'll run if you're puppy training a dog you've just got the
[26:13.980 --> 26:16.700]  newspaper you're barely even whacking them with it but you know it's just to
[26:16.700 --> 26:22.460]  train them they see a magazine they get upset that's my control and then they
[26:22.460 --> 26:27.660]  make it real fancy and and and then and you know it's scientific and there's
[26:27.660 --> 26:32.380]  wires in your brain and the rest of it and they have moved on to that they've
[26:32.380 --> 26:37.140]  moved on where they can have a rat a cockroach a human with electrodes not
[26:37.140 --> 26:40.500]  talk according to the stuff that's declassified I'm sure they can now but
[26:40.500 --> 26:45.700]  what we know 20 years ago that he classified every few decades is they
[26:45.700 --> 26:48.260]  can hook wires into your head with remote control and have you walk around
[26:48.260 --> 26:53.820]  shoot guns drive cars they can hit a button make you urinate make you fall
[26:53.820 --> 26:59.900]  asleep make you vomit make you feel euphoric now that's electronic and so
[26:59.900 --> 27:03.740]  that's cybernetic a little different most of the mind control has just been in
[27:03.740 --> 27:09.980]  basic Pavlovian torture and let me tell you they torture you for six months and
[27:09.980 --> 27:14.500]  then say a key word when the torture begins you'll become upset you'll start
[27:14.500 --> 27:17.860]  stumbling around you'll start throwing up you'll fall to your knees under the or
[27:17.860 --> 27:21.620]  when they say the happy word when the drugs are taken off and the and the
[27:21.620 --> 27:27.540]  opiates are given to you feel okay when they say that key word you're gonna feel
[27:27.540 --> 27:37.940]  great and so here I am spent 20 minutes on this but it's an important subject and
[27:37.940 --> 27:40.700]  and now I've digressed and I've got so many guests coming up I don't know how
[27:40.700 --> 27:45.940]  I'm gonna get to all of this now but you can go to prison planet calm in

[27:49.300 --> 27:53.980]  out admit and page after page that the government basically killed him and
[27:53.980 --> 27:57.940]  there's a whole nother NBC report from the forensics admitting the government
[27:57.940 --> 28:04.220]  killing but here's the the other type of news we have Defense Secretary Gates

[28:12.260 --> 28:17.580]  reason this is very this is a big concern they wouldn't be letting these

[33:58.240 --> 34:03.480]  growing every single day and so remember that the enemy is scared to death I've
[34:03.480 --> 34:10.400]  done my own analysis for many different gauges that we have to know how big our
[34:10.400 --> 34:15.200]  movement is and it's almost unmeasurable it's so large and growing so fast but
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.280]  there are billions of people that now know about the new world order there are
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.840]  billions of people I would have to say about 35 40 percent of the world's
[34:23.840 --> 34:30.160]  population has a good idea now exactly what we're facing but we still feel like
[34:30.160 --> 34:34.040]  we're alone we still feel like other people aren't aware of it that final
[34:34.040 --> 34:38.680]  illusion is starting to collapse though and as it collapses it will fall that
[34:38.680 --> 34:45.760]  much faster I'm gonna talk more about that in a moment but now getting back to
[34:45.760 --> 34:54.800]  airport security they hire these poor folks for 8 10 bucks an hour and you go
[34:54.800 --> 35:01.320]  to some airports and they're nice they're friendly they're professional but
[35:01.320 --> 35:08.080]  you go to others and it is just a culture of abuse I have witnessed with my
[35:08.080 --> 35:20.560]  own eyeballs at the San Francisco airport some group called Wolverine
[35:20.560 --> 35:28.000]  security they had they were wearing kind of bright blue cubra commander type
[35:28.000 --> 35:38.760]  battle dress fatigues with yellow highlights they were all foreigners they
[35:38.760 --> 35:44.080]  pretend I look like it was predominantly Vietnamese and they were with
[35:44.080 --> 35:50.440]  abandoned jabbing pushing interrogating gibbering message gibbering because it
[35:50.440 --> 35:58.240]  wasn't even good English at old people women of World War two vet a group of
[35:58.240 --> 36:01.440]  more getting on the plane with one of that oxygen tanks I told the story look
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.040]  like he was about to die I guarantee he died within a year and he looked bad to
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.200]  barely walk had his elderly wife helping him they were pushing along the
[36:11.200 --> 36:21.440]  oxygen tank and they would search you it was 2002 once you'd gone through the
[36:21.440 --> 36:27.640]  gates but then again randomly going on to the plane right before you won the
[36:27.640 --> 36:37.120]  plane at the gate not just going through the terminals and I've been in
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.440]  airports I'm at the Austin airport where some guy was reading a book that
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.880]  looked like something on 1984 it was a black-covered book with white lettering
[36:44.880 --> 36:51.200]  saying that said how someone becomes a terrorist and she has a culture of
[36:51.200 --> 36:58.520]  paranoia and I and so to keep those guys going and not completely bored they'll
[36:58.520 --> 37:02.120]  ban lighters they'll ban matches then later it's fluids then later it's how
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.680]  much fluids you can have and at first again it's dog training every fourth
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.240]  fifth person until about 2004 they wanted you to take your shoes off if you the
[37:11.240 --> 37:18.320]  beeper went off and then it's everybody and then it's oh and I've got the TSA's
[37:18.320 --> 37:23.640]  thing here I mean if you've got piercings and your skin grows over them they
[37:23.640 --> 37:29.720]  make you take them out with pliers they have pliers there for it or you don't
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.520]  have to fly but soon it'll be you don't have to have a job you don't have to
[37:32.520 --> 37:36.200]  drive a car you don't have to very soon you get on the road and you're not paid
[37:36.200 --> 37:39.800]  up and don't have your nationality card in order the car will turn off bare
[37:39.800 --> 37:42.760]  minimum the cameras will scan your license plate and the police will be
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.760]  dispatched that's official and that's the new system life will be like the
[37:47.760 --> 37:50.080]  airports
[37:51.160 --> 37:57.840]  but people say it's ridiculous the TSA stupid the government or morons well the
[37:57.840 --> 38:02.480]  guys and gals that believe all this is for security are morons but the
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.400]  Pavlovian psychological warfare experts know this is part of your journey into
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.640]  slavery you are being acclimated they've written about it and if you can be made
[38:13.640 --> 38:19.720]  to remove your piercings from your breast if you can be made to remove
[38:19.720 --> 38:23.880]  piercings from other places I won't mention if you can be made to have women
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.760]  and men there's been a lot of cases of this in the news where the men like to
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.800]  and I've seen it good-looking women are in trouble I mean if you're a perv it's
[38:30.800 --> 38:36.480]  where you get a job it's been like that throughout history pregnant women are
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.960]  made to pull up their shirts and show their bellies in front of people and
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.080]  then the woman cries so they arrest her the husband complained so they beat him
[38:45.080 --> 38:52.400]  up that was in the major papers that's just one case of hundreds I see him
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.960]  every day five six-year-olds are tasered for arguing people who don't give urine
[38:56.960 --> 39:01.520]  samples are tasered paying compliance tortures legal in this country of course
[39:01.520 --> 39:10.240]  it's illegal but they criminally say it's legal it's their policy and so it's
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.120]  about making you do things that are stupid and ridiculous I saw a report
[39:14.120 --> 39:23.360]  Monday I never covered out of the London Telegraph just type buses must stop
[39:23.360 --> 39:31.760]  every 30 minutes under EU rules and the European Union makes all buses stop
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.800]  every 30 minutes and everyone must get off to make sure the bus driver doesn't
[39:36.800 --> 39:43.080]  fall asleep see they take something that sounds reasonable but then they set
[39:43.080 --> 39:48.240]  international laws under then once you're trained to do something that's sounds
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.480]  reasonable but it's really ridiculous then you'll follow any other orders it's
[39:51.480 --> 40:00.640]  habitualization you know I was on talk sport Monday for two hours and I was
[40:00.640 --> 40:07.280]  listening to ads run by the government by the EU saying you know stop every 30
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.400]  minutes be safe this causes hundreds of deaths a year people falling asleep and
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.240]  it does I thought there's some government angle this a while the show was
[40:16.240 --> 40:27.040]  going I googled new rules on drivers sleeping and then all this stuff came up
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.120]  where the police are watching they stop the bus every 30 minutes everybody gets
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.920]  off it's about being micromanaged totally controlled and then once the
[40:36.920 --> 40:41.800]  silliness is set once the silly precedent is set everything else can
[40:41.800 --> 40:47.960]  flow so once you've been trained to take your shoes off and be fondled and take
[40:47.960 --> 40:51.600]  piercings out and but the borders are wide open and they give illegal aliens
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.760]  any IDs they want and the government accepts consulate regular cards on its
[40:55.760 --> 41:02.480]  face it's a fraud it's not about terror it's not about keeping you safe from the
[41:02.480 --> 41:08.320]  boogeyman and I know I've made this point everybody's made this point but we
[41:08.320 --> 41:11.760]  need to write articles about this we need to point out this basic psychology so
[41:11.760 --> 41:17.240]  people understand as they keep saying it's so dumb explosive experts on the
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.560]  news and say well it would take several hours with chemicals that they're
[41:21.560 --> 41:24.840]  talking about to go in the bathroom and make these explosives and then they
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.760]  wouldn't be very high-powered explosives you know first it's you've got a drink
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.360]  out of the water when you carry it on and then it's you see it's about being
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.040]  eyed it's about being questioned it's about being shoved up against a wall
[41:39.040 --> 41:43.400]  it's about show showing papers it's about being prepared and then now they're
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.840]  saying they want to put similar security in malls they want to put it on the
[41:46.840 --> 41:51.440]  streets the schools thumb scaring to get school lunches thumb printing to
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.360]  clock into jobs thumb printing to get library books thumb printing to go to
[41:55.360 --> 42:01.160]  the the gym the tanning salon thumb printing to go to the mega church that's
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.440]  all be part of the casual society as I told you 10 years ago now 11 years ago
[42:06.440 --> 42:15.840]  excuse me and my first film America Destroyed by Design and then they
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.600]  announced we're gonna have on the streets the Viper teams in Dallas in
[42:19.600 --> 42:27.040]  Houston and LA Miami just randomly searching you randomly and then New
[42:27.040 --> 42:34.920]  York over 500,000 in 2007 random stop and searches they just pull cars over
[42:34.920 --> 42:38.520]  randomly so we've got video of this in the upcoming film haven't chosen a name
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.040]  yet for it but just where they just block off a major street in New York they
[42:43.040 --> 42:51.840]  just search everybody just like when you go get a bank account now it's like
[42:51.840 --> 42:56.280]  you're joining the FBI or something background checks 20 questions spying on
[42:56.280 --> 43:00.120]  you of course they don't tell you hey slave we're reporting everything you're
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.480]  doing to the government it's all uploaded to the government you go in to
[43:02.480 --> 43:05.040]  have a baby they're hooked under the health department with a computer
[43:05.040 --> 43:08.840]  reporting everything you're doing asking you questions not telling you this is
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.160]  going right to not even the police who still have some due process but to the
[43:13.160 --> 43:17.640]  other tier the social worker guild they set up 100 years ago to carry out
[43:17.640 --> 43:23.760]  eugenics you got a good environment your husband nice to you huh tell me the
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.800]  truth you can trust me I always tell him to leave I'm your friend tell me I'm
[43:28.800 --> 43:36.960]  your friend they're not your friend they've all been habitualized to be
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.560]  little spooks and little tattletales and they all enjoy it it's their little
[43:40.560 --> 43:48.040]  power position for the betterment of society they're professionals
[43:50.560 --> 43:55.520]  yeah they professionally took over a thousand times the amount of blood
[43:55.520 --> 44:01.400]  thickening vitamin that they demand that they give your baby and they give it to
[44:01.400 --> 44:07.640]  Dennis Quaid and his kids almost die to his kids and they kill more people in
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.920]  the hospitals every year than automobiles do from just drug interactions
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.920]  but doesn't matter they're perfect they're good everything's merging into
[44:16.920 --> 44:27.160]  the government all internationally standardized Mandy Hamlin 37 is
[44:27.160 --> 44:30.840]  demanding a civil rights investigation as well as an apology from federal
[44:30.840 --> 44:36.120]  security agents after being forced to remove a nipple ring before boarding a
[44:36.120 --> 44:40.840]  flight from Lubbock to Dallas in Texas during a press conference miss Hamlin
[44:40.840 --> 44:43.680]  said she was scanned by female transportation security administration
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.800]  agent using a handheld detector that beep when it passed in front of her chest
[44:47.800 --> 44:51.880]  and it goes into how they drug her behind the closed doors made her pull it
[44:51.880 --> 44:58.400]  out with pliers laughed at her and you know what it was like to take my shoes
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.440]  off walk over were thousands of people who walk with all their athletes foot
[45:03.440 --> 45:09.120]  all their germs smell make an issue with that to try to stop it see it's all
[45:09.120 --> 45:12.600]  selectively enforced they'll have you knitting about something else
[45:12.600 --> 45:15.440]  environmental everybody with hand sanitizers everywhere wiping
[45:15.440 --> 45:20.480]  neurotically obsessive compulsively but then you're gonna walk across where
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.320]  everybody else from the whole planet in LAX has been walking and they just say
[45:25.320 --> 45:28.920]  oh you know you didn't beep we're gonna scan you come on over here they start
[45:28.920 --> 45:36.560]  waving the wand they go missed come on mr. stinky feet oh he got stinky feet and
[45:36.560 --> 45:39.840]  I guess they were black guys who'd been teased by whites when they were kids big
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.560]  black guys so it's fun to and I forgive them they're just brainwashed poor
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.920]  pathetic slaves like everybody else I didn't even get mad I was really sad I
[45:47.920 --> 45:53.400]  almost started crying because I realized this country is completely gone mr.
[45:53.400 --> 46:01.360]  stinky feet come on mr. stinky feet yeah you got stinky feet and I looked at
[46:01.360 --> 46:05.640]  him with sadness and they just kind of shamefully went off to somebody else
[46:05.640 --> 46:13.440]  but oh mr. stinky feet he got to stinky feet
[46:14.640 --> 46:23.120]  our nipple ring oh she doesn't like having it removed and they're not gonna
[46:23.120 --> 46:26.040]  like getting right into the pits either when the soldiers shoot them in the
[46:26.040 --> 46:31.960]  back of the head but the soldiers like it because they're on the winning team
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.680]  and they've been trained to do it and the grandsons of the people that financed
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.360]  it all around the nation and so they make a big deal about this in the news so
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.200]  see when you're just having to have your shoes off and be in question you won't
[46:45.200 --> 46:51.280]  feel as bad because after all they make women take their piercings out here's
[46:51.280 --> 46:57.880]  another one spy drones in demand by US police departments but approval pending
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.600]  the Miami police could soon be cutting-edge flying drones to help fight
[47:02.600 --> 47:11.400]  crime oh yes mounted with little infrared systems and sonar systems they'd
[47:11.400 --> 47:15.760]  look right through your walls and give them nice images the classified stuff
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.720]  spent color for decades but the stuff they're now publicly deploying a nice
[47:19.720 --> 47:25.000]  black and white image and hey let the helicopter fly in grids over your house
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.680]  we see the cops on the ground they like the feds coming and advertising the new
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.200]  systems controlled by joysticks only way 20 pounds or so so it's not too bad if
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.120]  it falls on somebody so now the cops get to have them LA for about four years has
[47:40.120 --> 47:43.360]  been without even FAA approval has drones flying around everywhere these
[47:43.360 --> 47:52.440]  little saucers it's all part of the militarization and it says how honey
[47:52.440 --> 47:55.480]  will international and other defense contractors have got a new market the
[47:55.480 --> 48:04.440]  police developer sues to win 12.3 billion Larry Silverstein's already been paid
[48:04.440 --> 48:07.480]  out 4.6 billion he's scheduled to get another 2 billion that's still been
[48:07.480 --> 48:14.200]  withheld but he wants 12.3 billion from damages from airlines and airport
[48:14.200 --> 48:21.480]  security companies the 9-11 attack and of course the airlines themselves the top
[48:21.480 --> 48:27.560]  three were given 35 billion after the attacks as a aid package more than those
[48:27.560 --> 48:30.600]  companies make profit together in five years I crunched the number at the time
[48:30.600 --> 48:33.360]  that was a payoff for job well done then they were given billions more in
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.640]  supplement this will just be another public payoff Larry Silverstein for a
[48:37.640 --> 48:42.760]  job well done well he's gonna come out with over 17 billion dollars total when
[48:42.760 --> 48:47.680]  all is said and done and that's just the payment for going along with the black
[48:47.680 --> 48:56.640]  up crime really does pay well doesn't it when you run the government but
[48:56.640 --> 49:00.160]  criminals always go wild and start killing everybody in mass that's why
[49:00.160 --> 49:06.280]  they always fall but see they need that thrill of doing something dangerous
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.200]  psychopaths always want to get caught that's why they always do get caught
[49:09.200 --> 49:18.440]  down the road because they get wilder and wilder they get more and more reckless
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.800]  of course we die in the process but that's okay and call for new 9-11
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.200]  investigation reaches crescendo public figures increasingly speaking out while

[50:02.960 --> 50:08.920]  new 9-11 investigation has spurned many celebrities to use their
[50:08.920 --> 50:14.080]  public platforms to speak out knowing that the press will at least have to
[50:14.080 --> 50:20.240]  address the issue because they are so celebrity obsessed the latest to do so

[54:34.360 --> 54:44.360]  and on best actress this year other Academy Award winners on and on and on
[54:44.360 --> 54:51.080]  and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on top of it separately
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.280]  National US News is reporting and all these top forensic scientists are
[54:55.280 --> 54:59.960]  saying that Kennedy was shot from behind well the original coroner said that and
[54:59.960 --> 55:06.080]  we have BBC coming out with a three-year investigation with photos and film of
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.640]  four top CIA operatives from Southeast Asia there around him and that's what
[55:11.640 --> 55:15.920]  the witnesses saw and reported that one of these guys shot him in the back it's
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.680]  been declassified that Israel attacked the USS Liberty on purpose Chicago
[55:20.680 --> 55:24.640]  Tribune Associated Press never got any news after that it's now admitted
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.960]  everything we always told you tried to blame it on Egypt it's now been
[55:28.960 --> 55:32.320]  declassified they said our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.760]  Vietnam it came out within days they staged the thing a few months ago where
[55:36.760 --> 55:39.560]  they claim the Iranians were driving up a little motorboat saying we're gonna
[55:39.560 --> 55:46.680]  blow you up totally fake now now admit it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[55:46.680 --> 55:54.120]  cover-ups are being uncovered in the same old men and the CIA and NSA just sit
[55:54.120 --> 55:59.240]  up there running their same old tricks on us over and thinking we're gonna buy
[55:59.240 --> 56:09.000]  it over and over and over again and I think they don't care because they're
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.800]  gonna set off nukes or release bird flu or whatever they're gonna do just have
[56:11.800 --> 56:14.880]  just everybody none of us are safe till they all go to prison I mean you
[56:14.880 --> 56:21.000]  understand that this isn't gonna go away it's not gonna stop we have to avert
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  the next attack we've got to stop it everything I do is to stop that next
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.960]  attack the reason I went public before 9-11 and predicted it was because I saw
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.840]  them preparing the public to carry out the attack I've always said we have to
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.840]  take false flag terrorism that mechanism their favorite tool their favorite
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.520]  weapon and we have to totally expose it and render it useless and we've done
[56:42.520 --> 56:50.000]  that partially but we haven't gone far enough false flag terror the 9-11
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.640]  truth movement is the heart of stopping the globalist and their problem
[56:56.640 --> 57:03.680]  reaction solution Hegelian dialectic if we do not have a universal understanding
[57:03.680 --> 57:08.760]  of that and a universal discrediting of the private corporations that own and
[57:08.760 --> 57:12.240]  run the majority of the world's governments and are mopping up the last
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.720]  few they don't right now to focus in on exterminating the majority of humanity
[57:16.720 --> 57:20.960]  and that's their statement not mine if we do not expose their favorite tool
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.920]  they're gonna continue to beat the brush to drive us out into the open so that
[57:25.920 --> 57:32.680]  they can have their way with us ancients would beat drums set fires drive the
[57:32.680 --> 57:38.560]  elephants the mammoths the mastodons over the cliffs and then they could
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.600]  butcher them and have enough food for the winter that's how they were extinct
[57:42.600 --> 57:52.400]  most archaeologists and anthropologists archaeologists believe just how they hunt
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.040]  pheasant in England today they have beaters a few miles away getting a line
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.440]  and then they start beating and they come in kind of in a wedge of V and then
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.920]  they push out the birds at one point hundreds will come flying out that's
[58:06.920 --> 58:13.120]  all terrorism ish now we're not pheasants and we're not elephants though
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.800]  elephants are magical creatures and very intelligent they are not able to
[58:16.800 --> 58:20.720]  understand and they were made extinct that form of
[58:20.720 --> 58:27.520]  pachyderm now ladies and gentlemen we're humans we can fight back against these
[58:27.520 --> 58:32.240]  bad humans they hit us with fluoride try to get the upper hand but it's not

[59:58.040 --> 1:00:05.680]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the
[1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:31.480]  GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:37.640]  we're gonna be talking to a guest who runs a little newspaper up in main but
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:41.000]  he did more than all the mainstream media has done combined he went out and
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:54.040]  investigated the larger ramifications of an announcement made a month ago of the
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:57.280]  canadian and u.s. military saying that they will use each other's foreign troops
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:07.560]  on domestic soil so that is coming up but before we go any further I wanted to
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:10.880]  just play this clip because I've come across it and somebody sent it to me
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:21.640]  again this is earlier this year Sarah Taylor former White House political
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:27.680]  director and you hear Bush say my government my government and you're
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.880]  changing say I don't care what 80% of the public want you get your input every
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.320]  four years we can do whatever we want we can torture we can torture kids we can
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.480]  take your bill of rights we can legalize illegals we can go after your guns
[1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:45.960]  no we have a bill of rights in a republic the basic rights are protected
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:49.800]  and a 51% wants slavery you can't because you can't violate the rights of
[1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:54.000]  the 49% that's the difference between a pure democracy in a constitutional
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.760]  republic and the White House the executive is the weakest of the three
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:04.200]  branches it goes legislative judicial executive if you really read the
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:08.760]  debates when it was all founded and set up the executive is told what to do with
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:13.120]  the laws basically by the Congress they declare war and then the court sits
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:18.240]  there and referees between the two because you have the greatest
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:23.080]  separation of powers in the Congress at the time senators were elected by the
[1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:26.640]  legislatures they were sent by the states creatures of the states but look
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:31.800]  I don't want to confuse everybody with the facts let's just play her basically
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:38.440]  saying George Bush is God you ready with the same with the
[1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:49.720]  Sarah Taylor clip John that's the yes that's the clip all right there we go
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:58.240]  I was looking over my notes during the break Miss Taylor and I was really
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:04.680]  struck by one of your answers I don't know the answer to your question I will
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:09.800]  say senator I was a deputy assistant to the president I was a commissioned
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:17.200]  officer I took an oath and I take that oath to the president very seriously I
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:24.920]  know the president said recently he referred to our government is his
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:30.560]  government said my government most of us always assume it's the government of
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:37.240]  all of us not just the one individual is almost a monarchy kind of question or
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:41.120]  quite kind of answer that he gave although it may explain a lot of things
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:48.080]  and then you said I took an oath to the president and I take that oath very
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:55.280]  seriously did you mean perhaps you took an oath to the Constitution I the yes
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:00.440]  yeah you're correct I took an oath to the Constitution but what did you take
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:04.360]  a second all to the president I did not I what I should have the answer was
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:08.240]  incorrect the answer was incorrect thank you what what I should have said is that
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:13.080]  I took an oath I took that oath seriously and I believe that taking that
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:20.360]  oath means that I need to respect and do respect my service to the president no
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:25.560]  the old says that you take an oath uphold and protect the Constitution of the
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:32.080]  United States that is your paramount duty I know the president refers to the
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:36.600]  government as being his government it's not it's a government of the people of
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:44.960]  America you're old is not to uphold the president nor is mine to uphold the
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:49.840]  Senate my old like you're old is to uphold the Constitution we'll be right

[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:24.400]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat
[1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:28.160]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't

[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:11.320]  Dave Dushan is our guest for the next 25 minutes I was aware of his work but I
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:15.200]  heard him on Pastor Butch Paw Show eight o'clock central last night driving along
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:20.680]  down the highway here in Austin back to work and he's just an amazing research
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:26.320]  now really none of this is true I mean none of this is new they're just now
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:32.200]  beginning to be truthful about it they're just now beginning to come out
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:39.960]  with it in the past they were deceptive if you take my film 9 11 the road to
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:44.080]  tyranny we have the Washington Post in there and other news articles where it
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:49.040]  said Mexico to Canadian troops will be used during emergencies in the US then
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:52.280]  North com when it was officially established signed deals with them
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:55.840]  they've used Mexican and Canadian troops put out fires Mexican troops in New
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:03.120]  Orleans that's all now down the record Norwegian a wax they were very quiet
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.200]  about it they wouldn't talk about it and now they're beginning to be more out in
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:16.120]  the open with it and I mean you see reports about Texas state police sent to
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:20.280]  teach the royal amount of police how to run checkpoints and violate people I mean
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:25.200]  that was in the news last year it's all being merged you see black water and and
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:31.000]  and other security at the airports up there searching Canadians coming in we
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:38.560]  had in the last month the CFR and several other big think tanks come out and
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:42.960]  call for a North American Union first merging the border regions in the Great
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:46.720]  Lakes just like the border regions of Mexico have already been merged under
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:55.240]  agenda 21 and a quote hundred mile buffer zone so it's all happening we're
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.920]  going into the North American Union just like Governor Ridge former Homeland
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:02.280]  Security had we played a tape where he admitted that they want a national ID
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:06.120]  card he said it's not really that it's a it's an it's a national driver's license
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:09.280]  but it is a national ID card so they say well we want to integrate the
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.320]  countries but we don't want to merge them integrate is merge when you take a
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:19.760]  deck of cards and stack them and then and then you know put them back together
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:27.000]  again that's integrating them when you mix the cards up you're you're
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.720]  integrating them it's the same thing as merging them you take two stacks and
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:35.960]  fan them together well what's that called sometimes the simplest things I
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:41.840]  can't you know you take the cards you go put them back together mix the cards up
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:47.720]  shuffle them thank you John John the little bird that pops in and helps me
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.640]  shuffle the cards but he decided to actually go interview one of the
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:57.680]  generals involved in this merger he decided in fact he helped ferret it out
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:03.040]  and really get the mainstream media to report on it and he decided to really
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:07.400]  talk to the local governments who had no idea the governors the governors aren't
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:14.000]  included in this and he is the publisher and also the editor of the Fort Fairfield
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.160]  Journal got a link to that up on info wars.com
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:29.360]  and I appreciate Dave is it D'Shane or how do I pronounce your name? D'Shane is correct okay
[1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:34.160]  well thank you for coming on the show with us sir I heard you last night you
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:37.560]  were really informative you got the floor of the next 20 minutes or so just
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:43.000]  just as simply as you can tell us the basics of what's happened how you with
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.400]  your little publication help push this out further into the open and then
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.480]  you're meeting with the general and what we're actually facing. Okay Alex a
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:56.080]  couple of weeks ago I ran a story as World Net Daily did and a few
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:02.720]  other independents online about the civil assistance plan signed by the
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:11.360]  generals of US North Com slash NORAD and Canada Com in Fort Sam Houston Texas
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.880]  down your way and I thought okay I'll run the story and I ran it as a
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:22.320]  North American Union military story and then I thought to myself wouldn't it be
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:27.800]  interesting to find out what our local emergency management director has to say
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:31.760]  about it at the county level and I said well I'm questioning him maybe I'll
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:37.000]  write a letter to the county sheriff so I got letters together for our
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.800]  heuristic emergency management which is our county management agency we're in
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.200]  heuristic county and I mailed one off to our county sheriff and then one to our
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:52.000]  secretary of state. Next thing you know that the letters started going up the
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.960]  chain of command and they wound up all the way to our state capital in Augusta
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:03.000]  and I was then putting contact with Robert McAleer our state emergency
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.320]  management director who had no idea that the civil assistance plan was signed
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:12.840]  three weeks previous at the time this was about the first of March when I
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:17.880]  started querying them. Well next thing you know I'm getting a call from our
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:22.600]  state adage general a general Bill Libby he's a major general so that's two
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:28.000]  stars and he's in charge of our state National Guard he had no idea that this
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.600]  had occurred and it took about a week for them to finally get a copy of the
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:38.080]  agreement from Northcom so that they could even review it to comment on it
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:42.200]  because I had a series of questions that I was really interested in having
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:47.400]  answered and what I got from them was we we really want to answer your questions
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.720]  but we have no idea what the civil assistance plan is because we never heard
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.920]  of it. Well they finally did get a copy of it and I did get a chance to meet with
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:02.160]  general Libby and I think he was very honest and sincere and forthright and
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:09.240]  trying to answer my questions but but he didn't answer and and he didn't answer
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.840]  them simply because the civil assistance plan wasn't addressing some of the
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:19.240]  things that I had concerns about one of the concerns was will the Canadian
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:24.360]  troops be required to swear oath of allegiance to the United States or the
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:29.680]  US Constitution in the event that they are used in this country. Well I want to
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:32.480]  go through all that but I want to go back here and make it clear in your
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:36.520]  articles very scholarly it's there's actually two of them it's they're
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.600]  excellent and and and covering the law covering the agreement that's been very
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:46.000]  secretive. The governors the Congress of the United States they have not been
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.640]  included in this and this is part of the continuity of government plan under PDD
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:55.400]  51 that Bush has told the Homeland Security Committee of the House and
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:00.240]  Senate they can't see. Now again the the the Speaker of the House is at the same
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:04.720]  level of the President. The leader of the Senate is at the same level when you
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:09.880]  come to power in the three branches of government they are equal it's co-equal
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:16.600]  is the term. Bush is saying no and even in the in the declassified short version
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:23.040]  of PDD 51 in the accompanying executive order Bush says Congress you don't run
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:28.720]  anything anymore this is a declaration of furor-like powers and I played the
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:34.160]  former White House political director Sarah Taylor earlier saying she swears
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:42.960]  enough to Bush not to America. Go ahead sir. Yeah and and I think I got that I
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:48.800]  think I got that from the interview and I think General Libby was was in a
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:55.000]  roundabout way figuring that out too because he said well don't worry the
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.080]  state governor and the adage in generals of the various states will they're the
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:04.080]  ones who have to request the use of foreign troops through Northcom. That's
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:09.800]  not true. That's not true. That's correct and I showed him I showed him section
[1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:14.160]  1068 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I had a copy of it
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.000]  in front of me and we read it word for word and it says the president shall use
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  and the words are the militia armed forces or both or by any other means
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:29.400]  and and and she'll take such measures as he considers necessary and I said
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:33.960]  General Libby that says president as he considers necessary that doesn't say
[1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:37.520]  governor that doesn't say adage in generals that doesn't say any of any of
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:42.600]  those emergency management agencies says president and he said and he
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.840]  essentially said well that's a little above my pay grade to answer those
[1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:52.640]  questions put it in a nutshell and then go through your meeting and the other
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:56.240]  excellent points you make I mean this is so off the chart this is happening and
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:03.920]  it is happening and the governors and the federal Congress is does isn't even
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:08.320]  allowed to be involved and has no authority but Bush can't just say that
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:11.960]  well it's like Hitler couldn't say he was fear he did people follow the order
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:15.440]  and you know what happened we have and again folks I know a lot of you love
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.440]  Bush that's fine you love the nerdy well he's a total puppet runs nothing well
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:24.640]  your god Hillary or your god Obama is gonna have these powers go ahead right
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:28.680]  and and just as he got done saying well don't worry it's just gonna be the
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:32.040]  governor's and adage in generals inviting them in I said well I made the
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:36.920]  point that you just admitted general that you weren't included in the
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:40.800]  discussions on this plan so you weren't included on the discussions you weren't
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:48.720]  advised that it even occurred and you expect them to to and let you invite in
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:53.440]  the Canadian troops on a plan that they went around your back on and there was
[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:57.680]  pretty pretty much silence in the room then so we of course had to move on but
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:02.240]  I wanted to know things like will the Canadians or and I said essentially it's
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:07.000]  foreign military so I referred to a lot to the foreign military will they be
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:13.200]  allowed to carry arms in our country because he had said general Libya said
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:16.240]  well don't worry they're not going to be here for law enforcement just right
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:21.560]  after I showed him section 1068 of the NDA I said okay if they're not gonna be
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:26.120]  here for law enforcement are they gonna be armed and he says the civil
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:30.880]  assistance plan is silent on that question I said okay that's interesting
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.520]  it is not silent it is not silent because in earlier agreements between
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:39.840]  Northcom and in mainstream news reports in Northcom press releases they've said
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:46.160]  for civil emergencies and to deal with terrorists and they have trained and I've
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:49.600]  been to urban warfare drills where they train with foreign troops for
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:55.520]  operations in the US go ahead okay and I said furthermore I'd like to know who
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:59.760]  these foreign troops are who's going to be that their command structure if and
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:04.440]  when they are deployed in the state and I was speaking specifically from a state
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.880]  of main level because I'm talking to the main adage in general and I said if it
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:11.560]  Canadian troops are in our state I would like to know who's in charge of them is
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.760]  it going to be the sheriff is going to be the governor is going to be you and he
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:19.360]  said well there's an understanding that they would be a reporting to the state's
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:22.960]  adage in generals when assisting in pre-known events such as security of
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:27.320]  sports events but for other unpredicted events there's an ongoing discussion of
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:31.560]  who the troops will actually work for now now now we don't know who to work
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:37.120]  for exactly well we it means the feds for training pavlovian conditioning
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:41.800]  they'll be at sporting events to search small children and widows and old people
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:46.240]  and people with oxygen tanks to train the slaves to have a military presence
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:49.640]  around them but when it really hits the fan the feds will be in control here we
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:58.840]  go it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by
[1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:04.640]  powerful government is known as the builder bird but their objective being
[1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:10.360]  world domination or thousands of years their dark order group now as they hail

[1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:58.320]  Dave Duchan is our guest
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:06.040]  Fort Fairfield Journal just Google that you'll find it you'll link up on info
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:14.760]  wars.com Dave continuing in the brief time that we've got other key points
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:18.240]  that if it's in the two articles you've done or the new info you're coming out
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:25.520]  with you've got the floor okay the main concern that I had was it if we if we
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:30.000]  have a shortage of manpower and we need extra troops and our National Guard is
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.960]  called away or there isn't enough of them I asked General Libby to comment on
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.560]  our main state guard because as you've mentioned in the past on your show that
[1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:44.240]  various states do have their own state guard which is a separate standalone
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:50.800]  entity from the National Guard and in Maine our state guard is codified at
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:57.080]  Maine Revised Statutes title 37B sections 221-225 I believe it is and it
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:03.040]  essentially says that the main state guard is empowered by the governor it is
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:07.760]  made up of the militia and it does use the word militia ages 18 to 45 years of
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:13.720]  age and it is to be equipped it is to be uniformed and share the same military
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:19.320]  rank as the army the US Army but it is not to be used in federal service it is
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:24.240]  not to be used outside of the borders of the state and it was originally formed
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.160]  during World War two when our National Guard was sent overseas activated
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:35.920]  sent overseas we wanted a guard unit still in the in-state so we formed the
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:39.920]  main state guard and we equipped them and I asked General Libby I said look we
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:44.560]  don't need to go to Canada or England or Germany or anywhere else for troops for
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:48.400]  assistance we've we've got enough people right here in the state now that
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:52.560]  could pass out blankets and bottled water and do whatever else needs to be
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:55.920]  done we can do it through an organization that already exists in the
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:00.400]  main state guard and we don't have to pass any new laws and we don't have to
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:05.040]  make any new new plans or protocols and he said the state guard currently has
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.800]  nobody in it and that it exists solely on paper and that's as far as he would go
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:13.360]  with that because of course he well activate the state guard that would have
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:17.560]  to be the governor but well there's bad and worse here and number one Bush's
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:21.160]  federalized the National Guard said he's above the governors and the John
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:25.880]  Warner Defense Authorization Act all of it fits seamlessly into his PDD 51
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:29.320]  saying he's a dictator or the office of the presidency is we don't want to make
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.520]  this about his personality because it's gonna go way past that particular
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:38.480]  puppet that meat puppet they've got so issue one is that he's acting as a
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:43.760]  dictator saying he runs and owns and they all they even have a new they've
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:48.200]  added on these they still have the old oath but they've added on one to him
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.560]  now in the military and his chiefs of staff and people literally say they
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:58.520]  worship him they follow him his White House memos say that law comes from him
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:03.640]  he cannot break the law he can torture children with pliers that he can order
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.000]  that that's actually in memos to the Defense Department listeners that's
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:11.480]  mainstream news I mean this is this is insane but they know what they're doing
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:16.120]  they're setting that precedent but that's bad enough now it's the old bringing
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:20.040]  the mercenaries that have been brought into our shores three separate times the
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:27.560]  Hessians the Germans others 1776 1812 the Mexicans brought in mercenaries from
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:32.720]  Ireland and other places this has happened before and we're dealing with
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:38.760]  this now so just the ultimate insult to end the ultimate insult to injury that
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:48.840]  the rubbing it in your comments yeah that's correct Alex and what I think
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:52.760]  the solution would be would be to activate a main state guard in the event
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:57.680]  it were needed but it doesn't seem at the state level but that is even really
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:03.920]  a discussion that they're interested in having they have roped them in as well
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:10.720]  as I show in martial law the film to be minions being directed by the Federal
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:16.800]  Guard in most cases yeah and and I think they were a little put off by the fact
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:21.800]  that they weren't even included in this discussion he said he said he would have
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:27.480]  at least like to have been forewarned that they had this civilizist plan going
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.640]  so that when somebody like me from the press comes to him he'd have some
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:37.360]  intelligent answers to give and he gave me some answers and and I don't think he
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:43.160]  was lying to me because he did call me I didn't call him and he suggested we meet
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:50.760]  so he reached out to me and and I respect him for that but he was it was
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:55.840]  almost like his hands were tied as as to what he could reveal or what he couldn't
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:59.080]  reveal now again on record you met with a two-star
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:05.480]  Brigadier General or Major General in charge of what area he is the he's the
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:09.800]  adigent general so he's the top general he's in charge of the main National Guard
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:15.600]  he's also the governor's commissioner for defense veterans affairs and
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:19.040]  emergency management he's the go-to guy for America stay there I want to do two
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:23.120]  or three minutes on the other side because you pointed out to him PDD 51
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:29.400]  you pointed out that and I want to specifically get what his response was
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:33.040]  even his body language to that well they're right back we've got more
