[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:28.440]  welcome ladies and gentlemen it's the Alex Jones show live on this Friday
[00:28.440 --> 00:34.920]  March 25th 2011 I'll be your filling host for the first half of this show today
[00:34.920 --> 00:41.160]  my name is Paul Joseph Watson editor and writer for prisonplanet.com and in
[00:41.160 --> 00:45.280]  the second half of the show your host will be none other than the health
[00:45.280 --> 00:51.640]  ranger Mike Adams so be sure not to miss that of course we're streaming live
[00:51.640 --> 00:57.680]  at prisonplanet.tv we'll be taking your calls at the bottom of the hour and in
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.200]  the next hour I'll be talking to Dr. Christopher Bosby who is a pre-eminent
[01:02.200 --> 01:09.760]  nuclear and radiation expert about the deepening crisis in Fukushima and that's
[01:09.760 --> 01:15.880]  where we'll start our news coverage today because for the past week the mass
[01:15.880 --> 01:21.120]  media has been obsessing about the death of Elizabeth Taylor Taylor and a
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.280]  myriad of other distractions of course the attack on Libya has taken center
[01:27.280 --> 01:33.520]  stage we'll discuss that later but there's been a kind of stupefied mass
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.920]  apathy cultivated by the establishment media as part of this bizarre
[01:38.920 --> 01:45.640]  campaign to convince the global population that the Fukushima crisis is
[01:45.640 --> 01:52.160]  all but over when in fact it's deepening day by day now according to the new
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.760]  scientists and the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and geodynamics
[01:57.760 --> 02:05.760]  in Vienna radiation levels being spewed by Fukushima now rival those emitted by
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.480]  the Chernobyl disaster and of course the catastrophe shows no sign of coming to
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.960]  an end it rumbles on day after day and of course the news today reactor core may
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.960]  be breached at damaged Fukushima plan Bloomberg news Japan's nuclear regulator
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.880]  said one reactor core at the quake damaged Fukushima power plant may be
[02:26.880 --> 02:32.200]  cracked and leaking radiation quote it's very possible that there has been some
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.640]  kind of leak at the number three reactor Hidehiko Nishama spokesman that the
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.000]  Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said in Tokyo today while
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.200]  radioactive water at the unit most likely escaped from the react core it also
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.600]  could have originated from spent fuel pools stored atop the reactor he said
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.920]  and so what the mainstream media is reticent to report is the fact that a
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.560]  reactor number three which is the one that was hit you'll remember by that
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.040]  massive fireball explosion we saw on March 14th is the reactor that contains
[03:10.040 --> 03:16.640]  the deadly mox plutonium uranium mix that is in none of the other reactors
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.760]  there at the site and so your gag account as in your EPA radiation detectors
[03:23.760 --> 03:29.760]  are just not going to pick up this mix of plutonium and uranium and this is what
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.640]  we'll be talking to Chris Busby about later in the show it's the most deadly
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.240]  form of radiation and it's also invisible to all these detectors that
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.040]  they're using to tell us that everything's going to be okay now wrote an
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.920]  article about this yesterday which you can read plutonium is the most deadly
[03:48.920 --> 03:56.000]  radioactive isotope known to man and indeed mox is two million times more
[03:56.000 --> 04:05.120]  deadly than normal enriched uranium the half-life of plutonium 239 is 24,000
[04:05.120 --> 04:11.800]  years and just a few milligrams of p239 escaping in a smoke plume can
[04:11.800 --> 04:20.640]  contaminate soil for tens of thousands of years now this stuff you know if this
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.160]  stuff leaks out in significant dosages you can forget about your potassium iodide
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.800]  it's a different monster altogether but I'm sure again that the EPA and the
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.200]  CDC will continue to tell Americans that everything's fine and that there's
[04:36.200 --> 04:40.440]  nothing to worry about just as the children who splashed about in the yellow
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.160]  rain puddles in the days after Chernobyl were told the same thing in
[04:45.160 --> 04:49.000]  Ukraine Belarus and surrounding countries we'll be back to cover the
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.040]  deepening Fukushima crisis on the Alex Jones show after the break stay tuned
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:05.560 --> 05:11.080]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[05:11.080 --> 05:14.800]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned menace
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[05:19.880 --> 05:25.240]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[05:25.240 --> 05:30.160]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.560]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.280]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.240]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.240 --> 05:47.760]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[05:47.760 --> 05:53.480]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[06:00.080 --> 06:03.600]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.560]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.560 --> 06:11.800]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.800 --> 06:16.080]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.080 --> 06:20.440]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.440 --> 06:24.520]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.520 --> 06:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.080 --> 06:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.200 --> 06:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.160 --> 06:41.000]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.720]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:43.720 --> 06:47.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[06:47.160 --> 06:52.400]  www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the

[06:59.240 --> 07:04.640]  a very wealthy u.s. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the
[07:04.640 --> 07:08.880]  most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[07:08.880 --> 07:12.760]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[07:12.760 --> 07:16.240]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now this
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.960]  man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is
[07:19.960 --> 07:24.080]  he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny May
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.960]  Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[07:27.960 --> 07:32.680]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you
[07:32.680 --> 07:36.200]  can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction
[07:36.200 --> 07:40.320]  yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least
[07:40.320 --> 07:43.680]  watch this free video online today he explains everything you need to know
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.400]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself you can find the video

[08:04.240 --> 08:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:11.960 --> 08:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.600 --> 08:27.560]  Alex Jones is Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today on this
[08:27.560 --> 08:35.600]  Friday March 25th edition Apple rejects iPhone 4 radiation metering app citing a
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.520]  lack of interest Apple has rejected an app that allows users to see a meter
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.640]  showing how much radiation is being given off by their iPhone in real time
[08:44.640 --> 08:48.960]  the app previously praised by Apple for its clever engineering and creative
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.480]  design is reported to have been rejected by Steve Jobs himself Israeli
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.480]  developer talk on admitted the app submitted the app on multiple occasions
[08:59.480 --> 09:04.520]  to the app store only to have repeated denials an email from Steve Jobs gave a
[09:04.520 --> 09:10.280]  short two-word explanation as to why the app wouldn't see approval quote no
[09:10.280 --> 09:16.280]  interest oh okay so potassium iodide is completely sold out exhausted he can't
[09:16.280 --> 09:21.800]  buy it anywhere Geiger counters can't buy them anywhere they're sold out but now
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.880]  Steve Jobs is telling us that there's quote no interest in an iPhone app that
[09:25.880 --> 09:30.680]  purports to measure radiation so again the message is clear everything is under
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.600]  control and now US health authorities are actually encouraging people not to
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.640]  take potassium iodide even in weaker doses and even as the Fukushima
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.240]  radiation continues to be spewed out of the planet so 25 years after they told
[09:49.240 --> 09:54.720]  us Chernobyl was harmless remember the Russians didn't even admit to it until
[09:54.720 --> 10:02.280]  two days later when it engineers in Sweden measured the radiation and we've
[10:02.280 --> 10:08.560]  been told that you know it's of no concern don't take your potassium iodide
[10:08.560 --> 10:14.920]  don't get your Geiger counters and yet in Europe since Chernobyl 25 years ago
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.360]  we've had nearly a million cancer deaths in Europe attributed to the disaster
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.360]  according to the latest studies and in fact there's a new study that's just
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.760]  been put out by the US National Institutes of Health the NIH which states
[10:31.760 --> 10:37.360]  quote nearly 25 years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.080]  Ukraine exposure to radioactive iodine 131 from fallout may be responsible for
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.760]  the thyroid cancers that are still occurring amongst people who lived in
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.800]  the Chernobyl area and were children or adolescents at the time of the accident
[10:53.800 --> 11:00.080]  and so just like the kids in Belarus who were told that splashing about in yellow
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.240]  radioactive puddles was perfectly safe because it was quote pollen now we have
[11:06.240 --> 11:12.200]  Tokyo being bathed in this same yellow rain and just like the victims of
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.320]  Chernobyl they're being told the same thing that it's pollen well for their
[11:17.320 --> 11:22.400]  sake I hope it is but everything about this disaster from the cover-ups about
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.160]  the safety of the plan before the disaster to the ongoing deception about
[11:29.160 --> 11:33.800]  the radiation levels in surrounding areas remember in the in the two
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.000]  prefectures surrounding Fukushima they won't even divulge what the radiation
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.960]  levels are it clearly indicates that they're not to be trusted which is why
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.000]  people in Tokyo have emptied the shelves of bottled water even after the
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.600]  authorities said it was now safe to drink again and again the whole lack of
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.920]  trust only creates a vacuum that is then filled with alarm and panic which is
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.480]  why we've been trying to get accurate information so people can make the right
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.280]  decisions it's why we've been talking to people like Busby and Bowman on the
[12:09.280 --> 12:16.680]  Alex Jones show over the past two weeks but what really galls me is not just the
[12:16.680 --> 12:23.160]  likes of Ann Coulter claiming that you know radiation is nutritious and again
[12:23.160 --> 12:28.760]  the offer is still on the table and all expenses paid trip to Fukushima for Ann
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.500]  Coulter if she still thinks that you know radioactive iodine, cesium and
[12:33.500 --> 12:37.760]  plutonium are healthy and nutritious the offers on the table not being accepted
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.400]  yet but what gets me is the self-proclaimed environmentalists the
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.120]  people who you know scream bloody murder all day long about man-made climate
[12:49.120 --> 12:54.120]  change devastating the planet but then when a real environmental catastrophe
[12:54.120 --> 13:00.160]  occurs like plutonium releases that can make soil infertile for 24,000 years
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.960]  something to be worried about you'd think you know it's all fine and dandy
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.800]  and it proves that they don't really give a damn about the environment they're
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.360]  only interested in the environment when they can use it to demonize the likes
[13:14.360 --> 13:20.040]  of carbon dioxide emissions because they know it's the lifeblood of a free and
[13:20.040 --> 13:26.320]  prosperous society and specifically I'm talking about George Mombiot who writes
[13:26.320 --> 13:33.000]  for the Guardian now Mombiot is Britain's foremost eco control freak he's the
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.560]  environmentalist icon for a whole generation of deluded ignorant leftists
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.240]  who think they're saving Mother Earth by picking up a copy of the Guardian and
[13:42.240 --> 13:48.720]  reading his article and what did Mombiot write in the Guardian in response to the
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.520]  Fukushima disaster he wrote a story entitled why Fukushima made me stop
[13:53.520 --> 13:59.640]  worrying and love nuclear power and in this article he says that critics of the
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.360]  nuclear industry of quote wildly exaggerated the dangers of radioactive
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.720]  pollution so this is a self-proclaimed environmentalist saying that radioactive
[14:11.720 --> 14:18.320]  pollution which makes the soil infertile for 24,000 years is nothing to
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.640]  worry about and that quote is going to come back to haunt him in light of the
[14:23.640 --> 14:30.320]  fact that we now have reactor 3 spewing this mox uranium plutonium mix but
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.160]  here's another quote from the article as a result of the disaster at Fukushima I
[14:35.160 --> 14:42.280]  am no longer nuclear neutral I now support the technology writes Mombiot so
[14:42.280 --> 14:46.840]  God forbid should anyone point out the dangers of you know catastrophes that
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.240]  can devastate whole regions make them environmentally inhabitable for decades
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.920]  radiation that causes nearly a million people to get cancer in the case of
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.960]  Chernobyl and fertility rates in Europe plunging through the floor as a result
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.680]  of the fallout no according to Mombiot the real threat is those smoke stacks
[15:08.680 --> 15:16.480]  emitting the harmless life-giving gas CO2 so I ask Mombiot how many people have
[15:16.480 --> 15:22.920]  coal plants killed how many rivers and fields of coal plants turned into
[15:22.920 --> 15:29.520]  radioactive swamps as the regions around Chernobyl were in 1986 and yet
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.560]  here's Mombiot you know lauding the virtues of nutritious plutonium like
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.640]  Ankelter and saying that we need more of it if only to stop the construction of
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.280]  those dastardly clean burning coal plants that God forbid should allow the
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.520]  scum human population to keep their evil automobiles fueled without going
[15:50.520 --> 15:55.640]  bankrupt with the gas prices going through the roof because of oil going
[15:55.640 --> 15:58.920]  up day by day with the Obama administration's publicly admitted
[15:58.920 --> 16:05.080]  war on the nuclear sorry the coal plant industry and of course the blackouts in
[16:05.080 --> 16:13.680]  recent months attributed to that in no small part so George Mombiot has
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.120]  basically confirmed his position as the ultimate eco hypocrite and proved once
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.640]  again that these people don't give a damn about real environmental catastrophes
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.920]  if they can't exploit them for their own control freak ends and you know
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.480]  Mombiot is the same moron who claims that islands like Tavulu are completely
[16:37.480 --> 16:43.560]  inhabited due to man-made climate change when you know the real population in
[16:43.560 --> 16:47.640]  the case of Tavulu has doubled over the past three decades and yet you've got
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.560]  Mombiot and the likes of the UN IPCC claiming that they're completely
[16:52.560 --> 16:59.560]  deserted because the sea levels have overrun them again a total pack of lies
[16:59.560 --> 17:04.000]  when these people want to exploit something for their own agenda it's a
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.920]  real environmental catastrophe even if it's completely made up but when there
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.880]  actually is a real environmental catastrophe like Fukushima they're not
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.800]  interested and in fact Mombiot is applauding it he's saying we need more
[17:17.800 --> 17:26.560]  Fukushima plants we need more nutritious plutonium in the atmosphere but
[17:26.560 --> 17:30.720]  we're going to get into that more in the next hour with Chris Busby and I'm
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.400]  going to try and get him to address Mombiot's article in The Guardian because
[17:35.400 --> 17:41.480]  I think Busby was in fact on the Green Party in Britain so he probably knows
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.600]  quite a bit about Mombiot so I'm going to try and get his reaction to that but
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.240]  we need to move on now we'll get back into Fukushima and talk about the attack
[17:51.240 --> 17:57.000]  on Libya and the ongoing globalist agenda to hijack revolutions so they
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.400]  can re-engineer the entire Middle East and I want to take your calls on this
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.200]  also after the bottom of the hour which we'll get to because now of course they've
[18:08.200 --> 18:15.000]  managed to con the world into accepting the lie that they're attacking Libya to
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.120]  protect quote protesters remember right at the start this the media called them
[18:21.120 --> 18:27.400]  protesters which is funny because I can't really remember seeing too many
[18:27.400 --> 18:33.280]  protesters that drive tanks and fly fighter jets I don't know about you not
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.040]  not something I've seen quite often when there's a protest occurring and
[18:38.040 --> 18:42.640]  naturally of course it has nothing whatsoever to do with the claims of
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.080]  protecting the people from the Gaddafi reign of terror it's about supporting
[18:48.080 --> 18:54.160]  one side in a civil war and it's got nothing to do with a humanitarian
[18:54.160 --> 18:58.880]  intervention these are the same people that told us Q80 babies were being
[18:58.880 --> 19:04.200]  cost out of incubators by Iraqi soldiers these are the same people that
[19:04.200 --> 19:09.280]  told us Bosnians were being incarcerated in Serbian Nazi-style
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.640]  concentration camps as we've proven completely fraudulent completely
[19:14.640 --> 19:20.640]  contrived completely made up but they always need an emotional trigger a
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.560]  selling point on which to base the foundation of any quote humanitarian
[19:26.560 --> 19:33.720]  war but what's it really all about it's about keeping the taps open for this
[19:33.720 --> 19:38.040]  wave of hijacked revolutions in the Middle East to continue to flood the
[19:38.040 --> 19:44.400]  region and now we're seeing open calls for an attack on Syria and we'll get into

[24:27.000 --> 24:32.760]  2011 I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex today and in the second half of
[24:32.760 --> 24:38.080]  the broadcast you'll be able to see Mike Adams the editor of natural news.com
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.760]  in studio going through the latest health news and of course taking your

[24:50.400 --> 24:56.480]  that's 800-259-9231 and of course at the top of the hour I'll be joined by
[24:56.480 --> 25:01.560]  Dr. Chris Busby nuclear and radiation expert to talk about the deepening
[25:01.560 --> 25:08.720]  crisis in Fukushima so if the globalists can't get this domino to drop in
[25:08.720 --> 25:14.560]  Libya it's going to be a lot harder for them to overthrow the next Middle Eastern
[25:14.560 --> 25:20.320]  country and now we know of course who the next target of this regime change will
[25:20.320 --> 25:27.160]  be and it's Syria US defense secretary Robert Gates who remember days before
[25:27.160 --> 25:32.040]  the bombardment of Libya was caught joking about the plan to attack the
[25:32.040 --> 25:38.760]  country on camera has now made it clear that Assad is the next target for the US
[25:38.760 --> 25:44.200]  military industrial complex and of course as we know Syria has been one of
[25:44.200 --> 25:49.840]  the primary targets for regime change on behalf of the PNAC neocons for over a
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.840]  decade and now they're getting ready to exploit this wave of hijacked revolutions
[25:55.840 --> 26:01.840]  as their prime opportunity financial Times reports today Gates calls for
[26:01.840 --> 26:07.760]  Syrian forces to move aside Syria should follow Egypt's lead and the Syrian
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.840]  army should quote empower a revolution Robert Gates US Secretary of Defense
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.280]  argued as thousands marched in a southern city mr. Gates made his comment
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.400]  some of the toughest remarks to date by US official about the rule of Bashar
[26:22.400 --> 26:28.040]  al-Assad Syria's president on a day of further upheaval in the Middle East and
[26:28.040 --> 26:34.240]  beyond so now we've got the US defense that's defense secretary calling for a
[26:34.240 --> 26:41.520]  revolution in the Middle Eastern country now if you care to scratch one inch
[26:41.520 --> 26:46.480]  under the surface just as happened with Egypt the kind of people behind this
[26:46.480 --> 26:53.720]  latest foe revolution are the very same characters we saw getting rid of Mubarak
[26:53.720 --> 26:59.680]  there in Egypt and we've got an article posted on prisonplanet.com today by
[26:59.680 --> 27:05.520]  Tony Carlucci which goes through this in detail and he writes a prominent
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.960]  Syrian opposition figure says the country is quote a bomb ready to explode as
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.720]  protesters demand freedom and an end to president Bashir al-Assad's cancerous
[27:15.720 --> 27:21.080]  regime reports Australia's ABC news this prominent Syrian opposition figure is
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.720]  quote human rights activist Haitham Malay of the Human Rights Association of
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.440]  Syria recently released from a Syrian prison Haitham Malay and Muhammad al-Hassani
[27:32.440 --> 27:37.240]  another activist whose plight is being used to stir up unrest both received
[27:37.240 --> 27:44.040]  pro bono legal services from the CFR stacked Freedom Now organization Freedom
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.680]  Now receives funding from the Mariah fund the Lantos Foundation which includes
[27:48.680 --> 27:55.800]  Israeli president Shimon Pires as an advisor real networks foundation which
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.800]  also funds democracy now and the Charles Bromfman prize which proclaims on its
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.720]  website quote Jewish values global impact Freedom Now also receives pro bono
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.920]  legal support from the Pillsbury law firm a CFR corporate member so once again
[28:12.920 --> 28:18.840]  just as with Egypt we see these sorrow some Brazinski and CFR linked globalist
[28:18.840 --> 28:25.320]  foundations behind the so-called revolutionaries as Carlucci writes once
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.080]  again we see an entire movement fermented and propelled by Western backed
[28:30.080 --> 28:34.320]  opposition in tandem with a corporate-owned media this is all part of
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.120]  the now irrefutable larger plot consuming the Middle East and Northern
[28:39.120 --> 28:46.360]  Africa and speaking of Northern Africa take Egypt for example I mean to
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.000]  suggest that there's been a revolution in Egypt is beyond comprehension there's
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.080]  been no revolution whatsoever you've got two presidential candidates waiting to
[28:56.080 --> 29:02.320]  take over one of which is this Arab League yes man and the other of which is
[29:02.320 --> 29:09.520]  the ultimate globalist stooge linked with Brazinski and Soros El Barade meanwhile
[29:09.520 --> 29:15.080]  the same army that backed Mubarak is still exercising ruthless control over
[29:15.080 --> 29:20.840]  the population with an iron fist where's the revolution the post-revolution
[29:20.840 --> 29:25.960]  administration in Egypt you know the globalists and the mass media are so
[29:25.960 --> 29:31.040]  enamored with and they're upholding it as this glorious example for democracy in
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.360]  the rest of the Middle East I've just passed a law that makes protest illegal
[29:35.360 --> 29:40.480]  and now they're beating and raping women protestors Abu Ghraib style and the
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.960]  globalists and the mass media love it because that's how they roll we'll be
[29:43.960 --> 29:48.760]  back break to talk more about it on the Alex Jones show
[29:48.760 --> 30:00.800]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:13.760 --> 30:18.440]  fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.240]  to reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[30:23.240 --> 30:28.000]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[33:19.040 --> 33:24.520]  we're back on the Alex Jones show with me Paul Joseph Watson so the wonderful
[33:24.520 --> 33:29.760]  post-revolutionary administration in Egypt has just passed a law banning
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.640]  protest the army in Egypt who are now in control we're just caught raping and
[33:35.640 --> 33:40.240]  torturing female Egyptians who were involved in the protest who oust Mubarak
[33:40.240 --> 33:48.000]  and we're talking about stuff worse than Abu Ghraib you know beatings torture
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.840]  rape of the very activists who were at the forefront of the protest who oust
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.640]  Mubarak over his so-called brutality now they get getting a taste of something a
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.400]  lot worse so it's perfectly understandable why the US military industrial
[34:04.400 --> 34:09.800]  complex and the media industrial complex is completely in love with this post
[34:09.800 --> 34:15.360]  Egypt revolutionary government I mean protest protest is illegal anyone that
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.880]  protests is tortured and rape and you know it's very democratic and it's
[34:19.880 --> 34:25.040]  surely a great example for the rest of the Middle East to follow and so then we
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.080]  turn to Libya and contrary to the propaganda that you know people everywhere
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.400]  are rejoicing and welcoming the airstrikes with glee we've got Muslims in
[34:35.400 --> 34:41.440]  Sri Lanka today rioting and stamping on effigies of Obama to protest against
[34:41.440 --> 34:47.600]  this attack which of course was sold on the foundation of three massive lies a
[34:47.600 --> 34:54.840]  the no-fly zone I mean if you if you've ever heard a more Orwellian term then be
[34:54.840 --> 34:58.720]  sure to tell me about it because you know Orwell's literally rolling in his
[34:58.720 --> 35:03.720]  grave as we speak no-fly zone it means you can't fly over the country unless
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.800]  you're in a French British or American fighter jet dropping bombs on the
[35:07.800 --> 35:13.520]  country so you know just a no-fly zone and of course all the liberals applauded
[35:13.520 --> 35:19.480]  it with glee no-fly zone you know very democratic very humanitarian of course
[35:19.480 --> 35:23.560]  nothing more than a euphemism for an aggressive bombing campaign that's now
[35:23.560 --> 35:30.200]  into its sixth seventh day the second lie the great lie on this on which this
[35:30.200 --> 35:35.960]  war was sold that there would be no boots on the ground that's what the UN
[35:35.960 --> 35:42.320]  resolution said no invasion force when it's documented that SAS and US special
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.720]  forces were in the country weeks before the resolution and look at this headline
[35:47.720 --> 35:53.400]  from today's Daily Mail 350 British special special forces already deep
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.880]  inside Libya and more already to be deployed squadron of SAS and SBS troops
[35:59.880 --> 36:05.360]  have been in the country for a month oh have they now that'll be before the
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.960]  actual resolution for a no-fly zone with no boots on the ground was passed
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.400]  hundreds of British troops have been deployed inside Libya targeting Colonel
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.120]  Gaddafi's forces oh really I thought it was to protect the protesters and more
[36:20.120 --> 36:25.480]  are on standby while Chancellor George Osborne repeated that UK ground troops
[36:25.480 --> 36:31.600]  would not be involved the Daily Mail can reveal there are an estimated 350
[36:31.600 --> 36:38.480]  already mounting covert operations so no boots on the ground turns out to be
[36:38.480 --> 36:45.840]  another pack of lies could you have anticipated it you know but I'm sure
[36:45.840 --> 36:50.160]  those SAS boys who were there a month ago are just there to protect the
[36:50.160 --> 36:56.280]  protesters in their tanks and fighter jets and the third massive lie on which
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.440]  this quote humanitarian war was based is that the claim that it was a
[37:01.440 --> 37:07.160]  humanitarian mission that's why they sent hundreds of troops in a month ago
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.520]  whose training solely revolves around killing people and training others to
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.480]  kill people but I forgot again they're just protesters right just got to get
[37:18.480 --> 37:25.200]  that into my head and so if it's just a humanitarian mission why were 350 SAS
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.880]  troops on the ground a month ago and now we have this headline out of Sky News
[37:30.880 --> 37:34.640]  US may supply Gaddafi rebels with weapons
[37:34.640 --> 37:39.040]  Western diplomatic sources have confirmed to Sky News that the US is
[37:39.040 --> 37:45.560]  considering the legality of arming the Libyan rebels now of course again around
[37:45.560 --> 37:51.040]  a month ago at the same time as those SAS troops were going in in Bloomberg news
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.720]  Hillary Clinton basically admitted that they were already arming the Libyan
[37:55.720 --> 38:03.760]  rebels not protesters and we featured an article earlier this week from Tony
[38:03.760 --> 38:08.680]  Cartelucci about how they were already arming the rebels through Egypt so again
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.320]  everything that they prepare the public to accept they're already doing it SAS
[38:14.320 --> 38:18.120]  troops have already been there for a month they've already been arming the
[38:18.120 --> 38:23.200]  rebels why do you think they've got you know car boots full of rocket propelled
[38:23.200 --> 38:29.680]  grenade launchers they're already being armed but again they're just protesters
[38:29.680 --> 38:37.520]  just protecting the people now of course we have the same groups in Libya at the
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.520]  moment working against Gaddafi and again Gaddafi's a monster but compared to what
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.760]  these people are gonna get you ain't seen nothing yet and of course they're
[38:46.760 --> 38:52.240]  the same people who worked with Osama bin Laden to try and assassinate Gaddafi in
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.920]  1996 paid for of course by the CIA in MI6
[38:56.920 --> 39:03.320]  $100,000 wire to bin Laden and al Qaeda to help them get rid of Gaddafi 15
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.640]  years ago and now these groups that help them do that are the same forces who
[39:09.640 --> 39:16.120]  want to impose draconian Sharia law in Libya so we have the rampant hypocrisy
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.840]  of both the left and the right amongst those who support this war on the right
[39:20.840 --> 39:26.320]  you have people supporting the airstrikes who just a few months ago were
[39:26.320 --> 39:31.080]  screaming bloody murder at Muslims trying to build a mosque in ground zero in
[39:31.080 --> 39:35.840]  New York when the people that they now support through their support of these
[39:35.840 --> 39:42.880]  airstrikes are the very people who want to impose a draconian extremist Muslim
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.800]  dictatorship in Libya so all those so-called conservative right wingers
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.360]  who love this war they're actually supporting the radical al Qaeda Muslims
[39:52.360 --> 39:58.360]  which is why the Libyan al Qaeda leader has come out over a week ago and gave
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.720]  his complete approval for the airstrikes said he wants to get rid of Gaddafi
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.440]  which is why you had the London Telegraph article headlined the West and
[40:07.440 --> 40:12.360]  al Qaeda on the same side just as they were on the same side with Bill Clinton
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.400]  and in Serbia and just as they were on the same side when MI6 and CIA paid
[40:18.400 --> 40:26.160]  bin Laden and al Qaeda $100,000 to assassinate Gaddafi in 1996 now they're
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.960]  giving it another go as part of this effort to continue the domination of
[40:30.960 --> 40:36.280]  the Middle East via these regime changes which are nothing more than
[40:36.280 --> 40:43.280]  aggressive coup d'etats sold as humanitarian lies and then on the flip
[40:43.280 --> 40:50.520]  side you've got the left who are you know bought the humanitarian pretext hook
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.640]  line and sinker completely ignorant of the fact that when these rebels do come
[40:55.640 --> 40:59.600]  to power if they do they're going to impose a doctrine that will ensure
[40:59.600 --> 41:05.080]  total persecution of women and all minorities in the country and it's
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.000]  basically going to make Gaddafi look like Nelson Mandela in comparison and
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.080]  yet all these you know liberal humanitarians are graciously applying it
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.200]  and again the globalists will love it because that's how they roll they like
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.760]  to prop up extremist regimes and install them so they can later have the
[41:24.760 --> 41:31.080]  excuse to overthrow them just as what we saw in Iran and again the likes of the
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.560]  BBC and the mass media will applaud and cheer at the liberation of Libyans
[41:35.560 --> 41:42.320]  while they like the Egyptians are now being subjected to are basically
[41:42.320 --> 41:45.720]  completely enslaved as their country becomes nothing more than an oil
[41:45.720 --> 41:54.640]  thief them for the new world order and again Israel this week bombed Gaza
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.880]  injured dozens and killed children we don't see any calls for a humanitarian
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.720]  intervention there do we the predator drone strikes that Barack Obama has
[42:05.720 --> 42:11.880]  aggressively increased after he replaced Bush kill 90% innocent people
[42:11.880 --> 42:17.120]  according to the Brookings Institute and yet we don't see any humanitarian
[42:17.120 --> 42:24.280]  concern surrounding that situation do we so again complete bluster complete
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.920]  hypocrisy again another war in the Middle East based on lies it's about
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.920]  arming and supporting one side in a civilian in a civil war has absolutely
[42:33.920 --> 42:39.920]  nothing to do with humanitarianism gonna go to some of your calls now and the
[42:39.920 --> 42:44.640]  first caller is Mike in New York go ahead Mike you're on the air yes hello
[42:44.640 --> 42:48.520]  I'm an escort warrior and I'm gonna contribute to the temple war right now
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.880]  everybody needs to vote some republics for the United States thought board we're
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.800]  gonna see that before the civil war you had the South walk out of Congress and
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.640]  looking came back he could not get up for them together okay in 1871 the United
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.040]  States corporation was created they were given jurisdiction only in
[43:07.040 --> 43:11.680]  Washington DC I want everybody please when you crawl please look at this
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.880]  information comment on it maybe right on it was very important okay thanks to
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.360]  the cold gator in North Carolina Carolina you're on the air gator hey
[43:21.360 --> 43:25.680]  good afternoon how are you good thanks what's on your mind today yeah I just
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.800]  want to call share with you I'm a veteran of the US Army and the United
[43:28.800 --> 43:34.040]  States Marine Corps and I just uh I've been speaking a lot with the sheriffs in
[43:34.040 --> 43:37.920]  the county surrounding the area I live here in North Carolina and I travel a
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.680]  lot I'm a member of the media and I travel and fly extensively and I when
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.560]  the start of the Speedos protest at TSA some months ago and have yet thank God
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.760]  to go through a full body scanner or to receive a pat down but I'm constantly in
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.880]  talk with military people and law enforcement of all ranks and sizes all
[43:56.880 --> 44:00.760]  over the country as I go about my business and couple of things that have
[44:00.760 --> 44:03.240]  brought in some big clarification for me I'd like to share with you and
[44:03.240 --> 44:07.280]  everybody else is you know there's a lot of people under the the illusion that the
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.080]  military and law enforcement there's gonna be a mass amount of people that
[44:11.080 --> 44:16.960]  will side with freedom and liberty and truth when you know push comes to shove
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.280]  and I just wanted to dispel that illusion a conversation I had two days
[44:21.280 --> 44:27.240]  ago with the second and command at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina I called him
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.000]  in regards to the report of the Marines being sent out to Libya and I asked him
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.200]  about that and I asked him from my you know the universal code military
[44:35.200 --> 44:39.880]  justice standpoint which requires Marines to stand down against illegal orders
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.960]  now I was asking him how could he in good conscience having sworn to defend the
[44:43.960 --> 44:49.360]  Constitution send troops to Libya which was obviously an illegal order being
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.320]  that you know Obama of course bypassed Congress and went and had a unilateral
[44:53.320 --> 44:58.000]  attack on Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and Sergeant Major
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.840]  refused that all to even mention the word US Constitution he refused to
[45:02.840 --> 45:06.800]  engage me in any kind of intelligent conversation and he just said that
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.720]  look I've got a commander in chief I do whatever the commander chief says I told
[45:11.720 --> 45:15.640]  him he was a traitor and a coward and he was a domestic enemy of the Constitution
[45:15.640 --> 45:20.360]  by failing to uphold his duties as a Marine and resist the illegal orders and
[45:20.360 --> 45:24.200]  I just wanted to leave you with that and I spoke to another recruit just out of
[45:24.200 --> 45:27.600]  basic I handed him a copy of the Constitution Bill of Rights and he
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.720]  said that he's never read it in his life and that of course they no longer
[45:31.720 --> 45:36.040]  teach the Constitution in any shape form or fashion in the military but I
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.840]  appreciate you giving me time okay thanks to the call yeah exactly and I mean
[45:40.840 --> 45:47.080]  that's precisely what leads to the disturbing and grisly photos that came
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.520]  out this week of these US kill teams in Afghanistan that just go out murder kids
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.480]  and then pose with them as trophies I mean what kind of training are they
[45:55.480 --> 46:00.920]  being given that leads to that kind of behavior and as he said now we've got a
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.480]  talk of Marines out of Camp Lejeune going out to Libya to support the rebels
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.920]  in the Civil War again no authorization by Congress Ron Paul's point of that
[46:11.920 --> 46:17.360]  out and not only that it will be a direct violation of their own UN
[46:17.360 --> 46:22.520]  resolution which said no boots on the ground you know no occupying forces even
[46:22.520 --> 46:27.480]  though as I just explained the SAS has been there for a month and now we have
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.640]  this article out of WCTI Camp Lejeune Marines to Libya to strike at Gaddafi
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.400]  forces we've seen Camp Lejeune Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan and now they are
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.800]  joining the fight against Libya okay I thought it was a no-fly zone now it's a
[46:42.800 --> 46:48.960]  fight against Libya okay about 2,200 Marines from the 26th Marine expeditionary
[46:48.960 --> 46:53.960]  unit will take part in support operations based aboard USS Kiyosarj at sea
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.160]  those support operations of thus far included airstrikes and one rescue
[46:58.160 --> 47:03.520]  operation the overall mission is to help end the violence directed at the Libyan
[47:03.520 --> 47:10.240]  people okay that's that'll be why when the US fighter jet crash landed in that
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.480]  field that the first thing that the US chopper did was shoot at six of the
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.880]  civilians who were trying to you know help the pilot so they're really really
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.360]  interested in stopping the violence against the Libyan people there quote
[47:24.360 --> 47:27.560]  in Libya right now they're doing exactly what we need them to do they are
[47:27.560 --> 47:31.880]  doing what they are told and right now that's protecting Libyan people against
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.440]  Gaddafi forces so again as the caller said they're just doing what they're
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.880]  told despite the fact that it is a complete violation of the Constitution
[47:40.880 --> 47:44.720]  that they swore an oath on to protect and defend and it's even a violation of
[47:44.720 --> 47:52.760]  their own stupid ridiculous pointless UN resolution Linda in California you're
[47:52.760 --> 47:58.960]  on the air go ahead Linda the reason that they're doing this is the economic
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.040]  crisis they've been telling us about and so the Constitution does is no good
[48:04.040 --> 48:10.320]  because an economic crisis is driven by Parkinson's law which is to increase
[48:10.320 --> 48:16.600]  jobs and the Constitution may work when an economy is really doing and can
[48:16.600 --> 48:21.120]  afford to enforce it once in a while and even then it's right squeeze
[48:21.120 --> 48:27.600]  unless you've got a bad line there we'll have to move on horse skin in Texas go
[48:27.600 --> 48:36.360]  ahead thank you sir of the death industry worldwide is not only Israel bombing
[48:36.360 --> 48:41.280]  bombing Gaza to kill Palestinian babies continually ignored by our long-step
[48:41.280 --> 48:47.600]  media but right here well over 50% of all black babies conceived in the United
[48:47.600 --> 48:50.920]  States are murdered in the womb last year as we all know who listened to Alex
[48:50.920 --> 48:56.240]  chosen ageism against the youngest and the oldest among us is the most
[48:56.240 --> 49:00.280]  insipid stench of bigotry in my mind the unborn are not even recognized for
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.920]  their humanity they are instead torn to bits chemically dissolved or used in
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.560]  some bizarre experiment to supposedly somehow serve the interests of us the
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.800]  adults of these non-productive consumers the old and disabled are night
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.200]  merrily discarded like yesterday's newspaper and any no forms of socialized
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.640]  medicine in the satirical health scam and that's right cost savings from death
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.400]  it's the common theme throughout the slimy satirical death scare spasm and you
[49:27.400 --> 49:31.560]  know Kenyan born Indonesian subject illegal alien thus ineligible so-called
[49:31.560 --> 49:36.040]  president so-called Barack Obama i.e. Barristaro is a stooge a stooge for the
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.960]  evil banking cartel of killers that grew greedily rules our world through the so
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.680]  called federal reserve and the IMF etc so I'm just urging people to learn more
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.160]  by visiting Ron Paul dot org or of course here at info words.com lew

[49:58.400 --> 50:02.240]  out there and thanks to you you're always doing a great job I really appreciate
[50:02.240 --> 50:08.400]  your professionalism and and great ideas sir and I'm really happy to be able to
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.240]  share some ideas about this death spasm that we're going through here in this
[50:12.240 --> 50:18.920]  country we're so angry it's supposedly the you know it could offer you or
[50:18.920 --> 50:22.880]  whoever for whatever minimal death that might come from his world but we're we
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.400]  have an industry here we're doing it all day every day and in fact here in
[50:26.400 --> 50:30.880]  Austin Texas it's not only the live music capital of the known universe it's
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.080]  the death capital of Texas we were the only county Travis County the only
[50:36.080 --> 50:40.640]  county that paid that forces taxpayers to pay for other people to have abortions
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.280]  the only county in Texas where taxpayer funds are stolen to do this horrible

[54:18.600 --> 54:23.760]  the Alex Jones show live I'm filling in for Alex today Paul Joseph Watson in the
[54:23.760 --> 54:28.680]  second half of the broadcast it will be Mike Adams the editor of natural news
[54:28.680 --> 54:34.000]  dot com and any of your calls that I don't get to Mike we'll be taking them
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.640]  in the second half of the show of course because we've got dr. Christopher
[54:37.640 --> 54:42.680]  Busby coming up in the next segment talk about Fukushima George in Connecticut
[54:42.680 --> 54:49.400]  you're on the air go ahead George talk to Buzzby or is this great past because
[54:49.400 --> 54:54.120]  he was on another radio station and talked about the possibility that they
[54:54.120 --> 55:00.920]  were upwards to a million deaths from Chernobyl alone over the decades and I
[55:00.920 --> 55:06.000]  think he had problems with translation of the Russian material that's one of the
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.560]  reasons why the numbers are not fully compiled but also I think this should be
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.800]  also translated into Japanese if there's anybody out there to help out on that too
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.200]  so that they're aware of what's going on yeah that's something that I'm gonna
[55:19.200 --> 55:25.280]  ask Buzzby about because regarding Chernobyl of course the UN figures and
[55:25.280 --> 55:31.280]  the World Health Organization figures actually there was a UN report in 2005
[55:31.280 --> 55:36.520]  that claimed that there were no birth defects as a result of Chernobyl in the
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.440]  Ukraine and the UN and WHO figures have routinely underplayed the cancer deaths
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.640]  as a result of Chernobyl they say that 200,000 were sickened by Chernobyl and
[55:48.640 --> 55:54.360]  only 9,000 died of cancer but as you mentioned the latest research carried
[55:54.360 --> 55:59.360]  out by the Russian environmental policy which was published by the New York
[55:59.360 --> 56:05.000]  Academy of Sciences has all this evidence which has not been translated into
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.200]  English and it clearly indicates that there have been almost a million cancer
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.760]  deaths in the past 25 years as a direct result of Chernobyl and that's something
[56:14.760 --> 56:20.240]  that I'm gonna ask Dr. Buzzby about directly and get his take on that
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.200]  because we know that the radiation levels in the surrounding prefectures at
[56:24.200 --> 56:29.000]  Fukushima are basically being covered up by the authorities now we've got this
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.760]  leak in reactor 3 with the plutonium mox uranium mix and it's the crisis is
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.520]  only getting worse but the Geiger counters and the radiation detectors
[56:40.520 --> 56:44.840]  being used by the EPA you're just not going to pick this stuff up so that's
[56:44.840 --> 56:48.800]  something that we'll we're going to explore further in the next hour
[56:48.800 --> 56:58.120]  Mohammed in Canada you're on the air go ahead yes go ahead yeah what's in your
[56:58.120 --> 57:01.960]  mind today yeah I'm calling I'm just talking about I was going back to what
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.240]  you're talking about Olivia I think the media has created the paradigm they
[57:06.240 --> 57:09.360]  created discussion I think everybody's eating it up and I think we need to look
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.640]  beyond that they're playing the same game we just got to look beyond like
[57:13.640 --> 57:17.720]  the language they're using and beyond like you know no flies on all this we
[57:17.720 --> 57:21.760]  need we can't just take it for what they're giving it to us we got to look
[57:21.760 --> 57:25.560]  deeper as citizens into what is really going on if we actually do care about
[57:25.560 --> 57:32.360]  what's going on in our world today well exactly most people initially bought the
[57:32.360 --> 57:37.440]  lie that it was just an old flies though they soon they were soon became
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.760]  acquainted with what it really was six constant nights of bombardment but of
[57:42.760 --> 57:46.920]  course it is all to protect the protesters that have RPGs tanks and
[57:46.920 --> 57:50.840]  fighter jets they're just protecting the people there thanks for the call
[57:50.840 --> 57:58.080]  Patrick in Kansas go ahead you're on the air hey Paul I'm calling in and let me
[57:58.080 --> 58:07.400]  know about a about a information about a big pharma side of the globalist and I
[58:07.400 --> 58:14.800]  watched this documentary on I'll tell you what you'd be better off talking to Mike
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.800]  Adams because he is of course the health ranger and the expert on all matters big
[58:19.800 --> 58:24.320]  farmer so I'm sure if you call back in when Mike is up you'll be able to
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.360]  discuss that with him but coming up after the break we got nuclear and radiation
[58:28.360 --> 58:33.080]  expert dr. Christopher Bosby on the deepening crisis in Fukushima is the
[58:33.080 --> 58:37.760]  Alex Jones show live stay tuned don't go away
[58:43.280 --> 58:51.400]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.400 --> 58:55.160]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.160 --> 58:58.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.920 --> 59:03.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.440 --> 59:07.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.320]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.320 --> 59:15.720]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.720 --> 59:19.480]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.560 --> 59:27.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.520 --> 59:31.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.360 --> 59:34.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.080 --> 59:40.080]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.080 --> 59:44.600]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go
[59:44.600 --> 59:51.580]  to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:52.840 --> 01:00:00.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:30.160]  Alex Jones Friday March 25th 2011 it's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.080]  Jones today and in the second half of the broadcast the editor of natural news
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.240]  dot com Mike Adams will be taking your calls but for the next half an hour I'm
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.920]  delighted to be joined by dr. Christopher Busby who is one of the
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.360]  preeminent experts on nuclear fallout and radiation he was the scientific
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.720]  secretary of the European Committee on radiation risks and has held numerous
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.440]  influential positions in this field and of course in the aftermath of Fukushima
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.960]  his expertise has been very much in demand with Busby appearing on the BBC
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.760]  numerous other TV and radio shows dr. Busby welcome to the show today
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:20.360]  hello good to speak to you and let's get straight into it because of course massive
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.400]  news on Fukushima today Japanese authorities admitting that reactor
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.440]  number three which is the reactor that contains this mox plutonium uranium
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:37.960]  mix has been breached and is now leaking water at radiation levels 10,000
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:43.520]  times above the level of normal reactor water now according to my
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.280]  understanding dr. Busby these plutonium particles can't even be measured with
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.040]  the standard equipment they're using to provide background radiation levels
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.400]  which people in Fukushima and surrounding areas are going by so how much
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.480]  does this new breach this new crack in reactor number three represent a deepening
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.640]  of the crisis at Fukushima well I think personally that this that this is not
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.200]  something new what is new is that they've admitted it I mean it's not as if they
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.120]  came along one morning and said oh look there's a crack in the reactor
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.840]  gosh I didn't see that before yeah I wonder what happened must be the mice I
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.680]  mean this must have happened when the thing exploded ages ago so it's quite
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.280]  clear that this is just just the famous Chernobyl that what happens is that they
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.760]  let the information out slowly for whatever reason and eventually they
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.720]  have to concede that there are these massive problems yes well the answer is
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.080]  it's a nightmare the whole thing is a nightmare but it was quite clear that it
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.840]  was a nightmare more to those of us who understood these things more or less from
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.240]  the beginning and you're quite right that these plutonium particles are
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.520]  extremely serious and also uranium particles I have to say and they can't
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.600]  be measured easily with Geiger counters they they they're not detectable you
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.280]  need a special sort of synthetation counter to detect them and I expect they
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.360]  have these but when they say that the dose rate is so many microcevers per
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.480]  hour it doesn't really include the the doses from these these particles and of
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.920]  course in any case these dosage from the particles are internal doses so you
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.160]  can't really measure them you can only find out afterwards that there's been a
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:29.640]  problem and that's basically what my next question was regarding the explosion
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.680]  we saw this massive explosion effect react to number three nearly two weeks
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:40.440]  ago now on March 14th with this huge orange fireball and this debris shooting
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.240]  up hundreds of feet into the air and for two weeks they told us that the
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.160]  containment facility was undamaged and yet now this morning they suddenly
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.880]  announced well yes it is cracked and it is leaking so you're saying that they
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.560]  probably knew it was cracked two weeks ago nearly after that explosion and
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.480]  that they've just been covering up this like I could have figured that out quite
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:10.400]  easily and I have to say that not only not telling the people but also all of
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.160]  the pundits that come on to the radio programs that are wheeled out by the
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.360]  nuclear industry and their supporters all those people who say there's no
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.560]  problem don't worry it's the same as going on a flight to New York and all
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.400]  of this stuff those people are criminally irresponsible because people
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.800]  could have got away you know they could have taken some sort of measures to
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.560]  reduce their radiation exposure if they'd have thought that these things were
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.880]  dangerous but to leave it two weeks and then say oh well it's much worse than we
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.840]  thought that means that people will certainly die as a result of this kind
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.000]  of disinformation but I have to say that in a court of law that kind of disinformation for an
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.520]  expert in a court case would be rolled in the expert's being prosecuted and perhaps being sent
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.920]  okay stay there we'll be back after break Dr. Christopher Busby on the unfolding
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.000]  Fukushima crisis hello friends this is Alex Jones you've heard me talk about

[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.880]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.200]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.560]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.320]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.280]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.840]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.560]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.320]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:18.320]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.000]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.800]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.840]  joseph Watson filling in for alex today on this Friday 25th of March edition we're
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.920]  talking to nuclear expert dr. Christopher bosby about the unfolding
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:31.320]  crisis in Fukushima doctor we had a call in the last hour who basically wanted
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.440]  to know something that I already plan to ask you which is we've got these
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.600]  comparisons constantly being made to Fukushima with Chernobyl and I'm
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.080]  interested in knowing where you place Chernobyl in terms of the scale of the
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.520]  disaster that occurred in 1986 and of course it's aftermath in comparison with
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:58.920]  Fukushima because we've had differing reports we had a UN report in 2005 that
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:05.040]  basically poo pooed any idea of birth and reproductive effects in the victims of
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.600]  Chernobyl in Ukraine and then we've had consistent numbers from the UN and the
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.800]  WHO which say that Chernobyl only caused nine thousand cancer deaths in the
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.640]  region affected which of course completely contradicts more recent
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.120]  studies such as this Center for Russian and environmental policy study which was
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.880]  published by the New York Academy of Sciences which gives a figure of almost
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:38.000]  a million cancer deaths in the last 25 years as a direct result of Chernobyl so
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.440]  I mean where do you place Chernobyl in terms of disaster in comparison to
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.440]  Fukushima okay well the two questions really there the first is was Chernobyl
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.320]  a disaster and how many people have died as a result of it and the second is how
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.760]  does Fukushima compare to Chernobyl well we start with the first one which is a
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:05.440]  Chernobyl question the million deaths that have been put out by Alexey
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.400]  Yavlokov and his colleagues in that document that you that you mentioned
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.800]  which was published by the prestigious New York Academy of Sciences and has
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.320]  been peer reviewed is almost certainly correct and in fact I think is
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.360]  probably conservative I would I would say that on the basis of the research I've
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.440]  done which is quite a lot of research and I have been working with Alexey Yavlokov
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.920]  on this too I would say that it's probably more than a million as a
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:40.280]  result of Chernobyl in in Europe and in in the ex-soviet Union territories so
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.400]  that's the first thing and it's easy to show that there are lots and lots of peer
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.520]  reviewed papers now when the United Nations and the International Atomic
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.440]  Energy Agency and the WHO talk they ignore all of the scientific papers
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.400]  which say that which show that there are these deaths so they just select the
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.200]  numbers of scientific papers that are the ones that agree with them and they
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.080]  ignore all the others so that's how it works and the WHO I have to say it's
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.120]  signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1959 to
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:15.240]  leave research on the health effects of radio nuclides to the IAEA whose remit
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.280]  is the development of nuclear power so this is a terrible bias now the second
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.680]  question so all right so Chernobyl was very serious and it caused lots of
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.120]  deaths second question is where does Fukushima lie in this now I have to say
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.960]  that Fukushima is probably going to be worse although slightly different and
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.280]  Fukushima is unfolding now so we don't know the end of it but the IAEA
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:42.200]  themselves who are not renowned for the telling the truth or for being very
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.000]  direct about this have already published in their various bulletins the
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.840]  levels of contamination at different distances from the Fukushima plant it's
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.800]  all on the internet you can see all this and the latest bulletin which was
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.680]  published today says that the concentration on the ground the contamination
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:06.400]  on the ground out to 32 kilometers has been measured at almost five
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.720]  megabecherels per square meter now that is actually ten times higher than the
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.920]  Chernobyl Exclusion Zone so that's the first thing you have to say is that out to
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.160]  30 kilometers and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is 30 kilometers so
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.040]  that's strictly comparable the Fukushima contamination is ten times higher per
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.160]  square meter so that's the first thing the second thing is that the
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:33.480]  contamination out to 78 kilometers also published by the UN is one megabecherels
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.920]  per square meter or as high as and so that is twice as high as the level in
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.680]  the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone where everybody was you will recall where the
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.400]  Soviet authorities after three days evacuated everybody now we are now two
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.680]  weeks from the beginning of this and people certainly have been evacuated in
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.120]  in the areas where where the contamination is coming down and the
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.200]  reason why is because they're just too many people who know where to put them so
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:08.440]  with Chernobyl the nearest large area of the nearest large city was Kiev in the
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:14.440]  Ukraine but luckily the radiation went north and it went northwest and so it
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.160]  didn't really go over Kiev to any large extent but here we have radiation going
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.520]  south and we've plotted all of this on the on the on the big computer of the
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:29.920]  NOAA the American computer which plots particle movements and it's quite easy
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.320]  to show that this stuff from Fukushima this radioactivity from Fukushima all
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.600]  these particles and the iodine and the cesium and the plutonium and the
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.280]  uranium and the tellurium 132 and all of these isotopes are going to Tokyo which
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:48.280]  are the population of 36 million it's the largest concentration of human
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.200]  beings in any city on earth so this is why Fukushima is so bad first of all
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.480]  there's more contamination in the in the area and secondly it's sitting right on
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.520]  top of a very large population center and the and also you know of course it
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.840]  will get spread around as people move away as they drive out of the area the
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:11.360]  aeroplanes fly away from Tokyo and land in other countries people will be
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.080]  carrying the radioactivity with them
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:24.000]  that's quite harrowing to hear but there's still on Chernobyl I mean in the
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.720]  days following Chernobyl children in Belarus were told that you know
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.840]  splashing around in puddles of yellow rain was perfectly harmless because it
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.200]  was merely pollen when in reality as we later learned it was it was in fact
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.680]  radioactive dust with people in Tokyo now reporting yellow rain and this
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.560]  yellowish substance on the ground are they right to trust Japanese government
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.720]  assurances that this yellow substance is merely pollen I wouldn't trust anything
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.160]  that the authorities said on this issue they've consistently lied they've
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.920]  consistently downplayed the problem and they continue to do so and when it
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.720]  comes to the nuclear industry they seem to be able to cast some kind of spell
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.720]  over human beings they say all these things and they say this is safe and
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.160]  this is the same as you know flying to America or this is the same as eating
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.560]  Brazil nuts all the all these inappropriate comparisons and in fact
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.800]  also inappropriate comparisons with natural background radiation they will
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.880]  give you they will say this is the same as a chest X right this is the same as
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.200]  those that you would get in a year these are all external radiation measurements
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.800]  and they're not comparable to internal radiation of the type that would cause
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.400]  the yellow puddles or actually you know at least you can see the yellow puddles
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.760]  I mean the type that is floating about in the air and is completely invisible
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.920]  because people don't have eyes that can detect this stuff so everything seems
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.600]  perfectly normal and you have to rely upon the upon the authorities to tell
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.880]  you if it's dangerous and their estimation of its danger is based on an
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.000]  outdated and obsolete and completely discredited radiation risk model which
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.720]  is based on the atomic bomb and has and has absolutely nothing to say about
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.800]  internal radionuclide exposures and as I say that loads and loads of papers
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.120]  scientific papers in the peer review literature which show that these
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.640]  internal radionuclide exposures are up to a thousand times more dangerous than
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.200]  the dose would suggest so if they say the dose is X multiply it by about 500
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:33.120]  and you're about right in terms of the dose and we published on the ice on the
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.360]  website of the low-level radiation campaign and my own organization the
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.600]  ECRR so you can go to either those LLRC.org or uradcom.org and you can
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.720]  find a simple method of calculating the likely cancer risk and the cancer
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:55.800]  outcome of the exposure at any particular dose that they publish. I'll
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.200]  bite that up in encouraging people to visit those websites. You mentioned the
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.720]  proponents of the nuclear industry downplaying this which is it's not
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.680]  right but it's understandable why they're doing it but what baffles me is
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.280]  these self-proclaimed environmentalists and I'm specifically talking about
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.320]  the British environmentalist George Mombiot who has been writing articles
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.960]  for the Guardian over the past two weeks including his most recent one why
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:31.000]  Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power and Mombiot writes
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.720]  that critics of the nuclear industry have quote wildly exaggerated the dangers
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:42.280]  of radioactive pollution so Dr. Busby given the fact that Mombiot claims is
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:48.400]  this preeminent environmentalist icon why is he completely disregarding the
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.560]  threat of nuclear fallout and treating it as if it's some you know nutritious
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.280]  health benefit. Well I have to say that I know George Mombiot and he doesn't know
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.880]  anything this is really the problem most of these pandas that come out they're
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.640]  not they're not scientists they're not researchers they have never done any
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.200]  research in this area and so they tend to rely upon people that tell them things
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.280]  and I guess he's relying upon all of the misinformation coming from the
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.480]  nuclear industry lobby and their friends otherwise there's no possible
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.080]  explanation for what he's saying because what he's saying is total nonsense
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.160]  in fact it's criminally irresponsible for him to write what he writes given
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.200]  that he doesn't know anything I mean at minimum he ought to say well I don't
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.280]  know anything but this is what I think but he comes out with all this tosh I have
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.720]  to say that about two years ago George phoned me up I was on holiday and he
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.720]  wanted me to give him an account of the effects of low-dose radiation and so on
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.920]  and I went to some length to write some article a little article for him which I
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.400]  sent to him so it's not as he doesn't know and then he wrote an article in the
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.240]  Guardian where he has a column in which he totally ignored everything I said and
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.760]  put out some you know similar sort of nonsense to the nonsense he's writing
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.560]  now but the nonsense he's writing now is actually much more dangerous because
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.200]  it's in the middle of a crisis when people are being exposed to these
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:13.000]  radionuclides and becoming contaminated and you will see and I predict a very
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.520]  large and measurable increase in cancer and other ill health after this accident
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.240]  in people living in the north of Japan certainly in Tokyo where there's a very
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.640]  large population so it would be easy to show this and just like Chernobyl where
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.960]  you could also show this they will say oh well you know it must be radio radio
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.160]  phobia or they've got the numbers wrong or perhaps is the contamination from the
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:42.280]  sea and the tsunami etc. etc. anything but the actual cause of the increase in
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.480]  cancer so we are we are we are asking people in the area all of them to take
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.000]  samples and put them in a plastic bag and just keep them right the day right where
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.400]  it was and put it inside somewhere safe and then afterwards when they develop
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.920]  cancer or their son or their mother or their uncle but married.

[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:15.440]  5 it's the Alex Jones show Friday March 25th Mike Adam to editor of natural
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.200]  news dot com will be your host for the second half of the broadcast so we have
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.680]  George Monbiot who claims that man-made global warming is making areas of the
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.480]  globe uninhabitable but then he says that radioactive fallout which in the
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.680]  case of Chernobyl measurably did make entire areas of the globe uninhabitable
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.880]  saying that concerns about radioactive fallout from Fukushima are quote wildly
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.960]  exaggerated he says as a result of the disaster at Fukushima I am no longer
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.040]  nuclear neutral I now support the technology and this is somebody who
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.200]  describes himself as an environmentalist dr. Chris Busby did you have any
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.120]  closing comments on that particular subjects well yeah well I think I said
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.120]  that George doesn't know anything I mean that's mainly the problem so he can say
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.600]  anything he likes but he hasn't done any research in this area and he hasn't read
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.320]  anything in this area he's quite ignorant he's an ignorant person when it
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.080]  comes to this I'm quite happy to debate this face-to-face with George who I know
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:23.880]  vaguely on any TV show and I do court cases on this issue and win them so the
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.560]  evidence is just massive but he's wrong and I mean what else can I say he can go
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.320]  and say these things and there are other people like Mark Linus that say the same
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:36.200]  thing they do so from a base of ignorance I've researched this stuff for
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.320]  20 years I've written through research papers on it I've studied at the
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.720]  demyelogical correlations between radiation and health I mean I know
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.960]  what I'm talking about these people don't know what they're talking about
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:55.320]  and I think as I said before criminally responsible to say these things okay
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.040]  now we've had a lot of callers basically what people that we won't have time for
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.680]  callers with you because obviously we're finishing at the bottom of the hour but
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.920]  the most common question that we get is how can people take steps to protect
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.040]  themselves from the radiation that's encircling the globe and not become
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.000]  victims like the people of Chernobyl and surrounding areas were we have
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.040]  potassium iodide obviously selling out you have the weaker liquid form of that
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.920]  which is a good method to build up your body's defenses are we just limited to
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.800]  potassium iodide or is there anything else that we can do to try and protect
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.680]  ourselves against this fallout dr. Busby
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:43.520]  I think there's not much that you can do I'm afraid you can stay indoors that's the main thing until it's died down you can
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:49.880]  not drink milk and drink fresh water drink each tin food and not and not
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.600]  fresh fresh vegetables but I don't think at the moment that the concentrations in
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.480]  the other parts of the globe are high enough for people to worry that much
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.960]  about it that the effect is much greater than Chernobyl but it's pretty
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.360]  localized because the wind is blowing it from the west it's a west wind mainly
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.880]  the drift is across the Pacific and there's an awful lot of Pacific before
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.320]  you get to the United States and then there's an awful lot of United States
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.920]  before you get to the UK whereas Chernobyl was in the middle of Europe and
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.920]  most of the effects from Chernobyl were in Europe because the wind was blowing it
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.600]  over the top of through through the Baltic Republic and then over the top of
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.840]  Sweden and then down into and also some of it went to Greece but it was
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.560]  essentially it was in the middle of a big land mass where this is not is on the
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.080]  edge of a land mass so that's actually saved most people I wouldn't I wouldn't
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.920]  say they have to worry too much about it I think maybe for children it would be
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.800]  a good idea to give them stable iodine because they will block their thyroid
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.000]  glands as far as the particles are concerned there's not much you can do
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.760]  these particles are very small and very mobile so to stay in would be a good
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.080]  idea it's inhalation is the main problem ingestion is not so much of a
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.600]  problem so it's inhaling the particles that are floating around the globe and
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.880]  after and so long as it doesn't get worse well which we don't know but if it
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.280]  does get worse then the only thing you can do is stay in that's all you can do
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:14.080]  and then the rain will rain out the particles okay that's all we got time
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.360]  for really appreciate you taking the time out to join us today Dr. Busby and I'm
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.680]  sure Alex will be talking to you soon in the near future thanks for taking the
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.520]  time to be with us today okay welcome thank you very much okay there goes Dr.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.680]  Christopher Busby calling George Monbiot quote criminally irresponsible for
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.520]  his lies about saying that claims of dangers from radioactive fallout are
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:47.560]  wildly exaggerated Dr. Busby said that Fukushima had the potential and in fact
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:54.080]  was already worse than Chernobyl now we've got the new scientist and the
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.600]  Austrian meteorological agency reporting the levels of radiation emitted from
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:05.280]  Fukushima already rival Chernobyl with no sign of the crisis ending and with
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.640]  the news today the reactor number three has been breached and that the core is
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.880]  leaking the core is cracked of course Dr. Busby earlier in the interview said
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.800]  that that was likely caused by the explosion we saw nearly two weeks ago
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.840]  with the plume of debris and the orange fireball shooting high into the sky and
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.080]  basically that the Japanese authorities have been lying about it for the past two
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.400]  weeks as it's seat plutonium radiation that's all for me Mike Adams will be
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:41.520]  taking the reins for the second half of the show I've been Paul Joseph Watson
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:49.120]  callers call him for Mike and be sure to stay tuned for the show at PrismPlanet.tv
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:57.000]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:05.200]  network a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:09.600]  the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.480]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:16.760]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.160]  this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.200]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:27.440]  Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.280]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.760]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.720]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.120]  this enough you should at least watch this free video online today he
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.360]  explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to

[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:04.240]  thank you you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.440]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.240]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.000]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.440]  body my name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:23.800]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.160]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:33.000]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:40.200]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.360]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:50.640]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung

[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.800]  Welcome back everybody to the Alex Jones show my name's Mike Adams the health
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.960]  ranger I'm here to fill in for Alex on the second half of his show want to thank
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:25.920]  Paul Joseph Watson for doing his usual excellent outstanding breakdown of the
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.520]  news on the first half of this show in the second half of the Alex Jones show
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:34.400]  we're going to be covering GMOs we have some information about events
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.840]  happening tomorrow some protests about genetically engineered seas we also have
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.720]  some information about the health freedom expo taking place right now in
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.720]  California and why that matters for your health and your freedom and speaking
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.280]  of freedom at in about half an hour from right now we're also going to be
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:55.880]  talking with gubernatorial candidate Phil Moffat who has a really intriguing
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:02.720]  position he is saying that the FDA should get off of Kentucky's farms we'll be
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.040]  talking to him and getting his information about why that matters and
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.000]  how that can help create economic abundance in Kentucky for the farmers
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.800]  and the people there but first in the next segment which is a long segment
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.960]  here we are going to talk about the Fukushima incident and provide
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.680]  additional information carrying on from what Paul Joseph Watson already
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:26.640]  presented in the last segment it's kind of a tag team effort here today so
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:29.840]  there's a lot of breaking news as you're well aware and also we're going to take
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.640]  callers about an hour from now perhaps less and I would like to ask callers to
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.760]  call in on the Fukushima incident or GMOs I'm not going to be taking calls on
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.640]  the Libya situation that's that's not the focus here on this half of the show so
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.800]  my apologies to those who want to talk about that in this segment but we're
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.160]  going to be talking about Fukushima the radiation GMOs the safety of the food
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.320]  supply and the safety of our planet from this nuclear catastrophe now breaking
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.840]  down that information right here to get started we have some news to go through
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.720]  breaking news that I compiled for you this morning and some of it here of
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:09.920]  course new Fukushima reactor number three suffering a core breach waters
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.640]  leaking out it has about ten thousand times higher levels of radiation than
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:19.160]  the usual radiation that should be present in the water in the cooling
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.480]  pools some of the quotes here are are quite ominous if you think about it here
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.960]  we go the situation today this is from Japan's Prime Minister the situation
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.880]  today is still very grave and serious he says we must remain vigilant we are not
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.280]  in a position where we can be optimistic we must treat every development
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:46.960]  with the utmost care we've got radiation on vegetables 135 miles south of Fukushima
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.680]  right now that's south the winds not even blowing that way and yet the
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.800]  radiation is headed that way and already contaminating the vegetables and the
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:00.680]  water there even see it in today called it this this new core leak situation a
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:06.080]  potentially ominous development in the race to avert or prevent a large-scale
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:11.280]  release of radiation Bloomberg today is reporting that the reactor core may be
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.520]  breached at Fukushima plant and here's another quote from a spokesman at the
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:20.320]  Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency he said it's very possible that
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.160]  there's been some kind of a leak in the number three reactor and he goes on to
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.000]  say even if there has been encouraging news the installation remains in an
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.720]  extremely precarious and very serious situation and it has not stabilized so
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.320]  and radiation burns are being reported on workers there who stepped into the
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:45.000]  water we have more news on the meltdowns you know the situation here folks if you
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.200]  think about this at first they downplayed the entire incident the plant
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.120]  exploded the radiation started leaking into the atmosphere into the water they
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:57.440]  were downplaying it they weren't releasing the radiation numbers that was
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.600]  covered here on the Alex Jones show they they were censoring the radiation
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.400]  reading so that people didn't find out what was going on there is a blanket of
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.120]  secrecy just covering this entire incident and even the story on that is
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.800]  now beginning to come out because we now have an engineer who worked on the
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.640]  plant who helped design it who is going public with the truth about some of the
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.840]  corruption and the cover-ups and the secrecy that went on during the
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:29.560]  construction of that facility so now that's starting to come out but remember
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.840]  the mainstream media has been downplaying this for at least what eight
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.640]  nine days now saying that there's no problem here in America President Obama
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:43.760]  went on the air and said Americans basically should not prepare that that
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:47.480]  one blew me away folks I don't know where that one came from I can you imagine
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.480]  former president Harry Truman saying that you know back in World War two the
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:57.360]  message was to the Americans get prepared grow your victory gardens have
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.120]  some extra food on hand have some extra water be part of the solution be part of
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.920]  the war effort to achieve victory and achieve freedom in Europe and in Asia at
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.400]  that time that was World War two today only a few generations later our
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:18.280]  president is telling us don't prepare we have a we have a nuclear facility smoke
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.800]  is coming out of the reactor cores out of the reactor buildings excuse me we
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:28.060]  have neutron beams emanating out of these structures we have the water is
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:33.680]  too radioactive for infants to drink the ocean is being irradiated to the point
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.920]  where even the the safety of seafood is being questioned countries are banning
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.760]  food coming out of Japan because it's irradiated you can't eat the vegetables
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:45.960]  out of Fukushima the situation is not under control even though we were told
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.800]  it was under control we were told there was power connected to all all the
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:54.240]  units but what good is that if there's a leak in the core what good is the power
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.280]  being connected if the pumps don't work because the pumps were damaged in the
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:04.240]  explosions and in this context our president says don't get prepared all
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.440]  of you in California or Washington or Oregon Alaska Hawaii don't get prepared
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:15.880]  I I'm sorry I don't understand that one I think everybody who's a fan of the
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.680]  Alex Jones show here would say get prepared just in case for everything
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.880]  but continuing with the news emissions now are are approaching Chernobyl levels
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.080]  this was covered by Paul Joseph Watson and his guest Dr. Busby in the previous
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.080]  segment great job on that by the way Chernobyl is now looking like it's going
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:39.640]  to be the second worst disaster in the history of the nuclear industry because
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.920]  Fukushima is sadly and quickly taking the place as the number one worst
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.440]  nuclear disaster in the history of human civilization as of yesterday the
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.800]  iodine 131 being released was 73% of the daily levels of that observed after
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.320]  Chernobyl and it's meltdown in 1986 cesium 137 is currently approaching about
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:09.160]  60% of the release from Chernobyl in 1986 three nuke workers in Japan were
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.200]  exposed to high levels of radiation here's some more news possible radiation
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.080]  burns to their feet caused by what they call beta ray burns all right here we
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:24.680]  go neutron beam observed 13 times that's evidence that the uranium and
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.360]  plutonium leaked from the plant's nuclear reactors and has discharged a
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.800]  small amount of neutron beams via fission we're all getting a lesson in
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.240]  nuclear physics over the last two weeks whether we like it or not and
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:43.040]  unfortunately the lesson is that physics beats politics that's right you can't
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.240]  cover up physics if the nuclear plant is emitting radiation you can only lie
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.920]  about it for so long if you're the government of a country like Japan or
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.160]  the United States you can only try to cover up cover it up for so long because
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.080]  sooner or later the radiation just kicks in and it becomes obvious people's
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:06.200]  hair starts started falling out after Chernobyl in 1986 right now in the USA
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:12.000]  the EPA says that eight of its 18 air monitors are not working along the West
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.920]  Coast that's California Oregon and I'm sorry my headsets in the shot there for
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:23.080]  those of you watching and Washington now this is amazing the EPA's spokesperson
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.760]  Ronald Frass director of the National Air and Radiation Environmental
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:33.280]  Laboratories in Alabama says quote what we are seeing is not a problem really
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.400]  how is it not a problem that your radiation monitors are not working 22
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.760]  monitors out of 124 that are deployed across the United States are not working
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:49.320]  as of today that's about one out of six right that's a lot of radiation monitors
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.080]  that aren't working and the EPA spokesperson says that's not a problem
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.320]  you know what it sounds like to me it sounds like a sounds like a cover
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.880]  story it sounds like they're setting themselves up to say that we don't have
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:05.480]  to report the radiation levels from these sensors and they can just say well
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.000]  see we told you they weren't working what a convenient excuse for not reporting
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.040]  the numbers let's just let's hope that's that's not the case let's hope the EPA
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.720]  gets on top of this and gets their radiation monitors working so that we
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.640]  can get some accurate information because that's what's been lacking in this
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.120]  entire situation is accurate information about what's coming out of Japan we've
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.640]  been lied to again and again through by the governments of both of these
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.320]  nations Japan and the United States who are not telling us the truth about the
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:37.880]  dangers of radiation about how much radiation is reaching our shores and
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:43.880]  about what we should do here in America to prepare ourselves for the possibility
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:48.760]  of radioactive fallout the fallout has begun sure the levels they say are very
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.560]  low right now as background radiation but again if you're one of those
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.040]  unfortunate individuals who happens to inhale a radioactive particle that has
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:03.200]  been sent over from Fukushima then it's not background radiation anymore it's
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.600]  internal radiation and you could die of cancer 20 30 years down the road because
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.800]  of that incident so I believe that our governments have a responsibility to
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.000]  give us more accurate information and that's why I think it's it's great that
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.720]  you're tuning into the Alex Jones show because this has been a source here over
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.320]  the past two weeks for some truly outstanding information that the federal
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.000]  government is not providing to the American people but you know that that's
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.880]  why you're listening radioactive yellow rain has been falling in Tokyo of course
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.320]  they explain this away as pollen yeah it's just pollen folks don't worry when
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.280]  there's a nuclear near meltdown scenario and it starts raining yellow rain don't
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.040]  worry about that of course the folks in Chernobyl in 1986 were told the exact
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:55.160]  same thing and it wasn't long before they start vomiting and their hair fell
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:00.040]  out and there were pictures of deformed animals starting to circulate around that
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:05.040]  realm in the weeks following the yellow rain falling out of the sky so yellow
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.000]  rain bad sign a lot of these are very dangerous and bad signs now just how
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.320]  dangerous could the situation be for the long haul out of Fukushima with this
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.240]  yellow rain they say it's pollen I don't believe them with the vegetables and
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:26.560]  and the crops being irradiated 135 miles away with the radiation in the water and
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.160]  the oceans and the air just how bad could it be well there was a study
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.840]  actually conducted by the National Institutes of Health this is from the
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.640]  US Department of Health and Human Services if you can believe that 25 years
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:44.280]  after the Chernobyl incident people there are still getting radiation that's
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.400]  right here it says high cancer risk continues after Chernobyl this is it
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.560]  right here from NIH news National Institutes of Health it says that iodine
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.600]  131 radiation led to an increased risk for thyroid cancer that has not seemed
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.040]  to diminish over time think about that 25 years later they are still paying the
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.120]  price for their mistakes and their cover-ups in Chernobyl it makes you
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.880]  wonder what kind of price are we going to be paying in our world now from the
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.760]  fallout that's being caused from Fukushima and especially what kind of price are
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.080]  the Japanese people going to be paying for this because they don't have a lot
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:27.000]  of places to go that that island is not a very large landmass and it is
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.880]  admitted this morning I don't have the source with me here but it was admitted
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:37.080]  that they may have to begin looking at making areas of Japan uninhabitable by
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.000]  human beings because of this incident and certainly if the reactor number three
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.280]  core is leaking and if if these emissions that these radioactive emissions
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:52.120]  from plutonium and the mox fuel there which we calculated as being two
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.880]  million times more deadly than regular enriched uranium if that gets into the
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.040]  environment in Japan you can bet there are going to be areas of that country
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:08.320]  that are not habitable by human beings for a very long time to come and on top
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.360]  of all that we have a lack of data coming out this is from the LA Times
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.720]  believe it or not lack of data from Japan distresses nuclear experts I wrote
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.120]  here you can see this on on prisonplanet.tv I wrote lack of data
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.200]  secrecy that just means they don't want to tell you what's going on they don't
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:26.960]  want to show you pictures of what's happening inside these plants and they
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.040]  don't want to share with you the real numbers of the radiation levels that are
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.880]  being caused by this incident there's a lot of frustration out there even in
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.320]  the nuclear industry about the lack of information from Fukushima almost every
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.000]  step of the way reported the LA Times the problems at the Fukushima plant have
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.920]  been understated understated by those in charge in Japan leaving observers
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:54.880]  scrambling to analyze the situation as best they can from afar that means
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.960]  guessing folks guessing they're guessing with the situation there when they
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.920]  could be telling you the truth the problem with that is when they guess
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:08.520]  they leave the people with a lot of question marks and they cause fear they
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.120]  cause panic by not giving people good information it's the same thing with
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.520]  preparedness when the president comes on and says people don't prepare there's
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.640]  no need to worry you don't have to really take any extra precautions then in my
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.600]  view if there's a situation like serious radioactive fallout in California which
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:32.800]  is still possible because of the the core containment breach today then people
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.960]  who have not prepared are going to freak out they're going to panic because they
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.760]  don't have the extra water they don't have the potassium iodide or they don't
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.440]  have the stored food they don't have anything because their leader told them
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.600]  don't get prepared it doesn't make any sense to me why not help people realize
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.200]  the importance of getting prepared so that if something happens people are
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.440]  going to be more calm you're not going to have such a panic you're not going to
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.520]  have such a run on supplies and if you have to bring in the National Guard to
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.680]  give people extra water and to distribute extra potassium iodide or
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:12.960]  things like that then those who have already prepared in advance are going
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.360]  to ease the burden on the National Guard or on any of the emergency services
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.520]  that are bringing in those materials so the right thing for any nation that has
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:28.120]  nuclear power in its borders today the right thing is for the leaders of that
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.640]  nation to say people get prepared just in case every day even without Fukushima
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.720]  be prepared every single day it's it's it's just bizarre that that's not being
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.200]  stated out there I will have to cover that more hopefully on another another
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.480]  show but okay Japan US watchdog now sees gaps in reactor safety this is from
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:55.080]  Financial Times says 28% of the nuclear plants in America are not reporting the
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.560]  defects here we go they're not reporting the defects of their parts and the
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.920]  functioning of those parts unless a nuclear incident or I'm sorry a maintenance
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:11.200]  incident occurs so we have the NRC the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that does
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.840]  not check whether the operators of nuclear power plants in the United
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:19.400]  States are reporting defective parts that they're just leaving it up to them
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:23.680]  just have you feel like it tell us if something's defective if you feel like
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.880]  it no no worries there nothing nothing big is going on in this in this world
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:33.560]  today so don't don't be worried about it folks the situation is worsening this
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:40.080]  is the bottom line now we we of course are hoping and praying for Japan and for
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.680]  the engineers there to be able to get the situation under control but I'm not
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:49.760]  betting my life on them telling us the truth and you shouldn't either don't
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:53.040]  bet your life on your government giving you honest information about this
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.880]  situation because you you've all you know if you're listening to this show you
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.320]  know that they've been lying to us and they're probably going to keep lying to
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.760]  us as long as they can get away with it the right thing right now is to stay
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.160]  tuned in to the alternative media like right here on the Alex Jones show where
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.000]  you get good accurate and up-to-date information on what's really happening in
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.600]  Fukushima and outstanding interviews with experts like you just heard in the
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.520]  previous segment so if you have questions about Fukushima and you'd like
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.760]  to be on the show in the next hour be sure to call in we will be taking
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.280]  questions about the Fukushima incident and hopefully get some answers out there
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:34.160]  for those who are listening now stay tuned to the Alex Jones show here across
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.080]  the break that we're about to take we're going to come back and talk about GMOs
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.720]  and protests happening tomorrow in Washington DC we have millions against
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.600]  Monsanto we have crazy news from the world of health we will be right back my
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.040]  name's Mike Adams right here on the Alex Jones show talk to you soon
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.400]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:08.120]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you

[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:27.440]  incident GMOs health freedom and we have an interview with gubernatorial
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.360]  candidate Phil Moffitt coming up in just about 15 minutes right here on the
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.800]  Alex Jones show we also have some breaking news about his campaign that
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:37.840]  we'll be sharing with you in a few minutes so be sure to stay tuned for
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:42.800]  that right now let's get into some about Monsanto and GMOs there's an event
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.720]  taking place tomorrow in Washington and all around the country and cities
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.920]  every everywhere let's see what do we have wow right here in Austin Austin
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:56.240]  Nashville in Atlanta New York City all over the country this millions against
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.320]  Monsanto this is a rally for the right to know what's in our food that's right
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:05.880]  it's a rally for knowing for honest GMO labeling of our foods and you can find
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.520]  out more about this by going to the website run by Jeffrey Smith who's been
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.400]  a frequent guest here on the Alex Jones show his website is responsible
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:20.160]  technology dot org and on responsible technology dot org you can see the
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:23.360]  action alerts on the right hand side there there is a rally for the right to
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  know Saturday happening across the US so be sure to join in that that's a big
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.240]  event now why do we have a right to know this is this we only have a short
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:35.960]  amount of time in this segment but I have to cover this why do we have a right
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.720]  to know because the grocery stores out there even the health food stores are
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.800]  selling foods that contain GMOs but they're labeling them as all-natural
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.920]  they're not telling you that there's GMOs in the foods and we're showing a
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.480]  video here for those on prisonplanet.tv about the millions against Monsanto
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.400]  March now we have a right to know what's in our food I think most people would
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.360]  agree with that the FDA of course believes that labeling foods honestly
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:07.600]  might it might confuse people that's right if you had information like the
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.480]  fact that there's GMOs in your food they think you might be confused by all
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:17.080]  that they say it might confuse people because they say it would make people
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.240]  think that genetically modified food might be different from non genetically
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:26.720]  modified food seriously that's their logic in their minds it's no different no
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:31.920]  different I think they forgot what the word modified means genetically modified
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:37.160]  food means it's modified it's genetically modified that's different than
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.560]  non GMO food and that's why we deserve the right to have it labeled on our
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:45.960]  foods so we know what we're buying and we can avoid these GMOs wherever possible
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.560]  the demands of this rally are that we want the right to know what's in our
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.240]  food we want factory farmed animals and genetically modified animal products
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.200]  labeled just so we can have a choice to know what's in there we want long term
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.840]  studies done on the safety of GMOs and in addition we want the organic industry
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:08.200]  to not be cross contaminated by GMOs so check that out at at responsible
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:14.680]  technology.org also going on this weekend Saturday in Long Beach California is the
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.600]  health freedom expo you can go to healthfreedom expo.com to learn about
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:24.160]  that I'm giving a video presentation there this this matters to us all because
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.280]  health freedom is crucial for the future of our country to get the FDA off of our
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.760]  farms the FDA out of our foods so that we can have honest labeling of natural
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.080]  supplements and herbal remedies that really work to prevent disease that
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:41.760]  actually work in many cases better than pharmaceuticals I mean a lot of
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:44.240]  pharmaceuticals don't work at all they actually harm you more than they help you
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.200]  but natural foods and natural supplements dietary supplements need to be able
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:52.720]  to be honestly labeled with their scientifically validated benefits and
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:55.880]  that's what the health freedom expo is working towards so check that out if
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.000]  you're out in California be sure to go visit the health freedom expo and
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.440]  remember we're going to continue talking about the FDA and food freedom here

[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:52.960]  of GMOs in our food supply people are demanding across the political spectrum
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.320]  on the left the right everybody in between everybody wants to know what's

[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.600]  joining us shortly we're going to have Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Phil
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:11.040]  Moffat who is going to be joining us and talking about his amazing platform that
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.360]  says keep the FDA off of our farms in Kentucky get the federal government out
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.320]  of our lives so that our farmers can pursue their own economic abundance
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.120]  without having their hands tied behind their backs or without being carted
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:28.240]  off as criminals for growing things such as industrial hemp which we import
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.760]  from other countries anyway to make clothing and bags and food so why not
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.800]  let Kentucky farmers grow it industrial hemp you can't smoke it it's not that
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:42.120]  drug it's industrial hemp only and it's good for making clothing and fibers hey
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.400]  the Constitution has written on hemp so that's what we're talking about bringing
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.320]  that back to America so Phil Moffat's going to be joining us Phil are you
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:54.480]  there right now yes sir I am thank you mr. Moffat for joining us today now for
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:58.720]  those who aren't familiar with your platform and what you're saying here can
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.880]  you give us a brief summary of what you're running on here with the FDA and
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:08.120]  keeping the FDA off of the farms of the Kentucky farmers but one of the corners
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.840]  of our platform is fighting for state sovereignty under the 9th and 10th
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.520]  amendment and part of that is using the power of nullification to get the federal
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:21.600]  government out of our coal fields in Kentucky and off of our and the FDA off
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.880]  of our farmers and it also applies to trying to get any unconstitutional
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:32.400]  regulation or a law that comes from the federal government that off of you know
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.200]  off our territory in Kentucky we're able and free people and we need to be
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:39.480]  treated as that's what the US government let me ask you what's what's wrong with
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.480]  the FDA on your farms there in Kentucky why why are you against that well for a
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  number of reasons one it's not a right given to them as you know enumerated in
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.960]  the Constitution so they shouldn't have any any place regulating how we farm or
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:03:00.120]  what we farm in Kentucky and the other is that they're choking our farms to
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:04.000]  death they're taking away crops they're bringing in the they're trying to force
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.480]  us to use the the seeds from you know genetically modified seeds and they're
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.040]  trying all kinds of techniques basically to tell us what to do and when to do it
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.240]  that's not how free people live that's exactly right now where did this come
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.080]  from I I I know you're a tea party candidate for and you're running in the
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.960]  gubernatorial primary which is coming up very soon but what caused you to pursue
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.520]  this position and what kind of feedback are you getting from the people of
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:34.560]  Kentucky that you're talking to right now about this position well what causes
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.600]  to do it is our farms our farmers are going broke slowly but surely the
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.640]  federal government has taken away crops from them and an opportunity for them
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:49.440]  to prosper and that one of the biggest things that they took away from us they
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.520]  did this quite some time ago but it needs to come back now because it has
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.360]  even more relevance today than it did a hundred years ago and that's industrial
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:00.840]  hemp these things the industrial hemp is a wonderful product that grows
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.240]  exceptionally well in Kentucky that can be used for all types of things
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:12.280]  including food clothing oil lotion medicines and it's it was the number
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:17.440]  one cash crop in Kentucky until the DEA believe it or not in the 1930s took it
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.400]  away from took it away from our farmers because they tied it to marijuana which
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:27.000]  is an unjust an unjust tied together of two things because you can smoke him but
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.160]  you certainly can't get high off of it the response has been very good I'll
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.760]  tell you the there are a lot of people in Kentucky they want the organic food
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:40.880]  industry in Kentucky they want industrial hemp they want their farmers to just
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:44.280]  all right so we got to take a break here Phil we will be joining you on the
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.360]  other side of this break stay with us here on the Alex Jones so we'll be

[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:20.520]  i'm mike adams the editor of natural news we are joined right now by phil
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:25.000]  moffat who is the gubernatorial candidate for kentucky and he's running on
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.640]  a unique and very uplifting platform actually about getting the feds off of
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.720]  our farms out of our lives so that the farmers of kentucky can experience
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.880]  economic abundance without the interference of washington it's about
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.960]  more than farmers but phil moffat is joining us again in this segment phil
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:47.720]  what has been the reaction now so far to your message out on the streets in
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:53.160]  kentucky the reaction has been well it's been wonderful a lot of people in
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:57.560]  kentucky understand how repressive the federal government has become especially
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:03.000]  for our farmers we had a a an absolutely wonderful tobacco industry here in
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.200]  kentucky that was taken away from us through federal regulation and lawsuits
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.720]  and it really has left our farmers and it's such a tough spot there they're
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:16.600]  trying to fight down the soybean and koi at soy markets with of course the
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.040]  worldwide markets with very low margins and they they need more crops and more
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.440]  opportunity to be free people and you know industrial health of the whole
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.520]  food industry and the natural food industry would be great extensions for
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:33.360]  them and it would allow us to bring jobs of prosperity back to kentucky the way
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:36.600]  we have a long time and as you're explaining the federal government has
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:40.480]  interfered with the ability of kentucky farmers to grow crops that would
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:43.920]  actually make them a profit such as industrial hemp which again we're
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.640]  importing from other countries and not allowing it to be grown right here in
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:51.840]  america i mean what kind of how does that policy even come to exist in america
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:54.800]  where american farmers can't grow the stuff that we're buying from other
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.800]  countries doesn't make sense it's what you might expect it was a paragraph by
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:04.280]  by a rich industrialist in the 1930s andrew melan who was the bill gates of
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:11.160]  the day and the owner of melan bank was the secretary of treasury under fbr and
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.440]  he was also one of the seed investors in a company called the pot chemical there
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:19.880]  you go the pot chemical was starting to you know understanding things like
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.480]  plastics and nylons and those types of things the synthetics industry was being
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.240]  born and their number one competitor was the industrial hemp industry in the
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:34.880]  united states so hemp at the time was you know used for clothing and fabrics
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.360]  ropes and all kinds of different things and of course by taking that off the
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  market and how they did it was they used that current day dea to tie hemp which
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.160]  is in the cannabis family that's tied industrial hemp to marijuana and they
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:55.080]  made it illegal and it took it off the it's really in just a day or so took an
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.360]  entire market away from Kentucky farmers in other states as well it's
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:02.040]  incredible but just to be clear for those listening your position is not about
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.120]  medical marijuana you're not advocating marijuana you're advocating just that
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.680]  farmers can grow industrial hemp to be used for clothing to be used for making
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.320]  personal care products and and even hemp seeds which are a nutritional product
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:18.080]  and those kinds of things correct that is absolutely correct we are not trying
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.400]  to get marijuana legalized in Kentucky we want industrial hemp
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.800]  really the last there you go now I understand that your your position is
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.840]  gaining such strength and you have so much momentum moving forward now that
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:34.960]  you're already starting to be attacked with some rather sleazy types of
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.800]  tactics that that we see in a lot of political campaigns this is some of the
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:41.720]  breaking news we just got word before we went on the air with you here Phil
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:48.280]  that someone is running counterfeit ads in your name on Facebook to try to
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:54.160]  discredit you then that's exactly right it is amazing that they would do this
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:59.320]  that but the truth is there are a lot of bad people out there they're trying to
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:04.000]  pit us against the New Hampshire's free state project and that's add to that
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.360]  something to the effect that we don't believe that there that they've done a
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:12.880]  good job and they basically you know it has a bad light on them and that's just
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:15.920]  not the case we appreciate what they're doing in New Hampshire and hope for the
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:20.880]  best but you know I guess my late father-in-law told me at one time he's an
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.960]  old Army Air Corps pilot he said that you know you're over the target when
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.240]  you're when you start catching the flag and that's exactly what's happening to
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:32.520]  us where we have a good message we're getting it out there the people are
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:36.080]  excited about it and now they're just trying to destroy me personally you're
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.200]  right in the crosshairs now of course you're gonna be hit with a big disinfo
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.280]  campaign that's you can expect a lot more Phil as I'm sure you're aware but
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.480]  if you think about it you are challenging the authority of the federal
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:52.240]  government in the state of Kentucky and they know that if you win and you can
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.360]  you can protect that power of the state there and you can enforce the 10th
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.720]  amendment rights of the state of Kentucky versus the federal government
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.320]  that you will set a precedent and that precedent is extremely dangerous to the
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.160]  power that's slipping through the fingers of those at the federal government
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:10.680]  who don't want the states to be able to make their own decisions about things
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:16.040]  like food and medicine and farming and economics and so on is it well you're
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.800]  absolutely right but I like the company that I'm in because Thomas Jefferson in
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:27.000]  1798 wrote something called the Kentucky Resolution and that was a resolution
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.760]  he wrote in response to the Aliens and Sedition Act and basically what it said
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.640]  is that Thomas Jefferson said that if the if the general government assumes
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:41.160]  undelegated powers that nullification is the act that is right if that is the
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:46.640]  rightful remedy and that's what we need to do I don't believe it and I've read
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.320]  the Constitution several times if we don't fight against the federal
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:53.640]  government I don't believe there's a statute of limitations to keep us from
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:58.400]  starting the fight today or starting the fight tomorrow they've taken our rights
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:03.560]  away we need to get them back in and on our side of the fence and you know
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:08.920]  Kentucky's just one of many states that are I will be as if Kentucky's governor
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:12.840]  one of many governors that are looking forward to this fight with the federal
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.160]  government to get them back into the country yeah you're right Phil there's
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:20.980]  no statute of limitations on freedom and thank goodness for that too now Phil
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:24.080]  Moffat your website let me just spell that out for people listening it's Phil
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:30.520]  Moffat M-O-F-F-E-T-T dot com so you can check out more information about Phil
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.520]  Moffat on that website we are going to continue with Phil here I have a question
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:39.200]  for you Phil have you done any calculations or can you can you just
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.520]  take a shot at this about what it would mean to Kentucky's economy if you could
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:48.480]  get the federal government off your farms out of your your industrial hemp
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.760]  farming history and reestablish freedom for the state of Kentucky in the
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:57.440]  agriculture sense what would that mean for your people there in the state well
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.760]  I can tell you the University of Kentucky did a study in 1990 about the
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:06.440]  impact that industrial hemp would have in Kentucky that were re-legalized and by
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.640]  their numbers they are they would have they estimated that as many as 90,000
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.200]  new jobs would be created in Kentucky as a result of the farming and the
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:21.080]  processing of hemp and the related products that would come from it now
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:27.120]  that's a really big number and even if we only got a third of that impact it
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:34.960]  would be a home run and really of epic proportions so it's opening our farmers
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.560]  up to be able to make the common sense decisions that they're capable of making
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:44.560]  you know we'll turn this into one of the best economies in the nation and I know
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:47.480]  that scares a lot of people out there because Kentucky's always been a
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.000]  laggard in almost every way and here we are looking at an opportunity to go up
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.080]  ahead of the rest of the country and actually lead like and see with having
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:00.840]  with you at the helm there Kentucky would become if your policy if your
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:04.240]  policies were able to to get through and you were able to protect them from the
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.920]  federal government Kentucky would become the industrial hemp farming capital of
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.920]  the country I could actually see farmers migrating to Kentucky to buy land
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.360]  that would increase the land values throughout the state there would be
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:23.480]  higher tax revenues higher exports out of Kentucky this would be an economic
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.360]  goldmine for the state of Kentucky and frankly the first state that does this
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.080]  is going to get the most riches from that goldmine it seems wouldn't you say
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:36.200]  I agree with that and you know it also opens up the multi-billion dollar
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:41.720]  organic and natural food industry as well they are looking for a place to be
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:46.640]  able to grow their crops without having the government crawling all over every
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:51.720]  day and it's something that we need to have in place you know it seems so
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:58.360]  common sense to me and so fundamental in terms of the right of freedom I have a
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:04.400]  hard time believing so many people don't believe but I guess resistant to this
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.360]  type of stuff in terms of getting the federal government off of our farm and
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:10.920]  out of our cold field well it's amazing the American people have been trained as
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:14.760]  you well know they've they've been hypnotized in many cases to just do
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:18.480]  what they're told follow their orders they're drugged often with so many
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:21.960]  medications that they're beyond critical thinking ability you know there's
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:25.720]  fluoride in the water the food has been stripped of many of its nutritional
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.960]  values because of the refining and the processing and the bleaching and the
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:32.640]  homogenization through the process food industry what you're talking about now
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.840]  in Kentucky growing real food organic food even real crops that can be used
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.200]  right here in America that would help I think wake Americans up from the healthy
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:46.160]  nutritious soil that Kentucky is blessed with I mean you you really have a
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:50.800]  goldmine there well I agree with you it's the you know the the situation is
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:56.000]  that we really have been brainwashed you know where over the last three or four
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.880]  decades it's not longer to believe that everything that the federal government
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:06.120]  does and it really is not most of the things that they have they have put in
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:11.920]  the place and just stay in place have done absolutely nothing positive for it
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:17.040]  and we need to we need to roll that back and get back to the basics and get back
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:22.560]  to understanding that you know farmers need economic opportunities and we
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:27.120]  need to promote self-reliance and it's what made this country great and it
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:30.280]  has to we have to go back to that or we're gonna convert ourselves into some
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:34.040]  semi-socialist European nation well those those are dangerous words in
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:38.040]  Washington self-reliance how dare you suggest such a thing for Americans
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:41.600]  self-reliance hey people are supposed to depend on the government tell them what
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:46.000]  to do what to eat what kind of medicine to buy what kind of vaccines to take so
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.240]  on and so forth you know the idea that people could actually rely on themselves
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.800]  or each other or their local communities that's the antithesis of what
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.040]  Washington is trying to sell these days well you're right in it and it's the
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.480]  opposite of what the founders believe absolutely you know the founders
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:04.640]  believe that the yes if you could push government as far out to the people as
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.280]  possible so that local problems are being solved by local people with local
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.640]  money that things would be much better for everybody and they were right on the
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:19.040]  money with it and you know we need to quit thinking and with the central
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:24.520]  government's mindset and turn it back around to where they allow us to define
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:28.440]  what our problems are what our solutions are and our funding needs to be on a
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:33.600]  local basis that's that that's absolutely the key we are heading towards a break

[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:13.520]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:18.720]  today and we are joined by some good music in the background there we are
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.800]  joined by gubernatorial candidate for the state of Kentucky Phil Moffitt who is
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.400]  running on a platform of nullifying the FDA's influence over Kentucky's farms
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.720]  and even nullifying the Department of Agriculture's mandates over farming
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:40.000]  there mr. Moffitt is also an opponent of the the Obama healthcare system that
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:46.200]  has been pushed upon Americans and I also want to ask you to Phil about what
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:51.760]  you think about the Senate 510 food safety act that has been passed and that
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:57.680]  is now going to further burden US farmers who are trying to you know just
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.000]  make an honest living well this is another example of the government
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.800]  passing legislation and putting some a happy name on it like the food safety
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.120]  act and and in reality what they're doing is tripping away more of our
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:16.240]  liberties and more of our freedom with the act itself and you know we just have
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:21.520]  to stop this stuff if they you know we really knew that certain products were
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.520]  absolute percentages they're absolute health hazards and things like that I
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:29.880]  can understand where the federal government would want to act but there
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.040]  is the reality is all they're interested in is is telling us what to do and when
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:37.840]  to do it and how to do it and there is they're killing our farm economy by
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.480]  doing that and it just needs to stop if you give that power back to the state we
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:46.000]  have a fully functional Department of Agriculture at the state level in
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.760]  Kentucky and we're perfectly capable of managing our own affairs in that regard
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:54.720]  exactly and then with the economic abundance that would come from the
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:59.800]  freedom that you would like to restore to Kentucky's farmers seems like the
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.600]  state of Kentucky would have a lot of extra tax revenues to use for running
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.120]  things like your own State Department of Agriculture makes economic sense
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:10.600]  doesn't it it makes the economic sense any time government gets out of the way
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.800]  and lets people figure things out on their own because the free market is
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.880]  the most efficient vehicle for getting getting progress accomplished in terms of
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.240]  new products and services and the more the government stands in the way the more
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:27.680]  they regard that and what's really interesting about your position this is
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:32.440]  just my comment I I have a lot of readers on both the left and the right
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.880]  and a lot of libertarian readers as well and I noticed that even people on the
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:42.520]  on the far left are very much in support of your basic platform here of being
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:46.400]  able to grow what you're you want to grow without the fed feds coming in and
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.600]  telling you you can't grow that industrial hemp being used to create
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.320]  hemp seeds which are very rich in omega-3s and hemp clothing which is
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:57.840]  really rugged and long-lasting you can blend it with cotton you know even the
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:02.160]  people on the left have been actually calling out for some of these things of
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:05.400]  course perhaps in a different context I understand that's not where you're
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.000]  coming from Phil you're a tea party candidate but isn't it interesting that
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.480]  your position has such broad appeal that crosses virtually all party boundaries
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:19.120]  and just gets down to the root of freedom for the people at a local level
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:23.520]  common sense has a broad appeal you know that there's no there's not a
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:29.160]  reasonable explanation other than the power grab by rich industrialists in the
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.960]  1930s that industrial hemp ever should have been taken off the market there was
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:39.680]  there was absolutely no reason for it and it needs to be brought back you know
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.120]  common as I said earlier common sense has broad appeal across all segments of
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:49.280]  society and I think you know think a big part of the tea party movement coming
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:53.160]  to life is the fact that you know people understand at a common sense level we
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:57.440]  can't keep burying our country in debt just like at a common sense level we
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:01.800]  know that we can't continue to be buried in in regulation from the FDA and the
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.560]  EPA on things that really are local issues that we should be that we should
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:10.800]  be figuring out on our own and what what can people do Phil who want to support
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:16.160]  your campaign or learn more about the progress of your campaign well we we
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.160]  definitely need your help we have 54 days till our primary we actually have a
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:32.400]  May 17 2011 primary if you can go out the film office dot com at PHILMOSFPCT.com sign up for email updates you
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:38.600]  could sign up to to volunteer or make donations and also you can follow us on
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:45.720]  Twitter which is Moffitt Harman 11 which is 1-1 Moffitt Harman H-A-R-M-O-N-1-1
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:50.160]  and that's on Twitter so get in touch with this we would love to have you as
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:53.720]  part of the payment we need your support all right thank you thank you Phil for
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.520]  joining us here on the Alex Jones show today and thank you for adopting this
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:04.360]  platform of nullifying the FDA the DEA and the USDA in the state of Kentucky
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:08.640]  it would be very interesting to see how this moves forward we wish you the best
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:14.080]  of success in your candidacy and of course any any candidate who's running
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:18.200]  for office on a platform of freedom is likely to do increasingly well in the
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.360]  days ahead because I think America has reached a tipping point America's tired
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.400]  of the federal government telling us how to live our lives grow our food and
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:29.600]  take our medicine and people are changing people are recognizing we've got
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.800]  to have freedom if we want to have a future we'll be back on the other side

[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:29.640]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:13.960]  United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:18.680]  prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to reach
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:23.360]  $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the reach

[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:29.160]  thought I don't really know just with those Mike Adams the health drinker
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:34.400]  filling in for Alex today and you're just hearing a segment from a song I did
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:38.320]  called just say no to GMOs it's trying to do a little music on the side and
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:42.360]  try to sing about some topics that people need to know about freedom and
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:47.520]  GMOs and so on now in this segment we're going to be taking calls if you would
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:54.880]  like to call in the number is 800-259-9231 you can call in we want to be
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:34:00.440]  taking calls about Fukushima and GMOs in this segment so please callers respect
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:05.280]  those topics and we're gonna go to callers right now we have I believe here
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:13.360]  we have Stephen in Florida calling in go ahead Stephen you're on the air Stephen
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:20.680]  you're right there all right moving on to Noel in Illinois
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:27.000]  hello hello Mike it's a pleasure speaking with you I you do an unbelievable
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.560]  job man God bless your work to two quick questions on GMO foods I'm a college
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:40.720]  student I'm an inspiring investigative reporter wondering how in the world I
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:46.120]  could interview you on my show but what college kids can do to prepare to get
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:51.320]  themselves you know self-sufficient in a way from these fancy GMO foods and
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:57.560]  secondly about natural medicines I know you know I use Tom's of Maine
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:03.920]  fluoride free toothpaste what can people do natural ways for dental work and then
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:09.360]  natural medicines that we could get cheap at the awesome grocery stores well
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:13.200]  you know the best medicine is actually food if you go out and you buy raw
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:16.840]  purple cabbage for example juice a little bit of that in a juicer that
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:22.000]  stuff actually treats ulcers better than ulcer drugs raw broccoli juice for
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.920]  example has an anti-cancer effect it helps prevent breast cancer and prostate
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:32.400]  cancer virtually every color in your food purple cabbage or the red of an
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.120]  apple skin or grape skin fruits and vegetables and seeds and nuts they're
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:40.840]  all they all contain natural medicines so those are some great ones of course
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.000]  there are great products that concentrate those as natural supplements I
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.240]  don't want to name any specific products right here but there's some great
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:50.480]  ones out there if you want to connect with me you have to do that through the
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.440]  natural news website and I would very much enjoy being on being on your show
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:01.680]  we're I'm sitting in for Alex today focused on the Alex Jones topics which
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:08.960]  are Fukushima and GMOs I appreciate your call thank you Noel Darryl from Texas
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:14.360]  how are you hey I'm doing great Darryl thanks for calling in hey I wanted to
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:20.040]  ask a few questions and I realized the press for time so I'm thinking the best
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:23.960]  way thing for me to do is maybe just take about 15 or 20 seconds ask these
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:28.560]  questions and then you can maybe formulate your answer and those are you
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.080]  know I'm interested in comparing this event in Fukushima to maybe Hiroshima
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:39.040]  Nagasaki to kind of assess what we've been through in the past and assuming
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:43.760]  this will enter our food how we can educate ourselves to best avoid these
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:49.600]  and also is there anywhere to run basically on the globe is this stuff
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:53.840]  going to circle and equilibrate to the globe I understand it'll also it will
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:37:00.320]  always be more devastating towards the source but um and then also well one of
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:04.200]  the big differences Darryl of course in the atomic weapons dropped in World
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  War two it was a single large burst of radiation that then faded out immediately
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:15.600]  what we have in Fukushima is a slowly building sustained lease release of
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:19.520]  radiation that is nowhere near being under control so now we're dealing with
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:25.520]  sort of a marathon of radiation exposure where in Nagasaki we were dealing
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.920]  with a one-time burst of radiation and a lot of fallout afterwards now this
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:34.360]  this situation in Fukushima could actually end up impacting a greater
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:39.520]  number of people with of course a lower severity of radiation than the atomic
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.360]  weapons of World War two but it could impact a lot more people over time did
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:48.200]  you have a follow-up question yes please obviously this is going to be a greater
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:53.040]  threat in the Pacific and I am just becoming a big fan of things like
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.360]  Clorella and Spirulina which float in the ocean their algae the question would
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:04.040]  be if this is in our food and our soil can we expected the decrease over time
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:08.840]  also do you think the spirulina and the algae that's on the shelves in the
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:12.720]  grocery store right now has probably been in a warehouse somewhere it's
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.080]  probably safe to eat because it has not been water in the last two weeks that's
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:19.600]  right the spirulina and clorella those are both really excellent micro algae
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:23.520]  superfoods that I've been recommending and even taking for a long time they have
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.400]  lots of benefits and it is safe to get them off the shelves or from the stores
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:32.760]  right now they haven't been irradiated in fact some of the best spirulina in
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.800]  the world has grown in Hawaii and so it pristine water is actually in in Hawaii
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.360]  and the other foods should be safe for now we have to monitor the situation and
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:45.560]  see what the radioactive fallout is going to be over the long run the
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:48.960]  interesting thing about this though by the way is that many of the answers to
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.080]  radiation actually come out of the ocean and have traditionally been part of the
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:58.200]  Japanese diet for example high iodine content seaweeds which are which are
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:02.440]  consumed in very high quantities in Japan these are the very things that can
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:06.280]  help protect your thyroid from radiation exposure thank you for your call
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.400]  Darrell some great questions here also from Noel earlier Tony in Michigan
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.840]  you're on the air what's your question hey Mike I appreciate you taking my call
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:20.440]  I just want to say that I have a local newspaper in the area of southeast
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:25.280]  Michigan I live went under and it was replaced by kind of internet thing that
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:30.880]  does kind of a half poor job of covering what a real newspaper did even though a
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:34.760]  real newspapers are controlled obviously but I enjoy reposting some of your
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:40.280]  articles on their community wall page so to speak and for the most part they
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:43.680]  leave them up there so your information counteracts some of the
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:47.920]  misinformation that comes out of the hospital thank you Tony thank you Tony
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:53.080]  what's your question for us my wife and I and we have a six-year-old son we have
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:58.840]  a natural food supplement kelp which is obviously an iodine supplement on the
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:05.760]  bottle it's listed as 150 micrograms is just your opinion I know you can't
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:09.840]  diagnose things like a doctor but your opinion about taking that supplement
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:13.560]  now and also about giving that to a child now just a precautionary to build
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:18.400]  up or does that work that way well it does work that way you need to have
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:22.480]  natural sources of iodine in your body now dr. brownstein who I believe has
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:25.880]  been a guest here on the alex jones show has studied this extensively and
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.960]  talks about the need to consume milligrams of iodine not just micrograms
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:36.640]  but milligrams 8 to 12 milligrams per day for an adult I believe is his general
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:43.000]  recommendation for ongoing prevention of well a variety of disorders such as
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.920]  thyroid disorders and iodine is even helpful in preventing certain types of
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:52.040]  degenerative conditions now of course if you're going to take supplements I
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:55.240]  always encourage you to seek out a naturopathic physician so that you're
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:58.320]  working with somebody who can get your overall sense of what you're taking and
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.480]  what you need but as a general rule iodine can be taken in much higher
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:06.240]  levels than what is recommended by the US government whose nutritional advice
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:09.880]  is always really low remember these are the same folks at the government who
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:14.680]  say you don't need much vitamin D either or zinc or magnesium or calcium all the
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.400]  numbers are kept artificially low which causes nutritional deficiencies in
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:22.440]  America which then feeds the profits of the drug industry and the cancer
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:26.280]  industry so it's all connected that's a great point that you made there Tony
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.520]  thank you for your call really appreciate these great questions Fred in
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.840]  Florida you're on the alex jones show go ahead please following the NHK world
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.280]  news out of Japan they've been quite informative about the Fukushima situation
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:44.240]  the current thinking about the number three reactor leakage is that it's from
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:49.560]  a broken pipe or valve inside a reactor vessel rather than a crack or breach in
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:54.640]  a reactor vessel itself they think this because if the reactor vessel itself
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.840]  was ruptured that the leaking radiation would be much higher well that's a
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:04.920]  really important point I'm glad you're bringing us that news from NHK that's
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:10.040]  of course one of the news networks out of Japan if that's confirmed and that
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.200]  would be a very positive development I hope that's the case I hope it's not
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:16.680]  actually the containment vessel of the core itself thank you for your call
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:22.320]  Linda from California you're on the air what's your question you know oxygen and
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:29.000]  diet and lifestyle are the prescribed the ways to just stay healthy and that
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.640]  applies to Japan to the facilities as well as the people which need light
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:42.040]  and oxygen and air that breaks down toxic waste as well as fallout otherwise
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:46.160]  it builds and deteriorates into even finer stuff which is why people get
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:52.560]  cancer years later so the the advice to people would be an oxygen diet lifestyle
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:57.680]  that's what viral raw foods and ocean stuff all of this could come under the
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:05.480]  heading of oxygen so you don't have to take supplements you can just say fasting
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:10.640]  is the total detox because when you don't take any food into your body it
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:16.160]  starts expelling the toxins so you're using all of your body exactly right
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.440]  Linda some really good points there I would just add that you know detox is
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.960]  a is a is something that a lot of people need because of all the processed
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:28.600]  foods and junk foods and so on that we tend to consume in America today detox is
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.640]  great but right now facing a possible radioactive fallout I wouldn't want to be
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:39.320]  in a detox cycle right now just because I would that can make your body weak
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:42.000]  temporarily you know what I'm talking about where that where the detox is
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.920]  kicking in and you have some of those toxins being released out of your body
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.000]  I would I would encourage people to really boost their nutritional intake
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:53.040]  right now of super foods and raw foods and and juicing and high quality
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:56.920]  supplements and you know real fruits and vegetables and things like that right
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:01.200]  now just to build up their bodies defenses and nutritional stores in case
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:05.640]  something begins to happen with the fallout situation because this is this
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:09.800]  is not over yet we're not out of the woods with Fukushima let's hope it
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.760]  doesn't get any worse but that's a great point Linda thank you for calling
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:18.680]  Stephen from Florida you are on the air please go ahead yeah hey Mike good
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:23.920]  afternoon good afternoon yeah I what happened was when you tried to pull me
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:27.880]  up earlier I'm trying to as much as possible keep the cell phone away from
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.720]  my head yeah so I keep it on speaker unfortunately I hit my mute button
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:39.800]  mistake but as far as GMO foods here's what I wanted to say I talked to a lot
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:44.280]  of people about this issue and even though there's so much information out
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:48.880]  there through people like you and Alex and especially Jeffrey Smith and a health
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:54.360]  freedom USA this is still an issue that for the most part is people are
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.640]  ignorant of and that's what makes it so dangerous and that's why I'm glad you
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:03.440]  mentioned these rallies that are taking place over the United States tomorrow to
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:07.680]  make people aware of this because as far as I'm concerned you're well aware of
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.640]  what the food industry and big pharma has done with the foods with all the
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.640]  chemicals and pesticides etc but this GMO situation with Monsanto and the
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:22.440]  corporate elite that are doing this this to me is the most insidious part of
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:28.200]  what they're doing to corrupt and toxify our food system and the bottom line is
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:31.280]  this and this is the main point I want to make that people need to understand
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:36.960]  Alex's point of this out very succinctly in his documentary Endgame this is
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:42.280]  about eugenics this is about a group of people and they're just a handful that
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.960]  want to exterminate us all and of course one of the main ways they're trying to
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:51.320]  do this is through what is our most essential element other than water and
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:55.760]  air and that's the food supply because we can't live without food and they know
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:00.400]  this and so what they're doing is they're trying to basically alter what our
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.400]  creator gave us that will benefit us in order to make us sick and weak to the
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:09.680]  point where we can't fight back and eventually we all just die off you got it
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:13.720]  yeah Stephen I think you're right on I think you're right on with a point
[02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:17.800]  there I get your drift I think you're right on the food supply is becoming a
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:22.680]  source of poison for the people and this is something that we have to overcome
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:25.640]  if we're going to have a future you made a lot of really great points there I
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:30.040]  started meaning to cut you off but it's true that the water is already poisoned
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:33.720]  with the fluoride we know that the vaccines have their own whole story of
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.280]  what's in there what kind of poisons and toxic chemicals are in there and now
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:42.800]  we have the GMOs and I when I was on Alex's show last week I mentioned some
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:47.600]  of the same things I said look the GMOs these are the Fukushima catastrophe of
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:51.920]  modern agriculture if you think Fukushima is bad and how it's impacting the
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.120]  food and and causing the radioactive contamination of vegetables over a
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:00.560]  hundred miles away from the nuclear facility then you just wait you just
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:06.200]  wait until these GMOs get out of control and you have a global food supply that is
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:10.680]  wiped out or you have a crash in one kind of crop what if all the GMO corn
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:14.960]  fails one year because because of the monoculture activities that go on
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:19.400]  because it doesn't have genetic diversity because it has a vulnerability to a
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:25.240]  specific type of insect or type of mold or fungus or bacteria what happens
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:30.120]  when that fails us and then the farmers are left with no seeds because you can't
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:34.240]  save seeds year after year due to the seed termination technology that they're
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:37.600]  building into these GMOs because they want the farmers to buy the seeds year
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:41.920]  after year from the same wealthy influential corporations this is this
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.360]  is just a travesty and it threatens the future of life on our planet you're
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:50.400]  exactly right about that Steven thank you for your call Larry from Louisiana
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:56.920]  you're on the air here on the Alex Jones show yeah didn't I just see it
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:01.640]  snowing over in Japan there recently within since that reactor went up well
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:04.880]  I don't know but as far as the weather is going there's yellow rain falling out
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:09.320]  of the sky and that's scary enough for me yeah do you have a question yeah
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:12.960]  that's what I was wondering snow and season and pollen season ain't at the
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:18.840]  same time how are you getting pollen if it's snowing that's exactly right well
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.720]  when you start breaking down the logic behind some of these excuses that were
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:26.600]  being given by the Japanese government they don't really make any sense that's
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:29.520]  the truth behind many of the stories that were told today by the mainstream
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:33.640]  media as well so I'm glad you pointed out that discrepancy in the report yeah
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:37.520]  they've been talking about people out in the cold out there they don't have any
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:41.840]  warmth because their homes are gone from the tsunami so how is it how is it
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:46.560]  pollen season out there not sure about that one Christopher from Alabama you're
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:52.240]  on the air go ahead please doing today I'm doing great man how are you I'm
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:58.040]  always fabulous I'm real quick are you familiar with the disease called DKU yes
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:03.160]  I am okay well just real quick about GMOs I have twins that have that very rare
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:06.360]  disease called DKU will never approach to the rest of her life no milk no
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:09.920]  chicken or cheese no fish no birthday cake no ice cream no nothing as you
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:14.400]  know if they take in protein their body can't break it down it goes to the brain
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:18.480]  and causes stream in a retardation really anything happened with them when
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.640]  they got to be about three or four years old they started eating real real
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:27.760]  fruits and vegetables and their levels went off the chart and their doctors
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:33.120]  accused us of giving them protein and come to find out what had happened we
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:36.320]  had given them fruits and vegetables that had been genetically modified and
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:42.160]  they had a pig gene in the tomato the watermelon that made their levels go off
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:47.520]  the chart wow okay that that's a very disturbing report I'm glad you shared
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.120]  that with us Christopher thanks for doing that yeah it's true I mean your
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:56.000]  children can't even touch MSG or a free glutamate in any form including yeast
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.320]  extract which is a very common ingredient used in foods I'm sorry to hear
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:04.280]  that they got a hold of some genetically modified foods but I'm sure the
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:07.720]  reason you mentioned that is because it's important to point out what happens
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:12.680]  on our planet when you start combining animal genes with plant seeds this is
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:17.240]  completely unnatural it's a violation of natural law someone say a violation of
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:20.880]  God and mother nature as well this is not the way to run the future of our
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.480]  world by playing God and Frankenstein with all these seeds we are headed for
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:29.720]  disaster on the agricultural front I believe if we continue down this path
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:36.640]  of GMOs thank you for your call we have Rob from Illinois oh Rob I'm sorry we

[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:39.040]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global

[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:12.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Friday we are having a great time
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:18.960]  here taking some calls about issues GMOs the Fukushima nuclear power plant
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:23.120]  catastrophe situation I'm filling in for Alex today my name is Mike Adams the
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:26.960]  health ranger now when we left before the break we were about to bring in Rob
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.400]  from Illinois go ahead Rob you're on the air thank you Mike you're doing a
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:36.040]  great job I just wanted to point out that about the middle of last year the
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:43.280]  Carlisle group which is a Bilderberg group member and they bought the largest
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:48.200]  vitamin and health food supplement company the parent company of the
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:51.960]  largest vitamin and health food supplement company in the country and
[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:58.520]  I'm curious as to whether they may try to introduce some GMOs into the vitamin
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:02.280]  and health food supply and I wanted to get your take on that well currently the
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:08.240]  USDA organic label is does not allow GMOs to be used in fact the organic
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.120]  definition does not allow GMOs to be used in any kind of nutritional
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:15.440]  supplements or foods so that's currently a good protection for us but
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:18.720]  that's always under attack and that's why it's so important to join these
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:22.240]  protests and get out there and be part of these groups everybody from Jeffrey
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:26.120]  Smith at the Institute for Responsible Technology to even the Organic
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:30.200]  Consumers Association is involved in this it's important to keep on protesting
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:35.440]  and pushing for GMOs to be out of the foods and protected especially out of
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:39.680]  organics did you have a follow-up question there Rob? Well I was just wondering if maybe
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:45.440]  they might try to go on and dissolve the vitamin world that they bought you
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.640]  know even that or some way attack the vitamin industry by now owning it. Well
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:54.480]  my sense is that these these very powerful global corporations they do
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:57.920]  know that there's money to be made in supplements a lot of the more popular
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:02.520]  common vitamins on the shelves the low-quality stuff is really manufactured
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:05.560]  by what are essentially pharmaceutical companies and they use a lot of
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.840]  synthetic vitamins in those I'm again I'm talking about the low-cost low-quality
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:13.760]  stuff that you find at everyday stores but the the good side of the industry is
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:18.160]  the very high-end very high-quality nutritional supplement companies which
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:21.800]  tend to be smaller and they're doing a great job out there and I know that
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:24.240]  you'll continue to support those companies because they're bringing us
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:27.960]  really important nutrition that we need to help us prevent chronic
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:31.920]  degenerative disease nutrition really does work to do that we still have a
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:35.600]  little bit of time thank you for your call Rob I really appreciate it Vin from
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:41.280]  Arizona please go ahead with your question. Yeah hi Mike can you hear me
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:46.000]  Aaron? I can go ahead yeah. Just bridging off what you guys were just talking about
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.440]  the nutritional deficiency in this country is hitting an all-time high and
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.280]  one of the you know one of the studies that I found from the Southern
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:57:00.000]  California School was measuring vitamin C content in oranges and they were
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:04.640]  going after big distributors who were apparently keeping oranges in their
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:09.360]  warehouses for months and they were sitting there picked off trees ripe the
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:13.920]  peel was completely green when it was time to ship them out to the stores they
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:19.240]  died the outside of the peels orange and ship them out as fresh people go home
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:23.680]  and buy these these schools are testing these oranges by finding zero vitamin C
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:27.920]  content. Yeah Vin. Want to know why these companies are buying up these vitamins
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:32.480]  vitamin supplements and whatnot because we are gonna have to be dependent on
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:36.160]  those supplements. That's the nutritional value of our food. I think there's an
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:39.440]  effort Vin to actually lower the nutritional value of our food. The same
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:42.720]  thing happens with tomatoes you make a really good point. They say that you're
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:46.160]  buying tomatoes that are ripened on the vine but what they don't tell you is they
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:50.520]  cut the vine off too and then just leave the tomatoes attached to the vine. They
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:54.880]  don't tell you that they use synthetic gas chemicals to ripen bananas in the
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:58.040]  warehouses before they ship them out to the grocery stores as well. So there's
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:01.120]  all kinds of stuff like this going on. I hope maybe we get a chance to come back
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:05.120]  and talk about what's really in your food on a future episode depending on
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:08.400]  Alex's schedule. I mean there's so much you need to know about what's in your
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:12.720]  food and what's not in your food it would absolutely shock you. We'll get to
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:17.800]  that now. The rebroadcast of this show begins in just a couple of minutes here
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:21.200]  on the other side of this break. I want to thank you all for joining me today
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:26.000]  and allowing me to sit in here for Alex Jones. The rebroadcast includes Paul
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:29.800]  Joseph Watson, Christopher Busby and of course Phil Moffitt the gubernatorial
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:33.480]  candidate for Kentucky. Thanks for joining us today here on the Alex Jones
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:36.840]  show and I look forward to joining you again in the future. This is Mike Adams
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:59:04.400]  The Health Ranger. Take care.
