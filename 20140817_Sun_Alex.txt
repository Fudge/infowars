[00:00.000 --> 00:19.040]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19.040 --> 00:20.560]  I'm David Knight here live.
[00:20.560 --> 00:26.280]  We've got a very important show today because America is really at a crossroads, a crossroads
[00:26.280 --> 00:27.800]  I think of corruption.
[00:27.800 --> 00:33.280]  Of course, it was probably less than two weeks ago that Alex had Colonel Pete Martino
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.400]  in here, retired Marine Colonel.
[00:35.400 --> 00:40.160]  And he was talking about how the real issue before America that impinges upon all of these
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.160]  other issues, whether it's the police state or the drug war, is really an issue of corruption.
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.480]  And I think this is really brought to the forefront now here in a story that's breaking
[00:49.480 --> 00:54.560]  here in Austin about the indictment of Governor Perry here.
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.880]  This is two felony accounts that they're coming at him with that was a story of local
[00:58.880 --> 00:59.880]  corruption a year ago.
[00:59.880 --> 01:02.680]  And we're going to show those of you who weren't following this.
[01:02.680 --> 01:06.600]  I think we covered it a little bit just talking about how outrageous it was that we could
[01:06.600 --> 01:13.920]  have the highest law enforcement agent in the county behave this way and refuse to resign
[01:13.920 --> 01:15.840]  strictly because of political reasons.
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.960]  The Democrat Party is supporting her, keeping her in office, even though it reveals some
[01:20.960 --> 01:27.000]  very, very troubling character issues with this district attorney, who is actually in
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.800]  charge of the state public integrity unit, LOL.
[01:31.800 --> 01:35.640]  I guess I need to put that in back of it, so they're like, LLC.
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.280]  I guess if she's in charge of it, they ought to call it public integrity unit, LOL.
[01:41.280 --> 01:45.040]  Because she was getting $7.5 million of state funds.
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.720]  And Rick Perry said, if you're going to do that, we're going to have somebody who actually
[01:50.720 --> 01:53.320]  hasn't damaged their integrity publicly.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.120]  We're going to be talking about that in the next segment.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.600]  We've got clips of that coming up for you.
[01:56.600 --> 01:59.920]  Alex Jones is going to be coming up with Max Kaiser.
[01:59.920 --> 02:02.800]  And we've got a lot of breaking news from Ferguson.
[02:02.800 --> 02:05.880]  We have a lot of new news from last night, of course.
[02:05.880 --> 02:07.520]  Our crew is still there.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.920]  And there were more pure gassings last night.
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.520]  Of course, there's a difference in the way the mainstream media, especially CNN, is reporting
[02:14.520 --> 02:16.960]  it and the way that it really happened.
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.480]  And we have people there on the streets.
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.600]  We have Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, and Josh Owens are there on the street reporting this.
[02:24.600 --> 02:29.400]  So we're going to tell you what really happened, not what the police press report says.
[02:29.400 --> 02:32.360]  And we're going to take a look at what's going on.
[02:32.360 --> 02:34.880]  This has become, of course, a very large national story.
[02:34.880 --> 02:36.240]  It was just last Friday.
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.400]  More than 1,000 people marched in Times Square protesting what was happening in Ferguson.
[02:41.400 --> 02:46.960]  Because what is happening in Ferguson is something that we're seeing over and over and over again,
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.640]  the militarization of the police.
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.600]  But we see the feds, especially Attorney General Eric Holder, pretending that this is somehow
[02:53.600 --> 02:57.160]  something that is unique to that particular area.
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.880]  No, the reason this is a national story is because the militarization of the police is
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.640]  something that's being done by the federal government.
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.160]  They're changing the rules of engagement.
[03:08.160 --> 03:11.080]  They're changing the way that they treat the citizens on the street.
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.480]  They're changing the way that they're equipped.
[03:13.480 --> 03:17.240]  And they're encouraging them into this kind of confrontational belligerence.
[03:17.240 --> 03:18.240]  That's coming from the feds.
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.080]  And so for the federal government to come in and say that they're going to now be the
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.120]  saviors riding in on a white horse is a little bit hypocritical.
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.120]  It's way hypocritical.
[03:27.120 --> 03:28.680]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.200]  Of course, the governor of Missouri, Governor Nixon, has been on several of the Sunday political
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.200]  talk shows.
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.840]  We're going to talk about what he's saying.
[03:35.840 --> 03:38.920]  We're going to look at it from the perspective of eyewitness reports.
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.200]  We're now having some eyewitness reports surfacing, a little bit of contradictory information
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.200]  from some of these.
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.360]  We're going to take a look at that and also the Second Amendment and how that impinges
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.360]  upon all of this.
[03:50.360 --> 03:54.840]  Of course, we've talked about how the people who did not suffer from looting were the store
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.520]  owners who stood there with guns to protect themselves because the police were standing
[03:59.520 --> 04:00.520]  down.
[04:00.520 --> 04:05.760]  The police don't seem to be able in Ferguson, as in many other places, to distinguish between
[04:05.760 --> 04:12.240]  stepping up and protecting people from looters or coming after peaceful protesters.
[04:12.240 --> 04:15.800]  They stand down when they see looters, but when they see peaceful protesters, they seem
[04:15.800 --> 04:17.200]  to get aggressive.
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.040]  The people who stood there protecting their property with firearms were the ones who didn't
[04:21.040 --> 04:22.880]  have their businesses burned down.
[04:22.880 --> 04:29.200]  And yet we see a court decision coming out of Maryland saying that AR-15s are unusual
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.360]  weapons and we don't need to be allowed to have those.
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.160]  So we're going to be coming back with more information about that and other court decisions
[04:37.160 --> 04:41.640]  that have surfaced recently about the Second Amendment and how it impinges on your rights
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.800]  to protect yourself, whether it's from looters or an overly aggressive government.
[04:45.800 --> 04:58.760]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:58.760 --> 05:02.440]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.800]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:06.800 --> 05:08.520]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:08.520 --> 05:14.400]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[05:14.400 --> 05:16.440]  priced and fully legal.
[05:16.440 --> 05:24.080]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:24.080 --> 05:28.840]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[05:28.840 --> 05:34.480]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sown
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.400]  American-made jeans.
[05:36.400 --> 05:40.160]  After your out for dinner, working on the farm or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.160]  offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[05:55.080 --> 05:59.040]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[05:59.040 --> 06:07.240]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[06:07.240 --> 06:13.160]  up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[06:13.160 --> 06:17.240]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[06:17.240 --> 06:19.240]  of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[06:19.240 --> 06:22.160]  There's just have to be repetitive about this.
[06:22.160 --> 06:26.760]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[06:26.760 --> 06:31.560]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[06:31.560 --> 06:33.760]  about guns in a vastly different way.
[06:33.760 --> 06:34.760]  Enough.
[06:34.760 --> 06:35.760]  Enough.
[06:35.760 --> 06:36.760]  Enough.
[06:36.760 --> 06:37.760]  Mayor Bloomberg.
[06:37.760 --> 06:38.760]  How you doing?
[06:38.760 --> 06:39.760]  Jason, I go Brooklyn.
[06:39.760 --> 06:42.760]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[06:42.760 --> 06:45.040]  Uh, you will get right back to me.
[06:45.040 --> 06:55.000]  You'll get back to me?
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.560]  They may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture, there's an aspect of this, a kind
[07:01.560 --> 07:05.000]  of wild west cowboy dirty harry aspect, there's also an aspect of this.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  So they're macho men and they gotta have a gun.
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.040]  Go ahead, make my day.
[07:10.040 --> 07:13.440]  Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead.
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.280]  A trio of would-be burglars picked the wrong Albuquerque house to break into.
[07:18.280 --> 07:23.480]  Police say when the three teens pried open the door, a brave little girl was waiting
[07:23.480 --> 07:26.000]  for them, locked and loaded.
[07:26.000 --> 07:38.840]  It's harder to use a assault weapon to hit something that is a shotgun, okay?
[07:38.840 --> 07:49.520]  You don't need an AR-15, it's harder to aim, it's harder to use.
[07:49.520 --> 07:56.720]  In fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself, buy a shotgun, buy a shotgun.
[07:56.720 --> 08:02.400]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about
[08:02.400 --> 08:10.040]  how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification,
[08:10.040 --> 08:13.280]  the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear.
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.480]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven
[08:19.480 --> 08:24.920]  places where more innocents are killed called gun-free zones, we're gonna beat you, we're
[08:24.920 --> 08:27.800]  gonna vote you out of office or suck in my machine gun.
[08:27.800 --> 08:32.480]  That's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda, the Republic
[08:32.480 --> 08:34.960]  will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[08:34.960 --> 08:38.480]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed, we will take all weapons.
[08:38.480 --> 08:43.680]  I believe that as Americans, we have a right arm ourselves against criminals, but we don't
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.280]  need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[08:47.280 --> 08:49.720]  The United States military is not out to get us.
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.280]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying screen.
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.400]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.040]  The Second Amendment is there and it was put in there not for hunting and fishing like
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.080]  they like to say, because back when they did it, if you didn't hunt or fish, you didn't
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.080]  need.
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.240]  It was put in there so the citizens would have the ability, if their government became
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.680]  oppressive, they could defend themselves against oppressive government.
[09:18.680 --> 09:23.280]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns, but El Castro took the
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.160]  guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.640]  try to take our firearms.
[09:30.640 --> 09:36.880]  I'm the hootness, hootness, hootness, Bob T. Wildcat in the West.
[09:36.880 --> 09:39.240]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.360]  I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with him in his home, where he had access
[09:44.360 --> 09:49.920]  to his 50 weapons, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic
[09:49.920 --> 09:52.000]  that you got legally and pop him.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.640]  I'd love to see that in uniform.
[09:57.640 --> 10:03.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[10:03.320 --> 10:10.800]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down,
[10:10.800 --> 10:17.400]  if you want to come and take us.
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.360]  Welcome to this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, it's Sunday, August 17th, 2014.
[10:23.360 --> 10:25.200]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.200]  We have Alex Jones coming up with Max Kaiser.
[10:28.200 --> 10:30.160]  There's some breaking news, of course, in Ferguson.
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.160]  Our reporters are there covering that live, and again, there was more tear gas last night
[10:35.160 --> 10:42.280]  against demonstrators who are exercising their First Amendment rights to protest and to redress
[10:42.280 --> 10:43.280]  their grievances.
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.480]  And they have some serious grievances, especially after what the police have done this last
[10:47.480 --> 10:48.480]  week.
[10:48.480 --> 10:51.720]  We're going to talk about the history of that police force, a very troubling history
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.600]  that is now coming to the forefront.
[10:53.600 --> 10:57.680]  We're going to talk about what's being done by the federal government, how Eric Holder
[10:57.680 --> 11:02.920]  is trying to spend this, and take over the narrative, pretending that the federal government
[11:02.920 --> 11:08.760]  is the savior coming in on a horse to take this away from everybody, because they had
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.000]  nothing to do with these militarized vehicles.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.320]  He complains about how militarized the police are there, how did they get those weapons,
[11:16.320 --> 11:17.520]  those vehicles, that training?
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.120]  Well, of course, it has been coming from the federal government.
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.040]  We've been talking about that for a very long time, for years we've been talking about it.
[11:25.040 --> 11:30.880]  All we hear from the mainstream media is scoffs when we talk about 2,700 MRAPs, about
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.400]  2 billion rounds of ammunition, about all these vehicles being put in very small police
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.640]  towns, encouraging these people, telling them, you need a mine-resistant armored personnel
[11:40.640 --> 11:42.560]  carrier.
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.400]  This is what's happening from the federal government, and yet they're coming in as if
[11:46.400 --> 11:48.960]  they're going to save the day.
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.160]  Of course, this is really all about corruption, and as Alex Jones had a couple of weeks ago
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.440]  retired Colonel Pete Martino, who got involved in this because of the federal government
[11:59.440 --> 12:05.520]  militarizing a small town in New Hampshire where he lived, he said, can't you see what
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.560]  they're doing to our country?
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.200]  He had seen this abroad when he was fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he said, it's
[12:12.200 --> 12:13.880]  about the mission statement.
[12:13.880 --> 12:16.920]  What is the mission of our various agencies?
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.800]  They've lost their way, they've lost their way from the top down.
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.640]  It's really fundamentally about corruption, and I think a good example of this is what's
[12:25.640 --> 12:28.280]  happened here just this last weekend.
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.680]  Late on Friday there was breaking news that Governor Rick Perry has been indicted for abuse
[12:33.680 --> 12:35.760]  of office and for coercion.
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.360]  Yes, it's a story about corruption, but that's not the story.
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.760]  I think the real story is the corruption that is encouraged and tolerated because it can
[12:45.760 --> 12:48.000]  result in political gain.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.240]  And what we see with what was about a, it was a local story, I guess about a month,
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.960]  it was four months ago, a year, it was back in April of 2013, that the district attorney
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.440]  here in Travis County, the highest ranking law enforcement official here in Travis County
[13:04.440 --> 13:11.360]  and in the state, was convicted of drunk driving and what happened there?
[13:11.360 --> 13:15.600]  It wasn't just a single drunk driving conviction, but it was the way that it happened, and I
[13:15.600 --> 13:19.440]  don't want to play for you a short tape of this, and if you're watching this, you can
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.400]  see the B-roll of how she reacted once she was arrested for drunk driving.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.400]  Here's a little clip.
[13:24.400 --> 13:30.240]  And you're going to ruin my career, and that's not, that's not, that's not the intent of
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.240]  what I am here for.
[13:33.240 --> 13:37.800]  Now that clip is, is, she just keeps going on about her career.
[13:37.800 --> 13:39.760]  She can barely stand up.
[13:39.760 --> 13:42.960]  You don't see it in that clip right there, but we have some other clips where there's
[13:42.960 --> 13:48.320]  a very long, about a 15 minute video that they recorded on the police car dash cam,
[13:48.320 --> 13:51.320]  and she was staggering so much that both officers had to help her.
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.640]  Now, they didn't pull her over, she was reported to the police by a motorist, it was so bad.
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.800]  She was going across the lanes, she was actually three times the legal limit, and she had an
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.640]  open bottle of vodka in the car, she told the police that she'd had some vodka, later
[14:04.640 --> 14:08.920]  she changed her story saying that she'd had a few glasses of wine while she was watching
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.400]  a movie, maybe both of those are true, I don't know.
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.320]  But she got very abusive, as you can see in this B-roll that we've been running here,
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.440]  she got so abusive in the jail, so violent that they had to constrain her.
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.680]  She just kept shouting about her career.
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.560]  You're doing this to my career, absolutely no concern about the danger that she put
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.440]  people in on the road, simply concerned about her career, and of course the Democrats did
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.920]  not want her to step down, even though it was very embarrassing for her, and for the
[14:37.920 --> 14:43.520]  Democrats to stand behind her, they didn't want Perry to appoint a Republican in her
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.760]  place, so instead they stood with the corruption, because it suited their power play.
[14:48.760 --> 14:51.520]  It was purely political that they stood with her.
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.560]  Now the interesting thing about this, and where this comes in to charges against Governor
[14:55.560 --> 15:02.360]  Perry, is that she was in charge of a state fund where she had $7.5 million as part of
[15:02.360 --> 15:05.240]  the quote, public integrity unit.
[15:05.240 --> 15:11.600]  That's right, somebody who was screaming abusively at the people in jail, so much so that they
[15:11.600 --> 15:18.480]  had to constrain her, who was picked up for three times the legal limit, and didn't have
[15:18.480 --> 15:20.880]  the integrity to step down.
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.080]  Instead she wanted to run this office and have the public trust, and they were getting
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.320]  $7.5 million worth of state funds, so Perry said basically either she steps down, or I'm
[15:32.320 --> 15:39.720]  not going to give state funds to that organization, instead what they have now done is come against
[15:39.720 --> 15:45.640]  Rick Perry, and charge him with felonies for exercising his gubernatorial veto, what he
[15:45.640 --> 15:47.440]  has a legitimate right to do.
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.880]  Now stay with us, we're going to be joining our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, Jakari

[18:05.400 --> 18:08.640]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.

[18:20.360 --> 18:21.360]  security?
[18:21.360 --> 18:22.960]  Are we sticking our hands down against them on the streets?

[19:28.720 --> 19:32.400]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.760]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[19:36.760 --> 19:38.760]  Can you put two and two together?
[19:38.760 --> 19:44.320]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably

[20:25.440 --> 20:28.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, August 17, 2014.
[20:28.800 --> 20:29.800]  I'm David Knight.
[20:29.800 --> 20:35.800]  Alex is going to be coming up with Max Kaiser, and we have on the phone with us now.
[20:35.800 --> 20:39.440]  We have Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs there in Ferguson, Missouri, where the riots have
[20:39.440 --> 20:40.440]  been going.
[20:40.440 --> 20:42.320]  And there's some updates from last night.
[20:42.320 --> 20:48.360]  We had some more confrontations with the police and protesters, peaceful protesters.
[20:48.360 --> 20:51.400]  And we're going to talk to them about what happened and what their plans are, what's
[20:51.400 --> 20:52.400]  going on today.
[20:52.400 --> 20:55.240]  There's a lot of news coming out of there and a lot of different angles that are coming
[20:55.240 --> 20:56.240]  out of this.
[20:56.240 --> 20:59.960]  Of course, the federal government is trying to pretend that they're going to save the
[20:59.960 --> 21:01.560]  local residents.
[21:01.560 --> 21:05.360]  Many of them are buying that, even though it was the federal government that started the
[21:05.360 --> 21:07.680]  militarization of the police.
[21:07.680 --> 21:10.360]  So we need to talk about this as a country.
[21:10.360 --> 21:13.880]  We need to have a discussion, as Rand Paul pointed out last week.
[21:13.880 --> 21:17.080]  The real issue is the militarization of the police.
[21:17.080 --> 21:20.520]  But there's also some eyewitness reports that are coming out of the area.
[21:20.520 --> 21:24.000]  We're going to talk about those, and of course, there is second amendment news, because we
[21:24.000 --> 21:32.040]  had a district judge in Maryland, a rule on a Maryland law, saying that the AR-15
[21:32.040 --> 21:36.040]  bans that Maryland has put in, along with other so-called assault rifles, the court
[21:36.040 --> 21:41.240]  seriously doubts that these banned assault long guns are commonly possessed for lawful
[21:41.240 --> 21:42.240]  purposes.
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.880]  And it's inclined to find that the weapons fall outside of the second amendment protection
[21:46.880 --> 21:49.760]  because they are dangerous and unusual.
[21:49.760 --> 21:50.760]  So there you have it.
[21:50.760 --> 21:56.560]  A federal judge, it was appointed by Clinton, is saying that AR-15s are dangerous and unusual
[21:56.560 --> 21:59.600]  weapons that are not protected by the second amendment.
[21:59.600 --> 22:06.000]  Clearly, the second amendment was about military weapons, because it was talking about the
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.920]  militia being used to defend the country.
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.040]  And of course, the Constitution says that the militia is there to put down insurrections
[22:14.040 --> 22:15.040]  and invasions.
[22:15.040 --> 22:17.560]  It's a military perspective.
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.120]  And of course, it also falls into being able to protect yourself, and we've seen in Ferguson,
[22:22.120 --> 22:27.040]  Missouri, that the store owners who still have stores in the areas where they were looting
[22:27.040 --> 22:30.000]  and burning stores were the ones who stood there with guns.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.400]  Many of them AR-15s, because they're far more effective than shotguns in many cases.
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.800]  Now, just before we came up to the break, we were talking about what's going on here
[22:40.800 --> 22:44.240]  and the corruption that we see in government.
[22:44.240 --> 22:49.400]  And of course, the corruption of our police forces by militarizing them, the corruption
[22:49.400 --> 22:55.360]  that comes from not understanding, as retired Colonel Pete Martino said, not understanding
[22:55.360 --> 22:56.360]  the mission statement.
[22:56.360 --> 23:00.720]  Well, the mission statement is laid out pretty clearly in the Constitution as to what the
[23:00.720 --> 23:01.920]  government is supposed to do.
[23:01.920 --> 23:03.760]  So it starts from the top down.
[23:03.760 --> 23:06.000]  It starts from the federal government down.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.400]  But we also see that it is now moving up from a local story here in Austin to a national
[23:11.400 --> 23:18.640]  story as what began last April, I guess it was about a year and four months ago, there
[23:18.640 --> 23:23.440]  was a drunk driving arrest of the district attorney here who happened to be in charge
[23:23.440 --> 23:30.760]  of the state public integrity unit that got $7.5 million from the state government.
[23:30.760 --> 23:36.280]  And it was such an egregious arrest, it was videotaped both by the dash cam of the police
[23:36.280 --> 23:42.560]  and also because she was so abusive physically, verbally in the jail that they began videotaping
[23:42.560 --> 23:43.560]  it.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.560]  That all eventually came out.
[23:44.560 --> 23:48.000]  It was a local story at first, but then she refused to stand down.
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.440]  When Governor Perry tried to get her to resign, of course, she didn't have enough integrity
[23:53.440 --> 23:54.520]  to resign.
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.480]  The Democrat Party didn't want her to resign because they wanted the power.
[23:58.480 --> 24:01.400]  They didn't care what kind of person was in charge.
[24:01.400 --> 24:04.040]  And this is what they've used that organization for in the past.
[24:04.040 --> 24:10.120]  This is from the Washington Post and, of course, they make it sound as if Governor Perry defunded
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.320]  her entire department.
[24:11.320 --> 24:16.560]  Of course, she has a district attorney for the county, but it was the public integrity
[24:16.560 --> 24:21.200]  unit that was not going to get $7.5 million of state money.
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.960]  They say that her predecessor indicted then Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, who was a Republican
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.080]  and he was a Democrat, for allegedly misusing state resources when she was state treasurer.
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.920]  They say, and this is a Washington Post reporting, the prosecution crumbled on the first day
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.520]  of the trial.
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.560]  The same guy, the predecessor of Rosemary Lindbergh, his name is Ronnie Earl.
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.320]  He also brought a case against then House whip, Tom DeLay, again, another national story,
[24:50.320 --> 24:53.640]  for violations of Texas campaign finance laws.
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.520]  He got a conviction, but that conviction was overturned.
[24:57.520 --> 25:05.440]  Now we have Rosemary Lindbergh, who even though she had this egregious incident as a drunken
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.960]  driver, as she was three times the legal limit, she was given 45 days in jail, only served
[25:09.960 --> 25:10.960]  half that time.
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.200]  Her license was suspended for six months.
[25:14.200 --> 25:18.680]  And as a person in charge of the public integrity unit, Rick Perry wanted her to step down.
[25:18.680 --> 25:23.200]  But instead of doing that, she is fighting back.
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.760]  They got an indictment against Rick Perry, charging him with coercion and abuse of office
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.000]  because he vetoed the funding for that organization.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  Now there are things that they could come after Rick Perry for probably like the Gardasil
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.240]  connection.
[25:39.240 --> 25:44.680]  We've talked about that many times, how they were trying to make it mandatory in the schools
[25:44.680 --> 25:46.600]  for all the children to have Gardasil.
[25:46.600 --> 25:50.920]  And of course, there were ethical connections to people who had been on Rick Perry's staff
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.880]  that now worked for the company that made Gardasil an egregious civil liberties violation
[25:56.880 --> 25:59.160]  and one where you could make some connections.
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.760]  But of course, that wasn't investigated by their office.
[26:01.760 --> 26:02.760]  No, that wasn't investigated.
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.720]  And then of course, you have the situations where the Clintons are collecting hundreds
[26:07.720 --> 26:12.360]  of millions of dollars in speeches, typically getting a quarter of a million dollars for
[26:12.360 --> 26:13.360]  each speech.
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.880]  And of course, there was an article in the Las Vegas Review that just came out said,
[26:17.880 --> 26:23.000]  high fashion and expense for Hillary travel, I guess you could file this under the Devil
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  Wears Prada.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.560]  They say she insists on staying in presidential suites of luxury hotels whenever she speaks,
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.560]  including when she's coming to Las Vegas, she usually requires those who pay her six
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.320]  figure fees for speeches to also provide a private jet for transportation.
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.560]  Only a $39 million, 16 passenger Gulfstream or larger will do.
[26:44.560 --> 26:48.160]  And then of course, she makes demands about how she will stay at the event no longer than
[26:48.160 --> 26:49.160]  90 minutes.
[26:49.160 --> 26:52.680]  She will pose for no more than 50 photos with no more than 100 people.
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.080]  She won't allow any press coverage or video or audio taping of her speech.
[26:57.080 --> 27:01.760]  The only record will be by a stenographer whose transcription will be given only to
[27:01.760 --> 27:03.440]  Mrs. Clinton.
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.360]  And the stenographer's $1,250 bill, of course, will go to the University of Las Vegas in
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.080]  this particular incident where she's getting paid a quarter of a million dollars to speak
[27:14.080 --> 27:15.400]  to them.
[27:15.400 --> 27:20.020]  This is an event where she's getting paid a quarter of a million dollars and they have
[27:20.020 --> 27:24.680]  many corporations who are paying for $20,000 tables.
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.520]  Corporations like Bank of America, Barnes & Noble, Barrick Gold, Wells Fargo, that type
[27:29.520 --> 27:30.920]  of thing.
[27:30.920 --> 27:37.500]  When you see these kind of extravagant speakers fees, when you see these extravagant prices
[27:37.500 --> 27:43.080]  being paid for people to get close to them, this is nothing but money laundering of political
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.960]  influence.
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.520]  It is a kind of corruption that ought to be truly investigated.
[27:48.520 --> 27:56.000]  Instead, they're charging Rick Perry with felony violations because he tried to get this drunken
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.640]  DA to stand down from being ahead of the public integrity office.
[28:01.640 --> 28:02.640]  That's amazing.
[28:02.640 --> 28:03.640]  That's where we are.
[28:03.640 --> 28:09.640]  Instead of having any integrity, they come after the people who try to stop some of it.
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.120]  And again, like I said, Rick Perry is not somebody that I agree with on everything.
[28:13.120 --> 28:16.480]  On many issues, I have a lot of disagreements with Rick Perry.
[28:16.480 --> 28:21.520]  And I think there may be some ethical issues, but it certainly isn't this one.
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.320]  Let's go now to our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri.
[28:25.320 --> 28:27.720]  They're covering what's happening there.
[28:27.720 --> 28:30.680]  And there were some incidents last night, of course.
[28:30.680 --> 28:34.920]  There was a curfew imposed, and we're going to be doing that in the very next segment
[28:34.920 --> 28:36.440]  as we come back.
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.680]  There was more tear-gassing of protesters, as well as our reporters who were standing
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.680]  with the protesters.
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.880]  They were not in the sequestered area that the mainstream media was reporting on.
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.560]  And so there's a very different perspective from the mainstream media and what our reporters
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.680]  saw behind the lines with the protesters exercising their First Amendment rights.
[28:55.680 --> 28:56.680]  We'll be right back.
[28:56.680 --> 28:57.680]  Stay with us.
[28:57.680 --> 29:03.920]  The City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[29:03.920 --> 29:05.320]  I taste dirt in it.
[29:05.320 --> 29:06.640]  God knows what's in this.
[29:06.640 --> 29:10.760]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.080]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.080]  system.
[29:17.080 --> 29:18.080]  Now my nose is better.
[29:18.080 --> 29:19.080]  Tastes like nothing.
[29:19.080 --> 29:20.480]  Yep, I know what a good water tastes like.
[29:20.480 --> 29:21.480]  It's good water.
[29:21.480 --> 29:27.320]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.160]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues,
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.960]  including tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[29:33.960 --> 29:36.960]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're giving tap water.
[29:36.960 --> 29:42.880]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[29:42.880 --> 29:44.880]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[29:44.880 --> 29:45.880]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[29:45.880 --> 29:46.880]  It's good water.
[29:46.880 --> 29:47.880]  Refreshing.
[29:47.880 --> 29:48.880]  It's good.

[32:23.480 --> 32:26.800]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[32:26.800 --> 32:29.120]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.

[33:21.920 --> 33:31.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:31.720 --> 33:32.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:32.720 --> 33:37.520]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and we're joined now by Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.080]  Jakari Jackson reporting from Ferguson, Missouri, where last night there were more tear gassing
[33:43.080 --> 33:44.160]  of protesters.
[33:44.160 --> 33:45.840]  They imposed a curfew.
[33:45.840 --> 33:51.480]  As the curfew passed, they began shooting what the AP and KMOV reported.
[33:51.480 --> 33:56.920]  They're locally saying that there was multiple smoke canisters and at least one tear gas
[33:56.920 --> 33:58.680]  canister into the crowd.
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.680]  At least one.
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.800]  Well, I don't think that's what our reporters experienced there, is that what you experienced,
[34:03.800 --> 34:04.800]  Joe?
[34:04.800 --> 34:05.800]  Negative, David.
[34:05.800 --> 34:06.800]  Joe Biggs here.
[34:06.800 --> 34:11.480]  We're right outside of Ferguson in St. Louis, infowars.com.
[34:11.480 --> 34:18.240]  Last night, I have never been so angry to go through what I went through and then come
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.760]  out and have everyone back there, people across America, even in Australia, Ireland,
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.080]  texting me, writing me saying, hey, CNN, Fox News, all these people are saying that tear
[34:28.080 --> 34:31.360]  gas wasn't shot, none of this stuff happened.
[34:31.360 --> 34:36.880]  I'm telling you right now, those guys, like sheep, sat in their little holding pens and
[34:36.880 --> 34:40.280]  were afraid to go on and actually report on what was really going on.
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.000]  Jakari, Josh, and I got out there, went on the front lines, left that little media holding
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.360]  area and reported in a live stream from that area.
[34:49.360 --> 34:54.040]  There was not one tear gas canister thrown.
[34:54.040 --> 34:55.120]  There were multiple.
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.400]  I would say probably up to 20 to 30.
[34:58.400 --> 35:03.080]  What also the mainstream media is saying right now, too, is that gunshots were fired
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.320]  and that's what inside of the police officers had come and assaulted the protesters.
[35:08.320 --> 35:10.560]  That's complete and total BS.
[35:10.560 --> 35:11.560]  That is not it.
[35:11.560 --> 35:13.120]  Well, people can see you're alive and-
[35:13.120 --> 35:14.120]  It angers me.
[35:14.120 --> 35:15.120]  It boils in my blood.
[35:15.120 --> 35:16.120]  Like now, I have goosebumps.
[35:16.120 --> 35:17.600]  I can feel them coming up right now.
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.400]  I do not like this because I was sitting out there.
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.440]  They were shooting gas canisters at us, flash bangs going off.
[35:23.440 --> 35:25.320]  I heard gunshots from the police first.
[35:25.320 --> 35:30.520]  Then I heard gunshots from the protest side and then I saw a guy hit the ground and they
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.240]  grabbed him and picked him up and moved him out of there.
[35:34.240 --> 35:39.200]  It was complete and total chaos and it was the same guys who were here Wednesday night
[35:39.200 --> 35:41.520]  when everything hit the fan.
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.680]  We were told that these guys would be pulled out.
[35:43.680 --> 35:47.680]  They would not be put back out here on the streets again and the state troopers left
[35:47.680 --> 35:48.880]  last night, David.
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.400]  They were pulled out and they brought in the same thugs, the same militarized police force
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.000]  that was here Wednesday night and they let them come out here and run the whole thing.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.520]  Well, let's talk about what the media is covering about this first because we've got a report
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.280]  up on Infowars.com showing you guys they're live, showing what happened as you guys were
[36:06.280 --> 36:07.280]  reporting it.
[36:07.280 --> 36:09.120]  You were live streaming what was going on.
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.320]  You were not, as you pointed out, back in the holding area.
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.520]  We've got some video showing what the holding area was.
[36:14.520 --> 36:18.560]  They had most of the media was back in a covered area, back behind the police.
[36:18.560 --> 36:21.200]  You can see it if you're watching this broadcast right now.
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.920]  They're standing there and they're reporting that at some point they say, well, we hear
[36:24.920 --> 36:26.800]  some explosions for their out there.
[36:26.800 --> 36:29.520]  Not exactly sure what's going on because they're about a mile away.
[36:29.520 --> 36:32.680]  So they're relying on the police to tell them what's going on.
[36:32.680 --> 36:38.040]  And then we have this report showing how CNN initially reported that there was tear gas
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.480]  and then they walked it back when the police came up to them and said, no, no, no, it wasn't
[36:42.480 --> 36:43.480]  tear gas.
[36:43.480 --> 36:44.640]  It was smoke.
[36:44.640 --> 36:50.640]  And then we even have a Twitter feed from someone named Matt Ford who shows a riot CS
[36:50.640 --> 36:51.640]  smoke projectile.
[36:51.640 --> 36:57.000]  He's got the actual picture of it and he says, CS smoke is tear gas.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.160]  That's what they were shooting at people today.
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.520]  What they're saying, I hear on CNN, they're actually saying that they fired smoke, then
[37:04.520 --> 37:05.520]  tear gas.
[37:05.520 --> 37:08.200]  So CNN is shifting their story around constantly.
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.160]  But what you guys experienced right away was tear gas.
[37:11.160 --> 37:17.320]  People can see Jakari smoking and coughing and gagging on the tear gas there as he's
[37:17.320 --> 37:19.480]  trying to report that as you guys were live streaming.
[37:19.480 --> 37:23.200]  Well, I'm going to tell you why CNN changed their story, David.
[37:23.200 --> 37:26.440]  And that's a little part of my, on my side.
[37:26.440 --> 37:31.640]  When the police were chasing us in their M-Raps down the road with sniper rifle dots on us,
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.480]  I had to run about five miles out of the town, come around and then come back to my vehicle.
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.360]  And that last mile that I was heading in do sent me a picture, a screenshot of CNN saying
[37:42.360 --> 37:44.640]  that they're only shooting smoke.
[37:44.640 --> 37:50.000]  And I was so angry, I swear, that I had so much motivation that last mile that the only
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.880]  thing that was on my mind was to find that guy reporting live at CNN.
[37:53.880 --> 37:56.200]  And I tell you, I did this last night.
[37:56.200 --> 37:59.160]  I went in front of all those cameras and I said, you're a coward.
[37:59.160 --> 38:00.880]  You guys are the coward news network.
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.360]  You wouldn't even get out of this holding area and you're lying to the American people
[38:04.360 --> 38:06.160]  saying that the tear gas wasn't fired.
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.200]  You need to go out and do your job, go back to school and learn how to be a real journalist.
[38:10.200 --> 38:12.840]  Because what you're doing is you're deceiving the American people.
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.080]  You're lying and everything you do is crap.
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.320]  And everyone's looking at me like, oh my God, you know what's going on?
[38:18.320 --> 38:19.320]  They actually shot tear gas.
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.360]  I'm like, do you see my eyes swelling up?
[38:21.360 --> 38:22.520]  You think I'm lying?
[38:22.520 --> 38:24.040]  Does smoke do that?
[38:24.040 --> 38:25.520]  This is CS gas.
[38:25.520 --> 38:29.160]  David, CS gas is banned by military use in other countries.
[38:29.160 --> 38:30.600]  We can't use it over there.
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.800]  The military, I can't go to Iraq or Afghanistan and shoot CS gas on combatants at all because
[38:35.800 --> 38:36.800]  it's dangerous.
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.960]  But why can our police use it on citizens in Ferguson, Missouri?
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.480]  Exactly, like hollow point bullets that Homeland Security has bought 2 billion of.
[38:45.480 --> 38:48.640]  Those are banned for use by the military because they're anti-personnel.
[38:48.640 --> 38:53.760]  Well, Joe, what I want to talk about is the fact that they imposed this curfew.
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.840]  Like you said, it was the same guys that were going to tell everybody that they're going
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.240]  to now play nice and they're going to all get along with each other.
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.520]  And instead, they start drawing these arbitrary lines, trying to make sure that people are
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.120]  going to cross over those lines.
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.480]  And Jakari interviewed the fellow that's now in charge, that was put in charge after they
[39:11.480 --> 39:17.760]  took the county sheriff's department out of control there, supposedly, when he asked them
[39:17.760 --> 39:20.800]  what they were going to do if people violated the curfew.
[39:20.800 --> 39:21.800]  He wouldn't say.
[39:21.800 --> 39:25.440]  But there was a lady there who said, you've got a 12 o'clock curfew here.
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.280]  But in the surrounding communities, they put in a 10 o'clock curfew.
[39:28.280 --> 39:31.520]  So basically, they were kettling everybody by curfews in there.
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.120]  And it bothers me that they would make the First Amendment right to protest, that they
[39:36.120 --> 39:39.840]  would constrict that to areas, as we saw in Nevada.
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.760]  But they're now constricting it, of course, to time, saying that you can't protest beyond
[39:44.760 --> 39:45.840]  a certain time.
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.880]  If people are peacefully protesting, I don't think there should be a time limit on it.
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.520]  I don't think they should be able to cordon off areas and say, this is your First Amendment
[39:54.520 --> 39:55.520]  area.
[39:55.520 --> 39:57.600]  This is your free speech zone.
[39:57.600 --> 39:58.880]  That's not free speech.
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.400]  And when the media voluntarily does that and retires themself back to the lines behind
[40:03.400 --> 40:07.280]  the police, stays within their little confined areas, we're not going to see the truth.
[40:07.280 --> 40:09.680]  That's why InfoWars is there with our reporters.
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.680]  Well, yeah, I went and asked one of the police officers, I said, hey, where can I actually
[40:14.680 --> 40:15.680]  be?
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.320]  And he said, oh, you can be in this little spot over here in the gas station, the liquor
[40:19.320 --> 40:23.120]  store where Mike Brown supposedly had robbed it before he got killed.
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.120]  I said, OK.
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.960]  I said, so once the 12 o'clock curfew is set in, am I allowed to go out?
[40:28.960 --> 40:30.800]  They're like, no, if you go out here, you're subject to arrest.
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.400]  I'm like, well, that doesn't make sense.
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.880]  I was like, our job is to report on both sides of what's going on.
[40:35.880 --> 40:38.160]  So you're telling me I can't be there.
[40:38.160 --> 40:40.160]  And then multiple media sources came around.
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.560]  They were watching, filming, saying, oh, what did he just say?
[40:42.560 --> 40:46.360]  He's like, are they telling you that we are limited as to what we can see?
[40:46.360 --> 40:47.360]  I'm like, yes.
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.640]  And then they were giving disinformation to CNN and Fox News and all these guys sitting
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.640]  over there saying, oh, we're just shooting smoke.
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.160]  Just go ahead and report on that.
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.320]  Never mind the guys out there that are screaming and throwing up in the streets and pure chaos
[41:00.320 --> 41:01.680]  like it's a war zone.
[41:01.680 --> 41:02.680]  It was crap.
[41:02.680 --> 41:05.920]  And over the course of the week, there were three different types of people there, David.
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.120]  There were the peaceful protesters who were mourning the loss of someone in their community.
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.840]  Then you had the human right activists, the ones who said, hey, we're not going to stand
[41:13.840 --> 41:15.280]  up to a corrupt government.
[41:15.280 --> 41:17.000]  They can't tell us when we can go home.
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.960]  And then you had the crazy people from outside of town, the looters, the ones who were using
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.080]  a tragic incident as a way to unleash anger.
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.040]  They've had pent up for years and destroy a community they cared nothing about.
[41:29.040 --> 41:30.040]  We walked up.
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.600]  We were filming a bus stop area where glass was shattered, where I'd watched the live feed
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.800]  the night before where two guys were throwing a trash can against it until it busted and
[41:38.800 --> 41:39.800]  collapsed.
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.040]  And there was a guy there from Compton and we said, hey, what do you think about what's
[41:42.040 --> 41:43.040]  going on?
[41:43.040 --> 41:44.040]  He's like, I don't care.
[41:44.040 --> 41:45.040]  Let Ferguson burn.
[41:45.040 --> 41:46.040]  He's like, let it burn down.
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.040]  He's like, it's not my town.
[41:47.040 --> 41:48.040]  I don't care.
[41:48.040 --> 41:50.200]  So there are people from the outside of the community who don't care.
[41:50.200 --> 41:52.600]  They're the ones who are causing all the chaos out there.
[41:52.600 --> 41:56.920]  The people who live there for the most part wanted a peaceful resolution and you get those
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.440]  bad apples who come out there and start throwing bottles, start throwing Molotov cocktails
[42:01.440 --> 42:07.480]  and they're inciting violence by the police, helping our government say, hey, guess what?
[42:07.480 --> 42:08.800]  You need curfews.
[42:08.800 --> 42:10.080]  You need a police state.
[42:10.080 --> 42:11.080]  Hello, Obama.
[42:11.080 --> 42:12.840]  Oh, we need all this.
[42:12.840 --> 42:13.840]  It's ridiculous.
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.480]  Yes, they use that as a beard.
[42:15.480 --> 42:18.960]  You know, I saw on Fox News, a pretty amazing segment.
[42:18.960 --> 42:22.840]  You had Mike Huckabee talking about militarization of the police.
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.000]  Finally, I'm glad that he's finally talking about it.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.760]  But as he's talking about it, Fox News starts running b-roll behind him of looters, essentially
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.440]  undermining everything he's saying about not being confrontational, not militarizing
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.920]  the police, not coming out there in army uniforms to come at people.
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.280]  As he's saying that, they're showing visually just the opposite to try to move that dialogue
[42:47.280 --> 42:49.400]  along, that we need more police.
[42:49.400 --> 42:50.920]  We need the police to be militarized.
[42:50.920 --> 42:53.240]  We have a real threat we need to be protected from.
[42:53.240 --> 42:54.240]  Stay with us.
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.240]  We're going to be right back on.
[42:55.240 --> 42:56.240]  I know you've got to go.
[42:56.240 --> 42:58.920]  I'm going to keep you for just about another five minutes if you can stay, Joe.
[42:58.920 --> 42:59.920]  Stay with us.
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.560]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and
[43:05.560 --> 43:07.800]  sown American-made jeans.
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.360]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset

[43:26.640 --> 43:30.000]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jean Company.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.680]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.040]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[43:38.040 --> 43:39.680]  Can you put two and two together?
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.040]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.640]  It is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[43:47.640 --> 43:48.720]  But for how long?
[43:48.720 --> 43:55.720]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.520]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.920]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[44:04.920 --> 44:09.160]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[44:09.160 --> 44:13.040]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.920]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[44:17.920 --> 44:19.480]  chemicals within their homes.
[44:19.480 --> 44:22.880]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[44:22.880 --> 44:26.880]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[44:26.880 --> 44:30.360]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[44:30.360 --> 44:31.360]  to as well.
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.520]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.520]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[44:40.520 --> 44:45.800]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[44:45.800 --> 44:50.200]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[44:50.200 --> 44:52.320]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[44:52.320 --> 44:59.320]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.320]  This is Scotys John for InfoWars.com.
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.080]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, Eugenics
[45:06.080 --> 45:08.440]  and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[45:08.440 --> 45:11.040]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[45:11.040 --> 45:12.920]  If not, then I want to know why.
[45:12.920 --> 45:15.440]  Oh I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[45:15.440 --> 45:18.440]  They might call you names or they just want to talk about sports.
[45:18.440 --> 45:19.440]  They're so poppers.
[45:19.440 --> 45:20.440]  I say so what?
[45:20.440 --> 45:23.320]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.720]  The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.960]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.880]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[45:34.880 --> 45:35.880]  years.
[45:35.880 --> 45:36.880]  And I'm still fighting.
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.000]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.880]  The InfoWars is worldwide.
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.160]  Tell your friends about InfoWars and let them know that InfoWars doesn't print bull.
[45:46.160 --> 45:50.000]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[45:50.000 --> 45:57.080]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[45:57.080 --> 45:59.200]  The truth will set them free.
[45:59.200 --> 46:02.760]  I began to get into Iodon a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[46:02.760 --> 46:05.640]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.480]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[46:10.480 --> 46:14.800]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.360]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[46:23.360 --> 46:27.240]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[46:27.240 --> 46:30.880]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.280]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.120]  Everything else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:40.120 --> 46:45.000]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.680]  TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.040]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:01.040 --> 47:04.720]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:04.720 --> 47:18.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.560]  It's always a tough quote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[47:22.560 --> 47:25.040]  mean that we're running up our debt.
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.640]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase
[47:29.640 --> 47:30.640]  our debt.
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.000]  It does not somehow promote proflicacy.
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  All it does is it sets.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  You've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, coppers.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.440]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and we have in Ferguson, Missouri, the InfoWars crew and
[47:54.440 --> 47:56.040]  they have just a few minutes to spend with us.
[47:56.040 --> 47:58.320]  I want to get right back to Jacarie Jackson.
[47:58.320 --> 48:00.960]  We were just talking to Joe Biggs who was reporting from there.
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.960]  I wanted to get Jacarie's perspective last night because it was Jacarie's video that
[48:04.960 --> 48:07.840]  I saw as well as Joe Biggs.
[48:07.840 --> 48:12.880]  They were both getting attacked by the police there as they were standing out where the
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.320]  demonstrators were, where the peaceful demonstrators were standing, and they were tear gassed.
[48:17.320 --> 48:22.400]  Although the media reported that it was simply smoked because the media was standing probably
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.080]  about a mile away with the police and just relying on police reports, Jacarie.
[48:28.080 --> 48:34.040]  What are your feelings about this today as you see the disparity between what you experienced
[48:34.040 --> 48:36.760]  and what you see the media saying?
[48:36.760 --> 48:39.240]  Jacarie Jackson reporting from the St. Louis area.
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.800]  You're exactly right, David, and I have to echo just what you said talking about how
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.600]  the media is just pretty much regurgitating what they're being told by the police, whether
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.520]  it was how the police officers were helping the Huffington Post or even not the Huffington
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.880]  Post Al Jazeera when they were shooting rubber bullets and also smoke canisters at them.
[48:56.880 --> 48:59.760]  They said, oh, we're just helping them out, and they thanked them for that situation.
[48:59.760 --> 49:02.560]  And you guys saw the interview, that was not the case at all.
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.280]  And also last night, oh, that's not tear gas.
[49:06.280 --> 49:07.680]  Those are smoke grenades.
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.480]  Now maybe we're playing a semantic game here, David, just like we heard in the Christopher
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.640]  Dorner situation, flash bangs or burners, maybe they call smoke grenades something else.
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.080]  But whatever they fired in that first wave did contain tear gas.
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.360]  It was not just a visual deterrent, those first few canisters that hit the ground.
[49:26.360 --> 49:27.800]  I was close to one.
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.000]  And you guys saw that video, man, I was sniffing and snotting, and I couldn't even breathe.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.240]  We had the gas mask on, but mine wasn't tight enough at the time to really help me get through
[49:36.240 --> 49:37.240]  that situation.
[49:37.240 --> 49:38.240]  It was burning my eyes.
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.920]  It's a very dangerous substance, just like Joe Biggs said, you can't use this against
[49:42.920 --> 49:44.120]  a foreign combatant.
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.000]  So why would you use this against American citizens in the United States of America?
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.640]  Most of whom were peaceful.
[49:49.640 --> 49:52.480]  We were in that crowd that they said the gentleman had the gun.
[49:52.480 --> 49:54.080]  I did not personally witness that.
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.520]  Yes, there were hotheads out there making threats towards the police.
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.000]  After police, you know, somebody said, you know, you shoot us, we'll shoot back.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.680]  All that rhetoric was going on, but I did not personally see somebody with the gun.
[50:04.680 --> 50:09.320]  But I did see somebody fall down after hearing a gunshot, which more than likely did probably
[50:09.320 --> 50:12.600]  come from somebody in the protestor area.
[50:12.600 --> 50:16.200]  But the police are saying that they fired the smoke canisters after that event.
[50:16.200 --> 50:17.200]  That is not the case.
[50:17.200 --> 50:19.360]  You know, people were standing in the streets slowly.
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.760]  Yes, they were slowly advancing towards to where the police were, where they had a line
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.160]  all the way across the streets.
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.040]  But the police shot the smoke canisters before the shots were fired from the crowd.
[50:30.040 --> 50:33.960]  It looked like they were, you guys were getting rubber bullets fired at you as well.
[50:33.960 --> 50:37.240]  Yeah, they were, they were shooting something I didn't get hit by one and it looks like
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.680]  some things were skidding across the ground more than likely rubber bullets.
[50:41.680 --> 50:45.720]  So you know, they were definitely willing to show their heavy hand at squashing this
[50:45.720 --> 50:50.000]  protest of largely peaceful protesters and had a chance to talk to one of the officers
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  off camera.
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.120]  And he said, yeah, you know, you have a 95, hang on, Jukari, John Bowne just put up a clip
[50:57.120 --> 50:58.640]  here for people that are watching.
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.640]  There was a Huffington Post reporter and he took a picture of some earplugs, you know,
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.280]  how soft earplugs are and he says, I need to get confirmation.
[51:06.280 --> 51:08.080]  I think I found some rubber bullets.
[51:08.080 --> 51:12.000]  I don't think those things would hurt anybody if they could actually shoot those rubber
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  bullets.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.960]  You know, I'm not going to get on the guy too bad.
[51:15.960 --> 51:22.800]  I guess he's never been to a situation where he had had encountered earplugs before.
[51:22.800 --> 51:24.880]  But no, those were not rubber bullets at all.
[51:24.880 --> 51:25.880]  We had some.
[51:25.880 --> 51:26.880]  Yeah.
[51:26.880 --> 51:27.880]  One of them hit Joe Biggs.
[51:27.880 --> 51:30.880]  If he's there, he can show us how that bruise is expanding out.
[51:30.880 --> 51:32.320]  They don't see your bruise.
[51:32.320 --> 51:33.320]  Come on.
[51:33.320 --> 51:34.320]  Come on in, Joe.
[51:34.320 --> 51:36.520]  And Joe, I guess you want to make a comment about the rubber bullets.
[51:36.520 --> 51:37.520]  Man.
[51:37.520 --> 51:38.520]  I'll tell you right now.
[51:38.520 --> 51:43.280]  I saw the guy in the hotel this morning and I said, oh, those were the rubber bullets
[51:43.280 --> 51:44.280]  fired, huh?
[51:44.280 --> 51:45.280]  And he goes, yeah, yeah.
[51:45.280 --> 51:46.280]  And I was like, yeah.
[51:46.280 --> 51:47.280]  Those are earplugs.
[51:47.280 --> 51:50.120]  And I was like, you're a correspondent.
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.480]  You're on the streets kind of journalist guy.
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.720]  I was like, yeah, you might need to learn the difference between earplugs and rubber
[51:56.720 --> 51:57.720]  bullets.
[51:57.720 --> 51:58.720]  Well, he's Huffington Post.
[51:58.720 --> 52:00.720]  They don't really understand what an assault rifle is.
[52:00.720 --> 52:03.280]  They've never had a definition of an assault rifle, so they can't tell the difference between
[52:03.280 --> 52:04.280]  earplugs and rubber bullets either.
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.520]  A lot of these guys were in the free speech zone and we were there for a little while
[52:08.520 --> 52:11.720]  until we realized that, you know, all the stuff was going on down the street.
[52:11.720 --> 52:15.360]  So we moved out of the free speech zone, a couple activists, local activists went with
[52:15.360 --> 52:19.480]  us as well, because people are not only there mourning the death of Mike Brown.
[52:19.480 --> 52:23.800]  He also had just a First Amendment activist who came out there to exercise their rights
[52:23.800 --> 52:24.800]  as well.
[52:24.800 --> 52:26.160]  And I understand that 100%.
[52:26.160 --> 52:30.120]  You know, it's, you know, as much as people want justice for Mike Brown, I can understand
[52:30.120 --> 52:33.720]  that, you know, also want people, you also have people out there who want to be able
[52:33.720 --> 52:34.720]  to just walk down the street.
[52:34.720 --> 52:37.120]  They don't want to have to sacrifice one or the other.
[52:37.120 --> 52:39.560]  We can have our free speech or our right to assemble.
[52:39.560 --> 52:41.920]  We want them both and we want them at all times.
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.920]  And like I said, that was probably the smallest crowd we've seen out there at any time of
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.440]  the day since we've been here.
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.760]  You know, it was probably just a couple hundred people right before the curfew went in effect
[52:51.760 --> 52:56.680]  and then you had maybe 200 or so when it actually hit the fan.
[52:56.680 --> 52:59.080]  But you know, you wouldn't know that from watching the mainstream media because they
[52:59.080 --> 53:03.400]  were comfortably in the free speech zone, zooming in with those super long lenses.
[53:03.400 --> 53:07.000]  You know, we were right there in the thick of it, getting smoked, getting hit by the
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  smoke.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.080]  You know, me and Joe Biggs through a neighborhood once again chased by the police.
[53:11.080 --> 53:13.640]  I've only ran from the police twice in my lifetime.
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.560]  David and both times were on this trip while they were shooting at me and chasing me with
[53:17.560 --> 53:18.560]  MRAP trucks.
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.920]  Well, you guys have been in the thick of it.
[53:20.920 --> 53:22.480]  Thank you for getting the story.
[53:22.480 --> 53:23.960]  You've done a great job.
[53:23.960 --> 53:25.680]  I know you've got to get going.
[53:25.680 --> 53:30.920]  It's been very dangerous there for everyone, not just you, but as a sad condition, a sad
[53:30.920 --> 53:36.600]  commentary on our country when the police are attacking peaceful protesters who are exercising
[53:36.600 --> 53:40.440]  their First Amendment rights and when they are attacking the press and trying to constrain
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.440]  the press.
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.800]  To me, that is a real story.
[53:42.800 --> 53:46.600]  We've got some conflicting eyewitness reports that are coming out about what happened in
[53:46.600 --> 53:49.320]  the initial shooting that started all of this.
[53:49.320 --> 53:52.820]  And that's going to work its way out in the courts, hopefully.
[53:52.820 --> 53:54.720]  Hopefully we'll have a quick resolution of that.
[53:54.720 --> 53:59.360]  But I think the real story is the way the police have reacted, the way they have shut
[53:59.360 --> 54:04.080]  down free speech, the way they have attacked the press, especially those Al Jazeera shots.
[54:04.080 --> 54:09.440]  When you had some great shots from behind, everybody saw those iconic photos from the
[54:09.440 --> 54:14.240]  side that you had, actually the audio from behind as they were being fired upon, another
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.680]  perspective that was a very useful perspective, a great interview that you had with the Al
[54:17.680 --> 54:18.680]  Jazeera reporter.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.680]  Well, thank you, guys.
[54:19.680 --> 54:21.040]  I'll let you get going.
[54:21.040 --> 54:22.920]  Thanks for keeping us updated on that.
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.920]  Stay safe.
[54:23.920 --> 54:24.920]  Thank you, David.
[54:24.920 --> 54:25.920]  All right.
[54:25.920 --> 54:28.440]  Well, there's been a lot of news today in Ferguson.
[54:28.440 --> 54:32.320]  Of course, the governor of Missouri, Governor Nixon, has been making the Sunday news show
[54:32.320 --> 54:36.480]  rounds he was on this week, as well as Meet the Press.
[54:36.480 --> 54:39.560]  And he's telling the prosecutor that he needs to step up and do his job.
[54:39.560 --> 54:45.320]  And I think that's a real important thing for them to quickly expedite this trial, this
[54:45.320 --> 54:46.880]  hearing, to show the evidence.
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.080]  I think one of the things that concerns people so much is, of course, the past history.
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.840]  There's always in a police department, if you have situations in the past where there's
[54:55.840 --> 54:59.760]  been some egregious behavior by the police that hasn't been thoroughly investigated.
[54:59.760 --> 55:01.320]  Of course, that is the case here.
[55:01.320 --> 55:04.720]  We see in some history of the Ferguson police force.
[55:04.720 --> 55:10.480]  But if they could only bring this up quickly, they confiscated eyewitnesses' accounts.
[55:10.480 --> 55:15.400]  They confiscated their video and audio recordings of what had happened.
[55:15.400 --> 55:16.920]  We want to see that evidence.
[55:16.920 --> 55:20.680]  Now, the district attorney is saying that he's going to bring this before the grand jury
[55:20.680 --> 55:21.680]  in just days.
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.960]  But a lot of people there are not happy about the district attorney himself.
[55:26.960 --> 55:32.640]  Twenty thousand people have signed a petition drive for a special prosecutor as opposed
[55:32.640 --> 55:36.440]  to having the prosecutor that's there, Mr. McCullough.
[55:36.440 --> 55:38.520]  This is the post-dispatch in St. Louis.
[55:38.520 --> 55:44.000]  They said they reviewed the previously secret grand jury tapes in a previous case and found
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.440]  in this previous case that his public statements were untrue.
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.640]  This is a situation where a couple of detectives killed a suspect in a passenger car.
[55:52.640 --> 55:55.400]  They said that he was moving the car towards him.
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.800]  However, when they eventually got to the grand jury tapes, because grand jury tapes when
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.840]  they indict people are secret, what they found was that only three of the 13 detectives
[56:04.840 --> 56:09.480]  who testified said that the car had moved forward in the direction of the two officers
[56:09.480 --> 56:12.760]  who shot the man and his passenger.
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.160]  Two of those three who said it was moving forward were the ones who were doing the shooting.
[56:17.160 --> 56:22.800]  The third who said it was moving forward was a detective that McCullough later said considered
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.040]  charging with perjury because his account was so at odds with the facts.
[56:27.040 --> 56:32.680]  So you've got this St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, Bob McCullough, who has presided
[56:32.680 --> 56:35.760]  over this case that a lot of people were very concerned about.
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.600]  It looked like he was supporting the perjury of these two cops.
[56:40.600 --> 56:48.520]  They say that they even had a national forensic expert who came there and examined the car
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.520]  and found that the car was actually in reverse so it couldn't be going towards them.
[56:53.520 --> 56:58.920]  And we also learned on Friday that even though they released these tapes showing that Michael
[56:58.920 --> 57:06.000]  Brown had been in an altercation in a supermarket and had possibly stolen a $50 box of cigars,
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.440]  the police chief then said on Friday, well, that wasn't why the officer had stopped him.
[57:10.440 --> 57:12.040]  It had nothing to do with it.
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.800]  And so the question remains, do we kill people for shoplifting $50 box of cigars?
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.080]  Do we kill people because they get into an altercation, a verbal altercation with the
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.960]  police in a road when the cop told him to get out of the road and he didn't get into
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.200]  the road, then they get into a verbal altercation, then a fight, and then as he's running away,
[57:29.200 --> 57:30.200]  he gets shot.
[57:30.200 --> 57:31.560]  That appears to be the case.
[57:31.560 --> 57:35.080]  We have some different eyewitness accounts that are surfacing and we're going to talk
[57:35.080 --> 57:37.360]  about those right after we come back.
[57:37.360 --> 57:42.520]  But it's fundamentally about the abridgment of free speech and the freedom of the press
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.320]  and the militarization of the police that we've been seeing in the process this week.
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.320]  Stay with us.
[57:50.320 --> 57:53.960]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water.
[57:53.960 --> 57:55.400]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.760]  God knows what's in this.
[57:56.760 --> 58:00.800]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[58:00.800 --> 58:06.200]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with the Cropure G2.0 filtration
[58:06.200 --> 58:07.200]  system.
[58:07.200 --> 58:08.200]  That one is better.
[58:08.200 --> 58:09.200]  Tastes like nothing.
[58:09.200 --> 58:10.560]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[58:10.560 --> 58:11.560]  It's good water.
[58:11.560 --> 58:17.400]  Tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[58:17.400 --> 58:21.560]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including
[58:21.560 --> 58:24.080]  tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[58:24.080 --> 58:27.080]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water.
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.960]  The Cropure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[58:32.960 --> 58:34.960]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[58:34.960 --> 58:36.440]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[58:36.440 --> 58:37.440]  Good water.
[58:37.440 --> 58:38.440]  Refreshing.
[58:38.440 --> 58:39.440]  It's good.

[59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.760]  Network.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.280]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, August 14th.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.880]  Alex Jones is coming up in the next segment with Max Kaiser.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.360]  We were just talking about what's going on in Ferguson, about how they're trying to get
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.640]  a different prosecuting attorney because the current prosecuting attorney has had some questionable
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.640]  mishandling, I would say, of a previous police shooting.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.400]  As I was just talking about, three officers testified that a car was moving towards two
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.640]  officers who fired and killed the people in the car, yet 13 officers testified.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.640]  None of the others said the car was moving forward.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.720]  They did find that the car was actually in reverse, out of the three who said that it
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720]  was moving forward.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.200]  Two of them were the ones who were doing the shooting.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.040]  And the third was later, as the prosecutor said, suspected of perjury and other things
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]  that he was saying.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.960]  So, there's been a troubled history there.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:13.280]  There's also an interesting case back in 2009 titled the day Ferguson cops were caught in
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]  a bloody lie.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280]  This is from the Daily Beast.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.720]  And they're talking about a guy who was essentially traveling through the area.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.480]  He was pulled by the police.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.680]  He had the same name as someone that they were looking for, but he had a different middle
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.000]  name, also a different social security number.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.360]  They arrested him, even though he was the wrong person.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.480]  They took him back to jail, and that's when the problem started.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.320]  As they were putting him in a jail cell, it was early in the morning, and he was asking
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.760]  for a mattress.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.080]  And they told him to get into the cell, and then they told him to get on the floor and
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080]  to cover himself.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.440]  And he said, I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.040]  Why are you guys doing this to me?
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.080]  They said, just lay on the ground.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.800]  At that point, all these officers started kicking and beating him, and what they wound
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:05.920]  up doing was charging this fellow for destruction of property because he bled on their uniforms.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.160]  You understand?
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.400]  They arrest this innocent black man who has a name that's similar, but they can't be bothered
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.640]  to check the middle name or the social security number.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.280]  They think that he's somebody else that they're looking for.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:24.560]  They arrest him, they beat him, and then they charge him with getting blood on their uniforms.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.160]  That's what people are concerned about.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:33.200]  What people are also concerned about is seeing the police double down as a militarized army
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.680]  coming against peaceful protesters who are upset because they believe that this Michael
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:45.000]  Brown last weekend was shot down as he didn't present a threat to the police at a point
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.880]  where he was no longer a threat to them.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.320]  Of course, we've seen multiple accounts of this coming out.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.080]  Some of the first reports came from a lady who had her video and audio that she recorded
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.600]  on her cell phone confiscated by the police.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.520]  What she said was that he was running away from the police with his hands in the air.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.560]  The police said that they had gotten into an altercation.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:11.240]  Of course, the altercation had nothing to do with the alleged shoplifting of a $50 box
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.200]  of cigars at a convenience store.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.240]  It was all about a verbal altercation that he got into with a police officer when he
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.440]  was told to get out of the road.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.200]  A struggle ensued as they began to arrest him.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.440]  A shot went off according to the police in his car, and then he ran away.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:34.240]  Now we have some information that has surfaced today from a video that was quite a long video,
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.320]  and nobody had noticed a conversation that was in the background.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.040]  It was someone who was shooting the fellow who was, at that point, dead.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.840]  Michael Brown was dead on the street.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.840]  And as they were filming it and talking about it, there was a conversation that appeared
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:55.540]  to sound as if one person had seen Michael Brown turn and run at the officer, in which
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.080]  case there would be some justification for him shooting him.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.560]  However, there has also surfaced another report, and this one is up on infowars.com,
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.000]  a Twitter exchange that happened at the time of the shooting, right immediately after the
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  shooting.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.080]  A couple of people are tweeting each other, and one of the guys said he was shot from
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.520]  behind, and the other guy says the first two were from behind.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.280]  The next five weren't because he turned around.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.760]  This illustrates why they need to take this to a trial very speedily.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.400]  There's no reason that this needs to take a very long time to resolve.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.320]  And there is no reason, when people are upset about this, that the police should resort
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.880]  and full out military confrontation mode against the demonstrators who are peaceful and against
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.240]  the press who is there to cover it.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.560]  That's what's been happening this week.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.240]  Now, stay with us right after the break.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.040]  We have Alex Jones and Max Kaiser.

[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.000]  continual coverage.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.200]  We're taking over for Leanne McAdoo, I am your host Max Kaiser, hello, I'm Alex Jones,
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.280]  and we are the info war.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.720]  No seriously I'm Alex Jones, that's Max Kaiser, he's here visiting us as he spends time between
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.840]  London and New York City, he's down here working on a documentary film, and I gotta say it Max,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.840]  thanks for coming on.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.840]  Pleasure.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:55.080]  I remember four years ago, five years ago when you first started promoting Bitcoin, you
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:00.480]  were early gotta get in, you said it was gonna become this really dominant cryptocurrency,
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:06.560]  and all these years later, it certainly has become that with WordPress.com, Overstock,
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:13.360]  Amazon, Target, CVS, Subway, Victoria's Secret, they're all accepting it, so now infowarstore.com
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.160]  is accepting it, and we're even using a company you're involved with, as well the BitPay,
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.520]  and it's been very, very successful, people are excited about it, I've had my questions
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.800]  about it, I didn't wanna be involved early, but the people have voted with their currencies
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:32.240]  going into Bitcoin, they've supported it, we now see houses selling for 1.6 million
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.240]  Bitcoins, it's becoming more and more successful, and as you said on my show five, six years
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.880]  ago, whatever it was, I guess 2009, so I guess that's about five years ago, that it would
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.080]  give the private central banks a run for the money with their fiat currencies.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:52.160]  Now we had a caller in overdrive at the end of the show today, and he was asking, what
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.520]  is your position in it, we want full disclosure on Max Kaiser, that was one question, the
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.440]  other one was, is it a currency, or really what is Bitcoin, and where do you seriously
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:07.240]  predict it will go, so Max Kaiser, five minutes on the Bitcoin revolution.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.520]  Well, as far as full disclosure goes, I've said from the beginning, going back to 2009,
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.800]  I've been a buyer of Bitcoin, I've been buying Bitcoin ever since, obviously when it was
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:23.080]  $3 of Bitcoin, I ended up buying a very large position, and I still hold, and I'm very
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.560]  happy I'm holding it, I haven't sold any of my Bitcoin except maybe a few here and there
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:34.360]  to do some retailing, but I think going forward, the price will continue to go higher, and
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.200]  what's driving the price of Bitcoin, in my opinion, are these financial crises, remember
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.720]  it was a $40 of Bitcoin when the banking crisis in Cyprus hit, and it suddenly jumped
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.920]  to $240, and that's really a great application for this crypto technology, is a store of
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.240]  value and safe haven, during an era, we live in now, of banking scandals and banking crises,
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.600]  I think the next major bank to collapse, you'll see Bitcoin trade above $1,000 again, and
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.400]  stay above $1,000, and I think it can trade a lot higher from there.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.280]  However, it can be used as a currency out, but it's also primarily, its utility is to
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.640]  send money overseas on the internet for virtually no cost, and a great example of that would
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.200]  be somebody's trying to send a relative, let's say they're working in Britain, and they want
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.960]  to send 100 pounds to Africa, well if they go to an established money wire transfer service
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.720]  like Western Union to send 100 pounds, they're going to charge them up to 10 pounds, whereas
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.480]  if you're using Bitcoin to make that transaction, your cost will be virtually zero, and if for
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.680]  somebody on the other end of that transaction to save $10 on a transaction like that is
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.680]  very, very meaningful, because they don't make any money.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.840]  So we know why the big banks in Western Union are so angry about this, because I've noticed
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.600]  what things like Bitcoin coming in now, it's been driving down the rates, that in my opinion
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.720]  these loan sharking institutions are unable to charge anymore, so that really is something
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]  positive.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:06.760]  It's a pro competition, it's something new, and it makes all of these other entrenched
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:12.360]  oligopolies as we call them, stand up, take notice, and either lower their prices to compete
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.160]  or go out of business.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.600]  So we like competition, I'm pro competition, free markets and competition, Bitcoin is free
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.480]  market competition in the area of currencies, and it's being adopted around the world, BitPay
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.560]  as you mentioned is a company that was the first to offer Bitcoin transactions, they're
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.760]  signing up tens of thousands of merchants all over the world, hundreds of thousands
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.920]  of merchants accept it now, infowars accept it, and just to be clear, people can show
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.160]  up at your store, they can use Bitcoin to buy stuff, and you can instantaneously put
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.040]  that into dollars, you're not holding Bitcoin, you don't have to, you could be, you don't
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.960]  have to hold Bitcoin, you're just using it as a medium of exchange, and you're passing
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.360]  the savings on to your customers, so the customers that would be charged for the credit card
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.720]  transaction or some other means to use your store, those costs are being eliminated, they're
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:09.040]  being cut by 95% or more, that savings goes right into the pocket of people buying the
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.000]  t-shirts and everything else.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.240]  This is a true revolution, and even if Bitcoin itself isn't perfect and has some problems
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.520]  in my uninformed view, just as a novice looking at it from the outside, it is spurring a revolution
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.960]  of other cryptocurrencies, and now it's creating whole new economies around servicing it that
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.280]  is creating jobs, and I like to liken it to Uber that started around the same time as
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:42.640]  Bitcoin with the apps, and I'll hardly even get a cab in Austin to the airport, or if
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.480]  I got to pick my car up at the shop, because they usually show up 30, 40 minutes after
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.360]  they're supposed to, they're rude, I mean on average cabs are nightmares in Austin,
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.240]  they're better in some other cities I've been in, but when I use Uber, it's quick, it's
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:01.760]  clean, I can track the app in live time as they pull up to get me, and are the cabbies
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.320]  around the world trying in most cases to, if you can't beat them, join them with their
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320]  own apps and service?
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.800]  No, no, no, they're trying to shut it down, and I see a parallel between Uber and Bitcoin,
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.000]  and when I see the system trying to crush it and failing over and over again with these
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.320]  artificial crashes, but it bounces back up, that tells me more and more that Bitcoin really
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.360]  could be a winner, but regardless, we can't let them shoot down the idea of independent
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.200]  ways to exchange money and credit and currencies, so again, I salute you for being a trouble
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200]  laser, Max.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.960]  Well, I think the comparison to Uber is a good one, they did come around at about the
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.920]  same time, the words used in the technology space would be disintermediation or disruptive,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.400]  and in the case of Uber, they are going to put some cab drivers out of business, but
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.840]  you know, somebody said something I thought was very good, they said the reason the stone
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:59.000]  age ended is not because they ran out of stones, meaning that when technological advances
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.400]  come along, they tend to completely write over the current system with a new paradigm,
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.920]  a new system, or Uber's an example, and Bitcoin is another example, all the ways of doing
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:16.480]  business in the markets and in the banking sector are being reinvented and re-realized
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.760]  using cryptocurrencies, the open ledger, and there are other cryptocurrencies other than
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.600]  Bitcoin, Bitcoin has by far the biggest share of the market, but there are specific coins
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.560]  that do specific things, I created a new coin called Startcoin, which is specifically for
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.800]  my crowdfunding platform, StartJoin, it used to be very big in technology until 9-11 more
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.740]  or less wiped out my company, so I've been quiet in the technology space for a number
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:42.560]  of years, but now I'm back with something that I think is equally compelling as the
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.840]  stuff that I was doing in the 90s, crowdfunding meets cryptocurrency, we've got a fantastic
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.480]  project taking a stab at some of the mainstream media in America with a billboard campaign
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.400]  trying to raise $7,000 to take out a billboard that says, you know, Sean Hannity is an idiot,
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.520]  okay, it's not the most elegant campaign in the world, but it is a bit of fun, it's
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.000]  being crowdfunded, people are raising $5, $10.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.720]  I heard it got raised tens of thousands for potato salad.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.560]  Well in another crowdfunding company, somebody listed that they were looking to raise $10
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.200]  or something for a potato salad, but it caught fire as a meme on the internet and they raised
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:22.040]  $50,000, and that's what happens when you mix finance with the social networking and
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.720]  the meme potential or the viral aspect of the internet.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:31.320]  It's almost the opposite of the stagnation of the ruling technocrats throughout history,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.120]  it really introduces lightning into the whole equation.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.560]  That's my concern, I want to go to break, and I want to come back and talk about world
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:46.040]  events with Max Kaiser or MaxKaiser.com, I want to talk about what I see as more and
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.720]  more of an elite that believes they have a political system and believes they're in
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.200]  control found in this global corporate government, but if you look at what's really happening
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.440]  following the news closely every day, not just for mainstream news but alternative in
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:05.800]  different regions, it's a bunch of disconnected financial oligarchs who've bought off major
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:12.080]  governments and who aren't really aware militarily, economically, culturally what they're doing
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.880]  and that the whole world is lining up against them towards a giant crisis.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.600]  I want to see if you agree with that, I want you to augment that and expand and give us
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.080]  your breakdown of the short, mid, long term with your predictions straight ahead with
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.920]  more trends with MaxKaiser, then I'm going to break down after he leaves us a detailed
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:35.680]  report on geoengineering, it's real, it's happening, manipulation of our earth's atmosphere,
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.920]  Bill Gates is involved.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.000]  All right, what you're listening to is from Friday Night's Nightly News, that's what
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.720]  you'll hear as a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.960]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with a second half of that interview with
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.760]  MaxKaiser at Alex Jones' last Friday, we'll be right back with that and as he said, a
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:16:00.320]  special report on geoengineering, stay tuned.

[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.040]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.680]  higher levels of education.

[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.280]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.160]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.960]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.680]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.280]  being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.240]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.960]  this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:38.160]  that I personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.760]  on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating, and the best part is it
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.720]  helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.560]  true libertarian ideas. For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield

[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:11.400]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd. Whether it's the radio
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.440]  show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:27.160]  the spear. It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.640]  that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do. You watch the Assad regime is going to
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:39.040]  be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels. What we see now
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.880]  is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever that
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.840]  supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.640]  friends and family. Visit InfoWarsNews.com today. Become a member, share your membership,

[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:16.240]  And we are back. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Alex Jones, Max Kaiser. From England
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.840]  is our guest if you just tuned in. He's a former successful stockbroker and of course
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.960]  invented a lot of the virtual trading systems that are used today, and he's also been a
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.960]  syndicated radio host and syndicated television host. He made a lot of accurate predictions
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.600]  on our show, MaxKaiser.com, is his main website. Of course, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.560]  We ask, of course, InfoWars Nightly News, and I'm excited that a lot of what airs on
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.720]  InfoWars Nightly News is also being picked up by our syndicated AM&F affiliates on their
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.200]  own accord, and they are airing a lot of the nightly news on their own shows or in little
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:55.840]  vignettes on their stations. So it's incredible, Max, how hungry people are for something that
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:02.200]  isn't controlled left or controlled right, but just has a pro-liberty common sense bent.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.160]  And that is certainly our bias to tell the truth and promote a new renaissance of freedom.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:12.240]  I know you've said many times that that's basically your political perspective as well
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:19.120]  for new listeners out there. But in the time we have in this segment, we see massive political
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.840]  engineering going on. We see huge turmoil. Just last week, Secretary of Defense said
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.960]  the whole world's blowing up. Two weeks before, the White House press secretary said we've
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:35.800]  had unparalleled prosperity and tranquility during Obama. That's like saying two plus
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.880]  two equals five. Or earlier in the week in Ferguson, when our reporters got attacked
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.560]  with rubber bullets along with the Washington Post and Al Jazeera, the police said they
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.920]  were helping us that we'd asked to have that done when they knocked the cameras over. That
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:54.700]  was on Fox News. So we see CNN, MSNBC lying at record levels, Fox News just reporting
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:59.280]  whatever the police say. We're not even against the police in Ferguson. It just seems like
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:07.720]  the age of lies and fraud has kicked into overdrive. And then we see Russia having a convoy blown
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:14.840]  up by Ukraine last Friday. We just see unparalleled things happening right now. U.S. armor being
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:19.880]  sent to the border, a dollar devaluation accelerating. What are your short, medium and
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:24.000]  long term predictions? And what is the state of the world right now, Max Kaiser?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.960]  Well, give a little background. For the past 30 years, big Western economies and economies
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.720]  around the world have tried to sustain their growth using only monetary policy. That is
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:41.360]  to say they've been printing money instead of programs or instead of policies that would
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.320]  increase things like manufacturing. They've been doing whatever they can to lower the
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.840]  costs for corporations and to make up any shortfalls by just printing money. And right
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:59.920]  now in 2014, we see the result of 30 years of monetization fail, a huge failure. So these
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  countries that are really become corpocracies, vehicles for companies, are now battling for
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:12.920]  remaining world resources after having now come to the conclusion that they're attempt
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:19.440]  to aggregate their own pockets purely by printing money, purely by monetary policies now at
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.920]  the end game. So they're going to go into more of a hot war situation. So resources
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.560]  like water, resources like energy, resources like agriculture. And we see this happening
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:33.880]  in Ukraine. I think Ukraine is an example of what happens when an agriculturally rich
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.000]  country like Ukraine, which also will have a pipeline going through it coming from Russia
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.200]  Iran, suddenly catches the eye of the expanding Western European and the American forces
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.800]  that are not able to generate any GDP growth in those countries by printing more money.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.560]  It used to be that if you printed a bunch of money, you could create some GDP growth.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.520]  Now, the debts are skyrocketing. They keep printing money, but these debts are still
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:07.600]  going rapidly out of control. So conquest by counterfeit fiat derivative is coming to
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:12.040]  an end. Yes. So now they're going back to the old fashioned conquest by military force.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.720]  Correct. I think that's a good summation. So as a result, the money from before the
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:23.160]  world became monetized is coming back into play. And that would mean gold, that form
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.280]  of money. And I think Bitcoin, which is to follow up on Bitcoin a little bit, Bitcoin
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.600]  is almost digital gold in that sense, and that it has the attributes of gold. There's
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.560]  a limited supply, it's desirable, it's fungible, and it'll be used in this new war.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.040]  It's interesting, looking at the history, World War I started on horseback, it ended
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.680]  up with the Gatling gun. World War II started with the infantry, it ended up with atomic
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.040]  weapons. World War III, which is where I think we're starting now, is going to start with
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.800]  sanctions, which is a very crude economic warfare technique, and it'll end with cryptocurrencies.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:05.640]  In five years' time, the world financial map will be redrawn due to cryptocurrencies,
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.160]  the public ledger that's inherent in a cryptocurrency, and the ability to move hundreds of billions
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.960]  of pounds and dollars around the world effortlessly, frictionlessly, using the blockchain, using
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.320]  cryptocurrency. That's my prediction. World War III will be defined by cryptocurrency,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.840]  principally Bitcoin.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:29.280]  Well, the West, engaging in all this economic sabotage, is forcing Russia and others into
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.480]  the BRICS. It's forcing them to stop their own financial institutions.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480]  That's true.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.680]  They say necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.080]  That's right. The BRICS are creating their own bank to counter the IMF. This is called
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.240]  de-dolarization. So the dollar, which has been World Reserve currency since World War
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.680]  II, is losing its use on a daily basis.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.720]  It almost seems like our political elite are destroying our system on purpose. Or is it
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.320]  just pure greed? That's my concerns. Before you had generals and dictators and countries
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.560]  and that they made mistakes and things got bad.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:07.080]  Now, the suicide bankers you talk about aren't even looking at Russia my nucleus and we're
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.680]  moving tanks up to their borders and breaking deals we had. They just want Ukraine and it's
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:19.640]  just one more notch in their belt. It really seems like the type of thing historically
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.240]  that leads to disaster.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.080]  It's a Ponzi scheme. It's a Ponzi scheme made up of sovereign debt, mostly U.S. sovereign
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.400]  debt. And you know with a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme, in order for it to keep active
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.200]  you need to expand the base all the time. We know this from Bernie Madoff. We know this
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.040]  from classic Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes. So the American economy realizes that the
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:47.080]  way to increase the debt of the U.S. sovereign Ponzi scheme fast is to launch another war
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.120]  because war is incredibly capitalistic.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.600]  I guess we've run out of like third world countries to blow up. So now let's start
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:59.800]  it with somebody with 20 million nukes. Exactly. Now they're going up against somebody who
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:05.360]  has their own energy resources, who has obviously atomic weapons, but they have an enormous
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:11.960]  legion of hackers, of cyber hackers. I mean Russia, the country we're talking about, is
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.640]  known around the world for having extraordinarily adept cyber hackers and technologists. They're
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.960]  in bed with Iran and China through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. They want to get
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.760]  a pipeline going from that region into Europe. So whose work are going to go with? She can
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.600]  decide with Russia, China, Iran, which is the bottom line. The Maravada and the arrogance
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.440]  of the West could be our undoing. Our elite has become completely disconnected from reality.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.120]  Look at Obama. In one minute, how do you see an ending? Where is the dollar going? It's
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.800]  like in casinos. There's a strategy called the Martin Gale betting system, where you
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.160]  have a losing bet, but you double down on that losing bet over and over and over again,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.920]  thinking you're going to win. I think America is doubling down once again on another losing
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:00.120]  bet, this Russia invasion, more or less. And I think that will be the last bet. I think
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:06.440]  after that, America goes belly up. The dollar loses world reserve status and commodities,
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.240]  oil, food, prices in this country are set to double and triple in the next three to
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.040]  four years. All right, Max Kozler, thank you so much
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.480]  for being with us. I hope we can hang out some tonight. Folks, we're going to go back to

[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:04.840]  Changing.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:34.640]  To go out for yourselves, write down some notes and then use a major search engine to
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:43.280]  look up these mainstream media articles, university studies and governmental reports for yourself.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:49.280]  Since the early 1990s, it's been partially declassified, I'm about to go over it, that
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:56.720]  major western governments have been secretly adding to jet fuel a whole host of radioactive
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:04.320]  isotopes, aluminum dioxide, the list goes on and on to manipulate the weather on this
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.360]  planet. And when the general public brings it up, they just say, oh, you're a conspiracy
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.800]  theorist, despite the fact that most of this is hiding in plain view. This is similar to
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:23.280]  back in 1996, 97, with my NSA whistleblower connections, many of which are now public,
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:31.120]  Wayne Madsen, James Bamford and others, that the National Security Agency was illegally
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:37.440]  spying on everything Americans did for social control. Now, folks would call that a conspiracy
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:44.120]  theory, then it's now known fact. I want to give viewers and radio listeners a chance
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.960]  to write down some key terms and look this up. They kept the Manhattan Project secret,
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:53.880]  they kept the Tuskegee experiment secret, they've kept literally hundreds of different
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:35:01.600]  projects secret until the establishment feels like telling us they were doing it later.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.800]  In the public documents dealing with weather manipulation, geoengineering or terraforming,
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.960]  they say it's being done for our own good and repair of the atmosphere. But the scientists,
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:18.400]  meteorologists, astrophysicists and others that I've talked to have said what they're
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:23.560]  spraying and releasing would actually eat holes in the atmosphere and damage the soils
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:30.280]  of the planet. So let me now race through for you the over 50 or so documents I have
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:36.120]  here in front of us, admitting the geoengineering program that's going on.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:47.160]  Council on Foreign Relations 2008, geoengineering workshop on planetary scale geoengineering.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:53.160]  This is already going on. It's a multi-hundred page report, go read it. Admitting this is
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:58.240]  going on, but then they make jokes on the nightly news when I talk about this. Here's
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:04.680]  another report out of Wired Magazine, Earth Dimming Skies Before and After. Admitting
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.960]  the condensation trails from jet aircraft since the early 1990s has dimmed the planet
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:18.720]  upwards of 30%. That's from 2009. Pretty darn important. Here's another article. Can a million
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.120]  tons of sulfur dioxide combat climate change? That's their cover for this and Bill Gates
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.960]  gets billions in taxpayer money a year to carry out these secret projects. He's just
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:35.960]  one part of it. Here's an M4Wars.com article with the link to the National Patent Office.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:43.680]  Using the Skies 1975 US Patent for Powdered Contrailed Generation. And you look at what
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.880]  they're releasing now in the atmosphere, what's being picked up, it's exactly that.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.920]  The airlines don't even know. It's at the major jet fuel manufacturers. There's more
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:59.160]  than 50 patents on this alone for geoengineering. BBC, you notice I'm going through one stack
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:07.320]  here. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine more stacks. BBC,
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:14.800]  why the sun seems to be dimming. Manmade chemtrails. This is a key article from the Pentagon. Weather
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:22.680]  as a force multiplier, owning the weather by 2025, 1996. Dealing with manipulation of
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:27.680]  the weather. Department of Defense weather programs, breaking down the control of hurricanes,
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.640]  everything that's been going on since the 60s. Declassified in 2004. Been living to
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.420]  the father of weather weapons. Was interviewed on radio and TV. By me, those interviews are
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:45.280]  posted at M4Wars.com today from almost 10 years ago. This is key information, ladies
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.120]  and gentlemen. Let's continue. Here's another report. Oral evidence taken before the Science
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:58.520]  and Technology Committee 2010 in Congress dealing with the geoengineering that's going
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:05.240]  on. Here's another. Unilateral geoengineering. Briefing notes. Again, this is put out by
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:12.160]  Stanford University, who first certified the weather control in 1968 with Ben Levingston.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:17.640]  Not declassified till the mid-2000s. Let's continue to another key document. Indirect
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:23.480]  and semi-direct aerosol campaign. This is put out by the federal government and more
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:30.480]  than a dozen major universities dealing with how they are manipulating the weather currently
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.280]  and controlling it. You notice all the droughts, the rest of it. Just like I told you how the
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:41.360]  NSA operated with precision, I'm telling you from public documents that I have read and
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:49.960]  interviewing the top experts what's happening. In 1992, a Nobel Prize was won by Paul Crudson
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:55.360]  on how to control the weather worldwide with these systems. And you read what he got the
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:01.160]  prize for. Turned out this was work he did decades before. His plan got implemented.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.280]  He won the prize because he claims it's to fix the ozone holes. Why aren't you telling
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:13.200]  the public then about this project if it's supposedly to fix the ozone holes? We've interviewed
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.800]  the physicist, the atmospheric experts. It's pure bull. They're changing our atmosphere.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.320]  House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee, the regulation of geoengineering, 2010, calling
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:30.000]  for banning it, talking about how dangerous it is. There's UN treaties on it from 1979.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.360]  But again, none of this exists even though I'm giving you all the documentation. I told
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:41.520]  you in 1996 that the NSA spy grids were to be able to predict the future in mass movements
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.160]  and rig economies. Snowden told you that last year. I'm on record. I know what I'm talking
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.960]  about. We've done our homework. Here's another one put out by Harvard. Stratospheric injection
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:56.400]  of reflective aerosols on particles by means of aviation fuel additives. Bam. That's how
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.760]  they're compartmentalizing it where people don't know what's happening. Serious clouds
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:07.080]  seating using airliners to reduce reflectivity and, quote, save us from the sun as the earth
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.240]  actually gets less light and plants begin to die. All mainline government reports. Get
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.760]  up, write all this down, watch the video, take notes, look it up, or just say it's racist
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.800]  and that would be easier or homophobic. Doesn't have any reflection on reality. Just say it,
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.440]  be trendy, wear colorful socks, row a beard, you're cool, everyone worships you because
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.240]  you're so trendy. Again, the trend is just ignore all this and just call us conspiracy
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.800]  theorist. Here's the whole Air Force breaking it down, all the rest of it. And separately
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.640]  then the Air Force comes out and white washes it and just says it's ice crystals. No, we
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.800]  know there's natural ice crystals at high altitudes that form. We're not saying it's
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.680]  all weather modification. The point is the weather modification is going on. You can
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.480]  search it. You can watch C-span where they've had hearings, admitting all of it. This is
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:01.480]  the reality. And you ignore all of this at your total peril. The globalists have created
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.680]  a breakaway civilization. They have created a technocracy. They're playing God. In places
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.480]  like Dubai years ago, they admitted they could control their weather and make it rain and
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:16.280]  turn the desert green. But here they don't tell you that a lot of the so-called Doppler
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:22.160]  towers are really weather control towers. And I was told that in 1999 by a top engineer
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.600]  in microwaves, and didn't even believe it when he gave me the documents, and then years
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:32.320]  later saw it in the Daily Mail and the Associated Press, but in the Middle East and China, not
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.600]  here. They're doing it with jet trails, with the chemicals. They're doing it with these
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.920]  different microwave systems and relay towers that then resonate with it. They've got over
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:47.480]  the horizon radar as one reason they're spraying this stuff. The point is we need to know.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:53.320]  The public needs to have an investigation. This is hardcore, serious info that government
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:58.120]  using our tax money and our ingenuity has built a breakaway civilization where they
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.360]  put stuff on our water, GMO in our food. They're messing with the weather. They're buying armored
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.520]  vehicles and billions of rounds of ammo and have TV shows, badmouthing the founding fathers.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.120]  I mean, we're living in a science fiction movie. And that's what I wanted to break down
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.240]  here on The Nightly News and on syndicated radio stations across the country that pick
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.680]  up this information because I'm just somebody that knows how to read public documents off
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.360]  Army.mil. I know how to watch C-SPAN hearings about this, where they admit it's all going
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:33.040]  on and then CNN and MSNBC says none of it exists and mix it in with space aliens, something
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:39.400]  we can't prove. All I know is our Earth's being manipulated. This is hardcore, serious.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:45.720]  Now that's it for InfoWars Nightly News. Some stations out there will come back after this
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:51.080]  with David Knight and more. I'm Alex Jones, signing off for now. And if you're watching
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:43:00.560]  this transmission or listening, you are the resistance. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.640]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water. I can taste dirt in it.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:10.120]  God knows what's in there. These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.560]  from the faucet. Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Cropure G2.0
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.180]  filtration system. Now one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep, I know what good water
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:25.560]  tastes like. It's good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine,
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.240]  glyphosate, and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.000]  of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer. It tastes like
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.840]  you're drinking out of the lake when you're in the tap water. The Cropure G2.0 filtration
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:45.240]  system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.640]  Okay, this is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's good. Go to infowarsstore.com

[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.720]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:09.560]  a potential for good situation? The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:15.080]  crowd. Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.680]  news, infowars is the tip of the spear. Is this another false-flight stage attack to
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.040]  take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security by sticking the hands down on the
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.080]  pants on the streets? It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.760]  everywhere, and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do. You watch the Assad regime
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:39.280]  is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.720]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.880]  than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their

[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.720]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.800]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.200]  and two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308

[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:29.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight in those last segments. You heard
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.200]  Alex Jones, a special report on geoengineering as well as his interview with Max Kaiser talking
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.720]  about cryptocurrencies, about how that's going to affect our monetary system. You can find
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.800]  both of those reports on Alex Jones' YouTube channel. Of course, you would have been able
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.560]  to see them live on Friday if you were a prison planet TV subscriber. We have the nightly
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:54.160]  news every night at 7 central and that's available to Infowars Subscribers. One subscription will
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.280]  allow you to share that with up to 11 other people so 12 of you can watch it simultaneously.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.960]  Also we have all of Alex Jones' documentaries there available for everyone in high resolution.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.400]  It's a way to support our operation. It's what provides the support for our reporters
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.600]  to go places like Ferguson that we've been talking about. As this was developing in Ferguson,
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:21.640]  we had a federal court decision about a new Maryland Firearms Act. This was the Maryland
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:28.560]  Firearms Safety Act of 2013 which makes the possession and open carry of so-called assault
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.040]  weapons illegal. Now what are assault weapons? There's a lot of confusion about that from
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.880]  the people who want to regulate it just like we saw the Huffington Post reporter had no
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:44.040]  clue about the earplugs that he found on the ground, the soft earplugs, the ear protection.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.520]  They thought they were rubber bullets. Well, rubber bullets are pretty hard. Those things
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.200]  if you could fire them out of a gun probably you wouldn't even feel it. Those are soft
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:58.960]  little squishy pieces of rubbery by this use them even if you're not a firearms person
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.400]  you may have used, that kind of hearing protection. There's a lot of confusion about what an assault
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.960]  weapon is. It's essentially banned because of its appearance and about 50 to 60 percent
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.320]  of the firearms that are sold would fall under that category because they are AR-15s. Now
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.600]  this is what the federal judge ruled in this case. This is a U.S. District Judge, Catherine
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.720]  Blake. She was appointed by President Clinton and this is reported by Investors.com. She
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.520]  issued a ruling that upheld the Maryland law that is the Maryland Firearms Safety Act
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:36.600]  of 2013 and she said the court seriously doubts that the banned assault long guns are commonly
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:42.200]  possessed for lawful purposes and it's inclined to find the weapons fall outside of the Second
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:49.480]  Amendment protection as dangerous and unusual. That is an egregious lie because you can look
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.840]  at the article that's up on info wars.com of the business owners tweeting pictures of
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:02.240]  themselves protecting their businesses and they're holding AR-15s and guns like that.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:08.440]  Just yesterday we saw this report from Fox News there in St. Louis area. They said, quote,
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:13.160]  there are no police. Ferguson store owners are guarding their own businesses and cite
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.840]  a lack of police response. In this article they say looters in Ferguson, Missouri were
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.400]  met with little police resistance Friday night and store owners say that they were forced
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.800]  to protect their businesses with their own guns. They said two store owners standing
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:34.320]  outside the business holding guns told fox2now.com that when they called 911 they were sent from
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:41.320]  one police agency to another and got no response. That's right. You can't get protection with
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:46.520]  a phone receiver. They said this is a pastor talking. He said he told the station, I think
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:52.520]  the first message is to remind all law enforcement that they are hired to serve and protect and
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:58.240]  if they're going to sit back and watch looting, they're not serving us. They're not protecting
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.240]  us.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:04.560]  Well, see, that's a fundamental flaw in the way a lot of people view law enforcement.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:09.120]  We've had a lot of lawsuits where people have sued the police saying you didn't show up
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:14.080]  in time. You didn't do anything to protect me. And over and over again, we've seen courts
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:19.920]  say the police have no responsibility to protect you. They're there to enforce government
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:26.520]  policy in many cases against you. Now, there was an interesting case. Now, the one about
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.880]  supporting the Maryland law banning assault rifles, that happened just last Tuesday as
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.360]  the looting and unrest was going on in Ferguson. They were saying there's no reasonable lawful
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:43.120]  use for these AR-15s even as people were protecting their businesses there with assault weapons
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:46.080]  when the police would not protect them.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:53.720]  There is an interesting spin on this. There was a court case on August the 5th, Von versus
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.760]  the city of Chicago. And in this particular case, they said this is a Washington Post
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.760]  article.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:04.600]  It says police interference with a person's self-defense. See, not the police protecting
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.240]  somebody, not being obliged to protect you, but when they interfere with your own self-defense,
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:15.200]  maybe like with gun control laws. Okay, but this is a more direct example. When they interfere
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.800]  with a person's self-defense, when he's faced with imminent danger, plus a failure to protect
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:25.600]  him against the danger, that may be unconstitutional. Now, in this particular case, you had a man,
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.560]  there was an altercation between two groups, a man named Von, left the area before four
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:35.200]  police officers arrived. They are now named as defendants. When the police officer stood
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:39.920]  between the two groups trying to disperse the crowd, this fellow Von returned to the scene
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.240]  looking for his younger brother. He was carrying a stick to protect himself. One of the officers
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:50.720]  drew his gun and pointed it at Von and demanded that he drop the stick. He complied. Then,
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:55.080]  a man in the opposing group began yelling obscenities at him, and he picked up the stick
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:00.840]  again. Again, the officers ordered him to drop the stick. Again, he complied. Then,
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.880]  the man who had been shouting obscenities at him made his way through the crowd carrying
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:11.920]  a metal baseball bat. The defendants, the defendant officers, didn't order that man to stop, didn't
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:16.320]  order that man to drop his metal bat. Instead, they let him go through and they watched as
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:23.400]  he clubbed Von in the head with a bat and then ran from the scene. Von died from this.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.560]  He died from this. Maybe what we need is bat control, right? Baseball bat control, stick
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:33.520]  control. No, maybe what we need are police who don't interfere with your right to protect
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:39.800]  yourself by banning guns. Do we really want the police that we've seen in Ferguson, Missouri,
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.000]  as we've seen the results of this militarization of the police? Do we really want them to have
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.160]  a monopoly on the use of force? Can we really trust them for that? I don't think so. Look
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.000]  at what Eric Holder is now saying. He's now pretending that he's astonished and surprised
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.560]  at the militarization of the police. This is reported again by the Washington Post. He's
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.880]  criticizing the police response in Ferguson, saying that he's, quote, deeply concerned
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.440]  about the use of military equipment. Well, where did they get that military equipment?
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.640]  They got it from the same federal government. They from the administration that is now putting
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:21.040]  these over-the-top military equipment in the smallest towns in America. They're the people
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:30.240]  who are bringing in 13,000 MRAPs from counterinsurgency wars abroad. These are the people where 2700
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.920]  of them have been purchased by Homeland Security along with their two billion bullets. That's
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:38.760]  right. They're hollow point bullets that by Geneva Convention, even the military can't
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.520]  use in a war. And CS gas, which the military can't use in a war. But they can use that
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.720]  against their own citizens. And they're stockpiling it in massive amounts. And the federal government
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:53.040]  has set up the rules of engagement that we see playing out on the streets of Ferguson.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.880]  But Eric Holder is amazed. He's astonished. And he says, at a time when we must seek
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:02.960]  to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I'm deeply concerned
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:07.800]  that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:13.960]  Yeah, it sends a real conflicting message. It sends a message that is saying that we
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.520]  need to rebuild trust is the conflicting message. Because nothing that the government has been
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.560]  doing in their war game scenarios. Joe Biggs, who's there in Ferguson, Missouri right now,
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:29.400]  Joe Biggs and I walked through one of the facilities, AP Hill, where they are training
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:35.160]  against the American people as if we are the counterinsurgency, as if we were the counterinsurgency
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:40.880]  in Iraq or Afghanistan, the people that need to put down. They are militarizing the police.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.080]  They're using going to use the police as military. You can see this in their training scenarios.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:49.880]  You can see it in the fusion centers and the NSA snooping the spying that's going on. You
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.920]  can see it in their war gaming scenarios. They make no bones about it. And then he goes
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:03.760]  on to pretend that he is surprised and disappointed about the infringements upon the free press.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.360]  Eric Holder went on to say, and this is a Washington Post reporting it. He said, quote,
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:12.320]  journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:17.840]  He said, and they point out his hypocrisy. They say this is a stance on behalf of media
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.160]  freedom noted from a tweet from a Justice Department spokesman who said that the Huffington
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.920]  Post, Ryan Riley, who was arrested along with the Washington Post reporter, Larry, was a,
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:33.320]  quote, gutsy reporter. And they say, that was criticized because this is the same Justice
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:38.640]  Department that is investigating several journalists, including James Ryzen, a Pulitzer Prize winning
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:45.000]  reporter who's facing potential jail time for failing to identify a source. So here we go.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:51.160]  They're investigating people. They're tracking journalists. They are looking at their phone
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:56.080]  records. You remember even before the Snowden leaks, we were told that they had gotten all
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:01.880]  kinds of phone records from the Associated Press, from the mainstream media, from now
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:05.760]  they're arresting people like the Washington Post reporter and the Huffington Post reporter
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.880]  there and Ferguson, Missouri. When they do that, these guys are starting to pay a little
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:16.600]  bit of attention, but they still fundamentally go with the governments. There's some footage
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.880]  of that right there. If you haven't seen that, you'd need to take a look at that and read
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:26.680]  the account of what they did because these guys were filming them in a McDonald's. They
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:29.840]  basically arrested them and said, sorry, you got to get going. You got to put that down.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:35.600]  You have no right to film me in a McDonald's. There is no expectation of privacy for the
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:43.120]  police and a public area. There is an expectation of a freedom of the press. There is an expectation
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:48.600]  of freedom of speech. There is an expectation that we can redress the grievances. Stay with
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:52.480]  us on tomorrow. We're going to be at 11 Central.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.720]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.800]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:34.200]  and two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308
