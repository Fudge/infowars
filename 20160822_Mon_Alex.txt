[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:18.520 --> 00:34.080]  the Info War. Two days ago, U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told Sputnik regarding
[00:34.080 --> 00:41.280]  the 50-70B61 tactical gravity nuclear bomb stored at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, we
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.760]  do have nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons are safe and secure and we are confident
[00:46.760 --> 00:53.080]  in that. Now, Debka is reporting, the United States has begun secretly evacuating the tactical
[00:53.080 --> 00:58.960]  nuclear weapons it had stockpiled at the southern Turkish air base of Incirlik and is transporting
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.160]  them to U.S. bases in Romania. Is this a reaction to the failed coup or is there a larger strategy
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.360]  at play here? As this reaction finally comes after the worst foreign policy administration
[01:10.360 --> 01:15.840]  in U.S. history, remain quiet as power was cut to the Incirlik air base and was put on
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.680]  lockdown while hordes of Turkish protesters gathered outside the base over the purported
[01:21.680 --> 01:27.680]  CIA link to the recent coup attempt, a link that winds its way back to Fethullah Gulen
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.660]  and his movement. The same Gulen who is protected by the Obama administration and maintains
[01:32.660 --> 01:38.300]  a charter school empire in the United States that has angered labor unions while siphoning
[01:38.300 --> 01:43.320]  money from the American taxpayers through those charter schools to fund his movement.
[01:43.320 --> 01:49.600]  The results of the failed coup in Ankara, Turkey that claimed 294 lives and saw thousands
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.000]  arrested has awarded President Erdogan unlimited dictatorial control over his country. The
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.600]  New York Times reported Turkey said on Wednesday that it would empty its prisons of tens of
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.240]  thousands of criminals to make room for the wave of journalists, teachers, lawyers and
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.320]  judges rounded up in connection with last month's failed coup. Numerous sources are
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.520]  now confirming that the Incirlik nukes are being moved to the Deveselu air base in Romania.
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.920]  Meanwhile, 2000 NATO troops have conducted airborne training operations in Poland while
[02:20.920 --> 02:27.440]  Obama pledged 1000 extra troops to Poland. Russian President Vladimir Putin is urging
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.320]  Erdogan to pick a side as the proxy situation in Ukraine funded by the United States.
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.680]  We've invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will
[02:38.680 --> 02:42.680]  ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.
[02:42.680 --> 02:48.520]  Is it possible that the majority of the civilian casualties that you're talking about were
[02:48.520 --> 02:57.240]  actually civilian casualties that were the victims of the Ukrainian army and the oligarch
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.960]  that financed one-third of their army at one point? Is that possible?
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.960]  If I could say two things first, I think it's highly unlikely on the basis of the reports
[03:05.960 --> 03:11.080]  that we've received from the United Nations and from the OSCE. Second, I want to underscore
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.720]  again why this conflict started. It started because Russia moved troops and weapons and
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.720]  so forth.
[03:17.720 --> 03:22.080]  Just so you know, Madam Secretary, the Russians would suggest it started when there was a
[03:22.080 --> 03:24.680]  violent overthrow of an elected government.
[03:24.680 --> 03:28.560]  Right. I don't make it a point of listening to President Putin's claims as a general
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.560]  rule. I don't find it credible.
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.360]  Well, I think that you are our representative. You should pay attention to everybody's claims
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.840]  and you should refute them if they can be refuted rather than dismissing them.
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.800]  And quarterbacked by George Soros, an escalation now forcing Putin's hand as 40,000 Russian
[03:43.800 --> 03:49.040]  troops are now sitting on the Ukraine's eastern border. Our media and government should be
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.400]  working to de-escalate this nuclear powder keg with rational reporting and diplomacy.
[03:54.400 --> 04:00.800]  However, Obama golfs. Hillary thumbs her nose at Putin. And George Soros sways public opinion
[04:00.800 --> 04:07.640]  to lead the world to the razor's edge of World War three. Just in time to hijack the US presidential
[04:07.640 --> 04:12.960]  election, John bound for info wars.com.
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.840]  Powerful report. If you want to share it, it's posted on info wars.com. World War three
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.280]  ramps up in time to hijack the election.
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.680]  We've had nuclear weapons now for 65, almost 70 years. We haven't had a nuclear war yet.
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.120]  So a lot of people think it's impossible, even though most top analysts say that it's
[04:30.120 --> 04:36.360]  more probable now than ever. And it's basically unsurvivable for the human race.
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.600]  But we've got generations of people that have not been in a major war that kills tens
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.200]  of millions of people. So they think they're immune from it. World War two killed more
[04:46.200 --> 04:50.960]  than 65 million people.
[04:50.960 --> 04:56.640]  But Americans think it can't happen here. Big broadcast lined up today. Strap yourselves
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.720]  in. I'm Alex Jones.
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.880]  Concerns over Hillary Clinton's health are not a conspiracy theory. And Hillary should
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.000]  be accessed by impartial panel physicians, according to Rutgers University professor
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.240]  of medicine Bob Lahita. According to a report by Paul Joseph Watson, Lahita told Fox Business
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.360]  that he agreed with Dr. Drew on several points about Hillary's health.
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.280]  This is a very unusual story with Hillary, said Lahita, referring to her health history,
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.200]  including two blood clots, a stroke and post concussion syndrome, which forced Hillary
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.240]  to wear special prison glasses to counter her double vision. The very fact that she's
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.280]  having these clots since she's had two bounces thombosis is disconcerting to say the least,
[05:31.280 --> 05:34.720]  he added. And when asked whether concerns over Hillary's health were objectively authentic
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.000]  regardless of politics or whether the leftist media was right to label the issue of conspiracy
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.440]  theory, Lahita responded, I don't think it's conspiracy. He said, quote, you go back to
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.160]  the history of our presidents and we've had many presidents who concealed their health
[05:47.160 --> 05:51.720]  during their campaigns and it had dire effects on our country. And similarly last week, Dr.
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.640]  Drew said he's greatly concerned about Hillary's health, noting that the treatment she's received
[05:55.640 --> 06:25.480]  is bizarre. Find out more at infowars.com. This is Get Daniels reporting.

[08:11.000 --> 08:20.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation. Monday through Friday
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.120]  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central. Then we have the nightly news, 7 o'clock central and I
[08:30.120 --> 08:36.320]  returned as I did last night. 4 to 6 p.m. central with the Sunday global edition. Where
[08:36.320 --> 08:41.400]  to begin? Southern command. We told you about this two years ago, but now it's mainstream
[08:41.400 --> 08:49.320]  news. Warns of SUNY, that means al-Qaeda, ISIS. Infiltrating from the south. It's ongoing.
[08:49.320 --> 08:53.920]  Bill Gertz is reporting. We're also going to be getting into Trump leads Clinton in
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.480]  latest poll after month of trailing. But that's with a poll that still is basically
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.000]  stilted. If you look at the methodology against Trump, assassination attempt, panic for Julian
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.680]  Assange as intruder scales Ecuadorian embassy in the dead of night going towards his window.
[09:12.680 --> 09:19.000]  Narrowly escapes the security forces. Isn't that just special? And massive news on attempts
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.160]  to censor the free press. This all ties into that. I have a whole stack on that issue that
[09:26.160 --> 09:34.640]  is now really rearing its festering head. Hillary voter registration fraud caught on
[09:34.640 --> 09:39.320]  camera. Paul Joseph Watson wrote a story and we have the video of a democratic party staffer
[09:39.320 --> 09:43.640]  caught on camera violating Nevada election law by soliciting votes for Hillary Clinton
[09:43.640 --> 09:49.280]  right out front polling place. Also, we're going to be getting into Louisiana man calls
[09:49.280 --> 09:54.400]  out black lives matter for not helping flood victims. Where's the black lives matter boat?
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.440]  There's plenty of salvation army boats and Christians of all colors out there helping
[09:59.440 --> 10:05.040]  their fellow humans. But doesn't matter. Obama has put out a memo saying make sure there's
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.640]  no racism in Louisiana in the aid delivery, even though he's not rendering any aid and
[10:10.640 --> 10:15.920]  even though he's on vacation or I guess ended his vacation last night, Hillary's not coming
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.280]  either. But it doesn't matter in PR and CNN. I played the clubs yesterday. They're very
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.960]  upset with Trump for going. It's it's bad. It's good to not go. It's bad to go unless
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.080]  you're George Bush and it's bad to go and render aid, but he didn't do it right. It's
[10:31.080 --> 10:37.120]  just best to do nothing. That's liberal. That's trendy and issue an anti racism memo and you've
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.880]  handled everything. Total and complete disconnect. We're going to be going over all these videos
[10:41.880 --> 10:50.480]  today. Also, another video left to support blacks only 10% tax reduction. So former reparations.
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.160]  This shows what's going on with the poor Californians. Also, Trump crowd chance. Do your job at
[10:55.160 --> 11:00.840]  CNN crew. People asked a few weeks ago, why did Drudge link to a short video of someone
[11:00.840 --> 11:06.880]  saying you're a trader. I'm a patriot. You're a trader. I'm a patriot of Trump rally to CNN
[11:06.880 --> 11:13.280]  to start a movement to call out the horror media. Now, Drudge didn't tell me that. I'm
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.440]  kind of synced up just on common sense wavelength. And now this is happening everywhere as people
[11:18.440 --> 11:24.560]  turn their anger on to mainstream media CNN being chief amongst them. This is the trader
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.960]  media, the decepticon media, the collaborator media, and I don't want any violence against
[11:29.960 --> 11:36.200]  them. But it's time to understand that they need to be called out. People don't need to
[11:36.200 --> 11:42.520]  just let them sit there and play along like their objective when they're such deceivers.
[11:42.520 --> 11:51.840]  MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, any of these groups, if they're out in public at an event, have
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.880]  your voice be heard. How many times have I personally hijacked live TV programs of Fox
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.920]  News, CNN, MSNBC? I've been arrested for doing it in New York. They're outside. I bring
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.960]  a protest to protest. The fact that they're covering up the lie that got us into the Iraq
[12:08.960 --> 12:16.760]  war. I just go after injustice. It's that simple. And of course, MSNBC famously in Denver
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.680]  attacked me, cut the wire of my bullhorn because the police wouldn't violate my free speech
[12:22.680 --> 12:26.200]  and take the bullhorn away. So they physically attacked us. We just went and got another
[12:26.200 --> 12:31.960]  bullhorn out of the truck and absolutely defeated them. So that's what this is all about, going
[12:31.960 --> 12:36.640]  after the media so they just can't sit there with their audiences and deceive them because
[12:36.640 --> 12:44.100]  we're going to be jumping in live on air any chance we can to culturally jam their operations.
[12:44.100 --> 12:50.440]  So that's coming up as well. Bill Gates, net worth hits a record 90 billion. That's
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.040]  not counting the hundred billion or so that he and his wife have put tax exempt into their
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.720]  foundation. They call him the greatest philanthropist ever. What he did was make his money tax-free.
[13:01.720 --> 13:11.440]  The profit goes to him and the taxes are zero. But only a mega robber baron is allowed to
[13:11.440 --> 13:19.320]  do that, not you. Only the big mega corporations get to pay zero tax. That's how they operate.
[13:19.320 --> 13:23.000]  That's how they roll while he and Warren Buffett is partner in the Bill and Melinda Gates
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.740]  Foundation. He's put what, 60 something billion in last time I checked. He lobbies for higher
[13:28.740 --> 13:33.480]  taxes on the middle class all day, billing it as higher taxes on rich people. We're going
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.520]  to be breaking that down as well. We have Obama, Reddy's one last push for Trans-Pacific
[13:38.520 --> 13:47.600]  Partnership. We also have that tying in to Brexit Sparks Rush for New Zealand as immigration
[13:47.600 --> 13:53.840]  inquiries hit record high. That's where everybody's evacuating to. After Shake Up with Trump,
[13:53.840 --> 14:00.200]  Clinton campaign keeps wary eye on conspiracy theories. That's the New York Times. When
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.840]  Judicial Watch and World Net Daily, the Western Journalism Center sued to get thousands of
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.720]  pages of documents a few years ago. I keep going back to that because it's a key data
[14:11.720 --> 14:18.240]  dump. When they sued the Clinton Library in Little Rock, they got thousands of pages
[14:18.240 --> 14:24.480]  of documents. And in those documents, some of which they've published, it says, anyone
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.960]  that criticizes us will be called a conspiracy theorist or a racist. It doesn't matter
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.160]  if they're liberal, conservative, we never intellectually debate, instruct the media
[14:33.160 --> 14:38.160]  to say conspiracy theory. And then they go into how the CIA trained them basically in
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.160]  the 60s to use that term. That term is from the 60s. It's been declassified. You could
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.080]  say that you don't like, again, the flavor of ice cream, and they'll say it's a conspiracy
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.520]  theory. It is a way to just ignore whatever your view is, whatever your opinion is and
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.440]  not have a debate. It doesn't work anymore. Just the last week, I have seen more than
[14:59.440 --> 15:06.600]  20 that we should do a compilation video. Medical doctors, sometimes head professors,
[15:06.600 --> 15:14.760]  brain surgeons, neurologists, radiologists. The list goes on and on saying Hillary Clinton
[15:14.760 --> 15:21.840]  clearly has serious, degraded neurological capacity. I mean, I'm not a brain surgeon
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.040]  or a neurologist, but you can see somebody sitting in a bus stop that their hands are
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.520]  shaking and their heads shaking and say, that person's probably got Parkinson's. And if
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.080]  you walk over and ask them, they'll say, yeah, I got Parkinson's or some other neurological
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.200]  disorder. Bill Clinton clearly is starting to get Parkinson's with his hands shaking
[15:39.200 --> 15:46.800]  and he's clearly on medication to try to control it. But Hillary looks like a bedraggled
[15:46.800 --> 15:53.000]  old shoe on the side of the highway. I mean, I'm sorry. And she looks worse by the day.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.080]  So we've got all these other new medical doctors coming out talking about it. But the response
[15:58.080 --> 16:03.960]  is to just say it's a conspiracy theory and to say that Trump listens to Breitbart and
[16:03.960 --> 16:15.240]  Alex Jones and Drudge. And so no one can listen to them anymore. Now, before I get into that
[16:15.240 --> 16:22.480]  doctor clip, let's get into Trump taking the gloves off. Trump has come out and said that
[16:22.480 --> 16:28.720]  the Clinton campaign is run by grifters and that Wiener is a perverted sleaze, which is
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.040]  absolutely true. And the Democratic Party at that level are con artist grifters. Remember
[16:35.040 --> 16:41.280]  Acorn, where they would send their undercover reporters into multiple Acorn facilities saying,
[16:41.280 --> 16:46.280]  I'm going to run child sex slaves. And they're like, excellent, just make sure they pay their
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.480]  taxes. Let us sign you up right now. Because that's what the Democrats do. They run the
[16:51.480 --> 16:57.560]  cocaine, they run the heroin, they run the synthetic drugs, they run the sex slavery,
[16:57.560 --> 17:01.160]  they run it all in the cities they control. And that's why the Democratic cities they
[17:01.160 --> 17:06.720]  control are hellish pits. And it's time to call them out for what they are. Let's go
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.800]  ahead and roll that clip of Donald. To be honest with you with the emails and the crimes
[17:10.800 --> 17:14.440]  he committed, she shouldn't even be allowed to run for president. Mr. Trump, let's talk
[17:14.440 --> 17:18.760]  about our email scandal because she totally threw Colin Powell under the bus. She was
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.920]  meeting with the FBI, and she said that Colin Powell told her to use her personal email
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.400]  server. So she's blaming it all on him. He was in the Hamptons over the weekend, was
[17:27.400 --> 17:32.280]  asked about it. And he said that is a total lie. He said she was using that email for
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.480]  one year before he told her that he had been doing the same thing.
[17:35.480 --> 17:40.120]  Well, look, she's a liar. I mean, she lies. She lied about the emails. She lied about
[17:40.120 --> 17:47.400]  Colin Powell. I saw that he was not happy. And the whole thing is a scam with them.
[17:47.400 --> 17:50.080]  The whole thing is a scam, like lifters.
[17:50.080 --> 17:55.280]  Hulse Ferry had a column over the weekend about Uma Abedin and her mom. Evidently they had
[17:55.280 --> 18:01.360]  a Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs going. It's a new, it's a journal. She had a title
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.520]  with the journal. She wrote for this journal. And if you know what basically their message
[18:05.520 --> 18:11.960]  is as anti-woman as you can get, you understand they were talking about how it's better for
[18:11.960 --> 18:17.320]  a woman to be subservient to a man. It goes on and on and on. And today the Clinton campaign
[18:17.320 --> 18:21.320]  president said her name was just on there. She didn't really do anything. She had no
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.200]  formal role as the, I got quote, of the radical Muslim Journal.
[18:25.200 --> 18:26.840]  Is that her mom's the editor? Is that right, Brown?
[18:26.840 --> 18:27.840]  Yeah.
[18:27.840 --> 18:33.320]  Of course that's terrible and it shouldn't happen. It's a lie. It's another lie that
[18:33.320 --> 18:37.480]  they tell. But what about the fact that Uma Abedin, who knows every single thing about
[18:37.480 --> 18:42.000]  Hillary Clinton, she knows more about Hillary than Hillary knows. And she's married to a
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.280]  pervert sleaze named Anthony Wiener, who will send anything that he has out over Twitter
[18:48.280 --> 18:53.280]  or any other form of getting it out. I mean, she's married to Anthony Wiener. She knows
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.280]  everything that Hillary Clinton is doing. And she's absolutely, let's go ahead and cut
[18:57.280 --> 19:01.520]  him off there because I want to add something because we've got a break here. When you understand
[19:01.520 --> 19:08.360]  how Wahhabist Sunnis work, the royal houses and the people in charge do whatever they
[19:08.360 --> 19:15.560]  want. And the ruling women live in palaces and have their own sex toys and, you know,
[19:15.560 --> 19:20.120]  their own boyfriends and their own helicopters. And they, they have long hair and they wear
[19:20.120 --> 19:25.920]  big dresses and they do whatever they want. It's the women in general that are enslaved
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.640]  and the men are enslaved as well. But the upper ruling classes do whatever they want.
[19:30.640 --> 19:37.040]  So that's why Khan founded a journal to enforce Syria law in America. So of course he works
[19:37.040 --> 19:43.560]  with the Clintons in Abedin. This is how they enslave their own people. It's an oppressive
[19:43.560 --> 19:50.320]  slave system, political Islam. It's a fact. And it's waging war against every other culture,
[19:50.320 --> 19:56.400]  the Shiites, you name it. It is taking over. And so that's why Abedin is such a disgusting,
[19:56.400 --> 20:00.480]  horrible person. She'd be executed to Saudi Arabia.

[20:59.680 --> 21:05.200]  Dr. Watter Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe. He also discovered
[21:05.200 --> 21:09.160]  how normal cells turn into tumor cells. He discovered the one prime cause of cancer
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.240]  was cellular oxygen deficiency. Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.600]  and discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency. She found that it
[21:18.600 --> 21:22.800]  was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax
[21:22.800 --> 21:26.880]  oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed. Flax oil delivered in this manner
[21:26.880 --> 21:31.720]  was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body. Now there's a new method
[21:31.720 --> 21:37.040]  of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[21:37.040 --> 21:41.680]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing. Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.120]  protein powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is

[24:12.200 --> 24:16.400]  I mention Gary Haven, one of my favorite guests who was in studio with us last week, was going
[24:16.400 --> 24:21.920]  to be in studio with Steve Quayle in studio for two hours. They just did a little tour
[24:21.920 --> 24:26.360]  around the country. We had a camera crew with them going around setting the brush fires
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.600]  warning folks about the new world order. Including going on the big, you know, national Christian
[24:32.600 --> 24:37.400]  broadcasting channels. And that's a big deal because one of the biggest audiences out there
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.400]  is on Christian radio and Christian satellite TV. So the fact that Haven and Quayle and
[24:43.400 --> 24:48.840]  others are now going on those channels is a very, very positive thing to warn people
[24:48.840 --> 24:54.120]  about exactly what's really going on. This message of exposing the globalist has gone
[24:54.120 --> 25:01.920]  mainstream and I don't give ourselves the credit because I even want the credit. Historically
[25:01.920 --> 25:07.960]  people need to understand that Info Wars has been at the heart of the resistance and the
[25:07.960 --> 25:15.320]  only reason I tell you that is so you understand what you've done. Supporting this broadcast,
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.320]  getting the word, standing up, being ridiculed, going to the PTA, going to your church, calling
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.680]  in to talk radio, starting your own blog, handing out copies of films, praying for America
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.680]  to awaken. Everything you've done, the rallies you've gone to, I'm talking about folks who
[25:32.680 --> 25:36.200]  were doing this 50 years ago in some cases that are listening. You know who you are.
[25:36.200 --> 25:43.240]  I want to salute you. In fact, I want to get Red Beckman back on. He's super old, like
[25:43.240 --> 25:50.880]  90 years old now, Air Force vet, World War II vet. No one knew the Federal Reserve was
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.800]  private when that guy was exposing it 55, 60 years ago. Look how far we've come and
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.880]  Red Beckman, last time I talked to him last year is still all there. And again, it's not
[26:01.880 --> 26:07.200]  about giving credit. He wouldn't want the credit, but it shows how far we've come to
[26:07.200 --> 26:13.560]  this point. So people shouldn't get too down because what we're talking about is now the
[26:13.560 --> 26:18.720]  zeitgeist. It's gone from guys out in the wilderness that nobody was listening to. People
[26:18.720 --> 26:23.920]  think I was out in the wilderness 20-something years ago talking about this. I opened the
[26:23.920 --> 26:30.040]  phones up and half the callers were saying I was crazy. Well, you try 30, 40 years ago.
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.280]  How about all the callers saying you're crazy and not caring because you know you're doing
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.960]  the right thing. I'm going to cover news in the next segment and get into the latest
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.960]  on Hillary's health and so much more in a bunch of clips. But first off, since I was
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.520]  mentioning this, here's just a stack that illustrates the type of censorship that's
[26:49.520 --> 26:57.680]  going on right now and how it's ramping up. Because they have to now act like naked tyrants
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.280]  because they are naked tyrants and their agenda is being destroyed by the truth. Some
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.360]  to express. Assassination attempt, panic for Julian Assange's intruder, scales Ecuadorian
[27:07.360 --> 27:12.280]  embassy wall. An attempted break-in at the Ecuadorian embassy, where he was found at
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.120]  Julian Assange's living, was foiled this morning. Security was scrambled. He's got
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.920]  to release the intel now. I'm telling you folks, an airplane's going to crash in the building.
[27:19.920 --> 27:25.040]  Something's going to happen. They've got microwave guns they can cook him with. Security was
[27:25.040 --> 27:29.600]  scrambled at the London building, sparking international concern. Assange was the target
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.440]  of an intruder. A statement was put out by WikiLeaks this morning. It stated 16 minutes
[27:34.440 --> 27:40.480]  ago at 2.47 a.m., a cat burglar scaled the side window of the Ecuadorian embassy in London
[27:40.480 --> 27:49.080]  fled after being caught by security. That's where he's been hiding out for years. Now
[27:49.080 --> 27:56.040]  let's tie that into this next story. New York Times tech columnist calls for Google openly
[27:56.040 --> 28:02.040]  to hide Hillary health info. Talk about racketeering. They won't even list Trump as a political
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.800]  candidate until they got caught doing it. They're doing everything they can to gain
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.500]  the statistics. When criminal stuff comes out about her, they bury it. They have daily
[28:09.500 --> 28:15.960]  meetings with Google. Hillary and the White House as well meet with Google more than anyone.
[28:15.960 --> 28:22.120]  That is admitted. And see, they can't hide this now, so they just throw it out your face.
[28:22.120 --> 28:27.240]  And the U.N. is handed control of the Internet and domain names and taking websites down
[28:27.240 --> 28:35.080]  and copyright control outside of law October 1st under TPP. Oh, but who cares about TPP?
[28:35.080 --> 28:43.360]  Obama said, you down with me? It's all cute and funny, isn't it? So this is all happening
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.320]  right now. Meanwhile, Giuliani comes out and I said, he thinks Hillary looks very, very
[28:49.320 --> 28:54.400]  tired. She looks sick. Yeah, no kidding. And we've got another top doctor. You can add
[28:54.400 --> 29:00.320]  to the list that is coming out and saying that she looks like she's got very serious
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.040]  health problems and needs to have an independent panel review her health, just as Dr. Steve
[29:05.040 --> 29:10.560]  Pachennick said here two weeks ago. The top doctor at Rutgers University, professor of
[29:10.560 --> 29:17.080]  medicine, Bob Lahida, said that concerns over Hillary's Clinton's health are not a conspiracy
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.920]  theory, but Hillary said they were and that Clinton should be assessed by an impartial
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.800]  panel of physicians. That's what they do when you're being insured for, you know, a large
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.840]  amount of insurance. You don't just go see a nurse and a doctor, a whole panel looks
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.800]  at you. That's if you're saying getting $50 million of insurance. But not when you're
[29:35.800 --> 29:39.280]  about to be the president of the United States and are falling down and look like you're
[29:39.280 --> 29:43.400]  completely insane. But it's okay because the New York Times says they're keeping their
[29:43.400 --> 29:48.280]  eye on Trump's conspiracy theories. That means questioning known liars because they control
[29:48.280 --> 30:00.760]  reality. They're history's actors, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.760 --> 30:04.560]  American journalism is collapsing before our very eyes. That's right. The mainstream media
[30:04.560 --> 30:08.320]  can no longer report the news rationally because they've ditched objectivity to fight Donald
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.520]  Trump. This is a topic we've covered a lot on info wars.com. And now the New York Post
[30:12.520 --> 30:15.960]  says Michael Goodwin said the same thing. He said the establishment media's shameful
[30:15.960 --> 30:20.760]  display of naked partisanship is unlike anything ever seen in modern America. In particular,
[30:20.760 --> 30:25.960]  the largest broadcast networks, CBS, NBC and ABC and major newspapers like the New York
[30:25.960 --> 30:30.600]  Times and Washington Post have dubbed media ethics and standards to get Hillary elected,
[30:30.600 --> 30:34.480]  Goodwin stated. He also pointed out that while leftist journalists call Hillary Clinton normal
[30:34.480 --> 30:40.640]  and Donald Trump abnormal, the fact is 68% of Americans find Hillary dishonest and untrustworthy,
[30:40.640 --> 30:44.640]  which means the New York Times and other pro-Hillary media are the ones that are abnormal. This
[30:44.640 --> 30:49.600]  establishment bias in the media wasn't always the case. In the 1960s, New York Times would
[30:49.600 --> 30:54.520]  intentionally edit articles, remove the political views of its reporters, except for the articles
[30:54.520 --> 31:23.520]  and the opinion pages. This is Kit Daniels, a check back at info wars.com for more reports.

[32:42.960 --> 32:44.360]  because I'm going back on it today.
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.360]  It just came back in yesterday.

[33:34.280 --> 33:37.240]  First off, this broadcast is listeners supported.
[33:37.240 --> 33:41.040]  About 80%, we have some sponsors, obviously,
[33:41.040 --> 33:42.840]  but about 80% of this news organization
[33:42.840 --> 33:45.680]  is funded by the direct sales of high-quality products
[33:45.680 --> 33:50.280]  at infowarsstore.com and infowarslife.com.
[33:50.280 --> 33:51.840]  And we have assembled thousands
[33:51.840 --> 33:53.920]  of the very best high-quality items
[33:53.920 --> 33:55.960]  at the lowest prices in many cases,
[33:55.960 --> 33:58.560]  but always competitive and your purchases
[33:58.560 --> 34:01.960]  at infowarsstore.com make our broadcast possible.
[34:01.960 --> 34:05.840]  We are going to get some more of this in in a few weeks,
[34:05.840 --> 34:09.920]  but we are going to sell out of this any time now.
[34:09.920 --> 34:12.760]  Living Defense is very hard to source.
[34:12.760 --> 34:14.480]  It is a harmful organism,
[34:14.480 --> 34:18.760]  cleansing dietary supplement with scores of known herbs
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.120]  and plant extracts that have been used by cultures
[34:22.120 --> 34:26.080]  all over the world to get rid of harmful organisms
[34:26.080 --> 34:29.240]  in the gut, in the stomach, in the body.
[34:29.240 --> 34:31.400]  Living Defense is amazing,
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.520]  and I am personally doing a cleanse
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.840]  with Living Defense right now.
[34:35.840 --> 34:36.960]  This is good for yourself.
[34:36.960 --> 34:38.480]  It's good for your children, good for the whole family,
[34:38.480 --> 34:41.160]  but obviously talk to your healthcare provider
[34:41.160 --> 34:42.360]  before you do it.
[34:42.360 --> 34:44.560]  It's available at infowarslife.com
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.200]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[34:48.200 --> 34:53.200]  Now, we have sold out of almost all of my inventory
[34:53.200 --> 34:56.200]  of my 20-plus films that were on DVD.
[34:57.080 --> 34:58.880]  We have a few of my films left,
[34:58.880 --> 35:00.480]  but we're having to collate
[35:00.480 --> 35:04.320]  and look at which specials we can offer right now.
[35:04.320 --> 35:05.960]  So when you get Amerageddon,
[35:05.960 --> 35:09.240]  the new $5 million budget film
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.440]  that's a fictional account of an EMP globalist UN
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.000]  false flag attack produced by Gary Haven
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.560]  and of course, Mike Norris.
[35:20.640 --> 35:21.680]  This film is excellent.
[35:21.680 --> 35:23.880]  One copy is $19.95.
[35:23.880 --> 35:25.880]  You can get a second copy for $19.95,
[35:25.880 --> 35:29.520]  then you get a bottle of Silver Bullet colloidal silver,
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.920]  absolutely free when you get two of the films.
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.640]  And then it's great to donate to the library,
[35:35.640 --> 35:36.680]  donate to a school.
[35:36.680 --> 35:38.160]  It's a professional film.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.840]  I've got a lot of big actors, myself, I'm in it,
[35:40.840 --> 35:42.200]  playing an evil senator.
[35:42.200 --> 35:44.120]  It's really a powerful film.
[35:44.120 --> 35:45.480]  Fox and Friends said,
[35:45.480 --> 35:47.680]  what happens when government turns against you?
[35:47.680 --> 35:48.960]  Ultimate political thriller,
[35:48.960 --> 35:50.520]  all Americans should prepare
[35:50.520 --> 35:51.560]  for this type of situation.
[35:51.560 --> 35:53.720]  Fox and Friends, here's Alex Jones.
[35:53.720 --> 35:56.160]  And this is, say, a powerful tool in the information war
[35:56.160 --> 35:58.640]  to really help wake people up and rally patriots
[35:58.640 --> 36:01.000]  in the cause of freedom and justice.
[36:02.840 --> 36:05.320]  So I would again ask people to get the film,
[36:05.320 --> 36:08.880]  support the broadcast, support and defend it, Patriot,
[36:08.880 --> 36:11.360]  Cinema, with the film,
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.560]  Amerageddon, the special director, producers edition.
[36:15.560 --> 36:17.320]  Now, it's actually gonna come out
[36:17.320 --> 36:19.760]  still in about another week or two.
[36:19.760 --> 36:22.320]  This is taking time to get finished up in the factories.
[36:22.320 --> 36:24.560]  We got the first installment of the DVDs.
[36:24.560 --> 36:26.360]  We're doing a second run right now.
[36:26.360 --> 36:27.960]  It's done on Wednesday.
[36:27.960 --> 36:30.440]  So quite frankly, we might sell out in a few days,
[36:30.440 --> 36:32.160]  but then it'll just be back ordered for a week,
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.760]  and then it'll finally hit stores.
[36:33.760 --> 36:35.600]  We are the exclusive place to get it.
[36:35.600 --> 36:37.280]  But if you order right now,
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.080]  we've got that first run in as we speak.
[36:41.080 --> 36:42.880]  You'll be able to get it quicker than other folks
[36:42.880 --> 36:44.640]  because it's very, very popular.
[36:45.640 --> 36:47.520]  People wanna have this in their archives.
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.600]  They wanna have it in their own personal library
[36:49.600 --> 36:50.960]  with all the censorship coming in,
[36:50.960 --> 36:52.160]  all the internet control.
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.560]  It's more important than ever to archive the internet,
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.400]  to save films, to have a database of information
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.400]  to wake others up.
[36:59.400 --> 37:01.800]  Because this information is only gonna get more powerful
[37:01.800 --> 37:03.360]  if they go to the next phase of tyranny
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.440]  and actually try to start curtailing free speech,
[37:05.440 --> 37:06.920]  which don't think they won't try.
[37:06.920 --> 37:08.320]  We're trying to stop them.
[37:08.320 --> 37:10.600]  We're trying to back them off.
[37:10.600 --> 37:12.160]  Then if we're successful, they'll say,
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.320]  okay, there's been somewhat of a world government,
[37:14.320 --> 37:16.080]  but it didn't totally take over.
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.160]  Like you said, you're discredited.
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.680]  Oh, I thought there wasn't gonna be a world government.
[37:21.800 --> 37:22.840]  I thought the world government's goal
[37:22.840 --> 37:24.240]  wasn't planned austerity.
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.000]  It's all being admitted now,
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.320]  and people are ready to hear the truth.
[37:28.320 --> 37:30.640]  So a lot of specials on the film
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.600]  out of the gates, Amerageddon at infowarsstore.com,
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.600]  or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[37:40.120 --> 37:41.800]  But you see the censorship of Trump.
[37:41.800 --> 37:43.160]  You see the demonization.
[37:43.160 --> 37:45.200]  You see the attacks.
[37:45.200 --> 37:47.120]  You see the New York Times coming out and saying,
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.760]  we've got to shut down this conspiracy culture.
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.160]  It's a globalist conspiracy
[37:53.160 --> 37:55.280]  to set up an unelected planetary government
[37:55.280 --> 37:58.360]  and sign us on to over $2 trillion
[37:58.360 --> 38:00.040]  of fake counterfeit garbage
[38:00.040 --> 38:02.840]  that makes Bernie Madoff look like an angel.
[38:02.840 --> 38:05.280]  George Soros is funding radical Islamists.
[38:05.280 --> 38:06.800]  They're overthrowing countries.
[38:06.800 --> 38:08.360]  They're starting wars with Russia.
[38:08.360 --> 38:10.400]  These people are out of control,
[38:10.400 --> 38:12.880]  like Hitler or the Soviets or something.
[38:14.320 --> 38:17.520]  We have bad megalomaniacs that have hijacked the country.
[38:17.520 --> 38:18.520]  We're fighting back.
[38:18.520 --> 38:19.520]  People are listening.
[38:19.520 --> 38:21.440]  The military is awake.
[38:21.440 --> 38:23.360]  So the globalists are really getting concerned.
[38:23.360 --> 38:26.000]  That's why every video you send out,
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.880]  every DVD you share, every article you share,
[38:28.880 --> 38:30.680]  every podcast stream you share,
[38:30.680 --> 38:32.120]  every YouTube video you share,
[38:32.120 --> 38:34.080]  every video you upload or copy,
[38:34.080 --> 38:35.440]  all of the films I've made,
[38:36.400 --> 38:38.800]  all of the documentaries, all the little news pieces,
[38:38.800 --> 38:40.080]  they're all copyright free
[38:41.120 --> 38:42.960]  for non-commercial educational purposes.
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.400]  I have to keep a limited copyright
[38:44.400 --> 38:46.440]  or people will take them away and say they belong to them.
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.880]  I've actually had folks try that.
[38:47.880 --> 38:49.080]  Oh, there's no copyright.
[38:49.080 --> 38:49.920]  It's mine.
[38:49.920 --> 38:50.880]  You don't own it now.
[38:50.880 --> 38:52.120]  Doesn't work like that.
[38:52.120 --> 38:53.920]  And we've defeated folks in court, by the way,
[38:53.920 --> 38:54.760]  to prove that.
[38:54.760 --> 38:56.560]  So that's how no good deed goes unpunished.
[38:56.560 --> 39:00.680]  But everyone should be hearing my films
[39:00.680 --> 39:02.240]  and other films on Access TV.
[39:02.240 --> 39:03.720]  Everybody should be putting them on YouTube
[39:03.720 --> 39:04.800]  and every other video platform.
[39:04.800 --> 39:06.640]  Everybody should be streaming them on Facebook.
[39:06.640 --> 39:09.680]  Everyone should just be blanketing the web with this stuff
[39:09.680 --> 39:11.320]  so that it's hard for them to censor it.
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.800]  That's the answer.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.480]  They're trying to game things with computers
[39:14.480 --> 39:16.520]  and actuaries and bots.
[39:16.520 --> 39:19.160]  We have to counter it with human intelligence,
[39:19.160 --> 39:20.800]  operating in cyberspace,
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.760]  but also hit the streets physically
[39:22.760 --> 39:26.520]  and show how the George Soros,
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.680]  Hillary hired anti-Trump guns
[39:28.680 --> 39:30.320]  are a bunch of lying trash
[39:30.320 --> 39:32.040]  who are the racist and the idiots.
[39:33.040 --> 39:34.320]  That's just one example.
[39:34.320 --> 39:36.120]  We engage them.
[39:36.120 --> 39:37.800]  We show what happens in Chicago.
[39:37.800 --> 39:38.760]  What happens in LA.
[39:38.760 --> 39:40.800]  What happens in other cities.
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.160]  We show the media lying about who starts the fights.
[39:44.160 --> 39:45.560]  It blows up in their face.
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.480]  They get discredited.
[39:46.480 --> 39:47.440]  They collapse.
[39:47.440 --> 39:49.000]  We just let them lie about stuff.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.480]  We don't send camera crews out.
[39:50.480 --> 39:51.880]  You don't go out and videotape.
[39:51.880 --> 39:52.800]  You don't upload.
[39:52.800 --> 39:54.840]  As a citizen journalist, they win.
[39:56.200 --> 39:57.440]  We lay down, they win.
[39:57.440 --> 39:58.720]  We fight back, we win.
[39:58.720 --> 39:59.720]  We have history.
[39:59.720 --> 40:00.760]  We have the numbers.
[40:00.760 --> 40:01.760]  We have the truth.
[40:01.760 --> 40:02.920]  We have common sense.
[40:02.920 --> 40:03.880]  We have free market.
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.200]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[40:05.200 --> 40:07.720]  we got God on our side when we do the right thing.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.240]  But if we just lay down,
[40:11.800 --> 40:13.440]  Thomas Jefferson was once asked,
[40:13.440 --> 40:17.440]  what is the level of tyranny under which man can live?
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.200]  Is there a limit to what tyrants will foist upon the people?
[40:21.200 --> 40:23.600]  And he said, the limit is what good people will put up with.
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.440]  There is no limit.
[40:26.720 --> 40:27.840]  It's like, why would Europe bring in
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.160]  5 million military aged men, jihadis,
[40:30.160 --> 40:31.560]  80% military aged men?
[40:31.560 --> 40:33.760]  Why would they engage in all this oppression and raping
[40:33.760 --> 40:34.960]  and killing and craziness?
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.720]  And why would the government arrest people all over Europe
[40:37.720 --> 40:38.960]  that criticized it?
[40:38.960 --> 40:41.120]  Because they want to mount your head on the wall.
[40:41.120 --> 40:41.960]  They don't like you.
[40:41.960 --> 40:43.240]  They have criminal energy.
[40:43.240 --> 40:46.000]  They're allied with anything that will bring down the West.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  And if you've gone to third world countries,
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  or you've gone to those, it's always strong men, thugs,
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.680]  that rule over everyone and 90% of the public
[40:54.680 --> 40:56.520]  is in total squalor.
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.520]  That's done by design to control you.
[41:01.560 --> 41:03.840]  So you can be bought for pennies,
[41:04.840 --> 41:08.400]  or just a few rubles, a few shekels, a few euros,
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.200]  a few yon, a few yen.
[41:10.200 --> 41:12.280]  It's called slavery.
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.160]  And the slave master class
[41:15.160 --> 41:17.480]  is setting up the planetary government right now.
[41:19.360 --> 41:20.800]  And they're so arrogant,
[41:21.800 --> 41:24.760]  they will attempt to voice somebody on the public,
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.880]  like Hillary Clinton, despite her criminal past,
[41:27.880 --> 41:31.320]  despite all of her corruption, despite all of her lies,
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.360]  despite her making Libya a failed state by design,
[41:34.360 --> 41:36.480]  despite her claiming that she was in combat,
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.000]  like Brian Williams, they still force feed her
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  that's their arrogance, but another top doctor.
[41:47.120 --> 41:49.800]  Concerns over Hillary's health, not a conspiracy theory,
[41:49.800 --> 41:52.720]  Rutgers University professor of medicine says Clinton
[41:52.720 --> 41:56.480]  should be assessed by a impartial panel of physicians.
[41:56.480 --> 41:59.640]  What did Dr. Steve Pachennick, who's headed up
[41:59.640 --> 42:02.840]  entire neurological facilities?
[42:04.840 --> 42:05.680]  What did he say?
[42:05.680 --> 42:08.400]  A panel of impartial physicians,
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.400]  a panel of impartial neurologist and brain surgeons.
[42:14.080 --> 42:17.440]  That's standard, but it's not happening.
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.240]  Instead, the New York Times says it's a conspiracy theory,
[42:22.240 --> 42:25.280]  and Hillary keeps an eye, like she catches us
[42:25.280 --> 42:27.480]  in the cookie jar, like we're hiding,
[42:27.480 --> 42:29.960]  beavering away out here underground.
[42:31.520 --> 42:33.160]  And the New York Times comes out and says
[42:33.160 --> 42:35.240]  it's time to censor her medical info.
[42:35.240 --> 42:36.800]  Don't anyone see her falling down,
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.320]  or shaking, or sitting?
[42:39.400 --> 42:42.480]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[42:42.480 --> 42:44.520]  They treat us like children.
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.560]  Here's the New York Times.
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.520]  After a shakeup by Trump, Clinton camp
[42:50.520 --> 42:53.320]  keeps wearing a high on conspiracy theorist.
[42:53.320 --> 42:55.760]  And see, they'll take the strongest stuff we talk about
[42:55.760 --> 42:59.320]  and act like, wait till you see this, we caught them.
[42:59.320 --> 43:01.280]  Like they've caught us in something like,
[43:01.280 --> 43:03.160]  they say you need water in the desert.
[43:03.160 --> 43:05.080]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you know.
[43:05.080 --> 43:06.800]  What crazy is what they say next?
[43:06.800 --> 43:09.800]  Again, it's all about the arrested development
[43:09.800 --> 43:12.640]  childlike minds of their supporters,
[43:12.640 --> 43:14.200]  where they just strut around in front of them,
[43:14.200 --> 43:16.040]  acting like they're in charge,
[43:16.040 --> 43:18.440]  and they've got control, and they're invincible,
[43:18.440 --> 43:19.800]  and they're wonderful.
[43:22.320 --> 43:24.960]  Let's go ahead and play the clip
[43:24.960 --> 43:27.400]  by Professor of Medicine Bob Lahida.
[43:27.400 --> 43:28.400]  Here it is.
[43:28.400 --> 43:30.600]  This is a very unusual story with Hillary.
[43:30.600 --> 43:33.680]  Two blood clots, she's had this stroke,
[43:33.680 --> 43:37.520]  which is in 2012, where she has a transverse sinus,
[43:37.520 --> 43:40.200]  very, very rare condition.
[43:40.200 --> 43:42.240]  She hit her head, and they're attributing it
[43:42.240 --> 43:43.440]  to the fact that she hit her head.
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.320]  Then she had a post-concussive syndrome.
[43:45.320 --> 43:47.920]  And if you remember, she was wearing a sunglass
[43:47.920 --> 43:50.320]  at one of the conferences before the Senate,
[43:50.320 --> 43:53.600]  where she had double vision and couldn't see properly.
[43:53.600 --> 43:55.760]  The very fact that she's having these clots
[43:55.760 --> 43:57.680]  and she's had two pouts of thrombosis
[43:57.680 --> 43:59.960]  is disconcerting, to say the least.
[43:59.960 --> 44:02.920]  So you do think then that the concerns objectively,
[44:02.920 --> 44:04.320]  no matter where your politics are,
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.960]  the concerns about her stamina and her health
[44:06.960 --> 44:09.520]  are justified because you have a lot in the liberal media
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.600]  saying this is a conspiracy to disqualify her somehow.
[44:12.600 --> 44:14.200]  I don't think it's a conspiracy.
[44:14.200 --> 44:17.600]  And you go back to the history of our presidents,
[44:17.600 --> 44:20.440]  and we've had many presidents up until Lyndon Johnson
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.760]  who concealed their health during their campaigns,
[44:23.760 --> 44:25.920]  and it had dire effects for our country,
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.920]  going from Kennedy to Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson,
[44:29.920 --> 44:32.320]  whose wife ran the White House for some time.
[44:32.320 --> 44:35.720]  So we have issues here, and I think both candidates
[44:35.720 --> 44:38.360]  should be very forthcoming and have perhaps
[44:38.360 --> 44:41.800]  an impartial panel of physicians review the data
[44:41.800 --> 44:43.320]  and make that kind of a decision
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.440]  before the Americans go to the polls.
[44:45.440 --> 44:47.280]  Now, notice that's relegated to Fox Business.
[44:47.280 --> 44:49.280]  Now, used to that being on regular Fox,
[44:49.280 --> 44:50.400]  they're killing Fox.
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.680]  Now, when I watch it as a media person,
[44:52.680 --> 44:54.760]  as a person that runs a news organization,
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.960]  I mean, the average person can see it clearly too,
[44:56.960 --> 44:59.840]  but I can see what's being loaded in the teleprompters.
[44:59.840 --> 45:02.480]  I can tell the people have horrible looks
[45:02.480 --> 45:04.280]  on their faces when they're saying this
[45:04.280 --> 45:07.520]  because they're not used to just flat out lying to people.
[45:08.800 --> 45:10.720]  And again, a lot of folks up there have been threatened
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.080]  that if you don't start telling the line for Hillary,
[45:14.080 --> 45:15.880]  you're gonna be thrown off the air.
[45:17.040 --> 45:18.240]  And that's what could make Trump,
[45:18.240 --> 45:20.760]  if he's not successful in this election,
[45:20.760 --> 45:23.760]  if he's robbed, start a successful new Fox
[45:23.760 --> 45:25.800]  because they're killing it on purpose.
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.560]  So that opens a vacuum for something more like Fox News.
[45:30.560 --> 45:31.760]  Not that Fox is perfect,
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.160]  but a lot better obviously than CNN.
[45:35.160 --> 45:36.960]  Well, not anymore.
[45:36.960 --> 45:38.720]  Here's Rudolph Giuliani pointing out,
[45:38.720 --> 45:41.160]  hey, she looks sick, she doesn't look well.
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.720]  I was to point out several signs of illness by her.
[45:45.720 --> 45:47.280]  What you gotta do is go online.
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.400]  Wait, her campaign and a number of people defending her
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.400]  saying there's nothing factual to the claims about her health
[45:54.400 --> 45:57.400]  and that speculation at best.
[45:57.400 --> 46:00.600]  So go online and put down Hillary Clinton illness,
[46:00.600 --> 46:03.360]  take a look at the videos for yourself.
[46:03.360 --> 46:05.400]  And of course, how does the New York Times respond?
[46:05.400 --> 46:08.160]  Because we've been saying Google Hillary Clinton illness,
[46:08.160 --> 46:09.840]  Google Hillary Clinton blood clot,
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.960]  Hillary Clinton brain tumor, Hillary Clinton Parkinson's,
[46:12.960 --> 46:14.960]  Hillary Clinton doctors.
[46:14.960 --> 46:16.640]  And we have the New York Times coming out saying
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.640]  it's time to censor and not let you see
[46:21.640 --> 46:24.560]  what's being said or what's being done.
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.760]  Isn't that just cute?
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.640]  Because they're keeping an eye on things.
[46:29.640 --> 46:32.880]  And they're gonna make sure as an adult,
[46:32.880 --> 46:35.440]  because they're the adults, you're the child,
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.040]  no matter how old you are, you can be 100 years old.
[46:37.040 --> 46:39.840]  The New York Times is conscious, they're intellectuals,
[46:39.840 --> 46:42.120]  they know what you're allowed to see.
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.240]  And so they're gonna delist things working with Google,
[46:46.240 --> 46:47.760]  the White House already admits they've been doing this
[46:47.760 --> 46:51.280]  with Google, to just make sure you can't find that stuff.
[46:51.280 --> 46:53.520]  That's not totalitarianism, that's not corruption,
[46:53.520 --> 46:54.680]  that's not a problem.
[46:54.680 --> 46:56.840]  Meanwhile, they're weaponizing the whole
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.160]  race-baiting more than ever.
[46:59.760 --> 47:02.520]  And when racist groups of black people beat up whites,
[47:02.520 --> 47:05.240]  on basically a daily basis, the media covers it up,
[47:05.240 --> 47:07.240]  which then only exacerbates it more
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.120]  and makes people think that's normal and good to do.
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.000]  No, if the Ku Klux Klan was running around,
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.200]  beating up or shooting or attacking black people
[47:15.200 --> 47:17.320]  out of the clear blue, it should be on the news,
[47:17.320 --> 47:19.960]  it should be wrong, they should be prosecuted.
[47:19.960 --> 47:22.280]  That's not a good thing to do.
[47:22.280 --> 47:25.280]  But see, it's okay because they're trying
[47:25.280 --> 47:28.360]  to foment racial division in, quote, minority groups
[47:28.360 --> 47:30.160]  that make up the broken strategy
[47:30.160 --> 47:31.480]  of all the minorities together,
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.200]  making the new majority under the Democratic Party
[47:34.200 --> 47:35.920]  who formerly ran the KKK,
[47:35.920 --> 47:38.400]  and is now just shifting that strategy.
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.520]  And that's why we have Joe Biden.
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.560]  Not just Kane, Hillary's VP pick,
[47:43.560 --> 47:45.160]  but Joe Biden just last year saying,
[47:45.160 --> 47:48.560]  whites will be a majority, a minority,
[47:48.560 --> 47:51.000]  whites will be a minority in 2017,
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.240]  and that's a good thing.
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.680]  It wouldn't matter if we made politics about issues
[47:56.680 --> 47:59.000]  and ideas and free market,
[48:00.600 --> 48:05.040]  and about better policies and more constitutional policies.
[48:05.040 --> 48:07.480]  But see, they're making it all about race,
[48:07.480 --> 48:10.480]  and now saying the minorities are gonna vote racially
[48:10.480 --> 48:12.840]  for policies against the minority,
[48:12.840 --> 48:16.280]  the essence of classism and racism,
[48:16.280 --> 48:18.880]  the textbook definition.
[48:19.840 --> 48:22.440]  But it's okay because it's Joe Biden.
[48:22.440 --> 48:24.160]  Let's play that clip.
[48:24.160 --> 48:25.720]  Not only our Muslim communities,
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.000]  but African communities, Asian communities,
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  Hispanic communities, and the wave still continues.
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.720]  It's not gonna stop, nor should we want it to stop.
[48:37.720 --> 48:39.000]  As a matter of fact,
[48:40.680 --> 48:43.920]  it's one of the things I think we can be most proud of.
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.960]  So, there's a second thing in that black box,
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.960]  an unrelenting stream of immigration, nonstop, nonstop.
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.600]  Folks like me who were Caucasian of European descent
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.200]  for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute minority
[49:04.200 --> 49:06.280]  in the United States of America.
[49:06.280 --> 49:10.600]  Absolute minority, fewer than 50% of the people in America.
[49:10.600 --> 49:15.600]  Most of them, then and on, will be white European stock.
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.120]  That's not a bad thing.
[49:18.120 --> 49:21.440]  That's a source of our strength, and so.
[49:21.440 --> 49:22.920]  All right, now in Europe it's even worse
[49:22.920 --> 49:25.040]  where they say whites are inherently bad,
[49:25.040 --> 49:27.080]  it's good the Muslims are raping our women,
[49:27.080 --> 49:28.880]  you know, the Green Party and all those folks,
[49:28.880 --> 49:30.800]  and women don't wear short skirts, it's your fault,
[49:30.800 --> 49:32.720]  we're gonna make you take charita classes.
[49:32.720 --> 49:35.160]  It's actually happening so that you can submit.
[49:35.160 --> 49:40.160]  Now, again, they claim it's all colorblind,
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.040]  Martin Luther King, whites sit there
[49:46.040 --> 49:48.520]  and demilitarize the whole situation,
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.360]  and then the Democrats just flip the script completely over
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.360]  and now turn it into race,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.320]  and will now base it on racial politics
[50:01.320 --> 50:04.080]  by minorities against whites.
[50:04.080 --> 50:06.160]  But, of course, the minorities really won't get anything
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.120]  in that equation except rhetoric that makes them feel good.
[50:09.120 --> 50:10.480]  I'm gonna skip this network break,
[50:10.480 --> 50:12.880]  because I wanna have time to get to this next clip.
[50:14.400 --> 50:15.920]  And that is Mark Dice.
[50:15.920 --> 50:19.720]  This video is up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.080]  Please don't just go watch the video if you're a radio listener.
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.520]  We're also simulcasttv, infowars.com,
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.120]  forward slash show to find all the free feeds
[50:27.120 --> 50:29.320]  and podcasts and everything right now.
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.320]  Send this out to everyone, because imagine, they've done studies.
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.120]  Most of the white people in this country today
[50:41.160 --> 50:43.320]  come from white immigrants who got here
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.160]  after slavery was banned.
[50:46.160 --> 50:49.040]  Like, I should do a video with the actual numbers,
[50:49.040 --> 50:50.840]  but more people, it's a fact.
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.440]  You can just search engine until, I guess, Google delisted.
[50:54.440 --> 50:59.440]  More people came into the US after 1867
[51:01.320 --> 51:04.680]  who were white that had come here before.
[51:05.560 --> 51:08.640]  A larger population came in than was already here,
[51:08.640 --> 51:12.240]  had nothing to do with slavery from Southern Europe,
[51:12.240 --> 51:14.360]  Eastern Europe, Europe, you name it.
[51:14.360 --> 51:16.040]  And it was England at the time,
[51:16.040 --> 51:18.640]  starting in the 1820s, that banned slavery
[51:18.640 --> 51:21.080]  and was attacking ships all over the world
[51:21.080 --> 51:23.880]  and was at war sometimes with more than 10 countries
[51:23.880 --> 51:25.720]  that wanted to end slavery.
[51:27.520 --> 51:30.040]  But you notice, everybody says England invented slavery
[51:30.040 --> 51:31.480]  because England ended slavery.
[51:31.480 --> 51:34.120]  It's upside down, world folks.
[51:34.120 --> 51:37.480]  England was actually attacking US ships at times.
[51:37.480 --> 51:41.040]  That's why the importation of slaves stopped by 1800
[51:41.040 --> 51:44.400]  or even earlier, because England would attack you.
[51:44.400 --> 51:47.520]  Because the evil white Christian abolitionists in England
[51:47.520 --> 51:50.840]  that would burn buildings down if you didn't ban it.
[51:50.840 --> 51:53.800]  Now the Muslims were doing it in dozens of countries
[51:53.800 --> 51:55.200]  until the 1960s.
[51:55.200 --> 51:57.280]  Two Muslim countries still have slavery,
[51:57.280 --> 51:59.160]  but it's okay, because it's their culture.
[52:01.920 --> 52:04.520]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[52:04.520 --> 52:07.520]  But again, it's the ignorant, dumbed-down population.
[52:07.520 --> 52:10.040]  So you got Joe Biden spouting all his racist garbage,
[52:10.040 --> 52:13.200]  all his Balkanization, a divide and conquer garbage,
[52:14.480 --> 52:16.480]  so that minorities who are the majority now,
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.120]  by the way, most areas, don't call for a piece of the pie.
[52:20.120 --> 52:21.760]  Don't call for a level playing field.
[52:21.760 --> 52:24.560]  Don't call for their basic rights of due process
[52:24.560 --> 52:26.960]  and free market and things that will make you happy
[52:26.960 --> 52:28.400]  and successful historically.
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.320]  No, no, no, it's your racial identity,
[52:30.320 --> 52:32.600]  and you're gonna be represented by your local racial leader
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.600]  and the Democrats that pat you on the head.
[52:36.440 --> 52:39.040]  Which then forces whites into a race-based system
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.360]  to defend themselves.
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.200]  And then the government, like a prison warden,
[52:44.200 --> 52:46.680]  manages the prison with everyone segregated.
[52:46.680 --> 52:49.720]  This is an admitted Roman program.
[52:49.720 --> 52:51.960]  2,000-plus years old.
[52:51.960 --> 52:54.560]  But the public doesn't read history books, do they?
[52:55.560 --> 52:58.000]  The British called it the Great Game.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.200]  You might wanna look into it.
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.360]  That's how they controlled India.
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.480]  Couple thousand British controlled
[53:02.480 --> 53:05.480]  tens of millions of people with divide and conquer.
[53:05.480 --> 53:07.720]  And you're like, well, Indians all kinda look alike.
[53:07.720 --> 53:08.720]  Well, actually, they don't.
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.120]  It was a diverse country.
[53:10.120 --> 53:12.080]  No, they played different tribes and religions
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.560]  off against each other, and it was the exact same deal.
[53:14.560 --> 53:17.160]  So I know I harp on this.
[53:17.160 --> 53:19.960]  There's a reason we've got weaponized media pushing this,
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.840]  and why it's so good that Donald Trump
[53:21.840 --> 53:23.560]  is crashing through all of it,
[53:23.560 --> 53:27.840]  unifying us around religious rights and free market
[53:27.840 --> 53:30.400]  and sovereignty and the right to defense
[53:30.400 --> 53:31.960]  and the right to contract.
[53:31.960 --> 53:35.360]  The Renaissance versus the globalist program
[53:35.360 --> 53:37.760]  that is just a repeat of the Middle Ages.
[53:41.360 --> 53:42.360]  So here it is.
[53:42.360 --> 53:44.160]  Imagine a tax cut.
[53:44.160 --> 53:45.840]  Imagine a tax cut.
[53:49.640 --> 53:51.440]  See, not a tax cut for veterans
[53:51.440 --> 53:53.360]  because you went and sacrificed and did something,
[53:53.360 --> 53:55.840]  and no matter what color you are, you went and did it,
[53:55.840 --> 53:58.760]  so you get a break on taxes to go to college.
[53:58.760 --> 53:59.640]  I'm all for that.
[53:59.640 --> 54:02.120]  When you've done something special,
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.040]  when you've put something on the line,
[54:05.640 --> 54:08.200]  but not because you're white, not because you're black.
[54:08.200 --> 54:10.480]  Oh, but remember Bernie Sanders said,
[54:10.480 --> 54:12.400]  white people don't know what it's like.
[54:12.400 --> 54:14.840]  We cue them up later, but don't be poor.
[54:18.840 --> 54:23.840]  There are massive numbers statistically of whites
[54:25.720 --> 54:29.880]  in the poverty category than blacks.
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.280]  Now blacks have a higher percentage of poverty,
[54:32.280 --> 54:34.320]  obviously because it's a lower population,
[54:34.320 --> 54:36.360]  but it's not anywhere near the general number.
[54:36.360 --> 54:38.480]  It is the most crazy statement ever,
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.400]  and everybody knows that.
[54:39.400 --> 54:41.160]  We went out on the street and talked to people,
[54:41.160 --> 54:42.840]  especially black folks, who are like, that's ridiculous,
[54:42.840 --> 54:44.080]  so there's not any poor white people.
[54:44.080 --> 54:46.240]  That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
[54:46.240 --> 54:47.360]  That's ridiculous.
[54:51.560 --> 54:54.560]  But again, this is the attack on common sense,
[54:54.560 --> 54:56.520]  and so you go to people and you say,
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.480]  oh, because someone's black,
[54:58.480 --> 55:00.000]  they're now gonna get this,
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.160]  when most of the white people that came to this country
[55:02.160 --> 55:03.560]  have no connection to slavery,
[55:03.560 --> 55:06.200]  and then if you go back to the people that were here,
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.480]  2% of southerners, 2% of southern families
[55:10.480 --> 55:11.560]  had quote slaves.
[55:11.560 --> 55:15.240]  So half or more were never even here during this,
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.000]  then you've got 2% of those that were here,
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.200]  and then now you're supposed to pay reparations,
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.360]  which isn't gonna even help anybody.
[55:27.360 --> 55:29.360]  It's all designed to create
[55:29.360 --> 55:31.240]  this wealth redistribution system
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.000]  so that the globalists have us totally dependent,
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.600]  and so people dream of wealth redistribution
[55:35.600 --> 55:38.560]  instead of dreaming of starting their own business.
[55:38.560 --> 55:39.920]  This is how you kill the free market.
[55:39.920 --> 55:42.680]  Let's play part of this Mark Dice report.
[55:42.680 --> 55:46.080]  President Obama has announced that he's gonna be giving
[55:46.080 --> 55:48.520]  African-Americans a 10% tax break
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.240]  just to try to help heal the racial wounds
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.200]  that you guys have experienced over the years.
[55:55.200 --> 55:59.840]  Just getting people's comments to this news this morning.
[56:01.920 --> 56:03.480]  I don't know, I'm just hearing it,
[56:03.480 --> 56:06.720]  and if he feels that's what he wants to do,
[56:06.720 --> 56:07.720]  it's okay with me.
[56:07.720 --> 56:09.200]  Are you looking forward to saving some money
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.320]  on your income taxes, being a person of color?
[56:12.320 --> 56:13.920]  Sure, why not?
[56:13.920 --> 56:17.320]  I mean, we've had a lot of heartache in the past,
[56:17.320 --> 56:20.640]  and I'm not going back to everything that happened, but...
[56:20.640 --> 56:21.960]  Do you think 10% is enough?
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.320]  A lot of people were suggesting
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.840]  that it should have been 20% tax break.
[56:25.840 --> 56:27.600]  I think at this point, anything that's given
[56:27.600 --> 56:29.080]  is significant.
[56:29.080 --> 56:31.080]  Good enough, at least it's a start, you think?
[56:31.080 --> 56:31.920]  Yes. 10%?
[56:31.920 --> 56:33.280]  Okay, all right, thank you, sir.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.560]  I think it's a great thing.
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.680]  I mean, obviously there's been a big divide
[56:36.680 --> 56:39.320]  with the whole judicial system
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.080]  and just kind of like the whole cop situation,
[56:41.080 --> 56:42.720]  all the rights we've been having.
[56:42.720 --> 56:44.400]  Probably the least we can do.
[56:44.400 --> 56:45.360]  Do you think maybe it should have been
[56:45.360 --> 56:48.480]  like a 25% tax break instead,
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.040]  or should he increase the tax break?
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.240]  I mean, yeah, I don't think it would be unjustified
[57:00.240 --> 57:02.760]  to say that he could do that.
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.760]  I mean, I think it's pretty equal.
[57:10.560 --> 57:13.440]  You think it was about time for that equality measure
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.040]  to be put in place to give the black people a tax break?
[57:18.040 --> 57:20.760]  I mean, it's a step in the right direction.
[57:20.760 --> 57:22.320]  New words.
[57:22.320 --> 57:23.200]  Black lives matter.
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.840]  Big news this morning, Obama's new tax break
[57:25.840 --> 57:28.920]  for POC people of color.
[57:28.920 --> 57:32.040]  10% tax break for African-Americans and Latinos.
[57:32.040 --> 57:34.080]  Let's go ahead and say this now.
[57:34.080 --> 57:36.680]  The full report is up on infowars.com.
[57:36.680 --> 57:39.560]  And I was about to talk to Daria in the control room
[57:39.560 --> 57:40.800]  when she popped in my ear and said,
[57:40.800 --> 57:45.800]  you know, Russia didn't abolish slavery until the 1860s.
[57:46.120 --> 57:50.360]  And that was the Czar's who were really German royalty
[57:50.360 --> 57:53.560]  or Hungarian royalty, Transylvanian royalty,
[57:53.560 --> 57:54.480]  if you want to get technical,
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.280]  same family as the House of Windsor, that's a fake name.
[57:58.280 --> 58:00.080]  And I was going to mention Germany though.
[58:00.080 --> 58:03.640]  Some Austrian-Hungarian provinces in Germany
[58:03.640 --> 58:08.640]  didn't in slavery till 1882 give memory serves.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.200]  I think it was Bismarck, but we'll look it up.
[58:11.200 --> 58:13.280]  Those were white slaves.
[58:13.280 --> 58:15.120]  In fact, if you had a name, Swartz, it meant slave.
[58:15.120 --> 58:15.960]  Swartz and anger.
[58:16.960 --> 58:20.400]  I mean, it means black, I mean, suntan from being outside.
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.720]  But we're going to come back to Daria in a moment
[58:22.720 --> 58:24.080]  who I would imagine from Russia.
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.040]  Most of the people in Russia were serfs,
[58:26.040 --> 58:27.800]  was the name in Russia, slaves.
[58:27.800 --> 58:31.520]  So does she get reparations from Russians today,
[58:31.520 --> 58:34.200]  even though most of them were slaves as well?
[58:34.200 --> 58:37.000]  I mean, it's just the ignorance of the public
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.320]  is unbelievable that only black people were ever slaves,
[58:40.320 --> 58:43.200]  because that's what Hollywood wants you to think.
[58:43.200 --> 58:47.400]  Sharecroppers, indentured servants, it goes on and on.
[58:47.400 --> 58:48.240]  We'll be right back.
[58:48.240 --> 58:50.080]  Penal colonies, Australia.
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.760]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[58:51.760 --> 58:53.240]  You can't survive without it.
[58:53.240 --> 58:54.400]  But where do you get it?
[58:54.400 --> 58:58.000]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.440]  water filtration system that is like no other.
[59:00.440 --> 59:02.720]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water
[59:02.720 --> 59:04.480]  from virtually any fresh source
[59:04.480 --> 59:06.320]  into clean, healthy drinking water,
[59:06.320 --> 59:09.040]  pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power
[59:09.040 --> 59:10.840]  of an all-new gravity block core
[59:10.840 --> 59:12.560]  with a hybrochromatic shell.
[59:12.560 --> 59:16.800]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities,
[59:16.800 --> 59:19.640]  including bacteria, viruses, fluoride,
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.600]  disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[59:23.600 --> 59:26.000]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.520]  Stainless fuel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance.

[59:49.120 --> 59:52.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:59.120 --> 1:00:03.120]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:05.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  Mother, tell your children,
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:13.120]  they're not going to listen to you.
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:16.120]  They're not going to listen to you.
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:19.120]  Mother, tell your children,
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:22.120]  they're not going to walk my way.
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:25.120]  Tell your children, they're not going to listen to you.
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  Now, Daria is an Army veteran
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  in supporting special ops and things like that.
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  And she's been to the Defense Language School, you name it.
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:34.120]  She's also born in Russia.
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  And so she helps us do great translations
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:38.120]  of some of the Russian news here on air.
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:39.120]  That's her voice you hear.
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.120]  But I was really thinking about going to her to go,
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  Daria, most people, I think it was like 80%,
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.120]  90% depending on the period in Russian history
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:51.120]  were called serfs and they lived on the land,
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  they were owned by the nobles, Germany until the 1880s
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.120]  in some of its provinces of the Austrian Hungarian Empire.
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:59.120]  People can look, in fact, Google,
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  when was slavery abolished in Germany?
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:03.120]  And it's the 1880s.
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  When was it abolished in Russia, the 1880s?
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  You tell the average trendy that they look at you
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:09.120]  like you are crazy.
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:11.120]  You ask them where slavery came from.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  There it is, Emancipation Reform of 1861
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:17.120]  was the first and most important liberal reforms
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:20.120]  affected during the reign of Emperor Alexander,
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:21.120]  the second of Russia,
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:23.120]  reform effectively abolished serfdom
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  throughout the Russian Empire.
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  And then you can argue then,
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  when it came after that, here come the Communists.
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.120]  Because the truth was, yes,
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:34.120]  slavery in the Caribbean was even more brutal
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.120]  than it was here in North America.
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:38.120]  And they were pretty brutal there in Russia,
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:41.120]  but not to the level of some of the extreme stuff
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.120]  you saw with the African slave trade,
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  which was based on the Arab slave trade.
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  But that's okay, because they got brown skin.
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.120]  Daria, you wanted to comment on this, go ahead.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  Yes, Alex.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:57.120]  So when I was watching the Mark Dice video,
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:01:59.120]  that's the first thing that came to my mind.
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:02.120]  I was like, well, I come from Russia
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:05.120]  and they've done away with slavery in 1861
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:08.120]  with the Tsar Alexander II.
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  So what am I being responsible for
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  with all the black people in the United States?
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  Or even if I were in Russia.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:18.120]  You're a racist person.
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:21.120]  You don't want to pay reparations like Jesse Jackson
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  and Bill Clinton, everybody want you to?
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:26.120]  Well, I just want to talk to a black person
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:28.120]  who would confront me on that
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.120]  and convince me why I should be responsible
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  with my taxes to pay them anything.
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.120]  Like, what is their argument?
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  Well, again, I have to be fair here.
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:41.120]  It's the globalist creating divide and conquer
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:43.120]  that are actually pushing this.
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:45.120]  It's mainly trendy whites that are actually pushing it
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:46.120]  if you research it.
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:48.120]  But there are some of these globalist, quote,
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  black groups that are out there pushing it
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:52.120]  and that's what I want to tell them.
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:54.120]  I mean, let's say, which of course they didn't,
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:56.120]  let's say some great-great-grandfather of mine
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:58.120]  was involved in something bad like that.
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  Okay, I'm not them.
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.120]  I mean, if my dad was a murderer, which he's not,
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  am I guilty for that?
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:06.120]  I mean, I'm trying to understand how,
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  under the sitalitarianism,
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  it's like if my neighbor robs a bank,
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:11.120]  do I then go to jail, Daria?
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.120]  Right.
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  Well, I also wanted to make a point
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:17.120]  on the fact that white people cannot be poor,
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  supposedly, or don't know what it's like to be poor.
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  In the Soviet Union, 99% of population were equally poor.
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  They were all equal and they were all poor.
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  And my family, my mother had to work three jobs
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  just to get by.
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:32.120]  And it was a real tough life.
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.120]  And that's why, you know, she made it her goal in life
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:38.120]  to have a better life for me
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:41.120]  and to bring me to sort of this land of opportunities
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:43.120]  that United States was supposed to be.
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:47.120]  How much has it changed since you first got here?
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  Well, you know, I compare how much United States
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  have changed based on how much military has changed.
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.120]  I joined the military in 2000.
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  And compared to what it is now,
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:01.120]  it's like day and night.
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.120]  I mean, we're talking about, you know,
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:07.120]  gay people are allowed to be in the military now.
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  They're wearing high heels and the standards
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:12.120]  have become so much lower than what I really need.
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:13.120]  Oh, it's clearly the sabotage.
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:15.120]  I mean, it's clearly the sabotage.
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:17.120]  What about black ops?
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.120]  I mean, you can't talk about it,
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.120]  but you were in some of the most secretive stuff.
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:24.120]  I mean, have they been able to water that down, any?
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:29.120]  Well, I believe that the regular special forces
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  in the Army have been watered down a lot
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:36.120]  and they have been allowing people, just basically anybody,
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  to enter special forces.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:41.120]  And that's just the mainstream special forces.
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  All right, thank you, Daria.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:43.120]  We'll talk to you more.
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.120]  There you go, though.
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:45.120]  She's guilty.
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:46.120]  Let's go out to break with Bernie Sanders, though.
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:47.120]  Here it is.
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  to be living in a ghetto.
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:58.120]  when you walk down the street.
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:59.120]  Bernie Sanders knows what it's like
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:00.120]  to have crap for brains.
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:01.120]  It sounds like Hillary Clinton's health
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:03.120]  are not a conspiracy theory.
[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:05.120]  And Hillary should be accessed by impartial panel physicians.
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:07.120]  According to Rutgers University professor
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:08.120]  of medicine, Bob Lahita.
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:10.120]  According to a report by Paul Joseph Watson,
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:12.120]  Lahita told Fox Business that he agreed
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:15.120]  with Dr. Drew on several points about Hillary's health.
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:17.120]  This is a very unusual story with Hillary, said Lahita,
[1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:19.120]  referring to her health history, including two blood clots,
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:22.120]  a stroke, and post-concussion syndrome,
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:24.120]  which forced Hillary to wear special prison glasses
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:25.120]  to counter her double vision.
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:27.120]  The very fact that she's having these clots
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.120]  since she's had two bouts of thombosis
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:31.120]  is disconcerting, to say the least, he added.
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:33.120]  And when asked whether concerns over Hillary's health
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:35.120]  were objectively authentic regardless of politics
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:37.120]  or whether the leftist media was right
[1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:39.120]  to label the issue of conspiracy theory,
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.120]  Lahita responded, I don't think it's conspiracy.
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  He said, quote,
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:44.120]  if you go back to the history of our presidents
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:46.120]  and we've had many presidents who concealed their health
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:47.120]  during their campaigns,
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:49.120]  and it had dire effects on her country.
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:51.120]  And similarly, last week, Dr. Drew said
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:53.120]  he's gravely concerned about Hillary's health,
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:55.120]  noting that the treatment she's received is bizarre.

[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:11.120]  that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology,

[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:03.120]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.120]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:09.120]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:12.120]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ,
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:15.120]  and how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the food
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:19.120]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:23.120]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:27.120]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:30.120]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:34.120]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:37.120]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:43.120]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:45.120]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:48.120]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential,
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:51.120]  in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:12.120]  As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:17.120]  Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest,
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.120]  the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:25.120]  a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man,
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:28.120]  now began to favor different traits.
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:33.120]  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  and more intelligent, but as time went on,
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:41.120]  things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction, a dumbing down.
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:46.120]  Harvard researchers have found children who live in high-flooride areas
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:48.120]  have significantly lower IQs.
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  Enjoy your extra-big-ass fries!
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:55.120]  Researchers found members of Congress, on average,
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:58.120]  speak at a tenth grade level.
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:01.120]  Most Americans read at an eighth or ninth grade level.
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:04.120]  Look, now I'll talk slow, so you can understand me.
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:10.120]  It was just a few thousand years ago that our ancestors were using primitive brunts to communicate.
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:15.120]  Hillary's a good leader. I trust Hillary.
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  Hillary is a good leader.
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  I stand here as a freed slave.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:25.120]  You are so dumb, you are really dumb, for real.
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:29.120]  Mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  You're a f***ing white man!
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:35.120]  You want to know what I found out?
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:38.120]  Most of England speaks American-ish.
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:41.120]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.120]  I've come too far.
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:49.120]  I believe that our education, like, such as South Africa and Iraq,
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:51.120]  everywhere, like, such as.
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:54.120]  And I believe that they should...
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:58.120]  Our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S.
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:00.120]  or should help South Africa.
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:01.120]  What does that mean?
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:04.120]  Mercury-containing vacuum may help not harm kids
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.120]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:12.120]  We now go live to violence channel correspondent for Micah Davis
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:16.120]  at the Extreme Court with highlights on today's trial.
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:22.120]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:36.120]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:44.120]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:46.120]  Nin-nin-nin-nin-nin-yir.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.120]  A great dust bowl had ravaged food supplies,
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:53.120]  and the number one movie in the country was called Ask.
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:57.120]  Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory.
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:00.120]  I'll see if that doesn't make any sense.
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:02.120]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:03.120]  What does that mean?
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:06.580]  Obama, you should run for a third term because you need to do it.
[1:11:06.580 --> 1:11:08.460]  Obama, third term!
[1:11:08.460 --> 1:11:10.460]  How many sides does a triangle have?
[1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:13.420]  Damn, four.
[1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:14.420]  There's no side.
[1:11:18.420 --> 1:11:21.120]  What's Osama Bin Laden most infamous for?
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:21.820]  Osama?
[1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:22.420]  Yeah.
[1:11:22.420 --> 1:11:23.320]  Or Obama?
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:24.520]  Osama.
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:26.120]  I have no idea who Osama is.
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:28.820]  Which state does KFC come from?
[1:11:28.820 --> 1:11:33.320]  What, the chicken?
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:34.320]  I don't know.
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:35.320]  I really don't know.
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:37.320]  Okay, do you know what KFC stands for?
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:38.820]  Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[1:11:38.820 --> 1:11:44.820]  A little further south from that facility, there's a completely separate building where they get this.
[1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:50.320]  Change raw sewage water into water people drink.
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:52.320]  Like out the toilet?
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:54.320]  But Brando's got what plants crave.
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:55.820]  It's got a detriment.
[1:11:55.820 --> 1:12:02.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:04.320]  That's your hair we'd be picking up.
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:05.820]  And for worse, not talking.
[1:12:10.820 --> 1:12:11.820]  Circus, everybody!
[1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:12.320]  Look!
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:13.820]  Look at the monkey!
[1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:14.820]  Look at the monkey!
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:15.820]  Look at the monkey!
[1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:25.820]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, I'm Alex Jones, your host for the next two hours in studio, we have a real treat.
[1:12:25.820 --> 1:12:35.820]  Gary Haven, one of my favorite guests, the producer of Amerageddon, billionaire successful entrepreneur here in America, and one of the leading funders of the anti-new world order movement.
[1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:55.820]  And then, of course, we've got Steve Quayle, who I've known for 21 years over the phone in studio with us, and the world's so crazy right now that Steve Quayle, normally, who stays out west, out in Montana and places, has actually been flying around with Gary Haven at the controls of his jet, flying himself around the country,
[1:12:55.820 --> 1:13:05.820]  speaking to capacity crowds and going on international television programs, and you guys just met with a federal agent about some really important stuff dealing with stingray and phones.
[1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:17.820]  I personally have had multiple of my phones where people go in and start typing and take it over, I had to get rid of my old phone number before it, and then start calling people and sending databases.
[1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:30.820]  And then now people I know it's happening, this just happened this weekend, when someone I know was just sending someone a message, and then it was sending messages back from their phones saying, do you have this particular drug?
[1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:37.820]  And so they were sending it from their phone, and they could see the message had been sent. I guess to have databases is just to set everybody up.
[1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:49.820]  Just like the DEA admittedly has their parallel construction where they have total access to the NSA, I've had the former technical director of the NSA on William Benny just two weeks ago about this, and he said they have all the Hillary's emails, they have everything,
[1:13:49.820 --> 1:14:02.820]  and he said that it all goes through that database, they're saving it, and the DEA, the IRS all have access to it, they go in, and then they basically make up a fake investigation and plant evidence when they want to bust you.
[1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:13.820]  So when I say the police aren't our enemy, I mean the local cop changing tires, writing tickets, going to domestic disputes, it's a terrible job, they're great men and women on average, they're good people, our local police departments are good on average.
[1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:21.820]  But the DEA, the CIA, a lot of the FBI, it's global, it's a run now, so you want to get into this big subject, we'll do it the next hour.
[1:14:21.820 --> 1:14:28.820]  I'm not really teasing it, you just mentioned it, and you guys were debating how far you could go with it when we were talking, so let's talk about it during some of the breaks.
[1:14:28.820 --> 1:14:38.820]  Let's get into the people that say there's no threat of nuclear war, let's get into what's happening in the economy, let's cover the waterfront with Gary Haven and Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[1:14:38.820 --> 1:14:40.820]  Steve, it is amazing to have you here with us.
[1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:52.820]  Hey Alex, this is just a delight, and ladies and gentlemen, for me to come out of Montana, I think Alex put it very succinctly, and the timing of all the events taking place are becoming so problematic,
[1:14:52.820 --> 1:15:01.820]  so in our face that now everything Alex, you and I used to talk about all the time, still talk about daily for you, daily or weekly when I'm on the radio with you or someone else.
[1:15:01.820 --> 1:15:08.820]  But here's the thing, it's in motion. Years ago, we were telling you the day would come when this would be an effect, this would be an effect, and this would be an effect.
[1:15:08.820 --> 1:15:11.820]  Now it's all in effect, and people can't deny it.
[1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:18.820]  So the urgency, and you rightly picked it up last week when you interviewed me, I have never felt a more urgent time in my spirit.
[1:15:18.820 --> 1:15:30.820]  And look, I've been on talk radio 25 years, 9,000 plus hours, interview after interview after interview, but by the time that we're talking about all these things, Alex, we're talking about the headlines.
[1:15:30.820 --> 1:15:40.820]  You and I basically spoke into existence years ago, and I don't know of a better, and this is not flattery, it's just a true statement.
[1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:49.820]  I've made this statement, I think the Infowars Journalistic and Investigative Skills are second to none, and that again is what I am just proud to say.
[1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:52.820]  Well, I mean, not me. You've got an amazing team.
[1:15:52.820 --> 1:16:17.820]  You know, the guy who was failing, who was in Seattle and moved here a few years ago, does an amazing job, is in touch with all the White Hat Hackers, he broke with the secret documents that Stingray was listening to everybody watching everybody and finally proved it, and that they'd also set up private networks of these, and were basically tracking everybody in real time and putting in their own communication system at Homeland Security so they could shut the web off, but still be operating with their web.
[1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:27.820]  And so the guy deserves a Pulitzer Prize for that. I mean, that's the kind of journalist we have, and I will give ourselves the credit. When they know we'll break stuff like that, that is dangerous, but we're willing to do it.
[1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:32.820]  And by the grace of God, like Jim Garrison said, we've stayed the spotlight, I think that's why we've been protected.
[1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:46.820]  Well, absolutely we've been protected, and Gary has basically put his name, his reputation, his financial blessings on the line, and ladies and gentlemen, again, this is what causes people to come out,
[1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:53.820]  who have a heart for other people. Alex, it's about people, it's about getting them to the point where they're not going to be cannon fodder.
[1:16:53.820 --> 1:17:03.820]  And what you brought up about Stingray, just a little bit of information, is years ago, people couldn't, they wouldn't believe that there were assassination algorithms.
[1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:07.820]  They didn't believe that the red list, the blue list, and the green list existed.
[1:17:07.820 --> 1:17:08.820]  And that's now admitted.
[1:17:08.820 --> 1:17:09.820]  That's now admitted.
[1:17:09.820 --> 1:17:15.820]  They admit roundup teams, they admit civilian inmate labor camps, they even call it reeducation camps in the Army manual.
[1:17:15.820 --> 1:17:16.820]  Absolutely.
[1:17:16.820 --> 1:17:17.820]  And so now,
[1:17:17.820 --> 1:17:20.820]  Reeducation camps, the Soviet term.
[1:17:20.820 --> 1:17:22.820]  But those are the people they get to live.
[1:17:22.820 --> 1:17:39.820]  What most people are losing track of, that quite candidly, Alex, with the very few mouths out there, or mouthpieces, and the broadcast that's out there, we have lost our country internally at any kind of level that I believe political.
[1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:43.820]  Outside of Donald Trump, and here's where, you know, thank you for all the times you've done.
[1:17:43.820 --> 1:17:45.820]  Please don't thank me.
[1:17:45.820 --> 1:17:46.820]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[1:17:46.820 --> 1:17:48.820]  Look, I got, let me share this.
[1:17:48.820 --> 1:18:07.820]  The thank yous go out there simply because having these guys that are absolutely willing to risk their lives, you just mentioned the guy that deserved a Pulitzer Prize, having Donald Trump saying to the world the things that everyone thinks, but they're too afraid to mention.
[1:18:07.820 --> 1:18:08.820]  That's the thing.
[1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:10.820]  Fear is the dominant theme, and I believe.
[1:18:10.820 --> 1:18:12.820]  He's breaking through the fear.
[1:18:12.820 --> 1:18:13.820]  Yep.
[1:18:13.820 --> 1:18:24.820]  And so the thing is, is that when you break the hold of fear, people can think, but the networks obviously are the greatest neural linguistic programming tool ever created.
[1:18:24.820 --> 1:18:27.820]  When you sit in front of the TV of mainstream media, that is a weapon system.
[1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:28.820]  You better be conscious.
[1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:30.820]  In fact, I'm going to skip this network break.
[1:18:30.820 --> 1:18:33.820]  Last one today, because I want to give you guys more time, but I want to inject something here.
[1:18:33.820 --> 1:18:38.820]  We come from a perspective of stopping the globalist being honest, shining a light on it like Paul Revere.
[1:18:38.820 --> 1:18:46.820]  Some people that are living in total fear think we're being negative or fear mongering or fear porn because they think they're helpless and we're trying to demoralize them.
[1:18:46.820 --> 1:18:49.820]  No, no, no, we don't think you're weak like the globalists do.
[1:18:49.820 --> 1:18:56.820]  We know the only chance we've got is for you to know under a new world order with GMO and chemicals and chemtrailing, you're already being killed.
[1:18:56.820 --> 1:19:00.820]  The only chance you've got is to stand up and to say no.
[1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:10.820]  But you know about the reeducation camps, the red list, the blue list, the green list, so that we can have a debate about it so they can't pull it off when they try to pull the switch.
[1:19:10.820 --> 1:19:13.820]  And now the military and the police are awake to a great extent.
[1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:15.820]  We won't be caught flat footed.
[1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:19.820]  We're telling you how bad it is because we believe you'll then take action.
[1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:20.820]  Absolutely.
[1:19:20.820 --> 1:19:24.820]  And the greatest survival tool is your brain.
[1:19:24.820 --> 1:19:29.820]  The greatest antidote for fear is knowledge that we document.
[1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:30.820]  And action.
[1:19:30.820 --> 1:19:31.820]  And action.
[1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:33.820]  And the action is where most people think that...
[1:19:33.820 --> 1:19:34.820]  And look at info wars.
[1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:35.820]  Look at Gary.
[1:19:35.820 --> 1:19:36.820]  Look at you.
[1:19:36.820 --> 1:19:37.820]  We are about action.
[1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:38.820]  Action.
[1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:42.820]  And we're in the studio today to basically say, this is a plea.
[1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:48.820]  This is a triune plea to basically get people to understand that you're out of time.
[1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:55.820]  Now look, even like when your car runs out of gasoline, the carburetor still has enough gas to continue on for a short spur.
[1:19:55.820 --> 1:20:03.820]  And what we're trying to do today is give everybody, not a short spur, but we're trying to refill your tank so you can be active and not sit back.
[1:20:03.820 --> 1:20:05.820]  This is the time for maximum effort.
[1:20:05.820 --> 1:20:06.820]  Absolutely.
[1:20:06.820 --> 1:20:07.820]  Gary?
[1:20:07.820 --> 1:20:08.820]  Yeah.
[1:20:08.820 --> 1:20:11.820]  Man, I'm on fire, guys.
[1:20:11.820 --> 1:20:18.820]  You know, a few years ago it might have been difficult to get up and stand beside us and what we're doing right now.
[1:20:18.820 --> 1:20:19.820]  But it is so obvious.
[1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:20.820]  It's so in your face.
[1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:21.820]  Open world government.
[1:20:21.820 --> 1:20:22.820]  Yeah.
[1:20:22.820 --> 1:20:26.820]  Just as Snowden and WikiLeaks, we know they're listening to all of our phone calls.
[1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:31.820]  You read the disclaimer in your television set, not to say anything, because it might be monitored.
[1:20:31.820 --> 1:20:40.820]  And yet we sit here and somebody can deny that information is being gathered to angle me.
[1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:46.820]  I remember, Quail, 20 years ago, senior TV's watching and listening to you, and then engineers came and showed me the scientific Atlantic boxes.
[1:20:46.820 --> 1:20:47.820]  We're doing it.
[1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:48.820]  Yeah.
[1:20:48.820 --> 1:20:52.820]  The disclaimer is on a box of a number of your television sets.
[1:20:52.820 --> 1:20:53.820]  There it is.
[1:20:53.820 --> 1:20:56.820]  So, and Trump has done a really great thing.
[1:20:56.820 --> 1:21:03.820]  You know, I agree with everything he says, but this guy has made it okay to talk about political correctness.
[1:21:03.820 --> 1:21:05.820]  He's made it okay to talk about globalism.
[1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:09.820]  And I think today we should talk about that a little bit.
[1:21:09.820 --> 1:21:13.820]  It is no longer a conspiracy theory to use the word globalist.
[1:21:13.820 --> 1:21:15.820]  It is part of our common vernacular.
[1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.820]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:18.820]  Yep.
[1:21:18.820 --> 1:21:27.820]  It's a nationalist versus globalist world we're in right now, whether it's Brexit, and they chose wisely, or whether it's Marine Le Pen in France or Paul Amos in Spain or here in the United States.
[1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:28.820]  Trump is a nationalist.
[1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:31.820]  He's standing for American sovereignty, American freedom.
[1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:32.820]  And this is nationalism's last stand.
[1:21:32.820 --> 1:21:33.820]  Yep.
[1:21:33.820 --> 1:21:36.820]  Hillary claims she is a globalist.
[1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:38.820]  And here's the problem with globalism.
[1:21:38.820 --> 1:21:46.820]  They're going to package it as if it's some solution to war, which by the way, they're creating World War III so that they can solve the problem by having a solution.
[1:21:46.820 --> 1:21:47.820]  Right.
[1:21:47.820 --> 1:21:48.820]  Global government.
[1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:50.820]  And guys, that's just the Hegelian dialectic.
[1:21:50.820 --> 1:21:52.820]  That's the strategy where you create a problem.
[1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:55.820]  And then when you provide the solution, you acquire power.
[1:21:55.820 --> 1:21:57.820]  That is straight out of the book.
[1:21:57.820 --> 1:22:06.820]  In fact, all of the chaos going on right now, the open borders, the importing of unvetted Syrian refugees to the FBI says up to 10% are radicalized.
[1:22:06.820 --> 1:22:08.820]  It's a classic destabilization program.
[1:22:08.820 --> 1:22:12.820]  The Southern Command has come out and warned of Sunni extremists crossing the Southern border.
[1:22:12.820 --> 1:22:14.820]  That's in the news today on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:22:14.820 --> 1:22:17.820]  Yeah, and ISIS has been coming across the border.
[1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:20.820]  FBI says they're now in all 50 states.
[1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:23.820]  They want us to believe that they're incompetent, but they're not.
[1:22:23.820 --> 1:22:25.820]  This is a strategy.
[1:22:25.820 --> 1:22:33.820]  It's by design because, as Henry Kissinger said, the only way that you can have a one-world government is if you diminish the United States.
[1:22:33.820 --> 1:22:34.820]  Right.
[1:22:34.820 --> 1:22:36.820]  They are deliberately diminishing us.
[1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:40.820]  Everything from spending our money to where it's never going to be recoverable.
[1:22:40.820 --> 1:22:49.820]  The debt's going to be so great to opening the borders to the lawlessness that Hillary just got away with literally murder.
[1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:55.820]  And Comey says, hey, just because we let her off, don't think we're going to let you off.
[1:22:55.820 --> 1:22:57.820]  They blatantly put that on our faces.
[1:22:57.820 --> 1:22:58.820]  And you know what?
[1:22:58.820 --> 1:22:59.820]  I'm not a subject.
[1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:00.820]  I'm a citizen.
[1:23:00.820 --> 1:23:02.820]  And I'm an American.
[1:23:02.820 --> 1:23:09.820]  And I believe in freedom, but I also believe that the price of freedom is a turtle vigilance.
[1:23:09.820 --> 1:23:10.820]  That's right.
[1:23:10.820 --> 1:23:11.820]  And a historical moment is here.
[1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:12.820]  I want to ask both of you this.
[1:23:12.820 --> 1:23:14.820]  Steve Quill of SteveQuill.com.
[1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:17.820]  I mean, folks, I've known this guy 21 years, never met him in person.
[1:23:17.820 --> 1:23:18.820]  It's amazing.
[1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:19.820]  Here he is.
[1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:23.820]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:23:23.820 --> 1:23:28.820]  Some cable systems and TV stations are also picking up large portions of the broadcast now and the nightly news.
[1:23:28.820 --> 1:23:34.820]  But here's Steve Quill in the flesh because we are at such a historic crossroads right now.
[1:23:34.820 --> 1:23:41.820]  Steve, going back 20 years ago, 25 years ago when you were writing your books on geoengineering, genetic armageddon, you name it.
[1:23:41.820 --> 1:23:42.820]  Now we're here.
[1:23:42.820 --> 1:23:44.820]  Now they admit chimeras, cross species.
[1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:45.820]  They admit world government.
[1:23:45.820 --> 1:23:52.820]  It's basically exactly what the patriots and the John Burt society and others told us they were going to do because people see this paradox.
[1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:57.820]  They go, wait, the government's run by corrupt evil people, but you're saying the government's one of our greatest hopes.
[1:23:57.820 --> 1:24:04.820]  It's people in the military and in some of these agencies that actually know we're telling the truth that have leaked the info.
[1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:07.820]  How did the John Burt society know the stuff of the 50s and 60s?
[1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:08.820]  They had a lot of patriots telling them.
[1:24:08.820 --> 1:24:09.820]  That's why it's dead on.
[1:24:09.820 --> 1:24:13.820]  And so that's why we can't just have a war with the government in general.
[1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:21.820]  We have to have a war with the ideas of the globalist and point out their occupiers in our government or they'll fool us into a civil war.
[1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:26.820]  Clearly they're setting up civil war in Europe and here as you got into the destabilization program.
[1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:28.820]  How do we counter that?
[1:24:28.820 --> 1:24:35.820]  Well, we counter it, first of all, by saying, look at the dialectic which Gary brought up.
[1:24:35.820 --> 1:24:37.820]  You know, Hegel said, you create the problem.
[1:24:37.820 --> 1:24:39.820]  Everybody knows that.
[1:24:39.820 --> 1:24:48.820]  But what's tragic is most people don't understand that the war of the police against the people, the people against the police.
[1:24:48.820 --> 1:24:56.820]  Alex, I was told a decade ago that we're talking about simply assassins to provoke the war between the police.
[1:24:56.820 --> 1:25:00.820]  Look, we talked about militarization of police, what, 15 years ago?
[1:25:00.820 --> 1:25:03.820]  Then they'll use the cops getting killed as the cover to wipe a bunch of other ones out.
[1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:04.820]  Absolutely.
[1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:08.820]  And ladies and gentlemen, it's always control the narrative.
[1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:09.820]  Whenever the mass...
[1:25:09.820 --> 1:25:10.820]  You talk about a list.
[1:25:10.820 --> 1:25:12.820]  We know the special list are on the police.
[1:25:12.820 --> 1:25:13.820]  Yes.
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:20.820]  And for the record, police, feedback to you, military guys, they've got their wives where their wives go shopping.
[1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:21.820]  They know everything.
[1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:27.820]  They're trying to ultimately force the police to be the first line of attack or arrest.
[1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:31.820]  And then once they're done with those guys, the blue list is simply this.
[1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:35.820]  Police and military that go along with the original roundup and assassination.
[1:25:35.820 --> 1:25:36.820]  Everybody focuses on that.
[1:25:36.820 --> 1:25:37.820]  Break this down.
[1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:40.820]  This has been done in other communist countries under Nazi control.
[1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:45.820]  It's an old totalitarian program, explain how the police are like the garbage men that bring in the garbage.
[1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:48.820]  But once they've done that, they're then taken out.
[1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:49.820]  They're then taken out.
[1:25:49.820 --> 1:25:51.820]  It's just a fact.
[1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:56.820]  The war that's generated is being absolutely orchestrated.
[1:25:56.820 --> 1:26:04.820]  And the people that are behind the scenes, call a hidden hand, the globalist, the illuminous, the elitist, and truly Alex the Satanist,
[1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:11.820]  they are implementing all of their predetermined, and I say this, hellish plans.
[1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:17.820]  When you and I started on the radio, we were trying to tell people about the events that were in the natural realm.
[1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:24.820]  Now, reading the front of Matt Drudge's page, it's like a world of supernatural evil.
[1:26:24.820 --> 1:26:27.820]  I heard you use those words the other day.
[1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:34.820]  And speaking of Drudge, he's linked to our story from Fox News, Top Doctor, Concerns Over Hillary's Health, not a conspiracy theory.
[1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:39.820]  We have top university professors, the heads of whole department, saying clearly she's got neurological problems.
[1:26:39.820 --> 1:26:43.820]  And the New York Times says, you know what, just delist those articles.
[1:26:43.820 --> 1:26:44.820]  Don't let people see them.
[1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:47.820]  I mean, they're nakedly pushing censorship now.
[1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:49.820]  They told Google to do that.
[1:26:49.820 --> 1:26:51.820]  What do you make of that?
[1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:54.820]  Well, it's just part of their exercise of control.
[1:26:54.820 --> 1:27:01.820]  Guys, we got to realize this, you do not have a free press in this country with the exception of this internet,
[1:27:01.820 --> 1:27:05.820]  which is another problem because the UN very likely going to take this thing over.
[1:27:05.820 --> 1:27:06.820]  October 1st.
[1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:07.820]  Yeah.
[1:27:07.820 --> 1:27:08.820]  So it's all converging.
[1:27:08.820 --> 1:27:10.820]  Well, we have a limited time.
[1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:15.820]  And man, I tell you what, if you can't wake up today with all the evidence in your face,
[1:27:15.820 --> 1:27:17.820]  I don't know what's going to wake you up.
[1:27:17.820 --> 1:27:20.820]  But when they, and see that I've been talking about this internet takeover,
[1:27:20.820 --> 1:27:24.820]  they're just going to shut it down or they're going to slowly diminish it.
[1:27:24.820 --> 1:27:25.820]  It's going to be slow, slow.
[1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:27.820]  And I agree with you on that.
[1:27:27.820 --> 1:27:28.820]  And how will it happen?
[1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:31.820]  Well, they're going to take something like Islamophobism.
[1:27:31.820 --> 1:27:32.820]  Okay.
[1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:36.820]  When I say something like, you know, it probably not a good idea.
[1:27:36.820 --> 1:27:38.820]  Korea law is not compatible in a free country.
[1:27:38.820 --> 1:27:39.820]  Yeah.
[1:27:39.820 --> 1:27:40.820]  Well, that makes me an Islamophobic.
[1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:42.820]  And by the way, the BBC now said that this weekend.
[1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:44.820]  They said shut down websites and arrest people.
[1:27:44.820 --> 1:27:45.820]  Exactly.
[1:27:45.820 --> 1:27:46.820]  And Germany's already doing it.
[1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:47.820]  Yep.
[1:27:47.820 --> 1:27:48.820]  Exactly.
[1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:49.820]  You can see the beta test.
[1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:51.820]  And what I think this is critical.
[1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:53.820]  Identify, vilify, nullify, destroy.
[1:27:53.820 --> 1:27:54.820]  They're in the process.
[1:27:54.820 --> 1:27:55.820]  It's a formula.
[1:27:55.820 --> 1:27:59.820]  I just started radio with the identification where the bad guys,
[1:27:59.820 --> 1:28:02.820]  the vilification where the bad guys, we being the truth tellers,
[1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:07.820]  we being those that go out and say, wait, this is an orchestrated theater of the absurd.
[1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:08.820]  We're the conspiracy theorists.
[1:28:08.820 --> 1:28:09.820]  Yes.
[1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:10.820]  Because we don't believe Hillary.
[1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.820]  By the way, and what's interesting is, remember, those who initiate,
[1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:18.820]  this is just absolutely right out of Saul Alinsky on steroids.
[1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:23.820]  This is going by his book and who obviously Lucifer is his direction.
[1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:26.820]  That's who he pledges to.
[1:28:26.820 --> 1:28:33.820]  And so, remember, telling the truth in times of deceit is a revolutionary act.
[1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:34.820]  That's right.
[1:28:34.820 --> 1:28:35.820]  Yep.
[1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:37.820]  And how is it going for him, Steve Hoyle?
[1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:39.820]  Well, I'll turn it right over to Jerry.
[1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:44.820]  In my opinion, it's succeeding at breakneck speed.
[1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:48.820]  I want to get to the major crux of the matter on, you mentioned France,
[1:28:48.820 --> 1:28:51.820]  you mentioned Germany, obviously England.
[1:28:51.820 --> 1:28:54.820]  Alex, everybody's forgetting the first premise of the New World Order.
[1:28:54.820 --> 1:28:56.820]  Out with the old and in with the new.
[1:28:56.820 --> 1:28:58.820]  The Phoenix is their mascot.
[1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:01.820]  They must destroy their countries, their nationalism, their currencies,
[1:29:01.820 --> 1:29:02.820]  all their values.
[1:29:02.820 --> 1:29:03.820]  They've said that.
[1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:04.820]  They've said that.
[1:29:04.820 --> 1:29:06.820]  So what you're seeing in the world, everyone,
[1:29:06.820 --> 1:29:10.820]  is you're seeing the actual implementation of the destruction of borders,
[1:29:10.820 --> 1:29:15.820]  language, culture in order to introduce all of their designs and plans.
[1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:20.820]  And so we're saying we're holding back the dam to the best of our ability.
[1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:22.820]  But Alex, there's more leaks springing.
[1:29:22.820 --> 1:29:24.820]  And when this thing springs on the American citizens,
[1:29:24.820 --> 1:29:28.820]  you can watch everything that's going on in Venezuela to know what the future is.
[1:29:28.820 --> 1:29:29.820]  Let's talk about that.
[1:29:29.820 --> 1:29:30.820]  Because people say, oh, Alex, don't fear manga.
[1:29:30.820 --> 1:29:31.820]  There's no depression.
[1:29:31.820 --> 1:29:35.820]  There are more than 30, 40 countries that are totally collapsed right now.
[1:29:35.820 --> 1:29:37.820]  It's unraveling all over the place.
[1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:41.820]  And we're just saying we need to fix this situation while the globalists are making it worse.
[1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:45.820]  We're going to come back and talk about all this and more with Steve Quell and Gary Haven.
[1:29:45.820 --> 1:30:14.820]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[1:30:15.820 --> 1:30:41.820]  Thank you.
[1:30:41.820 --> 1:31:08.820]  Thank you.
[1:31:08.820 --> 1:31:33.820]  Thank you.

[3:16:48.820 --> 3:17:15.820]  Thank you.
[3:17:15.820 --> 3:17:42.820]  Thank you.
[3:17:42.820 --> 3:18:09.820]  Thank you.

[3:20:55.820 --> 3:21:22.820]  Thank you.
[3:21:22.820 --> 3:21:50.820]  Thank you.
[3:21:50.820 --> 3:22:17.820]  Thank you.
[3:22:17.820 --> 3:22:44.820]  Thank you.
[3:22:44.820 --> 3:23:12.820]  Thank you.
[3:23:12.820 --> 3:23:35.820]  Thank you.
[3:23:35.820 --> 3:23:59.820]  Thank you.
[3:23:59.820 --> 3:24:26.820]  Thank you.
[3:24:26.820 --> 3:24:55.820]  Thank you.
[3:24:56.820 --> 3:25:23.820]  Thank you.
[3:25:23.820 --> 3:25:50.820]  Thank you.
[3:25:50.820 --> 3:26:17.820]  Thank you.
[3:26:17.820 --> 3:26:44.820]  Thank you.
[3:26:44.820 --> 3:27:11.820]  Thank you.
[3:27:11.820 --> 3:27:39.820]  Thank you.
[3:27:39.820 --> 3:28:06.820]  Thank you.
[3:28:06.820 --> 3:28:33.820]  Thank you.
[3:28:33.820 --> 3:29:00.820]  Thank you.
[3:29:00.820 --> 3:29:28.820]  Thank you.
[3:29:28.820 --> 3:29:57.820]  Thank you.
[3:29:58.820 --> 3:29:59.820]  Thank you.
[3:30:28.820 --> 3:30:55.820]  Thank you.
[3:30:55.820 --> 3:31:22.820]  Thank you.
[3:31:22.820 --> 3:31:49.820]  Thank you.
[3:31:49.820 --> 3:32:16.820]  Thank you.
[3:32:16.820 --> 3:32:45.820]  Thank you.
[3:32:46.820 --> 3:33:12.820]  Thank you.
[3:33:12.820 --> 3:33:35.820]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:35.820 --> 3:33:45.820]  David Knight, we're talking about George Soros,
[3:33:45.820 --> 3:34:10.820]  George Soros,
[3:34:10.820 --> 3:34:14.820]  George Soros,
[3:34:14.820 --> 3:34:28.820]  George Soros, George Soros, George Soros, George Soros.
[3:34:28.820 --> 3:34:41.820]  Here's gonna be George Soros.
[3:34:41.820 --> 3:34:46.160]  Department emails were released last week showing Doug Band, a counselor to the Clinton
[3:34:46.160 --> 3:34:51.080]  Foundation, asking Clinton advisors, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, who were both State
[3:34:51.080 --> 3:34:54.760]  Department employees at the time, for a quote, favor.
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:34:59.080]  And he forwarded an email from a Clinton Foundation donor and told him it was important to take
[3:34:59.080 --> 3:35:00.160]  care of the request.
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:05.160]  And Huma wrote back, and here's what she said, we've all had him on our radar, personnel
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:07.000]  has been sending him options.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:12.840]  Is this the kind of back scratching that has Americans just turned off and done with people
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:15.000]  who have been in Washington a long time?
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:20.800]  Well, first of all, Dana, the email in question from Doug Band was coming from his private
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:28.360]  email account, it had, or his Clinton.com email account, it was not related to the foundation.
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:33.960]  And the foundation at every step, or rather excuse me, the State Department at every step
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:36.240]  was following all the appropriate protocols.
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:41.560]  This was someone who had a relationship with the Clintons long before Hillary became Secretary
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:42.560]  of State.
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:48.840]  But Doug, excuse me, but Robbie, the issue is not so much where the email is coming
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:53.840]  from, it's the request in general, and who the request is going to, right?
[3:35:53.840 --> 3:35:57.960]  Well, again, this is someone who had a longstanding relationship with the Clintons.
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:35:58.960]  Yeah, money launder.
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:03.720]  I wanted to provide some insight into a matter.
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:07.680]  And obviously, the Clintons have staff that facilitate those sorts of communication.
[3:36:07.680 --> 3:36:11.680]  But there was no quid pro quo or anything like that here.
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:16.520]  And as I said, email was originated from President Clinton's private office.
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:17.520]  Yeah, right.
[3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:18.520]  Okay.
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:23.080]  So, I mean, this guy that they're talking about here is someone who had been found guilty
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:25.920]  of money laundering in Switzerland.
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:31.080]  He'd bought his way out of that with a plea bargain and a $60 million fine, and then they
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:34.960]  talked to Huma and they say, yeah, we need to get him in touch with somebody in Lebanon.
[3:36:34.960 --> 3:36:38.440]  Yeah, we can get him in touch with these people and he goes, do it now.
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:39.440]  Make it happen now.
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:40.440]  Okay, yeah, we're doing it.
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:46.520]  I mean, there is no reasonable person can look at this back and forth of the emails
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:52.360]  and not say that this isn't trading money for influence on the part of these people.
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:55.440]  Another one, get this guy a job in the State Department and so on.
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:00.640]  Okay, but you wouldn't know that there had been a leak of George Soros' information if
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:02.640]  you were looking at mainstream media.
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:05.400]  This is what Daily Caller is pointing out.
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:11.560]  They said that on June 4th, 2016, they point out the hypocrisy of the New York Times editorial.
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:14.840]  They talked about big money rearranges its election bets.
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:16.040]  So they talk about big money.
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:19.680]  They complain about it just like the Democrats complain about Wall Street.
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:26.560]  They complain about the influence on politics and yet they backed the candidate that all
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:29.520]  the Wall Street backers are getting behind.
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:33.960]  This is what the New York Times said back on June 4th before we got this release of George
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:34.960]  Soros' information.
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:39.160]  They said, both parties, both parties, not really, okay?
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:41.080]  Both parties, not Donald Trump, okay?
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:43.440]  Yeah, the Republican establishment, absolutely.
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:46.960]  They play that same game and that's what's different about Trump, okay?
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:51.080]  He's getting his money from the small donors like Ron Paul did.
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:53.320]  It's a true grassroots movement, okay?
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:37:56.120]  That's why when you look at this, we have to be very careful.
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:37:59.480]  The only way they're gonna win this thing, if you look at these rallies, Hillary Clinton
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:06.240]  goes around and talks to 2,200 millionaires, okay, up in the Northeast, Martha's Vineyard
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:07.400]  and so forth.
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:13.960]  At $100,000 a plate dinner being thrown by the Rothschilds while Soros is throwing $7
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:16.560]  million at a whack at her.
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:22.040]  And then on the other hand, we've got 400,000 people giving small donations to Donald Trump.
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:24.000]  Look at the number of people that show up at their rallies.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.080]  Look at the public rallies that Donald Trump has.
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:29.280]  Look at the fact that he shows up and of course he's gonna be here in Austin tomorrow.
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:30.920]  We're gonna be covering that on the nightly news.
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:34.840]  We'll have reporters there live at that rally.
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:40.640]  Thousands of people show up at his rallies and she can't even fill high school gyms.
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:45.040]  This is why we don't believe the polls that the mainstream media is feeding us.
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:47.840]  But listen to what the New York Times said.
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:51.920]  They were talking about the power of barely regulated super PACs.
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:56.360]  And of course, all the liberals want to talk about is the fact that we have to control
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:39:01.840]  speech and money and politics and yet they back Hillary Clinton, okay?
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:04.920]  I do believe that money is speech.
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:09.480]  I don't believe I should have chains put on me as to somebody that I wanted to give money
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:10.760]  to if I wanted to.
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:13.600]  I don't want to give money to politicians, quite frankly.
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:17.600]  I've been there, I've done that and I wish I had the money back.
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:23.240]  But if you want to give money to politicians and if you want to engage in free speech,
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:26.680]  you ought to be allowed to do that because we know that the big guys are going to have
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:32.280]  their secret meetings with the Hillary Clintons, with the George Bushes, with the Jeb Bushes
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:35.440]  and they're going to get what they want regardless.
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:39.640]  We don't want speech controlled by the federal government and yet the same people who want
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:45.560]  to have the government control all elections even more tightly, even more closely.
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:50.280]  Just look the other way when it's their candidate that's getting all the Wall Street money.
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:54.320]  The editors of the New York Times say, at the same time, campaigns are concealing the
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:40:00.720]  names of rich donors and dark money operations that are palmed off as tax-exempt social welfare
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:05.680]  agencies supposedly dedicated to doing good, not to bear knuckle politics.
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:07.680]  Who would they be talking about?
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:12.400]  Nobody fits that description better than George Soros when he talks about, oh, we've got social
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:14.520]  welfare agencies that are doing good.
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:17.240]  We're going to tell you what he does with that money, okay?
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:19.760]  We've told you in the past, we're going to tell you again.
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:24.640]  What we do is we have documents that come out, we tell you, people don't believe it.
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:28.440]  We keep telling you that, then more documents come out, we tell you again and more people
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:32.120]  don't want to believe it and we've got some more documents now about George Soros and
[3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:33.240]  Black Lives Matter.
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:36.920]  But the point that Daily Caller is making here is they say two and a half months later
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:43.720]  now we've got internal workings of a powerful political network that has pawned itself off
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:48.320]  as tax-exempt social welfare agency, George Soros' network, okay?
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:51.680]  We've got this hack that has been dumped in our laps.
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:53.080]  You want to talk about transparency.
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:58.000]  The only place you're going to get transparency is not from Obama, not from Hillary Clinton.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.280]  You're getting it from WikiLeaks.
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:01.880]  You're getting it from DCLeaks.
[3:41:01.880 --> 3:41:05.440]  You're getting it from people who are exposing these criminals.
[3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:08.440]  And yet people won't look at the information.
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:09.880]  They won't read it, okay?
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:10.880]  So what's going on?
[3:41:10.880 --> 3:41:15.680]  They say even as the Times ignored the major role of Soros' Open Society Foundation's
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:22.440]  network, okay, the paper wrote stories focusing on the role of wealthy donors in the Republican
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:23.440]  party.
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:24.760]  See, that's the way they do it.
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:28.880]  They complain about money in politics, but you're supposed to believe that that only comes
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:29.880]  to the Republicans.
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:34.480]  Yes, it does go to the Republicans and it should be exposed, but they ignore it when
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:35.880]  it comes from Soros.
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:39.200]  They ignore it when the money flows to Hillary Clinton.
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:43.400]  And this is what Investors Business Daily pointed out.
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:49.520]  They wrote an editorial and they said, the Times, CNN, CBS News, The Washington Post
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:56.520]  have remained silent on the subject entirely, the subject of Soros buying these politicians.
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:01.280]  We couldn't find a single story in The New York Times, CNN, Washington Post, CBS News,
[3:42:01.280 --> 3:42:06.880]  or other major news sites that even noted the existence of these leaked documents, let
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:10.080]  alone reporting on what's in them.
[3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:13.840]  And they point out that, and this is a story that came out today, by Sunday night, last
[3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:21.640]  night, those new sites still had not acknowledged the existence of the leaked Soros documents.
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:28.320]  Now New American looks at this and they have pointed out one in particular that shows the
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:30.800]  funding of Black Lives Matter.
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:35.080]  They say when George Soros' Open Society Foundation was accused last year of funding
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:39.920]  Black Lives Matter, and of course we pointed that out as well, and we were pushed by, oh
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:45.440]  no, no, no, no, we're not giving money to the array, we're not funding Black Lives Matter.
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:51.080]  We had people, we could, caught with the money that they were getting from Black Lives Matter.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:55.400]  They said, no, it didn't happen, it was a conspiracy theory, it was a fantastic rumor.
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:43:00.240]  They say, well, this is Ken Zimmerman, he's the director of U.S. programs at the Open
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:01.520]  Society Foundation.
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:03.680]  He flatly denied it, as I point out.
[3:43:03.680 --> 3:43:07.320]  He said it was simply a rumor, it was simply a conspiracy theory.
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.040]  He said, I can't really speculate on what leads to rumors, but it's wrong.
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:15.120]  I don't even know where one begins to reconstruct something like that.
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:16.760]  Well, we do.
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:17.760]  We know.
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:21.600]  You reconstruct it when you get the documents, okay, again.
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:25.920]  We now have the documents, and so we found out, now with these documents that have been
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:34.720]  leaked by DCLeaks.com, that the Open Society Foundation board approved $650,000 to BLM,
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:36.320]  and why did they do it, okay?
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:42.720]  They got a 69-page report from Open Society, and that's George Soros' organization.
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:47.800]  It documents its plans to use, quote, unquote, unrest, following the death of Freddie Gray
[3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:54.640]  to, quote, accelerate the dismantling of structural inequality generated and maintained by local
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:43:57.400]  law enforcement, okay?
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:02.800]  Now, understand, they're trying to foment unrest.
[3:44:02.800 --> 3:44:05.440]  They're trying to destroy the foundation.
[3:44:05.440 --> 3:44:08.320]  And what they're doing is they're using fringe groups to do it.
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:11.800]  One of the other documents, it's not in this report, one of the documents that I looked
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:19.480]  at was talking about how they were going to use the LGBT groups in Italy to push against
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:23.160]  Italian nationalism and towards the European Union.
[3:44:23.160 --> 3:44:29.880]  They said, we're going to have, we're going to illustrate the fact that Italy does not
[3:44:29.880 --> 3:44:34.040]  support LGBT issues, but the EU does.
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:42.200]  And so we want to get the LGBT crowd to focus on Italy being subsumed into the European
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:43.200]  Union.
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:44.200]  That's the way they're working this.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:48.840]  If you go back and you look in the 1960s, you can see how Bill Ayers and others were
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:54.360]  talking about how in America, they couldn't use the same kind of class divisions that
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:58.200]  had worked for them for the communist organizers in Europe.
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:01.080]  Because we had a relatively classless society.
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:03.360]  You had class mobility.
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:08.640]  You could be poor and you always had the opportunity of getting rich in America, far more so
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:09.800]  than anywhere else.
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:14.080]  And the perception in America was that you could move from one level to the other.
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:18.160]  So what they did was, they said, we're not going to come at it from a class angle.
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:21.320]  We're going to come at it from a race level.
[3:45:21.320 --> 3:45:27.200]  We're going to say that you can't move an American society if you don't have white
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:28.200]  skin.
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:30.000]  We're going to talk about white skin privilege.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.720]  We're going to make it a racial dialogue, okay?
[3:45:33.720 --> 3:45:38.160]  And that's the way we're going to divide the American public into classes.
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:40.480]  We're going to create racial classes.
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:47.920]  That's why, if you're wondering, that's why Obama's mentor has Bill Ayers and others.
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:48.920]  They have taken this.
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:54.520]  That's why we have more division, more racism in America than we've had since we got Obama
[3:45:54.520 --> 3:45:55.520]  in.
[3:45:55.520 --> 3:46:01.760]  It's because he's black, but it's because he's using racialism to push this through.
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:10.040]  Now, the US Programs Board approved a $650,000 fund to invest in the Black Lives Matter.
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:15.560]  And as they rightly point out in this article from New American, they say BLM, Black Lives
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:21.640]  Matter, could have used that $650,000 to actually improve the lives of black residents of America's
[3:46:21.640 --> 3:46:26.920]  inner city by initiating job training or educational and violence prevention programs.
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:30.680]  But instead, they used it to foment unrest.
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:33.720]  They used it to create violent protest.
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:38.640]  They used it to do things that were nothing more than violent riots.
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:40.320]  That's what we see.
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:44.400]  And quite frankly, folks, when we look at Hillary Clinton and the fact that I can't believe
[3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:48.640]  that the mainstream media is telling us over and over again that Hillary Clinton really
[3:46:48.640 --> 3:46:50.000]  doesn't want to take the guns.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:52.240]  Do you believe that for a second?
[3:46:52.240 --> 3:46:56.920]  I mean, that has been one of the foundations of her campaign.
[3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:02.640]  And I think it's interesting over this last weekend to look at what happened in Chicago.
[3:47:02.640 --> 3:47:07.680]  We're constantly seeing these reports of terrorism, whether it's in France, Muslim terrorists
[3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:13.720]  in France attacking people, or we see these suicide bombs at weddings in Turkey and other
[3:47:13.720 --> 3:47:14.720]  places.
[3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:17.600]  But look at this, in Chicago over the weekend, okay?
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:25.120]  You had 35 people wounded in shootings and four people killed, that's in Chicago.
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:30.500]  Chicago, where they have enacted every kind of gun control that Hillary Clinton and the
[3:47:30.500 --> 3:47:32.960]  Democrats want enacted.
[3:47:32.960 --> 3:47:38.080]  And this is a regular occurrence every weekend in Chicago.
[3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:40.200]  Every weekend in Chicago, we see this.
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:43.440]  Yet another bloody weekend in Chicago, it's nothing new.
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:45.960]  It's hardly even newsworthy, okay?
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:46.960]  It's how frequently it happens.
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:52.480]  As I point out in this article from Daily Mail, in one 14-hour span, beginning on Saturday
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:58.880]  afternoon, 25 people were shot in an area that has the strictest gun control you can
[3:47:58.880 --> 3:48:04.120]  find anywhere, except that California, of course, wants more.
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:06.480]  The Democrats always want more.
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:11.400]  Now they're calling, as New American points out in California, they want to restrict
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:18.880]  guns to elderly people because they're a risk.
[3:48:18.880 --> 3:48:25.800]  Quite frankly, it is the elderly, it is women who need firearms the most for their own protection.
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:27.200]  But that's who they're coming after.
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:30.160]  On the other hand, look at what's going on in Germany.
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:35.200]  We saw this report earlier, I pointed out, the fact that they're talking about how, as
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:39.280]  a leaked report from a German newspaper, talking about how they want to encourage the German
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:41.600]  people to start prepping.
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:46.320]  Now we've got the leader of the populist party, which is like the Donald Trump party
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:48.040]  in Germany.
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:54.160]  Alternative for Germany is now backing the right of German citizens to keep and bear
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:48:56.520]  arms, to protect themselves.
[3:48:56.520 --> 3:48:57.520]  Why?
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:01.600]  Because that is a fundamental human right.
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:06.080]  And people in Germany need to wake up out of their slumber, and they're starting to wake
[3:49:06.080 --> 3:49:08.880]  up because of the Muslim terrorist events.
[3:49:08.880 --> 3:49:17.520]  They're starting to wake up and understand that they don't have some kind of a special
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:24.680]  entitlement to a safe country, that they don't have to do anything to keep themselves safe.
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:31.120]  Like Americans, they've been put to sleep because they've had a very easy, soft existence.
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:35.040]  They've been taken care of, even their defense budget has been taken care of by the United
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:36.040]  States.
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:39.040]  But their German government is there to protect them.
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:44.200]  At the same time, you've got Angela Merkel bringing in immigrants and saying terrorism
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:49.760]  didn't come from the immigrants, and Islam belongs in Germany.
[3:49:49.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  Exactly.
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:51.760]  Okay.
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:56.920]  When we look at gun control, and you look at where this is headed, look at Venezuela,
[3:49:56.920 --> 3:50:03.320]  crushing 2,000 guns in public, they're planning now a registry of bullets.
[3:50:03.320 --> 3:50:07.560]  Another thing to what we have here in America, they have understood now, Obama, beginning
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:12.320]  with the Obama administration, the gun control liberals have wised up.
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:16.280]  They understand that the key is ammunition.
[3:50:16.280 --> 3:50:21.000]  If you can control ammunition, you can turn people's guns into clubs, even if you don't
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  confiscate them.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:25.080]  Now, they did try to confiscate guns in Venezuela, and we reported on this.
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:31.840]  We reported back in November of 2015, this last November, we talked about the fact that
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:38.040]  we had police being hunted down on the streets and killed for their firearms.
[3:50:38.040 --> 3:50:43.320]  Because Venezuela, with all the poverty that has been inflicted on them by socialism, had
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:46.880]  spent $53 million to set up gun confiscation centers.
[3:50:46.880 --> 3:50:52.160]  Now, they are crushing guns in public, 2,000 guns crushed and drilled, and this is what
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:53.160]  they say.
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:58.040]  We're going to bring disarmament and peace, nothing of the sort.
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:51:02.240]  Now, they're going to go through the process, expensive process of labeling the ammunition.
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:03.240]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:03.240 --> 3:51:07.880]  We suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat.
[3:51:07.880 --> 3:51:12.320]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[3:51:12.320 --> 3:51:17.720]  You hear the ads all the time, if this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[3:51:17.720 --> 3:51:18.720]  That's easy.
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:21.320]  Doctors are not trained in natural medicine.
[3:51:21.320 --> 3:51:27.560]  Extendivite heart tonic does want you to be as healthy as you can be, and it really works.
[3:51:27.560 --> 3:51:31.600]  Take Extendivite for six months and your doctor will say, I don't know what you're doing,
[3:51:31.600 --> 3:51:34.160]  but don't stop, it's working for you.
[3:51:34.160 --> 3:51:36.600]  Get the dependability of Extendivite.
[3:51:36.600 --> 3:51:38.600]  Just see how you feel in six months.

[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:04.040]  Dr. Waddle Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering house cells breathe.
[3:53:04.040 --> 3:53:06.960]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[3:53:06.960 --> 3:53:10.480]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:15.200]  Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:17.640]  to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:21.320]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax
[3:53:21.320 --> 3:53:25.480]  oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[3:53:25.480 --> 3:53:29.440]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of
[3:53:29.440 --> 3:53:30.440]  the body.
[3:53:30.440 --> 3:53:35.200]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality zero-oxidation
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:36.200]  undamaged seed oils.
[3:53:36.200 --> 3:53:39.240]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[3:53:39.240 --> 3:53:43.200]  Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the
[3:53:43.200 --> 3:53:47.960]  sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is, and you have a winning combination to confer
[3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:50.120]  health and energy like never before.

[3:53:55.960 --> 3:54:20.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, this last segment I want to go over a story that
[3:54:20.080 --> 3:54:24.040]  really, really made me angry when I saw this on Friday.
[3:54:24.040 --> 3:54:30.680]  A sailor who has denied a Clinton deal, and I want to give you the details of this story.
[3:54:30.680 --> 3:54:34.040]  It is absolutely amazing, the double standards, the entitlement, the privilege.
[3:54:34.040 --> 3:54:35.640]  You want to talk about white privilege?
[3:54:35.640 --> 3:54:38.240]  Talk about Clinton privilege, okay?
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:39.840]  That's the real privilege in this country.
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:41.760]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[3:54:41.760 --> 3:54:46.160]  Before we do, I want to remind you that we have the new Amerageddon film pack, which
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:48.920]  is two Amerageddon movies.
[3:54:48.920 --> 3:54:54.640]  This is the movie that was done by Mike Norris, Chuck Norris' son, and Gary Haven, who you
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:59.820]  heard in the last couple of hours of the show with Alex Jones.
[3:54:59.820 --> 3:55:05.120]  When you buy two copies of this movie, and it's available exclusively right now at InfowarsStore.com,
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:10.560]  you also get a free bottle of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, that's a $20 value.
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:12.640]  It really helps to support our operation.
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:13.920]  It's a 360 win.
[3:55:13.920 --> 3:55:15.960]  It goes through, this movie is very interesting.
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:22.920]  It goes through the scenario of a EMP pulse that takes down the electrical grid, and it's
[3:55:22.920 --> 3:55:24.800]  something that you ought to think about.
[3:55:24.800 --> 3:55:30.800]  It's something that is a conversation starter, and that's just one way that society can go
[3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:32.560]  down the drain.
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:35.640]  But that is a very important way, and of course, nothing is being done about that.
[3:55:35.640 --> 3:55:39.480]  It could very easily be addressed, but they're not interested in doing anything about that,
[3:55:39.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  because they want chaos.
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:44.600]  So again, if you want to see that movie, if you want to pass that around, the Amerageddon
[3:55:44.600 --> 3:55:48.880]  two-pack, and you also get a free bottle of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver when you get
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:50.600]  two copies of Amerageddon.
[3:55:50.600 --> 3:55:56.440]  Also, living defense, 20% off before it sells out, and it will be selling out soon.
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:55:59.680]  You can find that at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:55:59.680 --> 3:56:05.600]  Now quickly, before we run out of time, last Friday, we had a former Navy machinist who
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:06.600]  was on a submarine.
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:08.720]  He admitted taking photos inside a submarine.
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:13.240]  He took six photos on his cell phone, whose things were classified.
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:19.560]  They were not marked classified, okay, but they did classify them as confidential.
[3:56:19.560 --> 3:56:23.880]  And anybody that's been involved in any of the military industrial complex, I worked
[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:24.880]  as an engineer.
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:28.840]  I had to get confidential clearance when I was a college student, doing a part-time
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:35.300]  job in the military industrial complex, and it's not very hard to get confidential security.
[3:56:35.300 --> 3:56:38.840]  That is a very, very low bar to set up, okay.
[3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:40.080]  It is the lowest level.
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:43.280]  He had six photos that were marked confidential.
[3:56:43.280 --> 3:56:46.920]  He said he took these photos because he wanted to show them some day to his grandkids or
[3:56:46.920 --> 3:56:47.920]  whatever.
[3:56:47.920 --> 3:56:53.760]  There were souvenir photos, not really anything that is going to compromise national security.
[3:56:53.760 --> 3:56:57.440]  Not like the thousands of emails that Hillary Clinton had.
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:04.000]  And so for that, he was sentenced to one year in prison, $100 fine, six months home confinement,
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:09.720]  100 hours of community service, and a ban on owning guns, okay.
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:13.640]  So he gets a year in prison, and he gets banned on owning guns.
[3:57:13.640 --> 3:57:19.320]  Meanwhile, we got Hillary Clinton, who was about to get four years in the White House,
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:22.800]  and she's going to ban your guns, okay.
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:23.800]  That's how it works.
[3:57:23.800 --> 3:57:26.200]  That is Clinton privilege for you.
[3:57:26.200 --> 3:57:30.080]  Breaking the law, getting away with this, he had six confidential photos.
[3:57:30.080 --> 3:57:31.080]  He admitted to it.
[3:57:31.080 --> 3:57:33.200]  He didn't lie like Hillary Clinton.
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:36.120]  He admitted to it, and they nailed him to the wall.
[3:57:36.120 --> 3:57:38.120]  They said, we'd like a Clinton deal, okay.
[3:57:38.120 --> 3:57:41.400]  And I said, no, no, no, you're not going to get that.
[3:57:41.400 --> 3:57:45.640]  As one of his lawyers said, it could be argued here that depending on what your name is,
[3:57:45.640 --> 3:57:48.640]  that's the kind of justice you get in the United States.
[3:57:48.640 --> 3:57:52.040]  Yeah, it could definitely be argued that that's the case.
[3:57:52.040 --> 3:57:55.400]  Here's a guy, six confidential emails, okay.
[3:57:55.400 --> 3:57:59.120]  Hillary Clinton, not confidential emails, just pictures.
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:05.420]  Hillary Clinton had, they found, this is according to the FBI director, had eight confidentials.
[3:58:05.420 --> 3:58:12.960]  He had eight top secret, 36 secret, and those are just the ones that they didn't delete.
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:19.400]  We don't know how many they deleted, because she got to go through and clean up her email,
[3:58:19.400 --> 3:58:21.080]  got to clean up her computer.
[3:58:21.080 --> 3:58:24.600]  This guy and his lawyers didn't get to clean up his phone, but she did, okay.
[3:58:24.600 --> 3:58:25.920]  That's Hillary Clinton's privilege.
[3:58:25.920 --> 3:58:37.520]  And try this tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
