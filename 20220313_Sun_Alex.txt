[00:00.000 --> 00:25.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, March 13, 2022, and you are living through the most
[00:25.680 --> 00:35.360]  significant times in human history. And there's so many different levels to it. There's so
[00:35.360 --> 00:41.360]  many different angles and aspects to it. As I'm getting the news sorted out here on
[00:41.360 --> 00:48.040]  my desk, getting ready for this Sunday transmission, I'm just reminded of all the different angles
[00:48.040 --> 00:55.200]  that we have right now, trying to stave off this globalist tyranny, this one world government
[00:55.200 --> 00:58.680]  that wants a social credit score based off of the system in China, and the end of free
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.800]  speech, the end of the right to protect yourself, pretty much just the end of any individual
[01:02.800 --> 01:10.640]  sovereignty at all, any nation-state, any right to decide and determine your own destiny.
[01:10.640 --> 01:17.840]  And it gets so bad we're here in Texas today. In fact, I just got back about 15 minutes
[01:17.840 --> 01:24.760]  ago. We're out there for about two hours, I'd say. And we've got some of the B-roll
[01:24.760 --> 01:31.120]  that we're going to roll for you. The crew is uploading some of the HD video right now
[01:31.120 --> 01:44.000]  to band.video. But I'm out in Austin, Texas, where there is a pro-trans kids rally, which
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.440]  I don't call it trans kids. There's no such thing as trans kids until these pedophiles
[01:50.440 --> 01:54.320]  get their hands on them. Then there's trans kids. There's no such thing as a trans kid
[01:54.320 --> 02:01.400]  in nature. Doesn't exist, never has. The only way a trans kid even exists is if a pedophile
[02:01.400 --> 02:09.800]  gets their hands on them and mutates their genitalia. And so we've just got unbelievable
[02:09.800 --> 02:16.000]  footage. It's the same crap you expect from these nut jobs. But it just is wilder and
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.720]  wilder every time. It's just you can't believe this is reality. How do I go to downtown Austin,
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.960]  Texas and walk into a mob of pedophiles? By the way, that's literally the pedophile
[02:28.960 --> 02:36.040]  flag right there. And so that's what I'm saying. People tune in and they may think,
[02:36.040 --> 02:46.320]  you know, Info Wars is kind of extreme. No, the world is extreme. When I go to downtown
[02:46.320 --> 02:54.560]  Austin, Texas, and I've got people waving pedophile flags in my face, talking about
[02:54.560 --> 03:02.440]  how they want to mutilate children's genitalia. And they think they're the good guy. Folks,
[03:02.440 --> 03:08.240]  that is a pro-pedophile flag. They call it a minor attracted person flag is what it is.
[03:08.240 --> 03:12.160]  So you've got the tranny flag, you've got the gay flag, you've got the pedophile flag.
[03:12.160 --> 03:20.120]  They all have these new flags, they fly. And it's all to create this new tribalism of sexual
[03:20.120 --> 03:29.600]  perversion that they then virtue signal and say, oh, this is for the kids. No, you're
[03:29.600 --> 03:35.320]  sexual perverts. Fine. You want to be a sexual pervert and do your little activity behind
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.280]  closed doors or they don't even do it behind closed doors anymore. I'm not even exaggerating.
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.200]  And this has a lot to do with the fact South by South gay is in town. South by Southwest
[03:44.200 --> 03:53.320]  is South by South gay now. And I'm not even kidding you. I go out to breakfast this morning.
[03:53.320 --> 03:58.000]  Popular diner here in Austin. I love going to good food. But see, the more and more,
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.600]  it's the same thing with everything else. The more and more woke it gets, the more and
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.000]  more the leftists run the place and are just jerks and start doing bad service. It's like,
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.680]  I don't even want to go back. It's like, you know what? You got a great diner here. You
[04:08.680 --> 04:14.440]  got great food. I'm getting harassed by damn liberals. I just want to have breakfast. I'm
[04:14.440 --> 04:20.440]  not even kidding you. A man shows up. I personally, I'm not, look, it's probably not the worst
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.360]  thing ever. Personally, I'll never wear open toed shoes to a restaurant. I just, I just
[04:24.360 --> 04:28.120]  don't like showing my feet when people are trying to eat meals. I just think that's a
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.960]  little uncouth, but okay, it's not the worst thing ever. This man shows up dressed as a
[04:34.960 --> 04:43.520]  woman and walks into a breakfast diner with his ass out. I'm not exaggerating. Literal
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.440]  bare ass at a diner in public, just showing off the ass. And you're just supposed to say,
[04:48.440 --> 04:54.160]  Oh, that's a tranny. Oh, that's a drag queen. I'm not going to say anything like, Hey, why
[04:54.160 --> 05:01.760]  don't you get your bare ass off of the seat, please? I'm trying to eat breakfast. It's
[05:01.760 --> 05:08.280]  hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we had
[05:08.280 --> 05:15.200]  a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3. And as all three types
[05:15.200 --> 05:21.120]  of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in
[05:21.120 --> 05:26.480]  your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.480]  the population in the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So
[05:31.480 --> 05:36.400]  we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come
[05:36.400 --> 05:41.360]  in for a long time? So I took it back to full process. I was thinking, you know what, we
[05:41.360 --> 05:46.040]  need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is the right product everybody needs.
[05:46.040 --> 05:50.680]  So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself
[05:50.680 --> 05:56.280]  and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right
[05:56.280 --> 06:25.280]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[06:25.280 --> 06:38.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're tuned in to this live Sunday, March 13th edition of the Alex
[06:38.200 --> 06:45.160]  Jones show. It's an honor to be with you this evening. And I am pumping right now. I've
[06:45.160 --> 06:50.920]  got the adrenaline pumping. I am high as a kite right now. No, I don't need any sort
[06:50.920 --> 06:56.880]  of stimulants or drugs. I am fighting for freedom and truth in this country. And I just
[06:56.880 --> 07:07.520]  got done dealing with a bunch of pro pedophile freaks at the governor's mansion here in Austin.
[07:07.520 --> 07:16.480]  And it's just, it's so crazy because I got to be honest. It's not that I'm numb to this
[07:16.480 --> 07:25.680]  because if I was numb to it, I wouldn't care. But these freaks have become such a normal
[07:25.680 --> 07:33.120]  part of our culture or what I deal with as a journalist that I don't even have the proper
[07:33.120 --> 07:38.520]  response to it. Because it really is kind of a fight or flight thing. You either want
[07:38.520 --> 07:42.720]  to get the hell away from these deviants or you want to fight them. And I'm not talking
[07:42.720 --> 07:47.640]  about physically, though I was assaulted multiple times today and that's pretty typical stuff.
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.360]  And they get away with it right in front of police. I'm not going to complain, fine, whatever.
[07:52.360 --> 07:58.920]  I have to get assaulted as a journalist in the year 2022 and 21 and 2019 and 18 and 17
[07:58.920 --> 08:03.520]  and 16. So I mean, it's just seven years of me getting assaulted as a journalist. And
[08:03.520 --> 08:10.040]  I've only been able to get one person arrested, dozens of assaults on camera, spat on, punched,
[08:10.040 --> 08:14.880]  death-threaded, dozens of times. And I've only managed to get one of them arrested and that
[08:14.880 --> 08:21.040]  was a sexual assault when the woman came and grabbed my genitalia on public. So I've got
[08:21.040 --> 08:24.400]  one out about a hundred assaults. So I was assaulted another dozen times a day. But that's
[08:24.400 --> 08:35.600]  fine. You know what? I accept that. But see, it's almost disgusting that it's such a normal
[08:35.600 --> 08:44.160]  thing to me that I'm not honestly, like, on air crying, weeping that this is my society.
[08:44.160 --> 08:51.320]  Because really, I should be. I should be heartbroken. I should be, like, we should be devastated
[08:51.320 --> 08:57.600]  that this is going on. Not, not, not for me. Not, not because I'm a grown man and somebody
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.520]  wants to try to punch me and run away or spit on me or whatever. That's fine. I'm a grown
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.960]  man. I mean, you know, you want to try to fight me? That's another thing. No, I'm talking
[09:06.960 --> 09:15.200]  about for the children. I'm talking about for the children that these deviants want the
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.280]  world to be them to grow up in. And, and I, it's just, it's so demonic. It's so perverted.
[09:22.280 --> 09:29.480]  It's so evil that I just go out there. Folks, I didn't go out with a bullhorn. Yeah, okay.
[09:29.480 --> 09:34.520]  I'm Owen Troyer from info wars. So it's like, Oh, okay, he's the bad guy. He's gonna, he's
[09:34.520 --> 09:41.280]  gonna get mobbed. But I walk up doing a live stream, not even trying to provoke just wanting
[09:41.280 --> 09:47.680]  to go film what they're talking about, what they're doing. And a crowd of these deviants
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.480]  forms around me, starts moshing around me, bumping into me, rubbing their armpits in
[09:52.480 --> 10:02.740]  my face, doing little subtle jabs and elbows in the midst of the crowd, punching me. Why?
[10:02.740 --> 10:07.720]  Because I'm willing to call them out for what they are. And that's pedophiles. I'm done
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.040]  playing games. So you know what? Maybe it's fine that I'm not going to cry because these
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.080]  sexual perverts want to destroy the future for the children and want to destroy the children's
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.280]  lives before they even hit puberty. So maybe that's a good thing that I don't weep for that.
[10:21.280 --> 10:30.320]  And instead I get into a fight response intellectually, politically with these people. So what did
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.520]  I do? So all I did was I asked, what's a trans kid? This is a pro trans kid rally. What is
[10:35.520 --> 10:49.360]  a trans kid? They don't respond because there is no such thing as a trans kid. There is
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.040]  no such thing as a trans kid. Oh, yeah. And they have all the brainwash minions out there
[10:54.040 --> 10:58.360]  protesting for Ukraine at the Capitol every day. They're geopolitical experts. They love
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.520]  Ukraine and Zelensky so much. They have no idea where it is on a map or any of the history
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.680]  there. So they just go out there like, oh, they love Ukraine. Russia's so bad. They don't
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.960]  have a clue. But I guess it's all the same. So I guess it actually makes sense that you
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.080]  have the pro Ukraine rally and then caddy corner, you have the pro pedophile rally
[11:18.080 --> 11:26.400]  because it's all the same. That's not an attack on the Ukrainian people. Putin doesn't want
[11:26.400 --> 11:35.520]  Ukraine to have troglodytes and cretins like these sexually perverted freaks in Russia
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.360]  and in Ukraine. He doesn't want this crap in his backyard. Say whatever you want about
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.840]  Vladimir Putin, bad guy, oligarchs, all the crap. Fine. You know what though? Putin doesn't
[11:44.840 --> 11:52.920]  want trans kids in Ukraine, which is what the EU will bring, which is what the West
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.280]  will bring. And Putin says no. You know what happens to pedophiles in Russia? They get
[11:58.280 --> 12:06.240]  disappeared to Siberia. One of the worst parts of this planet, cold, isolated, desolate.
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.240]  You get forgotten about in Siberia. That's where they send pedophiles. Here they get
[12:10.240 --> 12:16.760]  invited to the governor's mansion to do speeches about trans kids. So I guess it actually culturally
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.760]  makes sense to have all the brainwashed minions for Ukraine protesting and then caddy corner
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.040]  having the pedophiles protesting because it's all one and the same. They don't even realize
[12:27.040 --> 12:38.040]  it. They don't know it, but they're attached at the hip. So it's, look, the crew is just
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.080]  going through my footage right now, which is just the point of view of me. I'm just holding
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.840]  a camera walking through these masses. But we've got other HD footage coming. Rob was
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.800]  out there filming HD. Another great member of the staff was out there shooting HD. There
[12:52.800 --> 13:00.040]  were other journalists out there shooting HD. But all you have to do, all you have to
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.880]  do, because it's rare that I get to go do this anymore because of just threats against
[13:06.880 --> 13:12.720]  me, security restrictions, traveling restrictions, just all kinds of restrictions, obviously,
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.600]  that you're probably well aware of. So it's rare that I get to go do this, which is kind
[13:18.600 --> 13:24.960]  of the genre that I created of online content, just going out into the masses of these brainwashed
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.240]  fools and just asking them questions and getting them on camera. Now it's a whole genre of
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.880]  content on the Internet. So it's not so bad that I can't really do it anymore because
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.160]  others are doing it. But boy, oh boy, when they get their chance to get it on Shroyer,
[13:37.160 --> 13:44.400]  they lick their chops. And they all, and they, and they've got these 300 pound women,
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.400]  like they say woolly mammoths are extinct. I beg to differ after what I saw today. And
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.960]  they get these 300 pound women that are like bigger than NFL linebackers and they don't
[13:53.960 --> 13:58.680]  shave their armpits and they come up to you with their arms in the air and they rub their
[13:58.680 --> 14:11.000]  hairy armpits in your face. Pro trans kids. What is a trans kid? There's no such thing
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.080]  as a trans kid until one of these pedophiles gets their hands on them and turns them into
[14:16.080 --> 14:26.360]  one. And you can just tell who they are. I mean, look at that demon. Oh my gosh, guys,
[14:26.360 --> 14:30.520]  pause it right there. Hold on. Hold on. I know who that is. No, no, no, no. See that
[14:30.520 --> 14:37.160]  seat, that one right there. Yep. Yep. Yes, it is. This is an individual right here. I've
[14:37.160 --> 14:41.520]  run into this individual. That must be a full trans person now. That was a man two years
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.400]  ago. That person right there was a man two years ago with a beard and was licking my
[14:47.400 --> 14:54.120]  microphone during a live report at a pro abortion rally. You see how these freaks operate?
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.920]  They're always there. They're always changing their appearance and changing their scent
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.840]  and changing their hair color because it's all about being demonic. It's all about being
[15:04.840 --> 15:11.200]  deviant. It's all about being perverted. It's all a big game to them. And so if they can
[15:11.200 --> 15:18.360]  get the children, then oh yeah, they like that. Yeah, they can get the children to play
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.560]  their demonic games. If they can get the children to play their pedophile games. If they can
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.520]  get the children to play their perverted games. Yeah, that's like the total victory
[15:27.520 --> 15:34.320]  to destroy the innocence. But see, there actually is a more psychological aspect of this for
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.160]  some of them. Some of these grown adults are still children intellectually. They've never
[15:39.160 --> 15:44.080]  matured. I mean, physically they've matured, but intellectually they're still children.
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.360]  That's why they're attracted to children, folks, because they're children. They've never matured
[15:49.360 --> 15:53.000]  to an adult. So they're still attracted to children. That's why they want to play with
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.400]  their with their genitalia and chop it off.
[16:00.400 --> 16:06.760]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February,
[16:06.760 --> 16:13.000]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3. That has all three
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.560]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[16:19.560 --> 16:25.120]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.120]  the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.040]  we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.000]  in for a long time? So I took it back to full price. And I was just thinking, you know what,
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.720]  we need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is the right product everybody needs.
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.360]  So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself
[16:49.360 --> 16:54.960]  and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.840]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[16:59.840 --> 17:05.080]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.880]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job. And I heard Dr.
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.720]  Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.680]  shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.040]  with F2. You had, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really excited
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.080]  about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.240]  like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.240]  again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.600]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[17:40.600 --> 17:45.320]  I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.680]  It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[17:49.680 --> 17:53.560]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[17:53.560 --> 17:54.560]  our own hands.
[17:54.560 --> 18:00.080]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[18:00.080 --> 18:07.520]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[18:07.520 --> 18:13.640]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.880]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[18:19.880 --> 18:26.240]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[18:26.240 --> 18:32.880]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.360]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem
[18:38.360 --> 18:43.080]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada,
[18:43.080 --> 18:49.520]  they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.760]  world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[18:53.760 --> 19:00.440]  serious situation. Stay tuned to info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.

[20:01.360 --> 20:17.400]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:17.400 --> 20:30.960]  So I'm convinced one of the beasts that I face down at a pro pedophile event in Austin,
[20:30.960 --> 20:35.880]  Texas today is what's formerly a man and we found the two images. We let the audience
[20:35.880 --> 20:41.640]  be the judge here. The crew is deliberating. I'm convinced it's the same person. There's
[20:41.640 --> 20:45.880]  the individual from a pro abortion rally I think it was two years ago that licked my
[20:45.880 --> 20:51.160]  microphone and was doing all kinds of demented behavior on camera. And then now here's that
[20:51.160 --> 20:56.520]  individual today. And so you be the judge. I think it's the same person. The only difference
[20:56.520 --> 21:02.640]  is that today's version of this individual is showered and clean shaven because let me
[21:02.640 --> 21:08.080]  tell you when I ran into this creature a couple of years ago at the Capitol, it was no way
[21:08.080 --> 21:14.120]  there had been a shower or any sort of hygiene process in two weeks. Let's just say there
[21:14.120 --> 21:25.320]  was a odious scent that perpetuated throughout any space that that person occupied. But this
[21:25.320 --> 21:31.280]  individual is a clean shaven female version of the deviant that I ran into a few years
[21:31.280 --> 21:36.520]  back at the Capitol. That's the same person. I mean, let's be clear. And that's just one
[21:36.520 --> 21:41.280]  screenshot. So you see, it's all about deception with these people. It's all about games with
[21:41.280 --> 21:45.960]  these people. They're demons, man. They're they're little gremlins that run around and
[21:45.960 --> 21:52.600]  their whole purpose in life is to just destroy the world. That's what gets them off. Deception
[21:52.600 --> 22:00.960]  destruction. That's their game. Pro trans kids. You're a damn pedophile, man. I'm not
[22:00.960 --> 22:08.200]  playing these games. I'm not I'm not playing your little word game. Oh, pro trans. There
[22:08.200 --> 22:16.360]  is no such thing as a trans kid until you perverts get your hands on them. That's it.
[22:16.360 --> 22:24.920]  Pretty simple stuff. But oh, they have their rallies in Austin, Texas. They they literally
[22:24.920 --> 22:32.280]  wave around the pedophile flag. So they don't even hide it, folks. It's all about it's all
[22:32.280 --> 22:39.840]  about deviancy. It's all about deception. It's all about ruining what is normal, ruining
[22:39.840 --> 22:48.160]  the world. So again, the crew is still debating. Is it the same guy? Is it not? It's because
[22:48.160 --> 22:51.840]  here's the thing. I've been to go into these things for long enough. It's always the same
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.080]  people, man. There's like a group of 200, 300 of these damn demon perverts in this city,
[22:57.080 --> 23:05.440]  and they all go to the same crap. Trans kids, pro trans kids. There is no such thing. And
[23:05.440 --> 23:11.520]  I'm writing down Congress Avenue here. It's one of the main drags to get into downtown
[23:11.520 --> 23:18.160]  and you cross the river. A lot of street traffic south by Southwest going on. And I'm writing
[23:18.160 --> 23:23.640]  down Congress and I'm on the PA on the truck and I'm saying there's a pro trans kids rally
[23:23.640 --> 23:28.080]  and people are like trans kids, trans kids. What are trans kids? It's like, yeah, that's
[23:28.080 --> 23:36.560]  what the left is doing here. You think I want to go out in public and be the guy on a public
[23:36.560 --> 23:44.200]  address system saying that the Democrat left in America is pro trans kids? You think that's
[23:44.200 --> 23:49.040]  fun? Okay, I'll be honest. There's a little bit of fun to it, but no. Like you're looked
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.640]  at like you're the freak. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be the freak here. There's
[23:53.640 --> 24:00.360]  a group of people 10 blocks down the road that want to chop children's genitals up.
[24:00.360 --> 24:10.560]  Yeah, that's going on 10 blocks from where you're at right now. Now, I'm not going to
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.920]  belabor this, the entire transmission, because we've got other big news going on that I'm
[24:15.920 --> 24:22.240]  going to cover with with specifically all of the updates out of Ukraine. And then I have
[24:22.240 --> 24:27.320]  a guest coming up in studio as well to talk about the gas situation that the Biden administration
[24:27.320 --> 24:33.320]  is lying about. But see, I don't go to this event and there's all these trans individuals
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.960]  out there and cross stressors and drag queens and all this stuff. I don't go to this event
[24:37.960 --> 24:42.400]  because I have a problem with them. If you're an adult, you're of consenting age, you want
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.520]  to do whatever you want with your body. It's none of my business, quite frankly. That is
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.600]  until you show up at a restaurant as a man dressed as a woman in a thong with your ass
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.280]  out while people are trying to eat breakfast. Then there's something wrong there. But you
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.360]  know what I did? I took my food and left because I'm not going to eat in a restaurant with
[25:01.360 --> 25:06.480]  it the clowns bare ass in my face while I'm trying to eat breakfast. Oh, but that's what
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.720]  you got to do in South by Southwest is in town. See, it's the freak show. It's the freak
[25:10.720 --> 25:19.240]  parade. So I'm not going to belabor this point, but let me just tell you, the crew did a great
[25:19.240 --> 25:23.120]  job out there today. Security did a great job out there today. My driver did a great
[25:23.120 --> 25:28.640]  job out there today. And I'm glad I'm still able to do these events and go cover these
[25:28.640 --> 25:37.240]  events when I can with all the restrictions placed on me. And we're going to continue
[25:37.240 --> 25:44.240]  to cover these events when we can. Thanks to your support at info or store.com. Because
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.360]  let me tell you, you know, they make a joke of it when I go out there, they're like shroy
[25:48.360 --> 25:56.360]  or needs security. Uh, no, no, that's not it. But you know what? Yeah, I don't want to
[25:56.360 --> 26:02.200]  be put in a situation where I have to get into a fist fight with a group of gremlins.
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.520]  And then I have to walk out of there on my own feet, bloodied because you people are
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.920]  trying to assault me. And Alex Jones cares about me enough to make sure I don't get into
[26:12.920 --> 26:19.240]  that situation. So yeah, we send security out there. That's called smart. But that's
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.960]  what I'm saying. Just to go out and cover these events, to have the driver of the truck,
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.600]  to have the security, to have the camera crew, it's not cheap. And I try to do it as cheaply
[26:28.600 --> 26:34.660]  and easily as I possibly can. But that's just the case. But because of your support at info
[26:34.660 --> 26:39.200]  or store.com folks, we will never relent. We will never back down. We will continue our
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.880]  attempts to expand in the face of this madness. We will continue to confront these deviance
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.760]  face to face when it when it calls for it. And we will continue to be right here on the
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.620]  air covering the news like nobody else will. And it's all thanks to your support at info
[26:55.620 --> 27:02.840]  or store.com. And by the way, I'm so glad now, it seems that every day, when I go to
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.440]  band.video, there's new channels popping up. And you can scroll down the channels. It's
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.240]  like if you have a, you know, satellite TV or something, and you just scroll through
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.560]  all the hundreds or thousands of channels. That's what it's like on band.video now with
[27:17.560 --> 27:21.400]  all the other contributors and channels that we have there because they're getting banned
[27:21.400 --> 27:24.640]  everywhere else. So they get banned. We say, Hey, you got a big audience. You got good
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.040]  content. You come on to band out video. We don't charge them for that. We pay the millions
[27:31.040 --> 27:37.120]  of dollars every month for the bandwidth for the archives and the live streams gladly.
[27:37.120 --> 27:40.600]  But that's what you're paying for when you shop at info or store.com. And we've got the
[27:40.600 --> 27:50.480]  best supplements. They keep me energized folks. I'll tell you that. You get yourself some
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.600]  super male vitality. You get yourself some brain force ultra. You get yourself some turbo
[27:54.600 --> 28:01.600]  force and you take off baby. And see, that's what they hate because they know I have real
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.160]  energy, human energy, God energy that I get from the creator and they know it. See, they
[28:07.160 --> 28:13.360]  get demon energy from underneath. Probably like crawls up their ass or something. That's
[28:13.360 --> 28:19.240]  why they're into diddling the little kids genitals. And they fear me because I come
[28:19.240 --> 28:24.160]  with a team of men and women that have energy from God, the creator, and they can see it
[28:24.160 --> 28:29.080]  and they can feel it. And all I have to do is come within 50 yards of these creeps and
[28:29.080 --> 28:34.680]  they all storm upon me because they know I've got the real energy folks. That's the same.
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.480]  Look at that. So I'm going to move on from this. But folks, again, if you like our coverage,
[28:39.480 --> 28:43.960]  if you like me going to these events, if you like band out video, get a great supplement
[28:43.960 --> 28:50.120]  from infowarstore.com, brain force ultra on sale 40% off, winter sun, plus that's the

[28:57.040 --> 29:05.480]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and
[29:05.480 --> 29:11.920]  viewers. If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your
[29:11.920 --> 29:16.600]  immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will
[29:16.600 --> 29:22.160]  change your life. It will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone has iodine
[29:22.160 --> 29:28.040]  deficiency. Look into it for yourself. It's the opposite of fluoride. It's the good halogen
[29:28.040 --> 29:33.600]  and then your purchase of X3 funds our operation. Now a lot of our products have been sold out
[29:33.600 --> 29:37.800]  and never came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain breakouts, they were sold
[29:37.800 --> 29:42.280]  out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off. A lot of folks are getting
[29:42.280 --> 29:46.160]  it and I was thinking, you know what? I'm going to bring it back on sale again just
[29:46.160 --> 29:49.920]  until it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long run,
[29:49.920 --> 29:53.920]  a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to
[29:53.920 --> 29:58.640]  stay on air. See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:58.640 --> 30:11.600]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[30:11.600 --> 30:21.000]  humanity. Then our God's sake will reward us with eternal life. That's basically the
[30:21.000 --> 30:28.800]  ethos of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the
[30:28.800 --> 30:34.520]  fittest in their social Darwinistic system and in a way they're right. If we let them
[30:34.520 --> 30:40.040]  lie to us and dump us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence
[30:40.040 --> 30:45.680]  is overwhelming and out in the open. We really deserve what's happened to us. So I ask you
[30:45.680 --> 30:52.360]  now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm pledging
[30:52.360 --> 30:59.460]  to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is infowarstore.com.
[30:59.460 --> 31:04.960]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[31:04.960 --> 31:10.400]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[31:10.400 --> 31:15.320]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and
[31:15.320 --> 31:21.240]  what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[31:21.240 --> 31:25.440]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[31:25.440 --> 31:30.040]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody
[31:30.040 --> 31:35.800]  should visit infowarstore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in

[32:00.440 --> 32:05.560]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as
[32:05.560 --> 32:10.240]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store.com.
[32:10.240 --> 32:16.040]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[32:16.040 --> 32:21.240]  get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need
[32:21.240 --> 32:26.080]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[32:26.080 --> 32:30.680]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every
[32:30.680 --> 32:37.040]  day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great
[32:37.040 --> 32:41.960]  for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and
[32:41.960 --> 32:46.680]  extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to
[32:46.680 --> 32:52.120]  the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force
[32:52.120 --> 32:56.480]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[32:56.480 --> 33:04.200]  you moving and feeling great at any age. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[33:04.200 --> 33:17.280]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones from the front lines of the information war. It's
[33:17.280 --> 33:25.600]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The blue checks are out protecting
[33:25.600 --> 33:32.600]  their sexual deviants today. The blue checks on Twitter. They're upset because I was at
[33:32.600 --> 33:38.680]  the pro pedophile rally. That's how I see it. You want to rally to talk about genital
[33:38.680 --> 33:47.040]  utilization of children? That's pedophilia to me. I don't know where you come from.
[33:47.040 --> 33:57.960]  Some folks from info wars have showed up here at the rally for transgender youth. You promoting
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.640]  transgender youth, you should realize that you're the bad guy here. There's been some
[34:02.640 --> 34:06.520]  pushing and scuffles. Yeah, every time I show up, they push and scuffle and try to fight
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.800]  me and stab me and spin on me. So they are state troopers telling people to calm down
[34:11.800 --> 34:19.960]  and create space. Folks, we literally have them throwing punches at me and they act like
[34:19.960 --> 34:25.160]  they're the peaceful, loving, tolerant people. All they do is flick me off, assault me, scream
[34:25.160 --> 34:31.240]  at me, insult me. But yes, you guys, it's like they don't even realize you're giving
[34:31.240 --> 34:37.760]  me the exact type of content I want to get. You can't even help yourself. It's like, yeah,
[34:37.760 --> 34:43.400]  I show up to show the world how psychotic and deviant you are. That's why I go to this
[34:43.400 --> 34:51.560]  stuff. And then you just deliver. You just deliver after deliver. I mean, you are like
[34:51.560 --> 35:01.120]  Carl Malone, the mailman. You just keep delivering. You just cannot help yourselves, can you?
[35:01.120 --> 35:08.840]  But see, you should realize they are out here in gay banana outfits. Literally. It's gay
[35:08.840 --> 35:17.120]  bananas. You should realize when you're promoting genital mutilation of children that you're
[35:17.120 --> 35:24.200]  the bad guy, not the guy that wants you to keep your hands off of children. You that
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.280]  want to mutilate children's genitals. You're the problem here. You're the bad guy. I mean,
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.160]  just look at how these people look. And that's what I'm saying is the crew's like, you know,
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.880]  you should talk about what's what's actually wrong with these people. There's something
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.960]  wrong with their biochemistry. Why do they all look like that? Why do they all look like
[35:43.960 --> 35:49.440]  sweaty, obese perverts? Why do they all look demonic? Why do they all have this dark energy?
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.920]  Why do they all look and sound and smell the same? There's something there. So I don't
[35:54.920 --> 35:59.800]  know if it's this individual that licked my microphone and tried to lick me two years
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.040]  ago at the Capitol. This deranged leftist. I don't know if it's the same person I saw
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.400]  today. It looks the same, but they just all look and smell and sound the same. It's a
[36:08.400 --> 36:17.320]  brainwashed cult. It's Satan's army. I mean, folks, I'm I'm going up against Satan's pedophile
[36:17.320 --> 36:26.200]  army, man. Oh my gosh. And what do you think? Again, it's the same people. They'll they'll
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.200]  do a defund the police rally, and then they beg the police to come stop me from attending
[36:31.200 --> 36:40.080]  their event. What do you think all the international media that was in town for South by Southwest
[36:40.080 --> 36:46.960]  that happened to pop by your event? What do you think they thought of you? You just showed
[36:46.960 --> 36:54.200]  the world what a bunch of freak shows you are. And you think like you think waving a pedophile
[36:54.200 --> 37:03.800]  flag is a good look. You think chanting to chop children's genitals up is a good look.
[37:03.800 --> 37:11.160]  You're gone, man. You're not with us anymore. You're with Satan. You're somewhere else.
[37:11.160 --> 37:16.200]  And you know what? Maybe I can't help you, but I'd like to help the children that you
[37:16.200 --> 37:24.240]  want to get your dirty little paws on. And you just see it in their eyes, man. And you
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.480]  just see it when you look into their eyes and they look back at you. It's it's a deep
[37:28.480 --> 37:34.320]  something else. It's not it's not a human to human experience, man. It's a it's a it's
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.680]  a demonic possession, evil, domineering, knowing what you're out there doing, knowing you want
[37:41.680 --> 37:47.400]  to protect kids, knowing that you have God by your side. It's it's all. Yeah, we're going
[37:47.400 --> 37:56.160]  to get you. We're going to get those kids too. Yeah. And you think me showing up to
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.560]  these events, fighting against the leftist agenda of pro pedophilia, you think that's
[38:01.560 --> 38:06.960]  going to help me in the in the persecution that I'm dealing with or do you think they're
[38:06.960 --> 38:14.720]  going to come after me even harder? But guess what? You're not going to get your hands on
[38:14.720 --> 38:24.480]  the kids, you demons. You're not going to chop up little boys and girls, genitals, you freaks.
[38:24.480 --> 38:29.640]  Not in Texas, damn it. You want to do that crap, you go out to California, you went to
[38:29.640 --> 38:35.720]  the rest of you communist freaks. You try to chop up little boys and girls, genitals
[38:35.720 --> 38:43.920]  in the state of Texas, we're coming for you. That is child abuse and we're coming for you.
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.120]  You're not going to abuse children in Texas and you're not going to go out in the governor's
[38:49.120 --> 38:57.360]  mansion and brag about it. And I hope governor Abbott witness that today and I hope he gets
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.920]  even more hardcore going up against these deviants. I hope Ken Paxton gets even more
[39:01.920 --> 39:07.280]  hardcore going up against these deviants. I mean, look, if you had to get a babysitter
[39:07.280 --> 39:13.240]  for your kids and let's say you just lined up a bunch of people, do you think you'd hire
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.760]  these freak shows for one second or do you think you'd say, huh, I have a feeling these
[39:17.760 --> 39:21.480]  people are going to abuse my children or touch my children inappropriately. They're not getting
[39:21.480 --> 39:27.360]  anywhere near my kids. You wouldn't hire a single one of these freaks to be anywhere
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.400]  near your kids. But see, that's why they want to be teachers and that's why they want to
[39:31.400 --> 39:38.880]  run daycare facilities because they know nobody would willingly allow them access to children.
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.760]  Nobody would voluntarily give these freak shows access to their children. So they disguise
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.240]  themselves as teachers and drag queen story times and daycare providers and then they get
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.400]  those kids in the classroom and they teach them how to have anal sex and give blow jobs
[39:53.400 --> 40:00.600]  and wave the gay flag and turn them into tranny so that they can sexually be abused. Yeah,
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.040]  we know what you're on to. We know what you're doing. And thank God for Ken Paxton for standing
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.280]  up to it. Thank God for Governor Abbott for standing up to it. I mean, my God, if Governor
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.240]  Abbott can't do anything else, but at least protect the kids from these demons, then good
[40:14.240 --> 40:20.280]  for him. Good for him. What do you think is going to happen if Beto O'Rourke gets into
[40:20.280 --> 40:30.720]  Texas? You're going to watch the whole school system go pro tranny. No. All right, so look,
[40:30.720 --> 40:38.280]  I've got to move on from all of this. And so all I'm going to say is the full HD footage
[40:38.280 --> 40:45.600]  is going up to Band Out video. It'll be up probably by the end of the night. Oh, my gosh.
[40:45.600 --> 40:51.440]  And then we're going to have a little bit of a highlight type of real thing to probably
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.080]  by tomorrow. And then if you want to see all of my footage that was just a live stream
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.560]  on Getter, you can just go to my Getter account at all I do is Owen. And you don't even need
[41:00.560 --> 41:03.920]  an account to go watch it. You just go scroll down. You'll see the video. It's a picture
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.800]  of me in the Info Wars truck. And it's about an hour and a half live stream. And it's
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.560]  just going up and down the streets in the truck and then me getting out and confronting
[41:12.560 --> 41:29.760]  these wicked ones. Can you imagine that pro trans kids? I mean, what is that? That's why
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.400]  I asked what is a trans kid and they can't answer because there's no such thing. There
[41:34.400 --> 41:42.160]  is no such thing as a trans kid until these freaks get their hands on them. That's what
[41:42.160 --> 41:50.760]  it is. Oh, but see, the Department of Homeland Security has new rules on extremism. And now
[41:50.760 --> 41:55.880]  if you question elections, you're considered a terrorist. Unless, of course, you're a Democrat,
[41:55.880 --> 42:00.560]  then it's okay. If you're Hillary or Stacey Abrams, you can question elections forever
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.560]  and you won't be a terrorist. It's only a Christian or a conservative or a Trump supporter
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.400]  or a Republican. You're not allowed to question elections. So all this stuff that you see
[42:09.400 --> 42:14.920]  being introduced is all just political persecution. It's all just creating the system where if
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.960]  you're a liberal Democrat, you can get away with murder literally now, whether you're
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.080]  Mike officer, Mike bird that killed Ashley Babbitt or the officer that beat Roseanne
[42:23.080 --> 42:30.200]  Boyle into death or the individual in Denver, Colorado that shot a Trump supporter murdered
[42:30.200 --> 42:34.960]  him in the streets. The Denver DA just dropped the case, just dropped the case, just killed
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.720]  the person cold blood to drop the case. But if you're a conservative, if you're a Trump
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.280]  supporter, if you're a Christian, if you're a Republican, you have no rights. You're
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.360]  a terrorist, you're going to be arrested, you better sit down, you better shut up and
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.040]  you better give your kids over to the liberal left pedophile establishment because they're
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.600]  going to turn them into trans. And if you don't like that, you're a terrorist and we're
[42:56.600 --> 43:05.200]  going to lock you up forever. It's hard to believe that we're already into March, 2022.
[43:05.200 --> 43:10.880]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship
[43:10.880 --> 43:17.400]  product X three. And as all three types of the amazing iodine, your body needs for every
[43:17.400 --> 43:23.080]  electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your
[43:23.080 --> 43:28.800]  libido, so much. And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient. This is
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.520]  the very best iodine out there. So we have on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.320]  of what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long time. So I took it back to full
[43:38.320 --> 43:42.560]  products. And I was just thinking, you know what, we need to funds in now to stay on air.
[43:42.560 --> 43:47.160]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs. So incentivize folks out there that have been
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.280]  on the fence to get X three and experience it yourself and support the broadcast. I'm
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.600]  going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X three right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[43:57.600 --> 44:06.360]  for 50% off. It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty of war is the truth. And
[44:06.360 --> 44:13.160]  the next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that is very very follows.
[44:13.160 --> 44:20.760]  But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and master censorship.
[44:20.760 --> 44:27.080]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[44:27.080 --> 44:35.760]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[44:35.760 --> 44:41.120]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned. And of course now Canada is under this legislation
[44:41.120 --> 44:47.240]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[44:47.240 --> 44:53.080]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.600]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.120]  wars.com more important than ever. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[45:04.120 --> 45:08.760]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[45:08.760 --> 45:14.400]  and thank goodness for info wars store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.800]  turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy
[45:18.800 --> 45:24.400]  turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.400]  the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.800]  at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones sore list.
[45:34.800 --> 45:39.840]  I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.480]  need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[45:45.480 --> 45:50.280]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.960]  to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity
[45:54.960 --> 46:02.640]  you need for every day and sore list can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[46:02.640 --> 46:08.800]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.800]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.720]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[47:01.480 --> 47:08.480]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[30:44.460 --> 47:45.440]  And now everybody knows Joe Biden is an unmitigated embarrassment and failure
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.440]  as a president, including those that were so anti-Trump and promotional of Biden leading
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.120]  up to the 2020 election. Like the not funny host of the Daily Show, Trevor Noah. Here
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.680]  he is just being honest about the situation right now with Biden in clip one. There is
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.960]  no denying that Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball with Joe Biden. And you know what? You
[48:05.960 --> 48:13.680]  can say what you want, but this would have never happened to Donald Trump. Never. No
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.160]  one was ever ignoring Donald Trump's calls. Yeah, because if you ignored Donald Trump's
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.520]  calls, you didn't know how he would respond. Maybe he'd send an angry tweet or maybe he'd
[48:23.520 --> 48:27.960]  just like ban your country from everything. You don't know. That's why I bet in these
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.880]  situations Biden actually wishes that he could hire Trump to step in as president wild card.
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.680]  You know, just keep everyone on their toes. Because if Trump was calling, you best believe
[48:36.680 --> 48:40.680]  the UAE. They'll be racing to pick up the phone. Oh, Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, we're here.
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.360]  We're here. Hello. Too late, Ahmed. You made me wait two rings. We're bombing the UAE and
[48:46.360 --> 48:57.960]  the UFC just in case. Is this the, uh, is this the reckoning of the left? Now, I could
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.920]  see that, you know, the Trump derangement syndrome and some people is starting to wane.
[49:02.920 --> 49:08.560]  Maybe Trevor knows an example. And there's members that are of the Democrat left, liberal
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.320]  progressive left in America that just aren't fully psychotic. See where the party's going
[49:13.320 --> 49:18.480]  and want nothing to do with it. Kind of like a Bill Maher and a Tulsi Gabbard. But what
[49:18.480 --> 49:25.840]  is this reckoning going to look like? Because really it's the media that's to blame. Of
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.040]  course, Biden's a liar and a fraud. That's not going to change. But who sold Joe Biden?
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.560]  Who covered for Joe Biden? Who lied about the emails? Who lied about Joe Biden? I mean,
[49:35.560 --> 49:41.400]  who, who told you he was in good health? Who told you he was fit? So really the reckoning
[49:41.400 --> 49:47.480]  needs to be with the media that brainwashed them into believing all this crap. I mean,
[49:47.480 --> 49:50.680]  you, of course you could blame the Democrat party. It's, it's their media. It's their
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.320]  talking points. But it's this, I mean, what's the reckoning going to look like? Cause there's
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.920]  going to be some kind of a reckoning. You're already seeing it. And here, here's some of
[50:00.920 --> 50:08.240]  the headlines with it. These graphs prove Joe Biden lying through his teeth about Russia
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.960]  causing high inflation and gas prices. And again, I mean, you look at any of the graphs
[50:12.960 --> 50:22.240]  as, as it was pointed out by John Carl on ABC News this weekend. He's no, he's no conservative.
[50:22.240 --> 50:26.800]  If you look at the numbers, inflation really started to rise almost exactly when Biden
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.320]  came into the White House. So again, whether it's, I mean, there's all these things that
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.560]  they try to deny, like, Oh, the vaccines, the COVID vaccines are killing people and you
[50:34.560 --> 50:40.160]  go look at the VAERS charts. As soon as the COVID vaccine was introduced, the vaccine
[50:40.160 --> 50:47.000]  death number goes sky high. Well, that's not a coincidence. We know what that is. Same
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.680]  with inflation. Same with illegal immigration. Same with all this other crap with Joe Biden.
[50:51.680 --> 50:56.840]  You can't deny the graphs. No matter how much the media tries to cover up for Joe Biden,
[50:56.840 --> 51:03.680]  no matter how much the brainwash left tries to deny what's going on. It's so obvious to
[51:03.680 --> 51:07.880]  thinking people and people that just aren't total liars. Yeah, Biden did all of this.
[51:07.880 --> 51:12.360]  It's kind of like when Trump got into office and the stock market, they called it the Trump
[51:12.360 --> 51:17.360]  mountain. It's like, yeah, that was Trump did that. I mean, you couldn't say Trump did
[51:17.360 --> 51:25.160]  that exclusively, but Trump getting into office started the movements that led to that.
[51:25.160 --> 51:28.880]  So it's just all the evidence that Biden is causing all these issues and they just act
[51:28.880 --> 51:38.120]  like it's Putin's fault. Scott Jennings on CNN roasts White House lackey for relying
[51:38.120 --> 51:47.800]  on Venezuela and Iran for gas. Oh yeah. Oh, the Iranians that chant death to America,
[51:47.800 --> 51:51.640]  the Venezuelans that are starving their own people. And that's who we're going to for
[51:51.640 --> 51:58.480]  gas now because we won't produce our own. And that's good. Iranian gas, good Venezuelan
[51:58.480 --> 52:08.120]  gas, good Russian gas, bad Putin, bad Larry Summers is second Obama economic advisor to
[52:08.120 --> 52:16.120]  blame Biden for inflation. So that's why you see not Joe Biden because he can't hack it.
[52:16.120 --> 52:23.280]  It's Jen Psaki. It's it's it's Democrats and media and state department officials. Biden's
[52:23.280 --> 52:27.480]  not to blame. It's not Biden's fault. It's Putin's fault. It's Russia's fault. Oh, it's
[52:27.480 --> 52:36.400]  your fault. No, it's Biden's economic policy. It's Biden's foreign policy. It's Biden's
[52:36.400 --> 52:42.160]  domestic policy. That's what's doing all of this. And it and it's just the left just
[52:42.160 --> 52:48.120]  denies the I mean their own hand in front of their own face. But see, Biden can't even
[52:48.120 --> 52:54.520]  do weekend interviews. And so they send Saki around to do Biden's job during the weekend
[52:54.520 --> 53:00.440]  while he's getting medical treatments in Delaware. And she just goes on TV saying, Oh, the inflation
[53:00.440 --> 53:05.080]  but but here's the story. Remember, it was inflation doesn't exist. There's no inflation
[53:05.080 --> 53:09.840]  under Biden. Then it was Oh, the inflation is transitory. Then it's Oh, the inflation
[53:09.840 --> 53:14.640]  is a good thing because it hurts the rich. It's exact opposite of the truth. And then
[53:14.640 --> 53:20.400]  Oh, inflation is Putin's fault. They just keep lying, keep moving the goalposts because
[53:20.400 --> 53:24.900]  it's so obvious that this administration has been an absolute disaster. And even liberals
[53:24.900 --> 53:30.320]  and Democrats are realizing it now. Trevor Noah blasts Biden over world leaders ignoring
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.720]  him would have never happened to Donald Trump. You just heard the clip. Bill Maher defends
[53:34.720 --> 53:40.360]  Florida education bill. Maybe kids that young shouldn't be thinking about sex at all. Wow.
[53:40.360 --> 53:46.480]  That's called common sense. That's called common sense. And you know what's an extension
[53:46.480 --> 53:57.920]  of that common sense? An extension is if you want to mutilate children's genitals or you
[53:57.920 --> 54:08.440]  want to put them on life altering drugs, that's child abuse. So see, that's what they do is
[54:08.440 --> 54:13.480]  they play these games when the modern liberal progressives, they play these games when they
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.040]  can't have access to the kids and they can't pervert the kids like they want. So in Florida,
[54:18.040 --> 54:23.680]  they say, Oh, it's a don't say gay bill. It's not in the bill anywhere. It's a parental
[54:23.680 --> 54:30.040]  rights bill. So it's just a total lie so that they can awaken the leftist radical mafia.
[54:30.040 --> 54:34.800]  And then they get on and they start stewing and they start steaming and having and hawing
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.680]  and don't say gay bill. And then you have all the Democrats in Congress doing videos
[54:39.680 --> 54:47.400]  where they say, Oh, I say gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, all over a narrative that's fake.
[54:47.400 --> 54:53.520]  There is no don't say gay bill. It's the same thing in Austin and in Texas, Governor Abbott,
[54:53.520 --> 55:02.400]  Ken Paxton, if you genitally mutilate a child or you give them life altering drugs before
[55:02.400 --> 55:08.880]  the age of consent, that's child abuse. And then they say, we're going to protect trans
[55:08.880 --> 55:19.800]  children. No, you're the ones doing the harm. And now you have, I mean, what kind of a judge
[55:19.800 --> 55:26.960]  has happened now in Texas? A judge is stopping the investigation into parents that are sexually
[55:26.960 --> 55:37.880]  abusing their children. I mean, how does how is this even the real world? How insane is
[55:37.880 --> 55:45.520]  the current reality? I mean, it's like, where do you begin? Where do you end? Democrats
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.880]  getting away with murder, Democrats getting array with with rioting for an entire year.
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.600]  And then you step on the wrong piece of concrete in Washington, DC, and your entire life is
[55:55.600 --> 56:08.160]  ruined. They go out, they have events bragging about how they want to sexually mutilate children.
[56:08.160 --> 56:13.120]  I mean, it's all perverted stuff, folks. It's all pedophilia is what it is. But see, there's
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.440]  going to be a reckoning. There's going to be a reckoning. People are going to realize
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.400]  what the left has become and there's going to be a reckoning. Nobody wants to be a part
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.440]  of this pedophilia. Nobody wants to be a part of crashing the economy. Nobody wants to be
[56:27.440 --> 56:33.240]  a part of just all the devastation culturally, politically, economically that the American
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.240]  left represents. The problem is the people aren't seeing the full story. They're not
[56:37.240 --> 56:43.160]  getting the full story, but the more and more psychotic and insane and perverted and demented
[56:43.160 --> 56:48.560]  that the modern day left gets, the more people are going to sit back and say, you know what,
[56:48.560 --> 56:54.360]  this is not the Democrat Party I thought it was. This is not the liberal progressive movement
[56:54.360 --> 57:00.760]  I thought it was. I'm out. I'm not being involved in this. Come on, Harris, Joe Biden, this
[57:00.760 --> 57:06.560]  is an embarrassment. I was lied to about them. Sexually mutilating and abusing children.
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.680]  No, I'm not. I don't want to do that. No, thank you. Starting World War III with Russia,
[57:11.680 --> 57:17.800]  I'm good. I'm good. I don't think we want to be a part of that either. So there is a
[57:17.800 --> 57:23.320]  reckoning happening, folks. And even though it's a bit disturbing that they can still
[57:23.320 --> 57:31.280]  get so many people to believe their lies and propaganda, it's only a matter of time. And
[57:31.280 --> 57:37.640]  that's why you're seeing it now from liberals in the media saying, geez, Biden's a disaster.
[57:37.640 --> 57:43.000]  And all the lies the administration is trying to prop him up with, we're not buying it and
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.760]  it's not helping. And you send Kamala Harris to Europe for diplomacy. Yikes.
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.880]  How is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.640]  wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain
[58:22.640 --> 58:25.560]  reaction? What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.160]  I have a few ideas. First of all, health care is really important to a farm. A rest out,
[58:30.160 --> 58:34.200]  rest while swab. A vaccine is poison. There's kinds of things. I say, keep it short, keep
[58:34.200 --> 58:35.200]  it concise.
[58:35.200 --> 58:39.640]  Don't agree. A rest vouchy, a rest bill gates, the COVID-19 vaccine is poison. Beautiful.
[58:39.640 --> 58:43.240]  Yeah, there's ways that we can all be involved if we can all be offended. So that's what
[58:43.240 --> 58:47.280]  I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you
[58:47.280 --> 58:52.480]  calling us today. Thank you so much. UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here
[58:52.480 --> 58:57.600]  all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants
[58:57.600 --> 59:01.640]  are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening
[59:01.640 --> 59:07.560]  in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're
[59:07.560 --> 59:12.760]  planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote,
[59:12.760 --> 59:16.840]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than
[59:16.840 --> 59:17.840]  martial law.
[59:17.840 --> 59:22.080]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[59:22.080 --> 59:26.360]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[59:26.360 --> 59:32.040]  grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you

[59:51.800 --> 1:00:02.640]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:18.320]  Well, I don't mean to belabor this point, but you understand that the left is now selling
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:25.920]  children's underwear for boys to tuck. I mean, look, I feel disgusting even talking about
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:32.440]  this. A story just went on redux.com guys, and it's everywhere. Like I'm disgusting.
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:35.560]  I don't even want to talk about this stuff. I feel perverted that I even know this stuff.
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:40.760]  I want nowhere near this crap, but someone's got to report this, this deviancy that's going
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:48.840]  on. Folks, a cell underwear for trans kids, quote unquote, where they give little boys
[1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:54.800]  this underwear and then they teach them how to tuck their penis so that they can pretend
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:00.760]  they're a girl. Do you see how this is pedophilia? They literally want to reach down your kid's
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:07.440]  pants. They sell, what did they call it for little girls, the bitty packers or whatever?
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:15.000]  Remember what I'm talking about? Folks, they sell little cloth knit penises that they reach
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.320]  down into your little girl's pants and they put in their underwear so that they can pretend
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:28.480]  they have a bulge. We're talking about this is being marketed and designed for children.
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:34.920]  Bitty packer penises so that they can reach down your kid's pants, tuck underwear for little
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:45.480]  boys so they can reach down your kid's pants. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but when I was a
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:53.960]  little kid, I like to ride bikes and climb trees and fences and go find creeks and play
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:58.840]  ball games and tag and hide and seek and playgrounds and maybe go over to your friend's house,
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:07.000]  play a video game or something. Now it's all about bitty packer penises for baby girls,
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:14.280]  little boys tuck underwear. I mean, they just want to touch kids genitals, man. So I need
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:20.080]  to stop yelling. I'm losing my voice, but it's like, you understand that I shouldn't
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:27.120]  be a voice in the wilderness here. Okay. I shouldn't be a man on an island here. Millions
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:32.200]  of people should be rising up, stopping this. I mean, this is not even debatable. You want
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:36.280]  to debate about Russia, Ukraine, you want to debate about foreign policy, you want to
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:41.960]  debate about domestic issues, funding, police, all that stuff. Fine. There's room for debate
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:52.400]  there. Having perverts design and market products so that they can reach their hands down your
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:58.080]  kids pants. There should be no debate here. This should be, I mean, these people should
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:04.280]  be wiped off the map. No pun intended. Cause that's where this goes next. You need to understand
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:07.280]  where this goes next. Info wars next year's news today. Here's what I'm telling you right
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:18.960]  now. If they get away in Texas, if they get away with sexual mutilation of children and
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.080]  chopping up little boys and girls, genitals and drugging them and destroying their lives,
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:28.360]  if they get away with that folks, you know what you're going to see in two years, right?
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:33.160]  You're going to see full on pro pedophilia marches saying pedophilia should be illegal
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:39.760]  and they should be able to have sex with your kids. Two years. You got two years to stop
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:48.800]  that. So like you think it's dangerous now sending your kid to a park without supervision
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:53.360]  or you, you know, you might be afraid now letting your kid maybe ride the bike around
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:58.280]  the neighborhood. Yeah, you're probably a good neighborhood, but all it takes is one
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:03.600]  of these pedo freaks, man. They'll say, Oh, do you know about trans kids? Do you know
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.720]  about trans sexuality? Here's my trans daughter. You want to play? Have you ever had tuck underwear
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:15.640]  here? Let me show you. Have you ever had a little bitty penis packer here? Let me put
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:20.680]  one into your pants. Little girl here. Go play with my trans kid. Yeah, you'll be seeing
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:25.400]  that in parks within five years and you'll be seeing pro pedophilia marches like you
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:30.320]  saw pro trans kid marches in Austin today in two years. If we don't stop these demented
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:39.000]  freaks now and the fact that Ken Paxton is not exalted and celebrated and governor Abbott
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:43.920]  are not lifted up and supported when they say we don't want to sexually mutilate children
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:48.280]  is an embarrassment. The fact that I'm out there with maybe a small handful of counter
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:53.080]  protesters dealing with these sexual deviants is pathetic. So you know what, they're coming
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:59.960]  for your kids and they're going to be introducing pedophilian schools within five years. The
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:05.880]  globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:10.440]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out. And they're doing that not because
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:16.000]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.320]  the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:28.520]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true. The propaganda would not be
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:34.760]  necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:41.320]  and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and
[1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:45.760]  they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why
[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:49.520]  it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than ever. Because
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:53.880]  even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting and setting up is
[1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:58.080]  safe handling. And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:13.440]  they just announced live from the info wars.com studios. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:23.360]  show and now your host, Troyer. I want to thank this audience for supporting info wars because
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.720]  if it wasn't for your support, I probably wouldn't have a voice anywhere. And that's
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:31.040]  not because I yell and scream too much and sometimes lose my voice. I should probably
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:34.880]  tone it down actually because I got a big broadcast week coming up with Alex on the
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:40.600]  road and double duty coming up. But no, I probably wouldn't have a platform. I'd be
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:46.200]  banned everywhere. I wouldn't have a talk show like I have the war room wouldn't have this
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:50.720]  great crew. So I want to give a big thanks to the audience for shopping at info wars

[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:53.120]  off the map. But thanks to you. We're still here fighting for truth and freedom and to
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.400]  protect the children every day. I mean isn't it so ironic protect trans kids like that's
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:03.200]  the most hyperbolic statement you can make. We're protecting trans kids from you really
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:06.520]  I'm not the one that wants to put my hands on them. I'm not the one that wants to chop
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:12.360]  up their genitals so so who are you really protecting here. We're the ones protecting
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:21.000]  the kids from you perverts. So that's what we do ladies and gentlemen. Now I'm going
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:27.120]  to get in to the latest news out of Ukraine and with Russia. Quickly though I want to
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:34.080]  go to a couple clips. Here's Bill Maher who's classical liberal well known as a as a lefty
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:40.600]  in America. You know thought leader if you will influencer. Big show on HBO and even
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:48.280]  he knows that. Biden is an embarrassment and it's time for people to start asking questions
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:53.760]  about why Biden has been such a failure here it is in clip nine. But I'm not sure I can
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:59.560]  follow Biden's logic all the way when he dragged January 6th into this he said look how would
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:04.000]  you feel if you saw a crowd storm and break down the doors of the British parliament kill
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.840]  five cops in your hundred and forty five. You know it's so funny Biden says that what
[1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:15.160]  did the Democrats do the entire summer of 2020. Oh that's right went in front of buildings
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:20.880]  and burned them to the ground shut down cities formed whole militarized zones in in Seattle
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:26.680]  and Portland. It's like how would you like it if a bunch of violent protesters showed
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:30.040]  up and looted and burned your business. It's like oh you mean like the Democrats in 2020
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:37.080]  oh I got you. But I'm sorry guys just rewind it and play the clip again. But I'm not sure
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:43.000]  I can follow Biden's logic all the way when he dragged January 6th into this he said look
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.520]  how would you feel if you saw a crowd storm and break down the doors of the British parliament
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.240]  kill five cops in your hundred and forty five. Pause it again pause it again. Folks you know
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:11:00.600]  that there were five cops. OK one officer died two days later they lied about that and
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.920]  they said oh he got bashed in the head with a fire extinguisher he died that was a total
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.040]  lie he died from natural causes of a stroke two days later and then the other four cops
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:15.720]  committed suicide. Why did they commit suicide. What's that about. So Biden just openly lies
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.200]  and said five cops died on January 6th zero cops died on January 6th but this is just
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.040]  the left this is just the left lying the mainstream media lying. All right continue.
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:30.520]  Bundestag or the Italian parliament. I think you'd wonder OK but if Putin thought Trump
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:36.440]  was really that supportive of him why didn't he invade when Trump was in office. It's at
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:43.080]  least worth asking that question if you're not locked into one intrage and thought yet
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:49.560]  not only that Putin has invaded Ukraine twice with Biden in office. First as vice president
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:53.920]  now as president. Here's Donald Trump at his recent rally. By the way Trump still has rallies
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:57.400]  tens of thousands of people show up. Biden couldn't fill a broom closet but you know
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.720]  I'm sure Biden won legitimately. That's not a problem. Here's Trump discussing that at
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:08.320]  his latest rally. We have to continue to drain the swamp. We did a lot of it but the swamp
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:15.200]  was deep deeper than anybody believed. Despite all of Biden's weakness cowardice and incompetence
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:20.600]  there is still a path for him to end this tragedy in Ukraine without getting Americans
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:27.320]  snared in a gruesome and very bloody war bloody war. This could lead by the way this
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:32.040]  could lead to World War 3. I see what's happening because if you think Putin's going to stop
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.040]  it's going to get worse and worse. He's not going to accept it and we don't have anybody
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:41.200]  to talk to him. You had somebody to talk to him with me. Nobody was ever tougher on Russia
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:46.720]  than me. I'm the one that stopped the pipeline. I haven't stopped. I'm the one that put all
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:52.520]  the sanctions on and I'm the one that he didn't attack during our administration. Everyone's
[1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:58.080]  asking about that now. Even the radical left reporters up there. The U.S. must make clear
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:05.320]  to Putin that he has two choices to negotiate peace right now or else face blistering consequences
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:11.680]  including a push to permanently eliminate dependence on Russian energy and we're talking
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:18.760]  about forever or for a long, long time because without the money coming in from energy Russia
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:25.560]  doesn't work. But to make this threat credible the U.S. would have to immediately end Biden's
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:34.200]  ridiculous war on American energy. We were energy independent. It's very simple. We have
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:40.280]  to get our great energy workers drilling, pumping, producing, mining and refining like
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:52.000]  never before. We have to do that. Some of them are sitting right back here. That's a
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.360]  nice looking group. You know they all become famous. Here's the thing. You have a better
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:03.400]  location but they're going to become famous. You know why? They're on television. You have
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:09.040]  a better location but they're going to become famous. So imagine Trump has another 20,000
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:14.280]  plus at a rally. Millions of people tune in on television and the Internet. Biden, they
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:19.560]  have to shut down the comments and the dislike buttons on YouTube because they're all negative.
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:24.960]  Biden couldn't fill a broom closet with supporters if he had an event. It's just a total joke.
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:31.000]  Our country is being stolen right in front of us and it's the... Sorry, I'm holding
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:39.560]  my words here but it's the fudging Biden family again. These people are just crooks, man.
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:45.160]  They are stealing our country. They are stealing our future. Everything is being ripped away
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:52.520]  from us by a corrupt crime family, the Bidens and all the people that they work with. Here's
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:57.440]  some of the headlines and we're going to really get into this on the other side. Media now
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:03.360]  warning of chemical attack by Russia after biolabs exposed and that's an ongoing feed
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:08.680]  at infowars.com. So here is that. Here, try to follow me on this narrative. First, the
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:15.520]  biolabs don't exist. Then the biolabs do exist. Then they don't exist again. Then they do
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:19.840]  exist again but they're health labs but also they're worried they're going to be used by
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:26.600]  Russia for a biological weapon. Well, why would you trust the people that are lying
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:33.840]  to you about all of it? What's behind Washington's denial of biowarfare weapons program in Ukraine?
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.200]  Well, because it's the Americans' program and now they've been caught. Tensions rise
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:43.800]  between Ukraine and Israel after Zelensky reported to surrender. Now, Israel is siding
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:50.840]  with Putin too? Only the brainwashed fool liberals in America are falling for any of
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:57.840]  this fake news out of Ukraine and thinking Zelensky's a hero. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:27.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:57.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:27.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:57.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:27.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:57.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:27.840]  It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment. It's really an embarrassment.
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:55.840]  I need funds to run the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:59.840]  a match made in heaven.
[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:06.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:13.840]  Let me cover the rest of these headlines here. Revolving around Ukraine and Russia and what's
[1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:32.600]  going on. By the way, the U.S. has now just affirmed another $200 million going to Ukraine.
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:39.600]  What a joke. I mean, we are just getting ripped off left and right by this deal. So frustrating.
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:44.800]  Meanwhile, it's like all the stuff that we see coming out of Ukraine is just total lies
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:49.280]  and BS. Within 48 hours, almost everything that we see coming out of Ukraine turns out
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:56.080]  to be a lie. Here's another interesting one. New York Times denies journalists killed and
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:00.920]  Ukraine was working for the Times, was likely U.S. intel collector. Now, it's been very
[1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:06.880]  obvious from the beginning of this that there's spies everywhere feeding Biden information.
[1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:12.040]  But so is this a U.S. spy that got killed or are the New York Times denying that this
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:15.760]  journalist was working for them because they are embarrassed that they just had a journalist
[1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:20.520]  get killed in Ukraine? Either way, it's not good. Vice President Harris says U.S. backs
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:26.040]  Ukraine in defense of NATO alliance. He also claimed Ukraine was in NATO in her European
[1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:36.240]  tour. That is not the case. I mean, what an embarrassment Kamala Harris is. Good Lord.
[1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:43.000]  She's over there doing foreign diplomacy in Europe. I mean, what an embarrassment. Seriously,
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:47.120]  if you've been monitoring her speeches, her activities, folks, it's been a joke. She's
[1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:52.120]  cackling. When she's asked serious questions about war and refugees, she starts cackling
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:22:00.920]  like a demon. She's the queen of saying word garbage and nothing at all at the same time.
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:04.800]  World War III just got a lot closer. Russia announced its plan to bomb NATO convoys entering
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:10.520]  Ukraine. That was the headline from yesterday's emergency broadcast from Alex Jones. You can
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:16.040]  find it banned.video. But see, the left is afraid of what a nuclear war might do to their
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:23.880]  precious climate change BS. This is in the Atlantic. A nuclear war would kill tens of
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:32.040]  millions of people and would also prove disastrous for climate change. Oh, oh, by the way, you
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:41.680]  know, look, people are so stupid. You do realize that there have been hundreds of nuclear bomb
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:49.440]  tests in atomic bomb tests. Like you can go find a graph right now of nuclear bomb testing.
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:56.480]  And I mean, it's been going on since the 70s. Hundreds of blasts. Russia, China, US, all
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:06.520]  of it, folks. Iran even. They've been doing nuclear testing for decades. So nothing would
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:14.080]  change except they drop a bomb on people. But oh, it's climate change they're concerned
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:20.400]  about not nuclear war. Oh, the devastating effects of nuclear explosions. I got news
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:28.460]  for you. They've been going on for 50 years. The US, Russia and China have been testing
[1:23:28.460 --> 1:23:36.120]  nuclear weapons for 50 years. What has that done to climate change? Have you put that
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:44.080]  into your models? I mean, what a joke. Like these people are so stupid. And they think
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:48.920]  they want to run the show. Russia threatens attack on NATO weapons shipments to Ukraine
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:53.900]  calling them legitimate targets. And in Putin and Russians eyes, they are. I mean, NATO
[1:23:53.900 --> 1:23:58.200]  aims missiles and weapons at Russia. So I mean, okay, you're just you're just supposed
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:02.720]  to get bullied by NATO that shouldn't even exist anymore. NATO should be shut down.
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:07.520]  NATO should have been shut down a decade ago. Look at how worthless NATO is. If you had
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:12.560]  any doubt about how worthless NATO was, just look at the past three weeks and you'll figure
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:18.600]  it out. Moscow rejects Washington Chemicals weapons claim. Well, yeah, Washington has
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:22.320]  lied about the whole thing. First, it didn't exist. Then it did exist. Then it didn't exist
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:27.080]  again. Then it did exist. But it was health labs, quote unquote, health labs. But somehow
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:30.400]  was going to be used for biological weapon by Russia. It's all BS. Russia is shutting
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:36.240]  down the West's biological weapons factories they had on Russia's doorstep. Lindsey Graham
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:42.040]  still wants everyone to die in a war. The best chance in 20 years to take this guy out.
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:45.880]  Lindsey Graham again calls for assassination of Putin and crushing the Russian economy.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.520]  So okay, so you're Russia, you're Vladimir Putin. You've got Western leaders that murdered
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:56.440]  Gaddafi saying, let's kill Putin. Let's start war with Russia and you're just supposed
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:00.360]  to sit there and take it. I mean, seriously, like even if you think Russia is the bad guy,
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:03.440]  and all this, what is Russia supposed to do with all these people calling for Putin to
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:10.120]  be assassinated and Russia to be crushed? Screw you, Lindsey Graham. You are a sick freak.
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:15.680]  You are you Lindsey Graham never seen a war. He didn't want someone else to die in a black
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:23.200]  male twink sitting in Congress on top of us perched up there.
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:27.640]  World Empire representative Madison Cawthorne blasts incredibly evil Ukrainian government
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:32.920]  during campaign stop. Lindsey Graham condemns him immediately. Good for Madison Cawthorne.
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.880]  Madison Cawthorne, good for you. Keep doing you, bud. You keep telling the world what
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:46.120]  you think. Don't be bullied around by the sycophant war hawk black male politicians like
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:50.840]  Lindsey Graham. And whether you're right or wrong about Ukraine, the fact that you're
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:55.040]  not buying into the mainstream message and you're not a puppet of the mainstream news
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:26:00.400]  is enough enough enough for me to support you. So good for you, Madison Cawthorne. You
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:07.880]  are getting better and better as the days go by. And I'm glad to see it. Trump blasts
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.280]  Biden and war hawks. This could lead to World War three. But remember, they said, Oh, Trump
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:16.240]  will get us into war. Trump will isolate us. No, folks, people ignore Biden's phone calls.
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:21.080]  He's that much of an embarrassment. Multiple Iranian produced ballistic missiles smashed
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:27.120]  into army base in Iraq. Oh, that's good. So now Iran is getting more hawkish and bombing
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:34.160]  its neighboring countries with Biden in office. Iran's Revolutionary Guard takes credit for
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:39.600]  the rocket attack on US base in Erbil, Iraq, 10 days after Iran asked Biden to remove them
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:46.440]  from the terror list. And they did. Remember that? Biden removed all these Iranian backed
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:52.160]  terror groups from the terror watch list. And within a week, they started bombing people
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:27:01.760]  and murdering people. Who could have seen that coming? Oh, but see you, the American
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:07.520]  people are the bad guys. DHS releases new rules on extremism will target anyone who
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:11.960]  questions 2020 election or challenges COVID narrative. You're not allowed to think anymore.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.480]  The Democrat overlords are here. The woke liberal mafia has taken over your country
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:27.160]  and they're allowed to loot and burn and steal and murder and they get away with all of it.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:33.320]  All of it. And they're just now openly saying, All right, any opposition to the Democrat
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:38.080]  party, we're just going to lock up and kill. That's called authoritarianism. That's called
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:43.160]  fascism. That's called cold blooded murderers. That's called evil. That's what the Biden
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:48.880]  administration is doing. Joe Biden says he will welcome Ukrainian refugees with open
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:53.080]  arms. Oh, good. Good because we don't have enough illegal immigrants pouring into this
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:28:00.000]  country. Do we? And we're going to spend another $200 million to protect Ukraine's border,
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:06.400]  but we don't get our own border. That's nice, isn't it? Real cute, real cute. And what is
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:09.880]  happening at the border? Oh, how about all the deadly fentanyl that's being shipped in?
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:14.200]  Do we do we care about fentanyl? Now the leading cause of death in middle aged men, half a
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:23.120]  dozen Florida partiers, OD on fentanyl, first responders giving mouth to mouth also OD.
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:30.200]  So there's it seems to be cocaine is the number one thing getting laced with this deadly fentanyl.
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:36.280]  And it's probably all Chinese made. And the cartels are probably lacing cocaine with deadly
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:42.720]  fentanyl. And it's killing middle aged American men more than anything else. And it's all
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:47.520]  coming across the southern border. And the Biden administration is openly facilitating
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:53.480]  it. I mean, how much blood is on the Biden administration hands? They are soaked in it,
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:29:02.840]  sopping it in it. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:09.800]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss. Everybody else has.
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:19.120]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:26.920]  and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:33.400]  public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:38.800]  tranty. And I know we're being fed into this globalist meagre under and it's so incredibly
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:46.240]  sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then
[1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:51.240]  degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalist
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:56.320]  are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually
[1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:57.920]  end the species as we know it.
[1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:03.560]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first
[1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:08.960]  of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:15.640]  free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:22.440]  the government. 231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious

[1:30:57.240 --> 1:31:04.120]  It has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth. Then the next
[1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:11.200]  big casualty isn't even the people that die. No, that invariably follows. But first there
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:18.960]  is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship. And now
[1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:26.120]  across the world, the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:34.400]  amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested,
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:39.440]  you can be imprisoned. And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have

[1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:18.880]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. You
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:28.000]  want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:31.880]  We've got a guest in the studio who would like to stop tyranny as well. It's the unicorn
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:38.840]  lawyer, Sarah Stogner. And she is running for Texas Railroad Commissioner right now.
[1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:44.720]  She's in the process of a runoff right now. So another election before the main election.
[1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:51.800]  And you can find her website, sarah4rrc.com, Twitter at sarah4rrc. That's the number four.
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.400]  And then on TikTok, the unicorn lawyer. So you've been a practicing lawyer for some
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:01.360]  time. Now you want to get involved in Texas politics. Why are you running for the Railroad
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.600]  Commissioner position? Yes, I mean, I don't really want to be involved in Texas politics.
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:11.120]  But when no one else steps up to the plate that's competent and is willing to do the
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.960]  job, you do what you got to do. What are your big issues and why Railroad
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:19.360]  Commissioner? Yeah, so my big issues obviously are making
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:23.280]  sure that the economy is strong and that we don't compromise our natural resources in
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:27.760]  the process. So I moved out onto a cattle ranch in West Texas last summer. I'd been
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:32.880]  there about a week and an old well that Chevron had plugged, came unplugged. And I thought,
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  oh great, a big super major oil and gas operator is going to come in and do the right thing.
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:41.200]  And instead the state of Texas lawyered up against the landowner. So if you're a criminal
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.360]  in the state of Texas, or you're a landowner complaining about oil and gas, you get lawyered
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:51.520]  up against. I have one issue that because I know that
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:55.880]  the oil prices, obviously gas prices are affecting everybody. That gets everybody all the sudden
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:59.800]  thinking about oil and production and everything. And so it really, it really hits home right
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.600]  now. And they're blaming Putin. But really, this problem started as soon as Biden got
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:10.880]  into office, specifically here in Texas. What happened in Texas specifically when
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:14.600]  Biden got into office and they paused all these drilling permits, paused all these
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:19.920]  new pipeline projects? I mean, Texas was pumping out oil more than ever under Trump, was it
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:22.040]  not? Yeah, they were. And I mean, look, if you
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:27.280]  look back at what was happening with the economy pre COVID, and we had really ramped up production,
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:32.320]  right? I can't remember exactly how many million barrels we were at in early 2020. But we had
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:37.160]  ramped up production and we oil was inexpensive at the time, right? We were at like 35.
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:41.320]  I'm now paying today. I filled up my tank today. It's now double. It is now double to
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.960]  fill up my tank than what it was two years ago.
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.680]  And so as soon as Biden comes in and he says, okay, I'm going to shut down Keystone, no new
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:53.360]  drilling. And, you know, people don't understand that operators plan their capital expenditures
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:58.160]  and their development years in advance, especially with especially in that industry with such
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.000]  big numbers, right? So you've got, right? It doesn't you don't just, okay, you get a
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.440]  permit and then you go drill a well the next day. I mean, you've got to plan your development.
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:10.280]  You got to make sure that the infrastructure is there, your pipelines, because you go and
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:12.960]  you drill a well, what are you going to do with the oil and the gas if you don't have
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  to take away. So and then now we've got extreme pricing on commodities for steel, it's cement
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:24.160]  and the labor once the labor is gone, could everything gets more expensive, right? Exactly.
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:29.000]  Now here's one thing that does confuse me because it's almost as if because the Biden
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.840]  administration keeps saying, we're going to do everything to lower gas prices, everything
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:35.920]  within our power, everything they keep saying it, everything we're going to try to lower
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:41.960]  gas prices with, but yet we're not tapping into our own the gas that we could be drilling
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.920]  and pumping out now. It's almost as if someone else owns our gas. It's almost as if somebody
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:51.520]  is telling Biden, that's my gas, not yours. You're not drilling it. It sounds like a conspiratorial
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:55.040]  thing, but the proof is in the pudding. Do you think there's something going on? Like
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:36:59.040]  does somebody else have rights to our oil? Can we not get access to it? Well, I mean,
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:03.560]  the Chinese are buying Texas left and right. So you think there might be a little foreign
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:07.840]  meddling? I mean, it's a question. Yeah, exactly. It's like they keep saying they want to do
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:13.000]  everything to lower gas prices, but yet they do nothing to lower gas prices. Look, I don't
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:16.920]  know that you can do anything in the moment to lower gas prices other than maybe, you
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:21.680]  know, put a hold on taxing or things like that. What I'm saying is it takes at least
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.600]  12 to 18 months for an operator to ramp up their schedule. They've got to go get the
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:29.760]  drilling rigs. They've got to go get the crews. They've got to go find the casing, right?
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:34.560]  Like this isn't, oh, you call up the store and go and pick up 10,000 feet of pipe. It
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:39.480]  just doesn't work that way. And then how frustrating is it? Because there was so much planning
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:44.800]  done when Trump was president and then Biden gets in and slashes all of it. Now the gas
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.960]  companies are the people that might be drilling for new oil. They don't even want to think
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:51.480]  about a new project because they just got screwed so badly on their last deal. Right.
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:54.760]  And everyone's making this big deal about, right, these 9,000 permits that have been
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:00.920]  unused. We typically have several thousand permits at any time that aren't currently
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.760]  being drilled. And again, some of those are not economical to drill. Some of those, they're
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.440]  planned to drill and it's going to take a long time. Some of those, they don't have
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:14.720]  the pipeline capacity, right? So again, it is all these little things that add up. But
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:20.360]  at the end of the day, if you've got a federal government that is so anti-oil and they have
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:25.800]  been, Wall Street won't give you money, right? Like the ESG movement, we've had all of these
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:30.900]  attacks and they're overly subsidizing the wind and the solar. And there's no such thing
[1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:33.800]  as green energy. We just have to look at the cost of benefits.
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.400]  Well, that's another one of the big lives from the Biden administration. He bragged.
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:41.960]  I mean, one of his campaign things was we're going to end fossil fuels. We're going to
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:45.960]  end oil. I mean, that was a quote. We're going to end oil. Well, now he comes in and they're
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:49.560]  claiming they're pumping out more oil than ever before. So they're a liar on either one
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:54.240]  of the issues. Quite frankly, I view them a liar on all of them, but it's like they campaigned
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.840]  his anti oil. This should be expected. We should expect gas prices to go up. They bragged
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:01.880]  about it. Now it's happening and they're saying, Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We're not anti oil.
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:04.920]  That never happened. Yeah, it's delusional.
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:09.760]  There is your website. Sarah Stogner, Republican candidate, Texas Railroad Commissioner. She
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:13.800]  is in a runoff right now. When is that election, by the way?
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:17.360]  Yeah. So the runoff is May 24th. May 24th. All right. So you got a little more time
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:24.160]  to campaign. Could Texas support the entire U.S. if we were pumping out oil?
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:31.960]  Yeah. I mean, I think we certainly could short term. I mean, we've got, you know, 250 billion
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:39.280]  barrel, I think, over than that equivalent. And we get better and better at the technology.
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.480]  If we're being intellectually honest, where the kind of the struggle would be is in the
[1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:47.600]  water because when you produce oil and gas, it comes with it, comes water. And so if you're
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:52.320]  pumping out 20 million barrels a day of oil, you're probably going to have at least 40
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:55.920]  to 60 to 80 million barrels per day of water. And it has to go somewhere.
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:59.760]  Interesting. I was not aware of that. What is that process? It just, it just all comes
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:03.880]  up the gas, the water, everything? Yeah. So when you drill a new well and you bring
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:08.600]  it online for every oil, you know, every barrel of oil that you produce, you usually produce
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.920]  one to 10 barrels of water and it's produced water. So it's salty. It has, you know, kind
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:14.640]  of nasty stuff in it. Needs refined.
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:19.600]  But you put it back down into the ground usually. And now this is the reason we're having earthquakes
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.280]  in Texas is because we're not from the fracking. People misunderstand. It's not that the fracking
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:29.320]  causes the earthquakes. It's that you're pumping 15 to 20 million barrels right now per day
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:34.200]  back into a different formation and it gets caught in faults and it just doesn't have
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:38.920]  anywhere to go. And so we're going to have to figure it out and start recycling more.
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:45.760]  How, I mean, I look at our oil reserves getting tapped into as a completely unnecessary thing.
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.000]  We spend a lot of time in Houston. I mean, Houston alone, I feel like they've been handicapped
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.920]  as far as oil production is concerned. Yep. Well, and part of the problem is, is we're
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:41:00.760]  not permitting any new refineries, right? So the refineries are made to refine a certain
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:06.200]  type of crude and it doesn't, we can't refine the sweet crude that we produce. So we'd have
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:09.320]  to build new refineries if we were going to refine our own crude that we're producing
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:13.560]  here in Texas. And how much, I mean, how much of involvement would you have with that as
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:17.080]  the railroad commissioner? Is that a big role that you would play?
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:20.600]  So the railroad commission, not really. So the railroad commissioner, they are, there's
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:24.400]  three of them, and they're in charge of all oil and gas exploration and production. So
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:28.240]  the drilling of the wells, the intrastate pipelines, and then the surface mining for
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:33.040]  things like coal, lignite, uranium. As far as the refineries, if you're going to have
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.640]  to go and permit like a new facility or do major changes, then you have to go through
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.720]  the federal permitting process with EPA and all that.
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:44.440]  But there is an important role for the railroad commissioner in this whole process. You want
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:48.120]  someone pro-oil in there. Oh, and yeah, you need somebody with common sense. Absolutely.
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:52.560]  Got you. Well, that's few and far between it seems like with our politicians these days.
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:58.000]  I mean, why would the Biden administration tap into our strategic oil reserves? Almost
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.360]  half of them now depleted. We're about to go to war. Boy, that doesn't seem like a
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:06.600]  smart idea when we could just be pumping out new oil. I mean, common sense would say either
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:12.120]  this person is a complete idiot or they're consciously trying to hurt the country. Yeah,
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:16.360]  I mean, look, I don't think it's not as simple as telling operators you guys can turn on
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:20.880]  the tap, right? It's not like these wells are ramped down and we can just turn a valve
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:25.360]  and turn them on. We've got to drill new wells. And I mean, when I think if you look at the
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:30.840]  numbers of drilling rigs in 2017, 2018, we were like at 800 rigs and now we're at about
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:37.440]  300. And so it takes time to get those rigs back up and moving and the crews and all that.
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.760]  I mean, even if everyone were to say go, it would be at least three or four months because
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.560]  we just don't have the skilled labor and the resources right now with steel and all the
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:52.440]  other commodities that are necessary to complete a well. Well, I have a feeling the Biden administration
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:57.480]  won't be doing it within three months or 10 months or 100 months or ever.
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:04.000]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock then FullWarStore.com and they will
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.720]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:12.200]  at full price. But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:18.560]  Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are. And I believe you
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:23.760]  will then get hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew are. So again, both
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:29.720]  these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun. They are 50% off for a limited
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:35.080]  time because they're going to sell out at this price. I would estimate in less than
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:39.600]  a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.760]  bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:48.280]  K for your muses as well. They're amazing. And they're at FullWarStore.com. And the
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:54.080]  reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run the operation. You need
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:57.080]  to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:04.400]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:08.760]  Good. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:13.760]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.760]  and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:19.760]  All right. Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.040]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:27.520]  out for the phone of the product. The X3 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.320]  on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the ample work.
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:34.160]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the air. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:36.600]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:42.120]  Honored talk to you. Awesome. So, firstly, I wanted to do was to say I love the products,
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:48.240]  alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.760]  So, just number one for a few years. Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:53.760]  Absolutely.
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:45:03.240]  You and Run Contact Tracers aren't coming. They're here, all over the world, from Australia
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:07.400]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:11.880]  do everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:17.120]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:22.000]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.880]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:30.760]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.600]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government

[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:06.400]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:20.080]  Final segment of this live Alex Jones show on this Sunday. Sarah Stogner is my guest.
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:23.200]  She's running for Railroad Commissioner and just talking to her in the break learned some
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:27.160]  other interesting things. I was talking to her about her race. They say, hey, let's talk
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.320]  about election integrity. Just, hey, speaking of that, there was a dead guy. You were running
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.480]  against a dead guy. Sadly, died right before the election, but 200,000 people voted for
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:42.160]  a guy that's not even with us anymore. Talk about election integrity and why that's such
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.680]  an important issue for you. Yeah, I mean, look, if we don't have election integrity,
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:52.080]  we don't have a republic and the democratic process is broken. So we've got to figure
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:59.040]  out a way without, you know, biometrically invading on privacy to have, you know, making
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.760]  sure that one person, one vote, and that's it. It shouldn't be so hard. I'm a firm believer
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:08.880]  in paper ballots. One person, one ballot, one piece of paper. And if you wanted to do
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:13.560]  the high tech stuff, I think that there should be some sort of, I don't know how it would
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:19.000]  work out, but it's like, okay, when you put your ballot in there, there's some sort of
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:23.680]  an interaction right then and there that you see that your vote counted where you wanted
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.720]  it to count. Like you put the thing in, it slides, and then that tally goes up so that
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:31.800]  you know your vote counted where it was supposed to. Because I mean, you go on this digital
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.120]  machine, it prints out the thing, you shove it into another machine, you have no idea
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:38.320]  where that information goes. Right. You have no confirmation number. You're not allowed
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:42.920]  to take a picture. So it's really sad. What are your big things though? Real quick, be
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:45.800]  the camp, have a campaign speech. I know you're campaigning crazy right now. You're
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.840]  probably sick of it. But just why should people vote? You're going to have my vote
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:53.280]  coming up. Convince me though. Convince me why I should vote for Sarah Stogner. Okay.
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:56.400]  How about why you shouldn't vote for Wayne and then I'll do me. You shouldn't vote for
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:02.520]  Wayne because he's a career long politician who takes bribes and has no oil and gas experience.
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:07.320]  He is a Grammy nominated gospel singer though. So he's got that going for him. So if I need
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:10.880]  a gospel singer, Wayne's the guy, but if I need a railroad commissioner, you're the one.
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:14.400]  Right. If you need somebody that actually understands the operational realities of exploring for
[1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:18.560]  and producing hydrocarbons, it's me. I'm an oil and gas lawyer. I'm supervisor, well
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:23.880]  control certified. I am actively in the field. I understand what's happening down hole and
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:30.320]  I understand the operational realities of what it takes to produce oil. I mean, is there
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:34.640]  anything like can Texas just give the Biden administration the middle finger and just
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:39.840]  say screw you. We're drilling baby. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, the federal government
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:45.720]  has no jurisdiction over anything other than the federal lands. So we could in Texas essentially
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:49.880]  just be leading our own charge right now. Yeah. And Texas, for example, there's about
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:56.640]  13 million acres of Texas land that you as a citizen of the state of Texas own a part
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:02.040]  of, right? We've got all those lands and most of that has oil and gas on it and most of
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:06.400]  it is leased. But I think the latest numbers I heard is about 25% unleashed. So go talk
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:11.480]  to George P. Bush about that. He was the former land commissioner, right? But he's had to
[1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:16.280]  sacrifice that position to try to get Paxton out. Right. But the land commissioner oversees
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:20.360]  all of those public lands. But he can't be the land commissioner again, right? He sacrificed
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:26.040]  his position to run for attorney general, right? Yeah, he's right. Oh, thank God. We
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:30.880]  need to protect Ken Paxton at all costs. I mean, that guy is a hero right now to me
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:35.880]  shows a lot of teeth, doesn't bite all the time. But when he bites, it's good. And he
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:40.360]  needs to be protected at all costs. We don't need another Bush running Texas. You know,
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:45.120]  another issue, and this is kind of maybe not even an issue that might affect you. But you
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.800]  were talking about it seems like a no brainer legalizing marijuana, legalizing cannabis.
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:55.520]  This is something Texas should do quickly. There is so much profit sitting there, taxable
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:00.080]  profit. And I mean, look, I don't like government taxes. I don't like government, you know, involved
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.600]  in anything. I don't want to pay taxes. But it's like, look at how much money Colorado
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:07.440]  has made off marijuana. Look at how much money Washington has made off marijuana. It's already
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:11.400]  decriminalized most places. It's going to be legal, probably every state. I mean, Texas
[1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:14.560]  should probably get ahead of this, I would think soon, but you were talking about how
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:18.200]  there's people that are trying to block it like Big Pharma. Yeah, I mean, like Big Pharma
[1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:23.360]  wants it to be rescheduled, not descheduled, because they want it to be only through, right,
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:27.760]  the pharmaceutical program. And then you've got big alcohol and big tobacco that one,
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:34.240]  a part of it. So we as a state should really be proactive, I believe, in legalizing cannabis
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:38.240]  and letting our ag people do what they do best.
[1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:42.180]  Does Texas have the potential? I mean, it has the potential, but does it have the potential
[1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:46.640]  in the leadership to start taking some of these steps to not just make Texas even better
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:51.160]  than it is, but for Texas to lead the charge again, hey, we're going to pump oil, we're
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:55.080]  going to get your gas prices down. Hey, we're going to legalize marijuana and cannabis.
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:59.040]  We're going to have that revenue stream coming into our state. We're going to have these
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:02.880]  farmers coming in farming. It's going to add revenue, add jobs. I mean, this is something
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:07.880]  that it's like, obviously not overnight, but you can start making these moves. And within
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:12.840]  months or years, you'll start seeing the windfall. Yeah, absolutely. There it is. That's what
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:18.360]  Texas is going to look like in six months. It's going to be just marijuana everywhere.
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:21.800]  It's already everywhere. I go downtown Austin, you can just smell it in the air. It's south
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:27.720]  by Southwest right now too. So you get a couple of different stenches actually now. You get
[1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:34.160]  the drug stench and then you get the liberal stench, the California stench. It's just unbelievable.
[1:52:34.160 --> 1:52:39.960]  So what do you think moving forward? Can Texas leadership with Sarah Stogner and Ken Paxton
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:44.160]  and Abbott, I mean, can we start to really, because Florida's kind of led the way, I think,
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:48.480]  post COVID, Florida's kind of what conservatives look at as kind of the new leader of the right
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:53.040]  side of America as far as the state is concerned. Do you think Texas can take that role back?
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:57.280]  Yeah, but to be honest, I don't think our current leadership can do it. Like that's the
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:03.840]  problem. Like they're too entrenched into what in my opinion has doesn't reflect a modern
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:09.000]  day GOP. And we need more people our age stepping up and running and being like, okay, guys,
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:14.680]  let's actually go back to being fiscally conservative. Let's actually go back to respecting landowners
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:19.760]  and property rights and like the fundamentals of what it means to be a conservative.
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:23.840]  And you know what? It's not about being a greedy capitalist pig, but it's like, hey,
[1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:27.760]  let's be greedy capitalist pigs. Let's do it. Let's let the Texas economy boom. Let's
[1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:32.080]  pump the oil. Let's have all the jobs come here. And it's like the same thing. You see
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:36.280]  all the people in New York moving down to Florida. We all know why you see all the people moving
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:40.400]  from California to Texas. We know why we should be owning it. We should be owning it and we
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:43.120]  should be making it even more of a cause to move here.
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:47.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we are adding a thousand new people a day and you're talking
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:52.240]  about issues, right? Our grid and the freezing and all this. We've got to fix those issues
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.920]  and how do you fix those? Well, you get intellectually honest and you say, okay, the definition of
[1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:00.960]  insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. We can't continue
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:05.720]  to do what we've been doing, which is just sitting and kind of letting a few big major
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:11.880]  corporations have their way. And the political guys saying, okay, and not taking hard stances
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:16.800]  and standing up. I mean, crony capitalism is the absolute worst thing that we can have.
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:21.000]  And so we need real capitalism. Yeah, we need actual free market capitalism. And by the
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.960]  way, speaking of the power outages, I mean, I'd like your take on this too. I'm sure you'll
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:28.840]  have something to do with this when you're the railroad commissioner. But it was the
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:32.960]  Texas energy sector that got capped. They said you can only produce this much energy
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:37.760]  using coal or gas. So that made us rely on on other states. And so we got hit with the
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:41.360]  ice storm. We had to shut our energy out. That was a synthetic blackout. That wasn't
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:46.280]  something that happened because of the weather. Right. We had a little bit right. What I think
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:51.520]  fundamentally part of the problem was is that we did not have ahead of time, a designation
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:57.320]  of what was critical. And so our leaders failed to say, okay, if you are a natural gas power
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:00.840]  plant, yes, obviously you're critical. But to get the natural gas to the power plant,
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:03.500]  you have to make sure that your wells are online. You have to make sure that your salt
[1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:07.120]  water disposal wells can take care of the water that we were talked about. You have to make
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  sure that your pipelines don't freeze. And so Wayne, the guy I'm running against, right,
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:17.600]  blamed it all on alternatives. And they did play a small part. But a lot of the reason
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:22.200]  was because we didn't have the foresight ahead of time to designate critical infrastructure.
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:27.560]  And look, there are times when, right, you're going to have these really extreme events.
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:31.680]  And there's no way it's not feasible to go and do what North Dakota does. We just don't
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:36.240]  have North Dakota weather that often, right. And no, but nobody wants to talk about, okay,
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:39.680]  if there's another really bad freeze, we need to make sure all of our industrial facilities
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.280]  stay open. And then maybe we make sure that one or two schools in town has some cots and
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:48.200]  is warm. And if people lose power, then they need to go there. I mean, that's an uncomfortable
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:52.320]  truth. But that's the kind of leadership. It's like, guys, we have to get our priorities
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:54.680]  straight. We need to make sure that no one dies. How do we do that? We make sure that
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:58.360]  they have a warm place to go. And we do the best that we can for everything else. But
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  growing 1000 people a day, we can't keep up. And you know, the funny thing is to I guess
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:07.160]  it's not so funny. Yeah, that was a big freeze for Texas. I don't know where you're from.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.280]  I'm originally from Missouri. That's like a typical winter day. And it's like everything
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:16.000]  shuts down in Texas on a typical winter day. Something was definitely up with that. There
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.480]  was a lot of blame being passed around. But it sounds like there's some common sense stuff
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:24.800]  that can be done for sure. Yes. Again, it's not rocket science. It's not rocket science.
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:28.720]  Sarah Stogner, lawyer, she's got experience in the oil field, whether her experience makes
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:33.000]  you right for railroad commissioner here. Oh, I've got an undergrad degree in economics.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.560]  So I understand economics. And then I've got my law degree. And I've been an oil and gas
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.600]  lawyer for 14 years. I mean, I, I negotiate contracts. I litigate risk issues. So when
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:48.560]  a well blows out, I see the insurance companies to get them paid. I understand how all the
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:52.640]  contracting works. I understand how the regulations work. I would actually get in there. We've
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:56.240]  got the rules on the books. It's not like we need to go and redo our rules. We just need
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:02.440]  to apply them fairly and evenly as they're written. So it's between a person who's no
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:07.400]  longer with us, may he rest in peace, a gospel singer, and you, the experienced lawyer in
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:13.160]  the oil field. Right. So I made it past the original primary. I came in second. So it's
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:16.880]  me and Wayne. So there's the runoff in May. All right, Sarah Stogner. Thank you so much
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:20.280]  for joining us. Where can people follow your campaign? Follow what you're doing. Yeah.
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:27.120]  So my website is Sarah, the number four RRC.com. And like you said earlier on my Twitter, I'm,
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:29.560]  I'm all over. I'm pretty easy to get in touch with.
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:34.400]  Let's get good leaders in Texas that want to see this state as an example for red states.
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:37.920]  And let's start pumping oil. Let's get gas prices here, not as bad as they are on the
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:41.440]  coast, but they're getting bad here, folks. Sarah, thank you. That does it for the Alex
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:48.480]  Jones show. Harrison Smith coming up with Sunday Night Live. Don't go anywhere.
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:54.840]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March, 2022. And in the month of February,
[1:57:54.840 --> 1:58:00.760]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3. That has all
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:07.640]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:13.160]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:18.720]  the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output. So we
[1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:23.080]  had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going to come
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:28.040]  in for a long time. So I took it back to full process. I was just thinking, you know what,
[1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:32.760]  we need to funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is a great product everybody needs. So
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:37.360]  to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself
[1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:42.960]  and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:46.760]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:54.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
