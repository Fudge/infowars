[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:24.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.600 --> 00:34.000]  Ahmad Khan Rahami's father, back in 2014, more than two years ago, told the police and
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.040]  the FBI that his son was a terrorist who was traveling to the Middle East to learn how
[00:39.040 --> 00:43.080]  to attack the West.
[00:43.080 --> 00:47.560]  So as usual, it is a false flag.
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.800]  And by false flag, it doesn't mean that radical Islam or Orthodox Islam or Wahhabist Islam
[00:52.800 --> 00:58.760]  isn't on the march and isn't one of the greatest threats to civilization and culture.
[00:58.760 --> 01:00.480]  That's absolutely true.
[01:00.480 --> 01:04.840]  But our government and Western governments have opened up the doors to bring these people
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.360]  in and to protect them and then to cover up the fact that it's terrorism.
[01:09.360 --> 01:16.680]  And they call it a war on narratives when in reality, the White House and the PR people
[01:16.680 --> 01:24.640]  are at war with reality and the truth, that's what they call it, is a war on a narrative.
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.240]  So they spin it around like changing the name of Al Qaeda when it came out that our government
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.360]  was funding it and supporting it all over the Middle East and Africa and in Syria and
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.360]  in Egypt.
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.440]  When that all came out, they go, OK, our troops are upset, they know what's going on, let's
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.440]  change the name, Congress is investigating, let's change the name to ISIS, which is the
[01:43.440 --> 01:52.840]  Islamic State that is part of Iraq and Syria, a new home base they've carved out for Al
[01:52.840 --> 01:59.560]  Qaeda, which is just another name, which means the base, again, it's all a big joke.
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.680]  It's Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia and their last name started in the early 80s is called
[02:04.680 --> 02:07.960]  Al Qaeda, which means the base or the homeland.
[02:07.960 --> 02:17.000]  And now their new name is IS, Islamic State, even clear, Al Qaeda, the base, IS, the Islamic
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.080]  State, the base, same black flag, same funding, same people.
[02:25.080 --> 02:32.760]  In fact, I wouldn't use the parable or the analogy or the comparison of my dad is a Jones
[02:32.760 --> 02:41.440]  and then I'm his son, we're closely related because ISIS is not the son of Al Qaeda.
[02:41.440 --> 02:47.520]  ISIS and Al Qaeda are the sons of the House of Saudi and the Wahhabist.
[02:47.520 --> 02:48.520]  They are brothers.
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.920]  Now, that's the best breakdown that you're going to get, period, because I've studied
[02:53.920 --> 02:56.240]  it in depth.
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.800]  That's why Donald Trump was meeting last night with the Egyptian president, one of the most
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.040]  populous Middle Eastern countries in the world, one of the most populous nations, period,
[03:06.040 --> 03:08.920]  in that whole region.
[03:08.920 --> 03:16.440]  And they've been an ally of the West and been what I'd call good Muslims, prosperity, basic
[03:16.440 --> 03:20.480]  freedom, compared to the other areas in the region, letting Christians and others live
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.080]  in peace, letting tourists come, not letting the radical Muslims kill everybody.
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.560]  Obama overthrows all that, CNN says it's wonderful five years ago.
[03:29.560 --> 03:36.880]  After all that, the Arab Spring turning Wahhabist Sunnis loose, the Muslim Brotherhood, IS,
[03:36.880 --> 03:43.720]  the base, setting up their bases, setting up their states, setting up their Wahhabist Islamic
[03:43.720 --> 03:44.720]  republics.
[03:44.720 --> 03:47.280]  That's what they're doing.
[03:47.280 --> 03:51.360]  They play games with the public who's ignorant.
[03:51.360 --> 03:54.640]  And the media criticizes him for meeting with them and saying, we're going to be allies
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.400]  with Egypt again and we're going to help fight radical Islam with you.
[03:58.400 --> 04:05.000]  Meanwhile, when we come back, the mother of insanity, and Hillary actually agreed with
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  her.
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.200]  Bloomberg reporter asked Hillary, like desperately, is it the Russians?
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.200]  Are they bombing?
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.200]  Because we know that Islamic state and radical Muslims don't exist.
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.360]  I mean, we know there's nothing radical about Islam.
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.080]  It's the religion of peace.
[04:23.080 --> 04:26.560]  She actually says this basically.
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.960]  So it's got to be the Russians bombing because Muslims never did that.
[04:30.960 --> 04:31.960]  No.
[04:31.960 --> 04:37.280]  And then Hillary goes, oh, yes, oh, yeah.
[04:37.280 --> 04:38.280]  It's like an aid screel.
[04:38.280 --> 04:40.080]  It's Carl the cut skit or something.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.080]  It's so over the top.
[04:41.080 --> 04:43.760]  They're like, oh, she's, oh, yeah.
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.560]  Donald Trump's the one promoting this radical group, ISIS, that has nothing to do with
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.560]  Islam.
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.320]  And yeah, the Russians like him.
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.000]  So she pretty much agrees with the biggest conspiracy theory made up.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.400]  Moon has made a cheese crap.
[04:58.400 --> 05:04.440]  I ever heard info wars is proud to announce the official info wars live app available

[05:40.760 --> 05:45.040]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment

[06:02.440 --> 06:03.800]  It took you over a year to do it.
[06:03.800 --> 06:08.520]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[06:08.520 --> 06:10.080]  scares me the most.
[06:10.080 --> 06:14.840]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:14.840 --> 06:20.520]  my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's
[06:20.520 --> 06:23.880]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[06:23.880 --> 06:28.960]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[06:28.960 --> 06:30.240]  going on everywhere.
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.240]  These are all parasites.
[06:31.240 --> 06:33.960]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[06:33.960 --> 06:35.200]  You have the neem in there.
[06:35.200 --> 06:38.280]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[06:38.280 --> 06:41.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:41.680 --> 06:44.760]  Alright well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[06:44.760 --> 06:45.760]  It just came back in yesterday.

[08:26.040 --> 08:27.040]  Thank you for joining us.
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.760]  It is September 20th, 2016 on this Tuesday edition.
[08:30.760 --> 08:33.960]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.200]  Roger Stone is joining us coming up in the last 30 minutes of the third hour with a lot
[08:38.200 --> 08:40.200]  of big breaking news.
[08:40.200 --> 08:47.440]  I will also tell you that we are working on a surprise.
[08:47.440 --> 08:56.840]  I guess you can call it a September surprise for Hillary and the globalist in George Soros
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.160]  that we should be breaking Thursday or Friday.
[09:00.160 --> 09:01.160]  That is big.
[09:01.160 --> 09:09.400]  I was going to leave it at that and the story will go out one way or the other no matter
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.200]  what happens in info wars, but believe me, these are the type of stories that are extremely
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.680]  dangerous so we need your prayers and your support.
[09:19.680 --> 09:24.840]  We have the reported bomber in New York.
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.760]  We have his father coming out and this is the New York Times saying that he told the
[09:29.760 --> 09:40.520]  police in 2014 his son was a terrorist official say.
[09:40.520 --> 09:49.560]  So that's Ahmed Khan Rahami's father went to the police, went to the FBI in 2014 when
[09:49.560 --> 09:53.640]  he knew that his son was traveling overseas to Pakistan and other areas.
[09:53.640 --> 10:00.120]  The classic story of going and being radicalized to become a asymmetrical warfighter known
[10:00.120 --> 10:03.080]  in the West as a terrorist.
[10:03.080 --> 10:09.240]  Now I raise that point because we witnessed Hillary on Sunday the day after we saw a bomb
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.400]  go off in New Jersey and a bomb go off in New York entering 29 and nine people being
[10:14.400 --> 10:21.080]  stabbed, three of them critically in a small town mall in Minnesota, we witnessed the controlled
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.440]  corporate press further discredit themselves and Hillary come out and further discredit
[10:26.440 --> 10:32.080]  herself and say yes I know about the bomb going off in New York and the bomb going
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.360]  off in New Jersey and that's why we've got to continue to go after the bad guys and
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.640]  then 30 seconds later CNN says well Donald Trump came out and called it a bomb.
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.520]  She goes yeah he's horrible, he's terrible.
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.800]  They're still on the news CNN, MSNBC, Fox even this morning I was watching it saying
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.320]  Trump jumped the gun because you see this is a big win for Trump predicting it being
[10:55.320 --> 11:02.000]  right calling it first so they just invert all of that like it's a con game and just
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.360]  announced that it's you know a horrible thing that he saved a child from a burning building
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.640]  hypothetically or it's terrible he saved a kitten out of a tree when a big storm was
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.440]  coming it's terrible he gave charity to people when someone's got positives you don't even
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.040]  try to actually undermine the true story you just brazenly attack it even though it doesn't
[11:25.040 --> 11:31.520]  even make sense in psychological warfare it just changes the subject that's what the
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.680]  media is doing just like they call it a war on narratives saying that because we admit
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.200]  ISIS is attacking us because we admit Al Qaeda is attacking us because we admit that radical
[11:43.200 --> 11:50.560]  Islam is in a major offensive jihad worldwide invading 20 plus countries the last five years
[11:50.560 --> 11:58.440]  alone and our own globalist government financed and protected it and called it a peaceful revolution
[11:58.440 --> 12:05.360]  the Arab Spring launching it in Egypt and Tunisia in North Africa the truth is the globalists
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.080]  have launched this with Saudi Arabia the Russians have come out and said we've never had a real
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.440]  ceasefire with you the last year you're cheating you're targeting Syrian forces you're killing
[12:15.440 --> 12:22.760]  them almost on a daily basis you are backing Islamic Wahhabist forces that have come here
[12:22.760 --> 12:29.760]  from around the world being run by Saudi Arabia stop it the Russian generals have come out
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.840]  yesterday and said this again and guess what it's true criminal elements that run our government
[12:36.840 --> 12:44.840]  the George Soros types are openly running Wahhabist jihad worldwide now Al Qaeda is not
[12:44.840 --> 12:51.240]  the father of ISIS it is the brother of ISIS Saudi Arabia Sunni Wahhabism is the mother
[12:51.240 --> 13:04.040]  and the father but the modern military incarnations of this are Al Qaeda which was much smaller
[13:04.040 --> 13:10.320]  and more infiltrated by Western intelligence than the new ISIS system which means Islamic
[13:10.320 --> 13:18.680]  state Al Qaeda means the base same thing it is the Islamic base it is it is the state
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.480]  it is planting the flag it is the invasion force it is the declaration of living space
[13:24.480 --> 13:34.760]  of Laban Stroud of taking over the world of usurping you for Islam of the Islamic state
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.400]  and this war on narratives they think the public so stupid and look at Californians
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.680]  not one Californian our reporter talked to last week knew that the Trumps weren't really
[13:43.680 --> 13:51.680]  hunting stegosaurus and triceratops and pterodactyls people think that's a fake video we're gonna
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.040]  do one in Austin I predict Austinites aren't as brain damaged as Californians but they're
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.960]  close because they're so-called liberals I am predicting half of the Austinites at
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.200]  UT or the people at the University of Texas we're gonna go there another 20 years will
[14:05.200 --> 14:12.120]  believe that the Trump brothers the Trump's sons are hunting stegosaurus are hunting
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.520]  triceratops and pterodactyl because you understand everything the globalist does is pointed at
[14:18.520 --> 14:25.120]  low information morons like these people who aren't deplorable they're just sad little
[14:25.120 --> 14:31.280]  TV heads who have no culture no future no life the opposite of a liberal who believe
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.600]  they're liberal they're they're moron brainwashed idiots who have been given by the mainstream
[14:36.600 --> 14:42.440]  media the mantle of intellectual gods when they are nothing but drooling sycophantic
[14:42.440 --> 14:48.440]  foppish morons and I don't say that with pleasure but these are snot-nosed dangerous
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.200]  authoritarians and when our military starts coming out and general Flynn came out and
[14:53.200 --> 14:59.000]  said we're backing al-Qaeda they're now known as ISIS when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.480]  Dempsey went to Obama four years ago and said there's gonna be a military revolt they're
[15:03.480 --> 15:11.120]  not gonna follow orders do not bomb the Syrian regular army or there's gonna be a full revolt
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.360]  and we're going to Congress Obama had to back off for about two years rename it ISIS within
[15:16.360 --> 15:23.600]  weeks and then launch this new Islamic invasion that's a ground force all over the world and
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.240]  then Merkel opens up the border they bring them all into Europe soros is in the news today
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.680]  they've given three billion in the last five years to radical Islamic groups in the US and
[15:33.680 --> 15:39.240]  Europe and hundreds of millions to Black Lives Matter Ford Foundation gave another hundred
[15:39.240 --> 15:47.920]  million two weeks ago soros is now pledging an additional $500 million to lobby for open
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.400]  borders in Europe and the United States to of course the media spends it as oh soros is
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.320]  helping the sweet immigrants you don't even call them invaders you don't call them eighty
[15:56.320 --> 16:01.520]  percent military age man you don't call them a hobbyist you call them loving little friendly
[16:01.520 --> 16:08.800]  helpers it's all orchestrated it's all run and there last night was Donald Trump meeting
[16:08.800 --> 16:17.320]  with General Flynn and Senator Sessions with the number one stabilizing force in the Middle
[16:17.320 --> 16:21.400]  East after Israel but the main stabilizing force not just in the Middle East but also
[16:21.400 --> 16:28.080]  in Africa Egypt the biggest population of that entire region saying we're gonna help
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.600]  take out the Wahhabist and the Muslim Brotherhood with you and making a deal publicly to the
[16:33.600 --> 16:41.780]  New York Times to oppose the Islamic invasion the Wahhabist invasion that criminal elements
[16:41.780 --> 16:46.200]  of our government with Hillary Clinton Obama and others have launched I mean Obama has
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.800]  personally with his family launched jihad invasions of Kenya which has been 90% of
[16:51.800 --> 16:59.560]  Christian nation parts of Kenya have already fallen like Sudan it's happening ladies and
[16:59.560 --> 17:04.760]  gentlemen and Trump is being advised by the Patriots like General Flynn who was the main
[17:04.760 --> 17:13.720]  person orchestrating the military saying no to backing al Qaeda slash ISIS this is this
[17:13.720 --> 17:18.600]  is big this is the counter coup this is the soft coup against the globalist against the
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.480]  leftist Goldman Sachs world government combine with Bloomberg and then you know all these
[17:23.480 --> 17:30.040]  other new order people working with Soros the Rockefeller Foundation the UN you name
[17:30.040 --> 17:37.720]  it to bring down the West this is really happening Russia has been encircled by the Islamist
[17:37.720 --> 17:43.360]  army the globalist are using Europe is being openly invaded and the sleeper cells are being
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.720]  put in place same thing with the US and Canada Russia their fights back against it and says
[17:48.720 --> 17:56.680]  this to the United States let's combine forces and stop this together and they're told no
[17:56.680 --> 18:01.480]  but our military behind the scenes has and Cy Hirsch has brought out that classified information
[18:01.480 --> 18:07.280]  we're skipping this break so this is the massive level of historical things that are happening
[18:07.280 --> 18:12.520]  not my opinion yes you heard it here first 20 years ago 15 years ago 5 years ago a year
[18:12.520 --> 18:18.680]  ago yes we were spot on yes we were on target because we have the sources and I do the
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.880]  research and we have the guests on and we understand who the bad guys are and who the
[18:23.880 --> 18:30.200]  good guys are and we now know the battle plan I thought they just use radical Islam to set
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.680]  up a police state in the United States and have excuses to invade the Middle East and
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.400]  go after the non radical countries which you've seen them do and overthrow like Egypt like
[18:38.400 --> 18:45.640]  Libya like Iraq and compared to the lobbyists they're non radical but I thought it was to
[18:45.640 --> 18:50.120]  maybe use those as bases to take out the radicals no the globalists are so evil they're actually
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.560]  doing that for the radicals to turn all of Islam into the most vicious system you could
[18:55.560 --> 18:59.960]  ever imagine which is very very close to happening and then double crossing the West
[18:59.960 --> 19:06.200]  and actually bringing in the Muslims by the tens of millions and making us submit to them
[19:06.200 --> 19:12.280]  and the government will be the client manager of all the different disparate groups in the
[19:12.280 --> 19:18.280]  divide and conquer strategy so it gets crazier want to play this clip first so you have the
[19:18.280 --> 19:26.880]  father of the bomber reported bomber reportedly admits he did it going to the police two years
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.800]  ago and saying he plans to attack you got to stop him and they did so if you ask where's
[19:31.800 --> 19:37.080]  the false flags the White House has tied the hands of the FBI the federal marshals you
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.400]  name it this is all on record they're not even allowed to investigate mosque they're
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.800]  not allowed to even prosecute Muslims when they create all sorts of problems and commit
[19:45.800 --> 19:51.640]  crimes this guy had stabbed a family member critically wounding him three years ago and
[19:51.640 --> 19:59.680]  had been let off not even charged not even charged because it's a protected class the
[19:59.680 --> 20:05.400]  radical Muslims are the detonator to destabilize everything and that's what Soros says in his
[20:05.400 --> 20:14.480]  emails remember this is no longer our expert opinion this is confirmed in triplicate so
[20:14.480 --> 20:23.840]  huge and what do they do they come out and they say well you know we're just gonna have
[20:23.840 --> 20:28.280]  to take more your liberties and have the NSA spy on you and it turns out the NSA is even
[20:28.280 --> 20:33.040]  spying on the jihadist basically it was all used as a way again to bring in the police
[20:33.040 --> 20:38.400]  state does that mean we hate the average cop no they're being enslaved as well not about
[20:38.400 --> 20:44.640]  police state I mean multinational corporations running our infrastructure spy grids having
[20:44.640 --> 20:49.280]  kill switches and everything this is the ultimate national security risk to America this is
[20:49.280 --> 20:56.680]  how we got Trojan horse captured by an offshore technocracy that admittedly runs the NSA and
[20:56.680 --> 21:01.640]  the other 15 agencies now we've been captured it's happened they staged the attacks with
[21:01.640 --> 21:09.040]  the radical Muslims pass all these laws allowing a total 1984 control grid put the system in
[21:09.040 --> 21:14.720]  place and then phase two dissolve our borders and bring in the very supposed threat that
[21:14.720 --> 21:20.880]  the police state was set up to counter to then in phase two manage those attacks from
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.600]  all the sleeper cells that are real and they're going to take action order the FBI to not
[21:25.600 --> 21:31.800]  stop the attacks let the attacks take place is all admitted now and then dissolve everyone's
[21:31.800 --> 21:41.080]  freedoms and legitimize the 1984 total surveillance state you've been given the plan before it
[21:41.080 --> 21:47.740]  happened while it was happening and now that we are up to our eyeballs in this swamp only
[21:47.740 --> 21:52.960]  admitting it is going to get us out of it because here's the big enchilada I would tell
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.440]  people 20 years ago they were going to come out with driverless cars and then raise insurance
[21:56.440 --> 22:00.520]  rates where everything had to be driverless as a way to totally control society and also
[22:00.520 --> 22:05.480]  during an economic collapse the elite corporations will still have their robot cars and robot
[22:05.480 --> 22:10.960]  18 wheelers running so they'll have their own autonomous robot system with a very small
[22:10.960 --> 22:17.720]  group of humans to upkeep it making all of us obsolete to be kept in our ghettos basically
[22:17.720 --> 22:23.360]  all the new regulations and controls under agenda 21 not letting us barter not letting
[22:23.360 --> 22:29.880]  us plant crops not letting us garden not letting us machine shop or engage in metallurgy outside
[22:29.880 --> 22:36.240]  of their control it's a total admitted takeover now I saw it over the horizon now what I saw
[22:36.240 --> 22:41.560]  over the horizon is here and exactly as I saw it because I studied history feudalism
[22:41.560 --> 22:48.160]  technocracy technotronic era brzezinski the kissager group the royal commission on population
[22:48.160 --> 22:55.640]  what google said it was going to I mean this is all public and now they're in your face
[22:55.640 --> 23:01.600]  throwing down the gauntlet the new york times I have it here and they say us signals backing
[23:01.600 --> 23:08.760]  for self-driving cars and it says in the article we're the feds are going to set it up where
[23:08.760 --> 23:14.360]  the highways are for driverless cars and not your cars and tax you and regulate you forcing
[23:14.360 --> 23:20.280]  you and this is an incredibly arrogant statement within five years out of your cars and you
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.160]  say well how are they going to pull that off because they're getting ready for a gigantic
[23:24.160 --> 23:29.120]  depression oh that's the next you to drop they have a big globalist professor writing
[23:29.120 --> 23:34.320]  a CNN article saying I'm not going to tell you what it is but a giant global crisis
[23:34.320 --> 23:39.800]  is about to happen within one month that will shake trump and hillary prepare yourself and
[23:39.800 --> 23:44.960]  then people all speculate there's an article in fours dot com you know isn't a jihad attack
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.640]  you know isn't a big war that's about to happen it's all of that it's already happening but
[23:49.640 --> 23:55.920]  it's going to be unless they change plans but currently it's already on german bank collapse
[23:55.920 --> 24:01.040]  which will then be followed by a huge banking crisis where they hold everyone hostage and
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.400]  say politically do whatever we say and give us unlimited banker bailouts and control of
[24:06.400 --> 24:12.920]  your currencies even further and let it all be completely untransparent or the stock market
[24:12.920 --> 24:21.840]  won't go back up so that's what they say is coming bloomberg deutschbank goes to crisis
[24:21.840 --> 24:30.240]  arrow well german bank say it's on the verge of total collapse that's today now the giant
[24:30.240 --> 24:36.520]  enchilada the first clip of the day i've laid out the spectrum of what we currently face
[24:36.520 --> 24:44.160]  in their own words george soros captaining the whole thing proud man who told reporters
[24:44.160 --> 24:51.600]  30 years ago he believed he was the messiah he believes he is the messiah but said i had
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.160]  to you can find the quotes i had to get into power first or they would lock me up thinking
[24:56.160 --> 25:04.440]  i was insane oh see it's not insane if he becomes the messiah see the messiah the messiah
[25:04.440 --> 25:12.280]  the guy thinks he's the messiah was a nazi collaborator when he's 15 years old got rich
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.480]  off the jews he helped find and repair it out i mean just think of the evil level of
[25:16.480 --> 25:24.640]  these people and now 500 million in this month alone to break our borders associated press
[25:24.640 --> 25:33.440]  and what do they do they've claimed the oh there's going to be no election fraud oh there's
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.520]  going to be no problems there's nothing going on there's nothing happening alex is insane
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.680]  a month and a half ago then trump comes out says no we are going to investigate it's real
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.600]  and then they come out and say the russians have hacked the election computers we have
[25:48.600 --> 25:57.200]  to hook into all of them with the OECD's paramilitary arm the OECD is what founded the modern EU
[25:57.200 --> 26:02.480]  the actual corporation the marshal plan corporation is going to come here now and take us fully
[26:02.480 --> 26:12.920]  under its control and they've now announced ladies and gentlemen that they believe that
[26:12.920 --> 26:18.560]  the russians might try to come after hillary clinton they're floating that the russians
[26:18.560 --> 26:23.000]  if you believe that when hillary is a globalist she is a conqueror she is a general for the
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.040]  new world order that that is here sitting on us she is the multinational queen she is
[26:28.040 --> 26:34.680]  their agent they are the outside group we are conquered to a great extent now they want
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.360]  to mop up media and they say the alternative right those that will tell you the truth have
[26:38.360 --> 26:42.920]  no right to exist you're watching history happen because we're there opposing them the
[26:42.920 --> 26:48.160]  last americans the last europeans in europe and others people in other countries like
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.280]  brazil are trying to block the globalist and being brought to their knees they're bringing
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.200]  other countries to their knees they're about to bring the uk to its knees because they
[26:55.200 --> 27:02.520]  dare declare sovereignty and and and you have the un making all the laws you have all this
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.400]  global control we have our borders being opened and and the people of england say we never
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.160]  voted to interview we're gonna get out they vote to leave and they go sorry we're not
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.560]  letting you leave and by the way we're gonna smash your economy and teach you not to try
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.800]  to leave us these are authoritarian's people these people are evil and they're now dissolving
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.120]  europe's borders to flood it with giant poor populations that they're gonna have under
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.840]  their control and running tv ads state runs saying it's bad to be german it's bad to be
[27:30.840 --> 27:36.640]  swedish white people are bad you must accept the hajib islam is your future and they're
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.760]  advertising it all over africa and the middle east come here we're open and the muslim imams
[27:41.760 --> 27:49.760]  say they are weak we take them now we come and and merkel and haland and all the leaders
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.680]  openly write articles saying this is good you're seeing the fall of europe they're actually
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.920]  admitting it and i gotta hand it to them they're finally gonna conquer europe after the middle
[27:59.920 --> 28:05.760]  east trying for two thousands of years it's actually happening but i mean they ran europe
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.920]  what's wrong with europe they're just destroying it for fun pissing on it because these are
[28:10.920 --> 28:15.880]  deviance and now the big clip i'm gonna go to it as we go to break and then come back
[28:15.880 --> 28:22.560]  with the rest hillary clinton asked by bloomberg are the russians the ones behind the bombing
[28:22.560 --> 28:28.880]  that's there is no radical islam even though his father says he did it it you're bad to
[28:28.880 --> 28:35.480]  say it but ladies and gentlemen is it the russians bombing radical islam doesn't exist
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.800]  hillary i mean they're peaceful right the russians i mean this is the the wild eyedness
[28:40.800 --> 28:47.560]  of these people and the guy that leads them who thinks he's the messiah here it is are
[28:47.560 --> 28:52.360]  you concerned that this weekend's attacks or potential incidents in the coming weeks
[28:52.360 --> 28:58.840]  might be an attempt by isis or isis sympathizers or really any other group maybe the russians
[28:58.840 --> 29:05.440]  to influence the presidential race in some way and presumably try to drive votes to don
[29:05.440 --> 29:10.400]  trompe rule as you back up the start i want to come back and play this in full without
[29:10.400 --> 29:14.080]  an interruption but notice she looks at that woman they make eye contact she doesn't do
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.080]  press conferences she has chosen little deals every day or so which you can get up for ten
[29:18.080 --> 29:22.240]  minutes look how sick she looks to let them ask a few prescripting questions that's admitted
[29:22.240 --> 29:26.320]  years ago it said admitted her emails that it's all scripted pre-questions she gets
[29:26.320 --> 29:29.600]  ready for the scripted questions so this is hillary asking yourself a question that's
[29:29.600 --> 29:35.680]  news right there and they slip in isis al-qaeda oh admitting oh yeah maybe they do do terror
[29:35.680 --> 29:41.680]  to make it sound more legitimate and then slip in the russians see all of it scripted
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.920]  all of it engineered admittedly so all of it a conspiracy against the free world stay

[33:11.360 --> 33:25.320]  you know I play chess and I play three dimensional chess when I study politics and history and
[33:25.320 --> 33:31.640]  a lot of people who think that obama cares free when it's not a lot of people who take
[33:31.640 --> 33:36.920]  common core classes and believe two plus two equals five they can't grasp some of the ideas
[33:36.920 --> 33:40.640]  we put out here and I'm gonna be honest I don't say this in the latest fashion I don't say
[33:40.640 --> 33:46.760]  this from a position of enjoying the fact of the general public even most so-called intellectuals
[33:46.760 --> 33:50.800]  pseudo intellectuals don't know what they're talking about don't really know about terms
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.720]  they're very threatened by it they don't like it I'm into knowledge and history because
[33:55.720 --> 34:00.880]  it's incredibly interesting and because I don't want to be a slave I fundamentally don't
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.640]  like reading hundreds and hundreds of books and hundreds and hundreds of white papers
[34:05.640 --> 34:13.120]  where the globalist and watching them on c-span and and and Ted TV and you name it admitting
[34:13.120 --> 34:19.080]  everything they're doing to us and knowing that ninety five percent of what I say came
[34:19.080 --> 34:25.440]  out of their mouths and then I show you where they said it and then the public goes you're
[34:25.440 --> 34:35.360]  a conspiracy theorist I choose not to believe that or they say that's your interpretation
[34:35.360 --> 34:41.840]  no a hundred trillion dollar a decade global carbon tax to start that they admit is to
[34:41.840 --> 34:47.600]  end the industrialized world on a selective basis and only allow in industry in select
[34:47.600 --> 34:55.840]  corporate reservations that's called high-tech feudalism and by the way they call it a new
[34:55.840 --> 35:04.200]  form of feudalism in the united nations biological diversity assessment I mean you know I'm gonna
[35:04.200 --> 35:07.560]  read this stuff it's like this sounds like feudalism they'd say we will re-establish
[35:07.560 --> 35:14.280]  feudalism you're like whoa but again the general public's like oh you're being fancy
[35:14.280 --> 35:20.600]  feudalism what's that made up word you know fag and I use that if you haven't seen you
[35:20.600 --> 35:25.960]  know idiocracy the guy was just average in the year two thousand you know twenty or whatever
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.280]  he goes forward two hundred years and people are so dumb down he's like the smartest person
[35:30.280 --> 35:34.920]  on the earth and he goes into this court trial and he goes I'd like to put on some evidence
[35:34.920 --> 35:40.640]  the judge goes why don't you just sit down stop talking like a fag and I've actually
[35:40.640 --> 35:46.040]  seen people who will say look at him he's reading a book I've actually been on at pools
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.480]  and stuff and seen guys walk by some other guy reading a book go oh wow reading a book
[35:50.480 --> 35:58.880]  must be really smart hey girls look I mean it's like a war on knowledge and it's getting
[35:58.880 --> 36:05.160]  weirder and weirder and weirder because the more knowledge you get the more you want because
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.240]  then you just start figuring stuff out and then you're more successful in life and business
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.400]  and then all of a sudden you're hanging around with the brainiacs of the planet instead people
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.120]  think it's really cool to know nothing or act like they do and just laugh at everybody
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.520]  but I'm here to tell you a world government is being established that is designed to set
[36:25.520 --> 36:32.840]  up a planet where you don't exist that's pretty diabolical and they're now announcing in
[36:32.840 --> 36:39.480]  Bloomberg and the New York Times hey by 2025 there'll be no one allowed to drive on the
[36:39.480 --> 36:41.920]  roads you're like well that'll never happen the point is they're trying to break your
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.800]  will and just being the most extreme up front we're building a world where humans don't
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.760]  run anything except the humans that set up the computers and control those they're called
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.560]  technocrats and the globalists call themselves technocrats at Davos and at Bilderberg and
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.040]  at the club of Rome and they talk about all these horrible things they're going to do
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.080]  so the like appointing presidents in three European countries in the last five years
[37:07.080 --> 37:13.880]  and saying this is our new model where we appoint presidents that's like Hitler invading in
[37:13.880 --> 37:22.080]  world war two and appointing presidents and premiers prime ministers but it's okay we
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.720]  took over we've got fancy Hugo Boss black uniforms so it's okay because we have machine
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.840]  guns and guys that'll kill you if you don't follow orders the average trendy just goes
[37:32.840 --> 37:39.080]  so what if they're appointing presidents big deal I'm a liberal shut up homophobe you're
[37:39.080 --> 37:42.600]  like I have nothing against gay people what if I'll even use the word you tell me to use
[37:42.600 --> 37:48.520]  shut up you hate me or I'm not even gay but but you still hate black people you're like
[37:48.520 --> 37:56.760]  actually I don't yeah it's like dealing with the idiocy but let me tell you something the
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.560]  big think tanks wouldn't have started all this anti-russia stuff there's Russian spies
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.720]  everywhere we've got to arrest Alex Jones and shut down the alt media and shut down
[38:04.720 --> 38:11.600]  right Barton shut down Matt drudge the Russians though are they under here are they over there
[38:11.600 --> 38:14.840]  I guess out of fifty something crew members we do have one evil Russian who came over
[38:14.840 --> 38:19.720]  here to get away from the communists and she's a little girl and then served in the US military
[38:19.720 --> 38:26.160]  with an honorable discharge but that doesn't matter because I mean Donald Trump's his godfather
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.000]  is a Putin I mean we saw race so mad how she put my head up there with Trump's and Putin's
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.880]  like it was some type of you know communist ideology with the red in the background like
[38:35.880 --> 38:40.440]  we were the founding fathers of Marx and Ingalls when Russia is the one going away from communism
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.720]  and what's the Democrats that put out campaign posters not mocking people as founding Russian
[38:46.720 --> 38:54.360]  communist but promoting it as founded founding Russian communists I mean there's no end
[38:54.360 --> 39:01.640]  to these people so let's finish up with this Hillary clip where she gets there always by
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.120]  her plane always at the airport with a four or five of her little minions that follow
[39:06.120 --> 39:12.080]  her around and roll oranges to her to ask her questions in injecting okay it's an attack
[39:12.080 --> 39:18.960]  oh it's a bombing now now we're allowed to say that but only when the media says so like
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.040]  yesterday Owen shroyer was in New York is back today he and Zimmerman are talking to people
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.720]  on the street you saw it on air and he goes up to a TV camera person that's there at the
[39:28.720 --> 39:35.440]  scene and says well is Trump bad then this is an educated idiot he's talking to he actually
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.840]  has an IQ but is in such a cult that he has to say to you okay well it was this bombing
[39:40.840 --> 39:43.720]  yes it was bombing well Trump said it wasn't everybody said he was bad well that's because
[39:43.720 --> 39:47.680]  he jumped the gun well no there was you know two devices went off in one day and he was
[39:47.680 --> 39:50.840]  talking to cops it was it was bombs and you know he's allowed to think on the zone if
[39:50.840 --> 39:54.440]  I see a blade of grass and I say it's a blade of grass I have to wait for ABC News to say
[39:54.440 --> 40:03.320]  it's a blade of grass and the guy goes actually I kind of get your point okay I get it that
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.920]  guy you could tell was smart he didn't have dim eyes but he was so brainwashed that he
[40:08.920 --> 40:17.360]  himself was there enforcing his own enslavement in front of us and I don't call him an idiot
[40:17.360 --> 40:21.480]  because I get off on that the person's an idiot to lie to himself and those trendies
[40:21.480 --> 40:25.720]  care about what people say about him so I'm going to tell you if it hurts your feelings
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.440]  not because I want to hurt you because I want you to get up off your ass and wake up and
[40:29.440 --> 40:35.320]  break your conditioning brother that's cult level control okay when Trump can't say it's
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.840]  a bombing and when he's proven right that's a bad thing that's upside down land that's
[40:40.840 --> 40:49.200]  bizarre a world we ain't living there so let's go to the club here it is are you concerned
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.320]  that this weekend's attacks or potential incidents in the coming weeks might be an attempt by
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.960]  ISIS or ISIS sympathizers or really any other group maybe the Russians to influence the presidential
[41:00.960 --> 41:08.120]  race in some way and presumably try to drive votes to Donald Trump who is as you've said
[41:08.120 --> 41:14.400]  before widely seen as perhaps being somebody who they would be more willing to or see as
[41:14.400 --> 41:18.520]  an easier person to be against well Jennifer I don't want to speculate but here's what
[41:18.520 --> 41:25.600]  we know and I think it's important for voters to hear this and way and making their choice
[41:25.600 --> 41:35.960]  back it up see now four days in we're not we don't need to speculate when the government
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.840]  doesn't want an answer to be there even though the answer is right in your face like four
[41:39.840 --> 41:46.840]  days after the sun rises and sets ma'am will the sun come tomorrow we don't want to speculate
[41:46.840 --> 41:53.320]  but here's what we know oh she's the authority like grandma talking to a two year old here
[41:53.320 --> 41:58.200]  let me talk to you like you're a moron oh here Hillary I'm waiting for you I'm not going
[41:58.200 --> 42:01.200]  to say you're standing in front of a jumbo jet saying stronger together I'm not going
[42:01.200 --> 42:03.960]  to say to her news conference I don't know where Hillary is in this video unless she
[42:03.960 --> 42:10.640]  tells me I don't know this is a piece of paper from Politico saying George HW Bush to vote
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.040]  for Hillary Clinton I mean it says that but I have to wait till till till they tell me
[42:16.040 --> 42:20.560]  because because I don't really exist I just have to sit her as a spectator as a computer
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.920]  program and receive whatever they tell me so okay okay I'm ready to receive it here's
[42:25.920 --> 42:32.320]  what we know okay see no one else can speculate but I can talk now I am where the knowledge
[42:32.320 --> 42:39.800]  comes from like Moses up on the mountain this is the religion of arrogance of these authoritarian
[42:39.800 --> 42:49.120]  hunchback crone like demons that rule us here it is we know that a lot of the rhetoric we've
[42:49.120 --> 42:55.600]  heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists in particular ISIS because they
[42:55.600 --> 43:02.640]  are looking to make this in a war against Islam okay back up again because I could teach
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.120]  a college course on brainwashing and disinformation and this war on narrative bull I'm about to
[43:07.120 --> 43:12.560]  define first they won't call it bombs they won't call it Islamic they won't call it
[43:12.560 --> 43:16.200]  terror the guys dad said he went to training camps he warned the police and the FBI they
[43:16.200 --> 43:20.400]  were ordered to stand down because you know this stuff doesn't exist just it isn't happening
[43:20.400 --> 43:26.640]  now Trump's proven right it's happening and so these groups are seizing on Trump that's
[43:26.640 --> 43:30.840]  why really Trump wasn't running till a year and a half ago and Al Qaeda and ISIS invaded
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.200]  20 something countries and our own government was there funding them and protecting them
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.840]  and the news was calling it the Arab Spring this woman was running the State Department
[43:39.840 --> 43:46.200]  then as the lead general in the telecommunications in the phones in the in the communiques in
[43:46.200 --> 43:51.800]  the WikiLeaks in the admitted public data she was the one ordering the stand down she
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.880]  was the one not letting people get help in Benghazi she was the one when Gaddafi months
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.400]  before was totally ready to surrender and give the West anything they wanted he was
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.640]  going to run to France he thought and they set him up to kill him because they wanted
[44:04.640 --> 44:14.320]  to loot the country and make it a failed state did he stabilize what was left of Africa
[44:14.320 --> 44:19.560]  think about that everything she says is the opposite of it she is the leader the founder
[44:19.560 --> 44:25.800]  literally of modern ISIS with Obama what what Trump said is pure truth told him by the former
[44:25.800 --> 44:31.440]  head of defense intelligence general Flynn who's a super patriot who is preparing to
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.280]  try to save the country right now meeting with foreign leaders 18 hours a day to try
[44:36.280 --> 44:42.600]  to stop World War three that this lady in George Soros the Messiah go look it up George
[44:42.600 --> 44:48.520]  Soros believes he's the Messiah all he leaves is death and destruction behind him and he's
[44:48.520 --> 44:51.960]  a Messiah let's I'm gonna try to shut up and just get into the clip after but here
[44:51.960 --> 44:59.880]  it is war against jihadists violent terrorists people who number in the maybe tens of thousands
[44:59.880 --> 45:07.720]  not the tens of millions they want to use that to recruit more fighters to their cause
[45:07.720 --> 45:14.880]  by turning it into a religious conflict that's why I've been very clear we're going after
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.360]  the bad guys and we're gonna get them but we're not going to go after an entire religion
[45:20.360 --> 45:27.960]  and give ISIS exactly what it's one of the order for them ISIS is panicking and now it
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.080]  means they're being beaten because finally our military working with the Russians is
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.400]  ignoring Obama's orders most of the time and taking them out so now they sit stay in place
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.360]  they launched a worldwide emergency on Sunday and said stay in place start killing where
[45:39.360 --> 45:45.480]  you're at so that's now Donald Trump's fault because you launched them Hillary and then
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.680]  it gets worse Donald Trump's son puts out a tweet of Skittles saying a whole bag of
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.640]  Skittles might be not poisonous but two or three of them are poisonous with these Muslims
[45:54.640 --> 45:58.680]  would you let them in obviously not I was watching Fox News this morning they go has
[45:58.680 --> 46:06.520]  Donald Trump Jr. gone too far a bag of Skittles so they take normal speech like people saying
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.600]  yeah Thomas Jefferson said the Declaration of Independence we have a right to fight back
[46:11.600 --> 46:16.240]  oh my gosh they're calling for violence that should be outlawed we're taking normal American
[46:16.240 --> 46:22.440]  speech and demonizing it now they're taking normal Americana and saying the alt right
[46:22.440 --> 46:34.320]  doesn't have a right to exist let's continue with Hillary to enhance their positions secondly
[46:34.320 --> 46:41.120]  we know that Donald Trump's comments have been used online for recruitment now you know
[46:41.120 --> 46:47.360]  how's my house we've heard that pause again and back it up 10 seconds they're the ones
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.000]  working with the Europeans working with the British and others and the French who allowed
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.240]  Islamic recruiting well hobbyist recruiting to launch the Arab Spring where Bilderberg
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.560]  met north of London we went there and covered it it was in the news the year before they
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.440]  hatched the Arab Spring with Facebook and Twitter and Google MI6 and NATO and the State
[47:09.440 --> 47:14.000]  Department of the US and launched it the next year they've launched this whole takeover
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.280]  of 20 plus countries hundreds of thousands dead per country in some cases 60 70,000 dead
[47:19.280 --> 47:28.880]  in Libya bare minimum and then she sits there saying Donald Trump did it so now it's Islamic
[47:28.880 --> 47:35.320]  terror she told you it wasn't a few days ago so it's Donald Trump's fault let's continue
[47:35.320 --> 47:42.520]  we know that Donald Trump's comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists
[47:42.520 --> 47:46.960]  that's the leftist model we've heard that that's why they're banning your speech in
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.440]  Germany and a bunch of other European countries in the UK arresting people that mildly criticize
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.120]  Islam or radical Islam and say it's wrong that's why they arrest you because you are
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.960]  causing them to kill our governments bring them in they start killing everybody acting
[48:02.960 --> 48:07.040]  like total animals towards women then we're supposed to kiss their ass and adopt what
[48:07.040 --> 48:10.800]  they're doing because it's our fault this is the this is the script that Merkel and
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.920]  Hollande and they all follow it in the colleges everywhere you're seeing a script thrown at
[48:16.920 --> 48:22.080]  you like you're an idiot continue with the whore with the way we know that Donald Trump's
[48:22.080 --> 48:31.080]  comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists we've heard that from former
[48:31.080 --> 48:37.760]  CIA director Michael Hayden who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.720]  is being used as a recruiting sergeant for the terrorists we also know from the former
[48:44.720 --> 48:52.360]  head of our counterterrorism center Matt Olson that the kinds of rhetoric and language that
[48:52.360 --> 49:00.160]  Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries Hayden and Olson are working
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.360]  with the globalists to illegally spy on the American people that's all been exposed they're
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.280]  part of the program not letting the real data intelligence get to the FBI and others and
[49:07.280 --> 49:10.800]  I'm not defending the FBI but it's had its hands tied the intelligence flows down to
[49:10.800 --> 49:15.440]  the FBI the FBI agents get prosecuted the San Bernardino shooters two years before the FBI
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.800]  tried to stop them they were going to Pakistan Saudi Arabia criminal charges investigation
[49:19.800 --> 49:28.840]  was opened on a civil rights violation by Loretta Lynch's predecessor the attorney general
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.560]  and then now she's expanded it these people are so sick and you sit here and you watch
[49:33.560 --> 49:39.040]  him engage in it it makes me want to throw up and I apologize to prostitutes lays the
[49:39.040 --> 49:45.480]  night horse that is a old profession and I think honorable profession compared to Hillary
[49:45.480 --> 49:48.880]  Clinton and that just slipped out so I call somebody a bastard big deal if you don't have
[49:48.880 --> 49:52.160]  a dad that stayed home compared to that's not that big an insult a lot of great people
[49:52.160 --> 49:56.120]  are bastards so it's wrong to call Clinton a bastard you know her husband he's a rapist
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.680]  he's a criminal he's a thug that only gave 5% it's now come out of the money they got
[50:00.680 --> 50:06.200]  for Haiti two actual people in Haiti they kept tens of millions of dollars those are monsters
[50:06.200 --> 50:14.160]  those are master criminals those are filth the likes of which have never seen witch evil

[50:20.600 --> 50:26.080]  whore I'm sure MSNBC will have fun with that give me a break you people have hitched your
[50:26.080 --> 50:33.640]  wagon to a whore of Babylon drunk on the blood of the saints engineering the murder of Christians

[50:49.680 --> 50:53.960]  people there is a spirit that animates them and everything she's done is they'll go out
[50:53.960 --> 50:58.320]  of their way to target Christians in Africa Christians in the Middle East Christians in
[50:58.320 --> 51:02.840]  Europe Christians in Eastern Europe Christians in Russia Christians in Central Asia Christians

[51:12.520 --> 51:18.360]  way to target Christians that's even admitted by mainstream news the persecution and murder
[51:18.360 --> 51:26.280]  of Christians is logarithmically doubling every year because there is a bounty out millions
[51:26.280 --> 51:33.000]  of Christians are being killed a year now the numbers are just untold untold because

[53:16.120 --> 53:27.960]  incredible it's all true now let's go to the next piece talking about intergalactic mosquito
[53:27.960 --> 53:37.080]  that's a metaphor it's an allegory for the media look at this body snatcher politico George
[53:37.080 --> 53:43.000]  H.W. Bush we have this clip to vote for Hillary Clinton oh my gosh oh my gosh all the old
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.160]  evil war mongers and those that call for world government those that bankrupted our economy
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.800]  and those that reverse the Reagan policies that made us so successful oh my gosh this
[53:50.800 --> 53:57.880]  horrible I mean this wonderful person has come out this globalist minion of evil this
[53:57.880 --> 54:03.240]  curse on humanity with his horrible family has now climbed back out of the pit to have
[54:03.240 --> 54:08.960]  one more utterance that you know your mother's doing you know what in hell as he spews figurative
[54:08.960 --> 54:18.440]  green green pea soup out of his maw to tell us that he likes Hillary Clinton now look at
[54:18.440 --> 54:28.200]  both of you prepared for the abyss God's chefs are metaphorically spiritually loading big
[54:28.200 --> 54:34.800]  juicy apples into your mouths and the big furnace doors opening up and you're sliding
[54:34.800 --> 54:42.400]  in on rails I'm afraid the Patriots are already prepared for you when your new world order
[54:42.400 --> 54:52.120]  arrives see you think you're the only people that know about these plans and oh you've
[54:52.120 --> 54:55.720]  got all these plans and they're so evil and oh they're so demonic and there's so much
[54:55.720 --> 55:01.680]  energy in them but there's a whole other level above that that sees your whole plan and knows
[55:01.680 --> 55:07.240]  how to stop it and knows that you have only been the people sent to prepare us to crush
[55:07.240 --> 55:14.640]  you in our elementary school graduation ceremony show George Herbert Walker Bush to vote for
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.760]  Hillary Clinton they call themselves a family you know I've interviewed all the top CIA
[55:18.760 --> 55:24.240]  people when I say all all the ones will talk dozens and dozens and it's all come out the
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.860]  Clintons were recruited for the CIA when they were both in high school then they were put
[55:29.860 --> 55:35.240]  on section together we have another section chief in London they were sent into the Moscow
[55:35.240 --> 55:39.720]  to try to infiltrate the Russians they were brought back here they were then set up by
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.280]  different paramilitary groups and the CIA to run for the governor's ship to bring in the
[55:43.280 --> 55:46.560]  cocaine and do all the rest they've done and that's why they've been vacationing with the
[55:46.560 --> 55:51.840]  Bushes they had that whole fake election in 1992-93 it's all staged I said it was staged
[55:51.840 --> 55:55.720]  in 96 when I first got on the air and now they admit they vacation together and call
[55:55.720 --> 56:00.480]  themselves family because Williams Everson Clinton is the son of the former Rockefeller
[56:00.480 --> 56:10.520]  governor of Arkansas now let's go ahead and go to a clip of the family the Bush family
[56:10.520 --> 56:16.640]  worshiping the Clintonistas you've often referred to Bill Clinton and you talked about his
[56:16.640 --> 56:22.040]  relationship with your father and how it developed in your mother as well and he's your brother
[56:22.040 --> 56:28.800]  from another mother what does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family my sister-in-law
[56:28.800 --> 56:35.240]  interesting he thinks of George a little bit like the father he didn't have he's very
[56:35.240 --> 56:43.440]  loving to him and I really appreciate that I love Bill Clinton yeah it was the Rockefellers
[56:43.440 --> 56:50.480]  that set up Herbert Walker and the end press got his daddy and so they're returning the

[59:09.320 --> 59:14.520]  the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:01:00.080]  I do not resonate with these enemies that I do not want their approval or their or their
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:08.360]  their they are weak little grasping twisted pieces of trash that were chosen by this system
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:28.600]  because they were such pure objects of emptiness pure objects of emptiness but okay I'm being
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.800]  myself here can people handle it can you handle it folks because I try to sit up here and
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.960]  be calm covering all this and you know I read news about two three hours in the morning
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.920]  and I sit there and see the big rollout in the last week and thousands of publications
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.840]  saying hey listen we're gonna get you out of your cars we're gonna run your thermostat
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.800]  we're gonna troll everything and by the way your kids don't belong to you oh and by the
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.560]  way we got a thousand different vaccines coming online the next few years we're gonna make

[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:11.440]  it's clobbering time I mean I can't help it this is just as evil as announcing itself
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.880]  running around flapping its wings crapping out failure behind it it's about a foot tall
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.720]  little red eyes and we collectively just woke up to stop that son of a piece of trash right
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  back to Hades that's the worst part is if you look at it it's this little look at Mad
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.640]  Owl and all these people look at sink and I mean they're all just weak blobs of just
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.480]  empty filth perched on a spewing their BS how they're the intellectuals if they control
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.960]  the language they know everything as they script what they say for six seven eight ten
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.720]  hours before with little teleprompters and screens and have little lessons and things
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:59.920]  about how to look like they're credible for everybody these empty nobody's and then you
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.000]  got to watch them commit evil that's the thing like if I wanted to show an evil boy could
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.240]  I but I don't want to I love humanity I want to lift it up these people it's like it'd
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.480]  be okay if they were like super advanced and just saw humanity as ugly and bad they're
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.880]  not gonna kind of maybe buy it but but we're not we're beautiful and incredible and then
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.560]  they're the worst of us freaking out to get rid of us because they can't stand being in
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.760]  our presence well I got a little bit of a news flash for you if you want all of us to
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:39.080]  die to create this utopia I think you should go first oh I know you won't because you're

[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.160]  amazing things starting to happen but with it evil intensifies that's because evil is
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:16.200]  running it when evil is relegated to its rightful quadrant you're going to see a jump in human
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:24.000]  development that is going to be unimaginable for those of us alive in this millisecond
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.720]  and these controllers are pulling their hair out knowing that the jump is about to be made
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.600]  and are just running around overthrowing all the genetics of the planet murdering killing
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.520]  innocents killing Christians because they have the spirit that is the operating system
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:52.120]  to save the planet while just allying with every failed evil they can I'm here to tell

[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:26.800]  in defense of human liberty you're listening to the alex jones show coming to you in occupied
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.600]  texas under fema region six but our local police our local governments are becoming
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:38.120]  aware of the occupation becoming aware of agenda twenty one agenda twenty thirty coming
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.160]  aware of the fact that yeah this stuff sounds crazy but truth and history is stranger than
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:49.800]  any fiction they're learning they're going under you in control they're learning that
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:57.480]  the founding fathers are being demonized they're finding out that the patriots were right and
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.880]  now it's time to try to stop the globals for engineering a civil war I have massive news
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.120]  more news breaking so much to cover so many clips but something I mentioned yesterday
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.000]  but didn't get to is very important because it's bigger than just the story yeah news
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.360]  is you know a twenty four hour really six seven hour cycle but all of it can be a teaching
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.720]  experience for myself as well I was thinking about something there's kind of a riddle
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:29.040]  in a mystery you've got Tim Cain the VP that was demonizing yours truly by name last week
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.920]  implying that we want violence totally made up we don't want offensive violence we will
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.360]  defend ourselves we're not looking forward to that eventuality we want to go down other
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:48.120]  roads historically much more palatable for all but if forced into said briar patch let's
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:57.480]  just say in the scheme of the ages those of you that serve the fallen system don't end
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.040]  up doing too well when the good people actually stand up but I'll just stop right there for
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:08.200]  you now continuing oh you always do good up front but not into the second and third act
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:14.400]  now continuing I was thinking about this trump comes out like he always does and it was Matt
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.320]  drudge that was here a year ago that again laid out a battle plan that's been really
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.960]  almost a prophecy but but it's not prophecy because we understand the globalist program
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.280]  and he has the sources but he said we need to go with that refrain hey if hollywood's
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.240]  going to have guns and if and if Obama's gonna have guns and if Hillary's gonna have guns
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.400]  you should turn your guns in you shouldn't have secret service protecting you and they
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.840]  never will address the logic of that they always just say what you want him to get
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.320]  killed you want someone to go after Hillary is that what you're saying we go no you had
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:59.360]  to do mental gymnastics or mental twister to get to that what did I say the common people
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.120]  don't get to arm ourselves under your system you'd like to disarm us we can't afford it
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:13.040]  you take what little money we have and have us pay to then have thousands of men and women
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:20.600]  protecting this person but then we don't get the right that this country was founded on
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:26.680]  for an individual to protect ourselves and they take that they go you want to hurt Hillary
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:34.120]  but that sort of thinking you know it's a false charge on the surface to say that that
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.480]  was a threat against Hillary and he was implying go after Hillary clearly that's not what he
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.840]  meant he was covering the point that everybody's made for decades and that drudge has been
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.680]  pushing heavily that hey we don't have bodyguards we don't have the money out of the money for
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:51.080]  bodyguards sometimes I do the point is that I can't do it all the time and quite frankly
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.640]  the mission is so important I've gotten to the point of saying I'm not just going to
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.240]  be filled with bravada and you know be so macho that I don't care if somebody comes
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.440]  after me it's quite frankly I don't I don't have time to be afraid I don't want to steal
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.920]  a ventura quote you know don't have time to bleed I don't have time to be afraid I'm
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.520]  not I'm afraid of failure but I need to have some protection to go as far as I can in this
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:15.080]  fight like saying if I was a helicopter going into attack an enemy in placement if I could
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.360]  have armor on a helicopter what I want absolutely I'm gonna attack a machine gun and a rocket
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.120]  in placement with my helicopter I've got courage but I want if I can get it an armored
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.680]  helicopter if I'm in a war for my country and my family and they're gonna send me up
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:35.640]  there in a tinfoil helicopter I'm gonna do it but the point I'm getting at here is that
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.000]  I get to think though they're called but see that's from their position they are telling
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.640]  us the truth in a way with the Freudian slip they're saying you want to hurt Hillary saying
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.320]  take her security we're saying no we're not allowed to have security under your system
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.160]  our own security we pay for her and then we can't have it that's wrong that's discriminatory
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.560]  that's not what freedom is slaves are disarmed and they come back and say you're threatening
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.240]  her we're calling the Secret Service Trump wants to hurt Hillary did you hear coming
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:13.000]  up next next segment and it hit me what they're saying is actually true it is an assault on
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.160]  Hillary Clinton to take her armed guards away and to say that she couldn't have a gun to
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.840]  protect herself it really is an attempt to lay her open to be killed and attacked it
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:26.280]  really is an attempt at assassination on Hillary not the way Trump meant it but the way they
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.440]  do it to us in Chicago and New York and DC and other places that the highest crime rates
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.240]  in the country and the world in Chicago's case saying we can't have guns the good people
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.040]  is saying only the bad people can have guns and the ruling class so they can hurt us and
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:46.280]  can dominate us so it's true yes Trump did threaten Hillary Clinton and she's threatening
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.680]  all of us so he threw it back at her and said listen which if you can be armed and protected
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:14:02.320]  we can too got it but see they hope logic is dead in their vassals little MSG fluoride
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:14.120]  brains now I'm gonna go circle of these clips here is a cane twist a cane Trump incited
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.760]  violence against Hillary Clinton with call to disarm her bodyguards and I guess that's
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.840]  actually in a way true again she's inciting violence saying disarm us and have Chicago's
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:32.280]  even more dangerous for worse places in Mexico Chicago's the most dangerous city in the world
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:39.040]  the United States has five of the top ten safest cities we also have the worst run by
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:45.400]  filth like Hillary so here's Kane unintentionally telling the truth let's turn to politics and
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.840]  I want to begin with Donald Trump's comment on Friday night about what he believes is
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.160]  Hillary Clinton's hypocrisy when it comes to the issue of gun control here he is I think
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:05.920]  at her bodyguards she'd drop all weapons they should disarm take their guns away she doesn't
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.840]  want guns take their let's see what happens to her senator do you believe that Donald
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:19.680]  Trump in any way was inciting an act of violence against Clinton I do believe that Chris I
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.880]  was stunned when I saw it although he's done it before so two things first Hillary Clinton
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.600]  I believe in the second amendment we support the second amendment we do support gun safety
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:35.480]  rules consistent with the second amendment we're not taking people's guns away but second
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.120]  this notion that he's done before look if Hillary gets elected then maybe second amendment
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.400]  people will have to take care of the situation or his comment Friday night or his statements
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.800]  and rallies you know I'd like to punch the guy in the face he is using language that
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.720]  is an incitement to violence or an encouragement of violence or at least being kind of cavalier
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.280]  and reckless about violence and that has no place in any election especially an election
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.800]  to be president commander in chief of this country but to ask specifically because what
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:12.600]  you're saying is fairly stunning you believe it's incitement to violence against his opponent
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.400]  in the presidential race Hillary Clinton I do so exact I mean use the other example
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.720]  you put it in the context of other things he has said if Hillary gets elected we may
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.560]  need second amendment people to take care of this what what did that mean when he said
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.480]  that just three weeks ago and when you look at a series of these comments that he's making
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:40.680]  I do believe it is an incitement or at a minimum an expression of indifference to whether that's
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.360]  good I want to play the responses of Pence and Chrissy but but let's be clear I could
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.200]  take the Bible and cut out each word of it and write a whole new book that was a thousand
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.680]  pages long or whatever so he says you say you take other things he said and put it with
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.840]  that well no he was being clear with again pure Americana if we lose the second amendment
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.440]  in the courts the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights says it's our right to take
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.400]  it back with a second amendment he gave a mild version of what Heston said my cold dead
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:20.200]  hands they're acting like that's wrong that's evil but the dishonesty is to mix it all together
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.520]  and then to claim that that's what he was saying earlier no he's saying if you want
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.800]  to take our guns you give up your protection lady it's very simple a three-year-old should
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:36.080]  be able to understand it if I've got to give up my toy gun you've got to give up your toy
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.640]  gun you know a three-year-old would get that an adult would get if I'm gonna give up my
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.520]  real gun you want to give up your real gun just like iced tea said many years ago he said
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.080]  I'll give up my guns as soon as the government gives theirs up as soon as Hillary gets rid
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.040]  of her bodyguards he actually talked about the Clintons he said as soon as the politicians
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.520]  get rid of their stuff I will you don't it was iced tea threatening you no he said I'm
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:05.240]  just as good as you lady okay so let's go to Pence the VP candidate by the VP responds
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.880]  to Kane absolute nonsense here it is on Friday night Mr. Trump said something else that's
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.680]  gotten a lot of attention he said the Secret Service protecting Hillary Clinton should
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:23.000]  disarm and then he said let's see what happens to her no let's hit pause let's hit pause
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  I'm gonna skip the break I gotta respond to this ladies and gentlemen here's the total
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.480]  deception she cut off the part before in his statement which they always do or he said
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.200]  if they want to take our guns if they want to restrict our right to defend ourselves
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.600]  then let her disarm and get rid of her bodyguards that's clear just like it's really hard to
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.680]  get into America legally right now a lot of good people want to come here we need workers
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.000]  folks I hire a lot of great people we need to make it easier if you don't have a criminal
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.240]  record no you're not a felon not a rapist to come here to the country I'm gonna do that
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.720]  and if you're illegal you just go right back out you prove it come back in but if you're
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.640]  a felon a rapist a murderer a shooter there's a lot of bad people coming in a lot of bad
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.840]  folks Mexico's got big problems their criminals are coming up here then we're gonna deport
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:09.640]  you there are a lot of bad Mexicans we're gonna deport all of you that's how they edit
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.360]  they just like they've been doing all week oh yeah the bombs that went off yeah trumps
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.680]  bad for saying bombs cut off the first part about bombs they'll quit no she falls down
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:24.480]  all the time cut it out she hardly ever falls down so so let's start the clip back over
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.360]  because separate from just what pence is responding there's lessons everywhere about their deception
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:35.680]  this is ABC this week engaged in prostitute level behavior here it is he said the secret
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.360]  service protecting Hillary Clinton should disarm and then he said let's see what happens
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:48.720]  to her what do you mean by that well I think you know Donald Trump believes in the safety
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:55.600]  and security of every American and any suggestion otherwise regarding Secretary Clinton's just
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.040]  nonsense I mean the point that he was making is that Hillary Clinton's had private security
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.040]  now in her life for the last 30 years but she would deny the right of law abiding citizens
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.000]  to have a firearm in their home to protect their own families I think what Donald Trump
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.560]  was saying is if Hillary Clinton didn't have all that security she'd probably be a whole
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.080]  lot more supportive of the second amendment but but let's see what happens to her whether
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.240]  he intended that or not the message sounds a lot like a threat or encouraging it pause
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.160]  I'm so sick of the back of the five seconds these chicken-neck fake liberals help me because
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:35.480]  they teach him to like have fake emotion like a psychopath would do but what did he and
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.400]  I told you this a month ago I told you this two weeks ago and now I'm seeing the talking
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:44.000]  points they're getting everybody ready for a stage assassination attempt on that reanimated
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.200]  corpse it's Hillary folks we don't want anything to happen to Hillary everybody knows it they've
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:56.440]  already claimed in a bunch of newspaper articles yeah AOL associated press MSNBC that I want
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:03.360]  her to be hurt no I am I'm not a vindictive person but she's very evil she's killed a
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.600]  lot of Christians a lot of innocent people I kind of like watching her twist on the wind
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.960]  apparently kind of like she's in the stocks or those cages they'd hang you on at London
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.640]  Gates you know where you just sat there till you were a skeleton I don't want anybody to
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.840]  physically do that to her but she's doing it to herself running as an arrogant corpse
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.000]  with the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and others behind her you know with this flock
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:32.680]  of rotting crone media dinosaur zombie media just scabbering like a pack of zombies to
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:39.000]  defend their witch king so no we don't want any harm on Hillary but I'm telling you false
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:49.080]  flags the next how many days of election 49 48 days boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:54.640]  I mean this is history you can just the energy level is just I can't even handle it right
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:02.000]  now I'm so alive and you notice everything they do turns the total crap right now because
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  they're under judgment but if we don't stand up politically and spiritually and culturally
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.680]  and economically against them we're gonna go into judgment we're getting because of
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:15.880]  the incredible Providence America had our incredible ancestors we're getting passes
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:21.960]  nobody gets but I'm telling you if Trump gets in and we don't make a real effort to turn
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.480]  things around to actually try to really stop cultural Marxism and race baiting and divide
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.880]  and conquer and crime and corruption if we don't repent and really get right and really
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:39.400]  pay down the debt and really kick these foreign banks out and really make a major turn we're
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.280]  going to be destroyed within four years I predict it now I'm telling you God's giving
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.160]  us for I just feel it I know what I've been thinking about this I've been waking up all
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.280]  the night about I never had problems sleeping I'm waking up constantly I can't even sleep
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.000]  now folks I quit drinking coffee in the afternoon I haven't quit taking you know brain force
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.440]  the afternoon I don't need it I have too much energy now because of what's happening historically
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:07.880]  and I'm here to tell you Trump gets in he's got to start delivering we've got to back him
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.760]  because there's going to be problems there's going to be failures they're going to plunge
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.880]  the economy they're already planning it they've already got it set up to plunge it whether
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:18.000]  she wins or he wins it's all set up globally that's admitted now it's happening we have
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.720]  to grow up be adults realize the attack or under I go back to Russia Russia's economy
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:28.160]  finally after 1415 years was doing good after the fall communism whether it was a fake fall
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.120]  or real fall people embrace it it was getting a lot better I saw the metrics then they've
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.760]  been under sanctions five years it's gotten really bad again the Russians though have
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.960]  gotten more patriotic and know what's happening just like the UK going under Briggs it they're
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.480]  now going to try to bankrupt them as well with economic warfare the bankers are the people
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.120]  have to identify it they have to pull out of it further they have to disregard the EU
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.200]  just like Iceland did or you'll go to the route of Greece but you want to fight you
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.680]  want to be free folks you don't want to be in bondage with the TV I saw a TV ad this
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:07.280]  morning on Fox almost every ad I see I saw a FedEx ad that was anti-hunting where they're
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.320]  sending this you know clown mask or or Groucho March mask to New Zealand and then they go
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.000]  to these right-wing hick idiots that are hunting deer but the deer are wearing the mask they
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  don't get killed by the evil hunters it's just everything's propaganda and it's not
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.280]  that hunting is God it's that that's normal human behavior like farming or ranching or
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.080]  gardening or sowing or barter or doing electrical work or doing machine work I was talking to
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.960]  Jesse James about this like six months ago he's been demonized he's not the guy they
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.000]  say is the media and I was talking to he's a good friend I was talking to a bunch of
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.080]  Tim Kennedy and others we're just all talking about we've got to get men back to being metal
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.440]  urges and women too we've got to get back to making our own things it's like it clicks
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:55.000]  things on in your body and the more manly somebody is the more traveled they are the
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.280]  more they've done things they realize that everything clicks on like a light switch when
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.360]  you go in the woods when you take a swim in the river when you hike up the mountain when
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:11.360]  you plant the vegetables when you harvest them when you cook them when you stand up
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.880]  to a tyrant when you do the right thing when you care about people when you're not a cool
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.200]  person I'm not a cool person I don't act cool I'm not waiting to have the right answer
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:28.440]  and act like I'm slick I'm hot I'm on fire I'm unscripted I'm alive and my only fear
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.160]  is the enemy has their way with us and I love how pinched is because that's ridiculous he's
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.440]  saying how would she act if she didn't have bodyguards and the snake goes yeah but she
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.280]  realizes she's losing so if you are TV or you can see it she just yeah how about this
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.620]  their whole system is about the weak and the twisted ruling the righteous let's go back
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:54.160]  to her whether he intended that or not the message sounds a lot like a threat or encouraging
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.600]  violence that's absolute nonsense his comment was that if she didn't have all that security
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.760]  she'd change her attitude about the right to keep her bare arms and I'll bet that's
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.720]  probably true and then she goes on and goes yeah now let's go to the next clip this is
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.800]  Chris Christie I've got problems with but he is smart he is a great speaker he can make
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.360]  great points when he wants to my problem is he flip-flops a lot and I pray Donald Trump
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.400]  isn't a big Chris Christie because let me tell you I lay it wake at night hoping I've
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.440]  done the right thing and I know I have I know he's for real I know the enemy's upset about
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:31.560]  him but still we're the ones that are gonna back Trump so he doesn't get pushed into
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.520]  a corner and have to start compromising but the stronger we get the stronger Trump gets
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:42.000]  understand that Trump is a figurehead like a like we're a Roman Legion like an like an
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.720]  eagle you understand that let's continue with the next clip you just heard Senator Cain
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:55.640]  say Trump was inciting an act of violence against Hillary Clinton your reaction sir
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.240]  man I tell you something boy when a race gets tight even a guy like Tim Cain gets desperate
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:07.680]  I mean to imply he said that that was to incite violence is outrageous and he owes Donald
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.440]  Trump an apology Donald Trump was trying to make a point about Hillary Clinton wanting
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.560]  to have one set of rules for herself and a different set of rules for the American people
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.000]  and that's what his point is on the second amendment but Senator Cain should be ashamed
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.480]  of himself for saying that Donald Trump would like to have violence perpetrated against
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.720]  Hillary Clinton it's an outrageous statement but just shows how desperate and scared the
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.520]  Clinton Cain campaign is now because this race is now a dead heat and they can't believe
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.400]  it and they're going to get even worse news as we move forward here because Donald's going
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.280]  to continue to do even better that's right and that's the big question I want to ask
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.840]  listeners when we come back after break eight hundred two five nine nine two three one this
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.800]  is a specific question I want you to call in on if you're not calling on this please don't
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:28:00.560]  call eight hundred two five nine nine two three one I want to ask callers what are they going
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.040]  to pull next because she's ten fifteen points ahead in non battleground states that are Republican
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.600]  maybe twenty and some he's like five seven eight ten twelve points ahead in battlegrounds
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:18.480]  I mean all I do study this okay and he's set to win some Democrat states watch watch watch
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.280]  the landslide will be so massive that they won't be able to cover it up he's going to
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.280]  win Democrat states folks I told you a month and a half ago when it was he's done he's
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.440]  plunging it's over I said people he was fifteen points ahead in many polls ten points ahead
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.560]  in the others this is total made up crap and people figured it out and Hillary collapsed
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.680]  and all this other stuff happened it's provenance but going out to break I'm going to come back
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.200]  and take your calls on the subject eight hundred two five nine nine two three one I'm not going
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.160]  to have her answer just pure bull already played last hour but here is Bloomberg asking her
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:29:02.320]  about Trump with the Russians behind the attack here it is are you concerned that this weekend's
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.840]  attacks or potential incidents in the coming weeks might be an attempt by ISIS or ISIS
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.280]  sympathizers or really any other group maybe the Russians to influence the presidential
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.040]  race corruptions all right that's enough we try to drive and there's a full article in
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.400]  the full videos up on info or so comment she goes on to say oh yeah not me the Russians
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.880]  you know or oh Trump's inciting ISIS and al-qaeda to launch this terror attack I thought it wasn't
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:33.840]  a terror attack I thought it wasn't a bombing now this guy's father admits Ahmed Khan Rahimi's
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:40.320]  father told police in 2014 his son was a terrorist they did nothing and people blame the FBI they

[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.960]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:26.720]  it's the time of the season when love runs high in this time give it to me easy
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  and let me there has been a metaphysical law that all cultures going back to the beginning of
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:45.200]  the first clay tablets that were carved the first hieroglyphics and other human languages from the
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:51.760]  beginning of language on our first writings humans have had a metaphysical rule that for every
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:59.760]  action there's an opposite and equal reaction and that when evil rises good rises to meet it
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:07.280]  and so there's this paradox the more evil they hit us with almost like pesticides on bugs
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:14.560]  the stronger the poison the faster the bugs become immune to it and actually in many cases you
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:22.480]  know mutate to even be stronger and the globalists understand this rule but they don't seem to understand
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:31.360]  that in the paradox for my own study just observing it those that are evil and that are openly directing
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:39.360]  it the blowback is even stronger than what they hit us with the bible says you know the pit they've
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:49.360]  dug for us they will fall into but it's happening and so that's why they claim that they manage
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.480]  crises and create chaos to rule it because the truth is they can't create anything they just
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:03.120]  wreck stuff and then declare that they're the authors of it very important to understand the
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:21.600]  New World Order's mindset now let's get into the news here first off i guess it is our best-selling
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.720]  survival shield nascent iodine x2 but that's so inexpensive we don't really make any money to fund
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.480]  the operation our most profitable product is super minimal vitality because we actually you know make
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.720]  like 20 something bucks on it which is absolutely needed to fund this operation but it's still unheard
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:42.800]  of to put that much money into a product cold pressed herbs where they don't get dry herbs make
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:49.120]  them wet and then cold press them they we get the fresh herbs more than 20 of them that are known to
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:57.760]  increase stamina libido you name it and then it's cold pressed and then it's basically
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.040]  fermented for a short period of time it just gets better over time group told me this like five
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.680]  years ago we started doing this and i learned it was actually totally true you know i was amazed
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.560]  because i've got some of the first batches of mobility it just gets stronger and it just it
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:21.760]  it just concentrates it's concentrated basically essential oil from plants and not even plants
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.080]  that are normally seen as oil bearing plant plants i mean i call it oil because it's so thick
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.720]  and it's got a unique flavor to it because i mean it's it's the real deal and i've talked a lot
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.560]  about this i didn't start taking it for libido i don't really have a problem in that department
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:45.680]  but let me tell you something i'm 42 about to be 43 but a few years ago i finally went for
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.040]  a 40 to check up my mom's like you gotta go to the doctor you know the doctor in decades
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.000]  you know for check up will you please go to the doctor and i said okay i'll go to the doctor and
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.120]  actually out the lake with the kids at the picnic and she watched me swim across the lake one mile
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.360]  and back and told me get out and i was somewhat overweight she said son don't get out you're
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.840]  not losing weight and you're working out and all this you just swam two miles she was a ut master
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:15.760]  swimmer herself won gold medals nationally a little bit olympic if she got into it she's
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.400]  getting into it was like 35 but i digress i was a good swimmer too and she watched me swim she said
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.760]  you go to the doctor so i go to the doctor i have my blood tests and all this other stuff
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.720]  overall i'm pretty darn healthy my blood was told the story a lot so i should shut up but
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.400]  borderline borderline diabetic not not borderline diabetic but getting into the borderline
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.960]  where it would soon be borderline it was going in the wrong direction and i went to the doctor
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:46.880]  had all my blood tested you know like i uh after that by another doctor i um looked into it all
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.440]  i started taking vitamin b12 injections but really the big game changer i don't even take
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:38:00.560]  those anymore was when i started taking supermobility every day and i work out less now than i did
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:07.040]  three four years ago and i've still had to be some beach boy but with my shirt off and wearing shorts
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.440]  folks can see that uh you know i'm in pretty darn good shape compared to what i was just three
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.520]  four years ago we can show for tv viewers the video and we also have the video posted on info
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:24.960]  wars life dot com by the supermobility where you can see that i've lost 70 pounds of fat
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.400]  yes folks i weighed 180 pounds was running six miles almost every day lifting weights when i
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  started info wars 21 years ago and then i quit working out in a couple years and gained almost
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:40.080]  100 pounds well i've gained 70 pounds of fat gained like 30 pounds of muscle and i am a new
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.840]  person today and i'm telling you i'm actually ashamed of it i was just saying i work out
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.520]  i started trying to lose weight like six years ago and i lost like 20 30 pounds took some supplements
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.960]  it helped but it i was jogging i was swimming i was lifting it was ridiculous and now taking
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:03.200]  the iodine taking the supermobility taking the dna force and stuff it's it's spoiling me where i
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.440]  have i mean really good shape especially like i said i'm wearing shorts i look like a gorilla

[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.080]  gained like 10 pounds back when i didn't work out for a few weeks but i've almost lost all that
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.440]  again the six pack is reforming and it's just like my god i look like a gorilla and i'm working
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.400]  out like three days a week instead of five days a week killing myself i mean i did some five mile
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:36.160]  swims and i would get out of the water all red and be like three four pounds lighter but we come
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.120]  back to the next day so whatever happened in my metabolic systems i don't know but supermobility

[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.880]  health care provider before you take it um the biggest thing everybody knows is is like i said
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.800]  the same um medical doctor said hey you're 40 you want some sialice you want some viagra you want
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.840]  to try it and i said sure i'll take a prescription i mean i never went to doctors i didn't know they
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.960]  were just you know you'll be in prescriptions sialice a little bit of an effect viagra just
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.760]  made me like like i said like kind of be dizzy and like kind of see blue i was like people take
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:24.000]  this stuff so i'm not bashing viagra and sialice i don't need it supermobility
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.960]  10 times the effect of sialice is what i experienced personally i mean i don't even
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.080]  really quite frankly need it in fact quite frankly a lot of days i don't take it now
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.880]  because i don't want to feel like i'm about to you know climb a mountain or tear somebody's head off
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:46.480]  but that's what god offers us with plants from the rainforest and things versus what
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.240]  the establishment's pushing i'm done i didn't mean to do an eight minute you know or five
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.840]  six a minute plug but i started thinking about it i'm like wow this really did change my life and
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.000]  i was just telling pat riley who i work out with a couple days a week and i'm developing
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.520]  some products with him because he's a he's a developer himself i was like man i'll work out
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.520]  like i did four years ago five years ago i'd be in incredible shape this stuff has made me lazy
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.440]  it really has because i'm looking at myself in this photo i'm like how do i look like that
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.760]  when i was working out three times harder five years ago because it's what was going on inside
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.360]  my body period all right i'm done talking about it it is your purchase that supports the broadcast
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.840]  now we also have a new free app we have a new app in five six years we only've had one app before
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.040]  that's free it's a great little audio app has a news feed on it but this is for droids it's for
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.840]  apples you go to info wars.com forward slash app to find links to the apple store on the google play
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:46.640]  it is free as in f-r-e-e and it's made to spread the word listen i'm gonna explain this and i'm
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:51.280]  gonna get back to these clips and then your phone calls they've done everything they can to keep us
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.000]  off tv everything they can to keep us off radio it doesn't matter how many radio stations i've been
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.560]  on where i get better ratings than the top rated shows we all know who that is rush limbaugh i'm
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.520]  not against limbaugh it's just a fact i've beat him in more than 12 cities i know of with huge i mean
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:12.960]  like 5 000 watt stations beating 50 000 waters within a year and then proverbially uh like clockwork
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.280]  a sports channel comes in pays three four times what it's even worth to kick me off and put me on
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.920]  fact the joke began in the industry is you put alex jones off for six months every year there's a
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.120]  little secret of the two affiliates out there a lot of them learned it then when those people drop
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:30.960]  off they bring us back they apologize i talked to you it's totally fine i don't you know i'm not
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.200]  gonna get you in trouble you can try it's not illegal what you're doing i get it you put me on
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.360]  you get top ratings they want to get me off the air and you know a hospital district comes in and
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.880]  finances some talk show host uh you know or the feds come in and finance a talk show host or
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.600]  you know uh espians normally the one nine times out of ten that takes me off the air and they come
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.320]  in and then they kick alex jones off and every other libertarian and conservative there is so
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:02.000]  the point is if you want to fight stuff like this spread the word while we're on these stations
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.880]  obviously but understand this app isn't just for you to see the video feed or the audio feeds
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.120]  or the podcast links or the updates and the news alerts and all the stuff we're gonna add
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:19.440]  videos i do daily that are live and archived only for you on the app that's coming in a few months
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.400]  we've already got it set up but i'm setting the studio up at my house you name it i'm hiring people
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.520]  to follow me around and show up at night and show up like clockwork you know it's six a.m i'm gonna get
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.680]  up out of bed like reality tv i mean you're gonna have me getting out of bed you're gonna have me
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.800]  just hit fighting the globals from the moment i wake up jump out underwear whole nine yards go and
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.120]  get in the shower come out of the shower you're gonna be eating eggs the whole nine yards i mean
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.080]  it's it's coming down okay that's what you want you get it okay pure warfare everything i'm doing
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:55.040]  what's happening total transparency it's the info wars live app it's free but what you need to do is

[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.600]  how you break the mainstream media with with choice with free will everything the globalists do is
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.560]  about shutting down your free will shutting down free market shutting down this economy of ideas
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.280]  the clinton's back in the early 90s it's come out in you know lawsuits in their clinton library
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.200]  foundation a separate foundation from the global initiative or their other clinton foundation their
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.640]  first foundation they said we can't allow a free and independent press in this country not just for
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:34.240]  right wingers but left us as well here's how we're going to do it we've got to attack their funding
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:38.560]  not let them ever have sponsors not let them sell books or videos not let them get a foothold or
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.480]  if they do it's over for us call them conspiracy theorists then the cia is in there advising
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:50.080]  them on how to do this we have you now and we have paid for you it's inside the system watching you
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:55.360]  who are aware of what's happening who are going to continue to sabotage you because you're the foreign

[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:45.680]  is that it's a big thing you are the power i don't sit here and say you're the power you're the
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.080]  resistance to make you feel big and important because you know other talk show hosts don't do

[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.080]  let me tell you i leave it all in the field here history is happening right now and you know it is
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.080]  and if i'm one thing know this i'm genuine ladies and gentlemen what you're seeing is real
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.800]  i believe the things i'm saying i know the things i'm saying i noticed the enemy my whole life on
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.920]  air more than half my life on air now i've been more than half my life on air has always been
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.760]  that i'm a fake and i'm not genuine because the enemy is fake and they cannot stand the fact that i
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:06.240]  am genuine quite frankly i'm ashamed of some of the things i'm genuine in all i gotta do is point
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.680]  my heart at god and everything else happens and that's all you've got to do and you already know
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.320]  that i'm not telling you things you don't already know but the enemy all day tells you things to
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:20.000]  counter man reality so you feel like you're alone so you don't follow your spirit that god gave you
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:26.240]  i can't skip every break today i've got to play this break for the network at all
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.480]  i might just end up doing a show three hours a day with no ads i'm really thinking about it just
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.080]  doing my own show i'm breaking off i've been doing this 19 years here but uh i've told them
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.960]  i'm a ticket serious it's like because i'm just like the stalwart guy that's always there always
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:52.240]  loyal always you know like i but you know the thing is next hour i will after i take this
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.240]  this group of calls i'll get to uh the the next round of clubs they're very very important
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:03.360]  i went long on that plug it wasn't really a plug it was mainly orant um with this with this war
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:09.040]  on narratives again they create these fake things like transgender bathrooms i'm not against transgender
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.880]  point is they create it to become the you know what's your gross national product uh it's trannies
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:20.800]  it just becomes some weird grand faloon that was a term that a great patriot wrote about
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.520]  where people just make up these weird things to celebrate and to be their own little crazy club
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:33.680]  Kurt Vonnegut who the left will be horrified to hear was a big listener but he was ashamed of
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:36.640]  his mind before he died and didn't think he'd do a good job on air so he wouldn't come on
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.360]  what a bummer man i want to get Clint Eastwood on not because i carry his Hollywood star because
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:48.080]  i really like him before he you know dies it's just like oh i'm old i'm not gonna come on you know

[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.240]  i mean donald trump is bad because he said it's a bombing and the hillary's saying it's a bombing
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.640]  and then the media today is like he's been discredited he said bombing before it was admitted
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:52.800]  it's like he won the world series he's just babe ruth discredited as a baseball player
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.400]  michael george is discredited as a basketball player because he made all the hoops i want to
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.560]  go to angelo in georgia and duane in canada and uncle sam in louisiana uh michael in washington
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:13.680]  and the canadian soldier in canada if you just tuned in what is hillary and the globalist who
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:20.480]  we have their internal emails from everywhere rnc dnc chinese communists white house bohemian grove
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.120]  they legitimately hate donald trump they legitimately are running the country robbing it
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.760]  they see him as coming in to stop the destruction of america this could happen we could defeat them
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.760]  that means we'll be in some heaven but at least folks aren't out to get us and make us poor because
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:38.080]  that makes us controllable we have a managed monopoly economy with a bunch of criminals running
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:42.320]  it they're scared of going to jail of trump gets in they're a rat who's cornered because they
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:47.440]  know they've committed crimes what are they going to do angelo in georgia thanks for calling
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.240]  hey yeah so i know my time's limited here but the first thing that i can almost guarantee you
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.720]  will do undoubtedly will be to double down whatever they're doing they'll double down on it they'll
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.960]  try to make it look like they're they're right everyone else is wrong and they'll keep going
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.640]  until it runs into a brick wall the other thing i'm pretty much certain having dealt with uh a lot
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.280]  of this mindset over the last couple of years it's been a little bit rampant will be that
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:21.200]  they'll try to push it is the norm for it seems that trump's words and ideals to be those of what
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.760]  they keep trying to say is hatred they'll try to push push that to be the norm you can see a lot of
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.600]  that and a lot of international things right now i think it was someone in germany said that it was
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:36.960]  in a recent magazine that they were asking about the u.s presidential election and you i think it
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:42.800]  was in sweden wasn't it that um they had the recent commercial about the immigrants and it's
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.120]  everyone a government funded government funded commercial saying it's bad to be swedish you
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.800]  need to accept islam and waraburka and this is the new uh you know this is the new sweden right
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:59.760]  right so it looks like to me the next big hit if i'm i'm no expert but if you were to take my word
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:04.960]  on it it looks like next big hill be an international movement to try to discredit trump well you
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:12.480]  know it's funny you say that because uh mono um of you too bono has come out total fake leftist
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:19.120]  caught making you download his songs and charging you on itunes spotify you name it i mean i mean
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.080]  every time i open up a spotify it's this guy forcing me to listen to his music uh he's a guy that keeps
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.240]  98.8 percent of the money he gets from charity for africans you name it that's his favorite oh he
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:36.560]  loves black people meanwhile it's come out hillary only gives five percent of the money she gets for
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:43.280]  charity this monster says that trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america can
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.480]  you imagine if trump ran huge charities and put on concerts and then was paid billions of dollars
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:55.920]  and kept 98.8 percent hillary gives just 5.7 percent of foundation budget actually went to
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:02.960]  charitable grants i mean this is insane she makes 91 million plus and then gives five million
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:09.760]  but it's okay because she's a woman i you know it's like she could commit axe murders and it's
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:13.840]  okay because she's a woman so yes the international attack is intensifying they're talking about a
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:19.520]  worldwide financial meltdown the next month that's the inside scoop what do you think i think that's
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.040]  uh that's where they're trying to push it towards i don't know if they'll be able to complete it in
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.480]  time but they're definitely moving towards it but there's another flank they're trying to
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.520]  attack on which they're already working on i believe paul uh joseph blotkin has an am a later
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:36.240]  actually i'm one of the sources of the internet flank hold on i'm coming back to your red collar

[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:49.840]  still 100 markup we got to find the operation we need more funds quite frankly but i just can't get
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:55.120]  you know the average industry is five to seven times markup i i mean it's it's it's a joke i will
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.680]  not do that but i mean i'm being honest with folks with our quote business model is how we want to
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.480]  be treated i'm very honest about it in fact i feel guilty if i don't just tell everybody what i'm
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:10.800]  doing and how i think about it because i'm always trying to really be the best person i can because
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:17.040]  i understand that i want to be treated like i want to be treated i treat people like i want to be
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.240]  treated but but thank you for the plug the products they've changed my life and now that i
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:26.640]  religiously take them every day because i've never been a pill guy i knew our biggest sponsors were
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:31.600]  nutraceuticals i knew they helped people i knew supplements were big and i said but the sponsors
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.320]  aren't getting it funded to expand why don't i just put it out make a bigger profit make sure the
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.120]  quality is great uh and people say well wait a minute they got bigger markups how's the bigger
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.360]  profit well now i cut the middleman out that's how we do that to be able to expand and so it
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:51.600]  all really turned out great but i had no idea i thought supplements just helped you i didn't
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:57.120]  know it changed my life but sorry go ahead those supplements i bought from gmc they don't work
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:02.560]  let me tell you something yours i'm able to do a two-man fire team alone
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:12.080]  well from 100 meters on sprint like running without crutches wow and i'm missing along as well
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.160]  and like your lung cleanse it helps well i'll be honest i don't like to defend hillary i don't
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.880]  like to defend hillary because we know from the secret service she's falling down and really
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.760]  sick i mean she really is sick the mold because all this rain really is bad i mean i cough a lot
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.520]  i get a cough like that sometimes and right here i've been doing this three or four times a day
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.000]  to not hack on air at lung cleanse and all it is is essential oils but anyways i'm gonna stop
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.040]  plugging the point is you absolutely start go ahead no i mean your lung cleanse helps me because
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:48.320]  i only got one lung i lost the lung in 2013 wow but anyhow like i said the whole point i was trying
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:53.520]  to make they make is last my last time i talked to you was false flags blamed on russia
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:57.360]  right yes sir and look what happened
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:08.240]  they bombed a syrian position right yes and they did it by mistake russia knows what they're doing
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.960]  for folks that don't know because our media is not covering it 80 plus syrian soldiers were killed
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:19.280]  in a key isis al nazar offensive and the russian generals we have a clip of it actually i'll play
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.600]  it in a moment since you brought it up coming out and saying look the us is violating the ceasefire
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:27.440]  they mean obama our military is working with the russians that's on record the russians know that
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:32.320]  by the way and you you you are helping isis advance go ahead and i remember you called a
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:37.680]  wall back you did predict that yeah like i remember i told you in 1989 we disobeyed an order to start
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:43.520]  world war three with russia i remember you were there in pristina there in southern kosovo pristina
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.240]  report yeah yeah they're in the middle of kosovo southern syria exactly i mean you know this is
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.760]  when the antennas are still coming in taking equipment out before it was handed over to nato
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:00.320]  right because they had hines and uh hip helicopters and i told you about the two ptr 80s blocking the
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.960]  road yes yeah anyhow ever since the two there's classified piece of equipment i'm gonna tell you
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:14.800]  the name of it i shot down the f117 uh nighthawk the two s6 tunguska ever since that happened
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.000]  and i saw the clearance in sofia in november they looked down on people like their scum
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:29.360]  i i was there at their at their rally i remember supposedly the serbs shot down a self fighter
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:36.240]  was it really the russians the two s6 shot it down the tunguska what is that weapon tell us about
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:42.160]  the tunguska it's got eight air defense missiles and four 30 millimeter cannons two per sight
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.600]  and it's on a tank chassis it can spoof its uh radar signature to an older system
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:55.600]  so when the harm missile comes it goes to the wrong target meanwhile it takes out what it wants
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.920]  that was classified i just let it out because you know what they're blaming rush it for everything
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:07.360]  people may as well know the truth what happened they tested they tested it it worked
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.600]  that's why they wanted us to start over russia because russia was weak at the time
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:18.320]  and now they're trying to push a russian narrative again yeah what do you make of hillary agreeing
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:23.680]  that russia might be behind the bombing uh while covering up for the islamists russia is going to
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:32.800]  be in what pulled into it ever since pete like clinton hates pewton why clinton is the globalist
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:40.560]  she's a solo he's a christian and a nationalist and pewton is the only one that's left of the free world
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:48.240]  and we did right regardless of this are big orders or not at the airport
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:53.520]  because the world would be different if you will well they admit general jackson after you guys
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.840]  refused to the right thing and said no even though others in the u.s were ordering an attack that
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.760]  would have started a war with russia because the word is the russians were ready to respond
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.920]  yes they were they were the important weapons and i said we did them i mean for 45 seconds we
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:13.040]  were pointing weapons at each other and then as soon as over the vulture press asked what happened
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:18.800]  to what happened now all we asked was you know who won the hockey game last night because you know
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.080]  well i don't i don't give it to me it's just so insane to blame an islamic state attack
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.640]  which is taking credit in new york and new jersey on russia and to hillary to go along with it i mean
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.080]  to have bloomberg blaming russia this is a new level of bs i told like i warned you that this is
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.600]  going to happen is they're going to blame russia no no you called about two weeks ago and say get
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:42.320]  ready for a false flag to blame terror attacks on russia i didn't roll my eyes i just thought
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:48.960]  i think i said that's a stretch uh canadian soldier but it happened i told you they have
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:55.280]  one clinton has a grudge they keep it i believe me i've experienced uh i've experienced her grudges
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:01.280]  i know what you're talking about scale i'm alert so i have to know my enemy to defeat my enemy
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.640]  well great points canadian soldier if you want to give us your number i'd love to get you on
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:08.000]  as a guest officially i'll get you in trouble and stuff but you're really a great caller
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.680]  so give us your info if you want if not god bless you and by the way do we get your address
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.640]  a few weeks ago and send you that product i want to send you some some of the product
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:21.840]  and uh my brother joe well put him on hold make sure that happened john harman thank you gosh it's
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:28.640]  hard to cut off colors like that we got so many it's really amazing actually see i trust but verify
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:35.120]  i actually remember it was guessed that the russians had a artillery fired missile most artillery now
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:41.440]  is missiles most artillery now is guided the shell goes out and little fins come out and somebody
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:46.320]  was showing me some classified footage one of those 20 miles shooting us around through a window
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:53.200]  they've got like even medium-sized uh field guns now that are basically missile launchers
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:59.120]  but imagine the russians have got them that'll uh perfect how they use modern radar the russians
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:02.480]  just went back to old radar in fact i'd read that separate from the list from the caller
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:07.360]  they went back to old radar and then basically i'm not an engineer but they flux it they like
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:12.000]  send out a bunch of different radar scrambled and then somehow doesn't matter the way that
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  signature is done for modern radar well who wouldn't have thought the russians would just go back to
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:23.200]  old radar see and that's what happens in wars no matter how sophisticated the globalist are
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.360]  whatever they come up with is going to be countermanded as soon as we figure out we're in a war
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:32.400]  that's why they never want us to know we're in a war the muslims aren't attacking they love you
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.880]  they love you i'm going to skip this break to go to more calls uh let's go to jeffrey and california
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:40.880]  then we'll go to de wayne uncle sam michael and others thank you canadian soldier jeffrey you're
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:47.200]  on the air oh thank you for taking my call alex i'm i'm uh honored to be on here i know you're
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:54.320]  honored to be on here too um one one thing i want to say before i make my point on what hillary's
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.280]  going to do here which we already know we can just go to a website and see there she's redoing her
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:07.680]  little uh tax system thing and you know she it's like almost she's she's listening or somebody's
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:12.160]  listening to the trump speech in north carolina and automatically you could see how she's going
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:18.080]  to reform the immigration system and how they're going to keep the homeland safe you know and yeah
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.880]  that's right she's actually more like a nationalist now on the surface is totally fake she's like i
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:31.360]  don't want your guns that's ridiculous right and and the more she lies the more the lies come out
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.720]  the more i see the people around me here in southern california especially the uh the
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:42.960]  latino males 18 to 40 i see them they they're coming around they're talking to me more i'm i'm
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:49.920]  not i'm not by the way national polls show that uh hispanic males latino males are flipping
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:53.840]  and people say this because they don't want to be bossed around by hillary because it's no they're
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:59.040]  playing it like it's sexist no hillary clearly is dangerous is going to kill prosperity and the
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:04.320]  average man i don't care what color you are deep down knows hillary is out to get us okay she doesn't
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:10.320]  like men and she doesn't want to empower women either she wants a big stagnant north korea she
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:17.120]  rules over and i'll tell you what i see is it's not just a macho thing it's also to the family thing
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:22.720]  and that's that's what trump he needs to hammer in on that because this whole uh dcfs or cps or
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:27.360]  whatever they call it in and whatever part of the world you're in you know this comes from it takes
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:32.480]  a village it's it's her old agenda so janet renault and all of those those those witches they got
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:37.040]  together and they say well this is how we're going to indoctrinate your children well it's in southern
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:45.040]  california the latino families or the hispanic whatever term you uh like to use it's it's sure
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:49.200]  i don't want to kiss the ass of hispanics in general but on average hispanics like where
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:54.560]  they come from but the us or latin america wherever take vaccines the less don't trust the
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:01.280]  government uh get don't pay the taxes they know it's all fraud anyways uh and and and know what's
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:07.280]  going on and don't tattle on their families the cps on average individuals may not be bad
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.720]  but it's admitted a eugenics program by by uh clinton is when they put these these quotas in
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:16.560]  there's a lot of good social workers that help old folks you name it they took a good thing
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:22.080]  and turned it into a deal where they'll take kids from a good family but then meanwhile if a kid is
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:27.440]  like in a crib never having his diapers changed they'll leave it with the bad people because
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:33.040]  there's an adoption racket going on in many cases it's not in every area to basically take healthy
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:38.800]  kids and adopt them out for half a million dollars that's where the real racket is and so absolutely
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:44.080]  uh i've always pointed out when i've covered these cases people try to take hispanic families kids
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:48.240]  they just leave you know they don't sit there and have their kid taken i'm like there's there
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:53.120]  there's common sense in a life force you know and and again it's a complex system with the courts
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:58.320]  some courts are good some are bad our families are collapsing societies in crisis just like i
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:04.160]  don't want to blame that the the tsa i blame ourselves in congress for letting this happen
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:08.400]  but they still it's a big joke our borders are open they're bringing in the muslims the radicals
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.680]  but we search everybody you know at the tsa it's all about trainings but but you're absolutely right
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:20.960]  and and that's what all the polls show listen they freaked out in nevada and other states when they did
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:27.920]  polls of the voters it was like four or five states and we're talking out of like six seven
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:33.120]  eight nine candidates depending on who was in at the time trump was getting 35 to 60 percent of the
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:39.600]  votes in a field of a whole bunch of people by hispanic males and then they did demographic
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.640]  studies uh with hispanic males across the board they've got the numbers out in politico today
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:51.680]  it's huge listen we've got numbers of 20 percent of black males set to vote for trump 16 of black
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:57.600]  females black females vote 95 percent in almost every election of the democratic party since the
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:06.960]  1960s so this is huge i mean people are really but listen if trump becomes the same old plantation
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:10.640]  that the republicans and democrats have been it's a disaster and i will turn against him
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:16.880]  but if we just try and do some good and reverse a little bit and have some prosperity which we can
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:22.640]  do it'll turn the tide it's it's an amazing time but trump has to continue to route the republican
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:28.880]  establishment let me tell you they are the slimyest filthiest people just like the democrats they
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:35.200]  get off on that they don't have stuff works and you don't we're here to show the hat trick uh jeffrey
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:40.640]  we're here to show everybody how it really works because i respect everybody i respect people that
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:44.560]  they should know how stuff works i don't want to hold knowledge back and screw somebody over
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:48.080]  i'm not somebody that sits there when a little kid walks by and i kick their legs out from under
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:53.680]  them i want to see everybody grow and be their full potential but i don't want people organizing
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:24:00.400]  the groups to suppress my potential so that's a two-way street go ahead the the truth the neocon
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:08.080]  system that the two-party paradigm he comes out of that that's why that's why he gets so much
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:12.000]  support in this part of the world and when he came out here and i looked him in his eyes the man's
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.640]  telling the truth he wants to leave a legacy that's a good thing that he's getting old because he
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.760]  wants to leave i'll just say this the private conversations i've had with trump are unbelievable
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:28.640]  so i'm gonna leave it at that but unbelievable how knowledge he is i always trump trump knows
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:33.040]  they've done the population down he's brought the knowledge level up some but he's right they
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.400]  twist what he says if he gets sophisticated but the real donald trump is a genius and the fact
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:44.640]  that he has played possum for decades against the globalist that's why they're panicking they know
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:51.040]  he's way smarter than them and he doesn't have an instinct to screw little people but that's why
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.880]  they're panicking they're like the little people are our food trump he's like no they're not there
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:03.280]  our future you suck get out of the way because the truth is trump is blue collar at the end of the
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:09.360]  day sorry go ahead i i want to let you know alex when you did the jade helm thing and you and you
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:15.440]  and you uh you saw how we got a we got a little little slither down here in southern california
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:22.080]  of resistance and you said that that were some kind of uh drug lord from mexico or something
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:27.520]  that's not true you came here just like trump we looked you in the eye we're holding it down out here
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.080]  and i'm not saying that you know we're going to start some kind of war or something but let me
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:36.240]  tell you buddy we're rock and roll ready to go and the number one thing we're doing we're out
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.560]  at the polls and we're making sure everything's going on absolutely i want to be clear when i was
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:45.120]  looking at jade helm map of like why do they say texas in utahs under california i was just saying
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:50.800]  why are they saying marshal law for that area to drill uh when southern i said maybe a drug war
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:54.240]  or something i wasn't saying as much as drug dealers in southern california it's it's everybody
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.080]  that's one of the most popular areas of the country it's literally everybody it's a full spectrum
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:05.920]  thank you for the call jeffrey great points what i was getting at is jade helm said they're
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:10.800]  training for marshal law in america i've talked to the special forces people who were involved
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:16.000]  they said no it's really alex flipped the map sideways it's the middle east in california
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.240]  is basically syria but then i was like oh my god you know yeah it's a joint training exercise
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.480]  was that like back of the head but then no but you're right that it's dual training to condition
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:33.520]  the public and us for domestic operations and we were trained to take over local governmental
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.360]  buildings and things like that but don't think we don't know in the briefing special forces was told
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:47.760]  this is all marshal law training and we know it so screw them but i was never saying the
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:51.520]  military was going to take over in july so i said back to the other people like four or five
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:56.400]  millions of people i said well you're kind of buying propaganda because joe biggs and i never
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  said it was going to be marshal law we were simply saying it's training oh you're absolutely right
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.880]  true so again we all just deal with the distortions and not that all of us have the answers either it's
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:11.760]  just that nine times out of ten when i deal with an attack it's not what i said they edit video people
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.840]  you just heard abc news if you tuned in last hour going donald trump said let's take this
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:24.800]  protection away from hillary and see what happens sounds like he wanted to have her killed he said
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.520]  the american people don't have bodyguards we can't afford all this taxpayer paid protection
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:33.600]  so if she wants to take our guns our protection away let her take her guns away and see how what
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:39.680]  happens but that's what they do constantly and once you're aware of it and take the time to go
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.000]  see the full club go find the full clip of what trump said and then see if you disagree with it
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.800]  and i'm going to say this right now i watched snowden two hours long the whole thing was super
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.800]  accurate i can't believe they got that movie out i'm really proud of oliver stone who i've been
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:28:00.000]  critical of sometimes in the past very impressive okay and and scottie's wood and all of it i mean
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:07.600]  it's amazing it's a tour de force but the one deceptive part was acting like he became a liberal
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:11.520]  no he was always a libertarian he never supported musch he just didn't support the democrats either
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:15.360]  and the other big thing is if you see the movie snowden
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:21.920]  it you know it kind of implies like american patriots think they're doing all this to protect
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:27.760]  america no they're globalists that are using it to hijack the country and so that's the rest of the
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:35.440]  story with a movie like snowden but i don't sit here in two-door horn i sit here and i mean reality
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:41.840]  based to tell people i told you with nsa whistleblowers wane madson james bamford and a bunch of others
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:51.040]  19 years ago 18 years ago 17 years ago and i had no idea what i was involved in
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.280]  i had no idea that i was having people after i had them on bringing me
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:03.600]  the blueprints of how your tv's and and and radios watch you even radios have like chips
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:09.440]  of them that basically pick up waves and then they create pictures it's very complex stuff
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:12.960]  i mean there's a lot of high tech that was invented that could be used to take us to the stars
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:15.360]  that instead is being used to totally control everything we do
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:21.520]  and i go see a movie like snowden and it's just like uh because i already knew all this but it
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:26.160]  was just crazy to see it on the screen but did i get any credibility for being right first long
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:33.760]  before snowden or anybody else you know having the army and fbi show up at access tv and it's surreal
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:39.600]  when you're in the parking lot and there's army officers in plain clothes threatening you
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:43.840]  you know saying are you planning terrorism because you just had a whistleblower on
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.680]  you know it's it's like a whole other world people just don't understand it
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:56.240]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:05.440]  job is here with info wars dot com more than 800 immigrants mistakenly granted citizenship
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:10.320]  i'll let you be the judge of that when i doubt it was mistakenly either way this is an article
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:15.040]  up by yahoo a drudge report the u.s. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least
[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:21.200]  858 immigrants from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:26.560]  who had pending deportation or according to an internal homeland security audit release monday
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:30.720]  the homeland security department's inspector general found that the immigrants use different names
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:35.440]  or birthdays to apply for citizenship with u.s. citizenship and immigration services
[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.000]  in such discrepancies weren't caught because their fingerprints were missing from the government's
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:46.480]  databases they committed fraud well here we go again obama's dhs screwing everything up and
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:51.440]  allowing people unvetted from other countries that hate us and do not want to assimilate
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:57.280]  into our country so we can have more attacks like we had in minnesota new jersey and new york
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:03.200]  this has been joe biggs with info wars dot com uh yeah first of all i want to say secret 12

[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.800]  done sometimes that is how the cali to cabbage we got like four or five of these clips this is
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:54.080]  really a big issue they keep confusing the public saying al-qaeda doesn't exist it's now isis al-qaeda
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:01.920]  means the base isis means islamic state or the base to start the caliphate it's the same wahhabist
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:07.200]  groups out of saudi arabia funding different jihad organizations who are sunni wahhabist
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:12.800]  worldwide like you got baptist and catholics well you got chi and you got sunnis and in the sunni
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:18.640]  group it's 80 of islam you've got these super radicals that are running the show now you can
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:23.120]  debate whether islam has always been horrible or always been whatever or good the point is right
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:27.680]  now is run by folks who want to cut women's generals off burnhole cities kill every christian jew
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:32.640]  atheists they get their hands on and i got all the atheists and agnostics running around
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:37.520]  attacking christians worshiping islam like it's cute sweet so we've got like five clips want to
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.880]  play but i'll get to all these four stone gets on we'll play them tomorrow but uh obama's global
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:48.480]  war on narratives washington free beacon that the narrative like it's wrong there's a narrative
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:54.320]  that islam attacks it was violent everybody knows the russians bomb new york on saturday uh so here's
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:35:00.080]  that clip or when it comes to isle we are in a fight a narrative fight with them a narrative
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:03.760]  battle in some ways this is actually just a war of narratives and so we want to make sure that
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.400]  we're getting out our counter narrative against isle we also can't give a narrative kill this is
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:14.880]  narrative that kind of narrative victory to be given to them tools like counter countering the
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.080]  this narrative because that is a false that embraces the terrorist narrative that feeds the isle
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:24.800]  narrative the terrorist narrative it also would feed the narrative that isle wants to feed because
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:30.160]  these types of incidents play right into isle's overall narrative isle is trying to advance
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:37.360]  and narrative to suggest otherwise only advances the the narrative of isle only serves to advance
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:42.480]  the the narrative that i so i can pause i don't want any more of this okay just stop it it goes on
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.600]  for a while so they're saying if you admit there's this islamic attack takeover that the west is
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:52.240]  actually funding that it's a narrative and if you admit they're attacking you're aiding the enemy so
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:58.240]  the globals are funding an enemy they're attacking you and so if you admit you're being attacked
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:03.760]  you're aiding them that's called upside down world that's called allison wonderland tea party
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:10.160]  so what is this narrative they claims being advanced face of the man on the screen the name
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:17.360]  he's a naturalized citizen here he is from afghanistan it raises the specter of the fear the xenophobia
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:22.880]  of those who are getting into this country and whether they are uh efficiently vetted in a way
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:30.240]  that has to be done uh we know but can it be done well enough this is a big big issue in this campaign
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:34.720]  is this a reflection of not getting it done well chris i don't want to speak to any individual
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:40.640]  suspects or individuals who are wanted right now what i can tell you is that we are when it comes
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:46.000]  to isle we are in a fight a narrative fight with them a narrative battle and what isle wants to do
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.680]  is they want to project that they are an organization that is representing islam in a fight in a war
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:56.640]  against the west in a war against the united states that is a bankrupt false narrative
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:02.240]  it's a mythology and we have made progress in debunking that mythology isle was a group that
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:08.000]  was viewed as on the move and on the march when they made a bunch of uh progress in iraq a couple
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.440]  of summers ago but since that time we worked with the rest of it that's josh ernaz the former head
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:19.120]  white house press secretary still out there uh shilling but the russian ministry defense and
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:25.440]  this official video that we're going to narrate live here on air came out yesterday and said the
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:31.040]  bombing over the weekend that killed 80 regular syrian military people was part of our government
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:36.880]  aiding isis and el nuzer in a new offensive which they're winning so every time they start
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:42.320]  losing our jets magically go bomb them and we've had our own fighter bombers go public to congress
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.680]  two years ago and say we're ordered to blow up people fighting al qaeda and isis i mean our
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:52.560]  military's pissed so let's be clear our military is not part of this they are lied to they're given
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:58.880]  fake targets general flin is meeting with the non radical countries right now they are pissed okay
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:05.520]  egypt is pissed syria is pissed israel is freaking out i mean who would think our government would
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:11.920]  openly ally with the most radical forms of islam so uh you know he talks about a narrative this is
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:19.120]  the reality here's what's happening here is the russian lieutenant general here it is
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:25.760]  it must be noted that the ceasefire was not achieved during this time
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.440]  within the past 24 hours the number of attacks by the armed groups reached 53
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:42.720]  three since the announcement of the cessation of hostilities it has been violated by the
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:50.800]  opposition 302 times during this time 63 civilians were killed and 252 were wounded
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:59.200]  while the losses of the syrian armed forces reached 153 the united states and the groups
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:06.080]  of the so-called moderate opposition controlled by them did not fulfill any of the commitments
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:14.000]  undertaken in the framework of the geneva limits the main point is that the break of the moderate
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:21.840]  opposition from from the jihad annusra has not taken place moreover what we see is not a break
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.240]  but the merging of the moderate opposition groups with the jihad annusra as well as their
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:33.360]  preparation for a joint offensive the reason for the creative situation is that the united states
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:37.840]  do not have an effective leverage over the moderate opposition and do not know the real
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:46.560]  situation of the ground one example of this is the strikes which were carried out today's ago
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:53.040]  by the aviation of the coalition against the syrian troops near the city of doros and the attacks
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:40:02.160]  by the isis militants that ensued considering that the conditions of the cessation of hostilities
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:09.040]  have not been met by the militants we deem that one sided fulfillment of it by the syrian government
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:17.280]  forces are meaningless in the twilight zone world we now live in a nazi war criminal commands the
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:23.440]  united states towards doros he's definitely the leader with all the weird Rockefeller money behind
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:30.080]  him and he writes in newspapers that he believes he's a messiah just google it you can see a
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:36.240]  a crazy person almost 90 years old who believes he's a messiah where's the diaper has a little
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:42.720]  wimp kid that runs around drunk on tv bombed out of his brain so he's the new air i guess the new
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:49.040]  messiah the many me and our own military has refused obama's orders for four years
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.840]  and now gives them fake targets that our militaries told congress were ordered to bomb
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:00.720]  the syrian military that didn't start this our own government started it the global has started it
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:06.160]  and the russians have to sit up there and what's crazy is that the russians do something wrong i'll
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.200]  expose it like that i don't care it'd have been to russia they don't they just say the truth constantly
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:18.400]  it's like 100 true and i just sit here in this twilight zone world where our governments overrun
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:26.720]  working with saudi arabia bringing in brainwashed hordes 80 military aged men to every major city
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:32.880]  waiting for the order to burn and burn and kill and they won't follow the orders to stand down
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:38.080]  so a small percentage go around and kill people exposing the agenda they've got planned the fact
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:46.320]  that these radical muslims won't ever follow orders is one of our greatest advantages they're
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:51.360]  so badly disciplined it's like three years ago they draw a red line they say if you cross this
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:57.920]  we're gonna attack you on the anniversary chemical attacks happened in syria and the al-qaeda they
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  were about to change their name to ices to confuse the american public were proud of themselves they
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  shot videos of them going and launching huge saudi made james weapons quarterly admitted it
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:19.200]  the un had to admit it un you know certified saudi arabian chemical mortars big huge warheads
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:26.640]  into cities to blame Assad hey dumbasses if you're gonna blame Assad for it don't
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.440]  send a video out to brag to your cousins and family because the saudi sends you a bunch of money when
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:37.280]  you do a suicide bombing or a nerve gas attack on an outdoor market imagine the syrians are out
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.920]  there their wives have their faces open their wives can get phd's their wives can drive cars
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:49.360]  you know they had hotels coming in europeans are flocking to syria to go to the beach this is
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:53.600]  one of the best beaches in the world for scuba diving everything the syrians are coming into
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:57.120]  those syrians are coming into the west they're investing their money they're like okay we're
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.480]  gonna have an election Assad's all set up trained in england just like qaddafi was set up but a lot
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:12.080]  better than qaddafi and they blow the whole country up i mean think about that and then they bring
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:19.600]  in hundreds of thousands of crazy weirdo jihadists the shit around in their western funding madras
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:23.120]  is talking about the women they're going to rape the people they're going to kill and they take
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:30.080]  over syrian homes with gardens and swimming pools middle class is wealthy was wealthy and they come
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:33.680]  to a father there's some other news and they say we're gonna kill your three daughters your two
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.760]  sons and your wife right now if you don't drive this truck full of explosives up to that army
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:50.400]  checkpoint and kill everybody and in most cases the father would just go ahead and go okay and drive
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:55.520]  it in and blow up his own countrymen because he had no choice but in many cases they they would
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:00.480]  stop and say i have bombs that my family's back there police and police and they're gonna kill
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:05.680]  my family if i don't do this but i can't do it and they would kill their families obviously the
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:10.240]  military could never go into the occupied town and save them so in hundreds of admitted cases
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:14.240]  fathers would sit there and break down crying and say they've got my daughters and sons and they
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:20.320]  will just kill them rape them and kill them and that's who hillary clinton supports you guys tell
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:25.040]  me you have another clip which clip is that absolutely the next clip you're reminding me
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:30.720]  this is fox host to white house people with shrapnel in their shoulders don't think this is a narrative
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.200]  battle yeah the hundreds of thousands of dead christians hundreds of thousands of dead muslims
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:42.480]  almost all of them killed by the west and hillary she came she saw they died it's starting this war
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:47.280]  they don't think it's a narrative of names because the former white house spokesman says it's all
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:52.720]  about that because he believes carl rubs bs that just because you're some candy ass from harvard
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:59.200]  with white shoes you control reality how about when josh ernaz gets a big-ass lung cancer or
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:06.320]  something yeah just announce it ain't cancer big boy that's a good news about people like you
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.840]  reality is going to slam you right up against a wall hell i know i'm going to be slammed against it
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:16.560]  and i hit the wall i'm expecting it but little pieces of felt like you never expected it did you
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:21.920]  let's go to this um you know you mentioned earlier today that you believe it's a narrative battle
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:27.040]  that we're fighting um you know i think that for people who you know have shrapnel in their
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:32.000]  shoulders this morning they might have a hard time accepting that that it's a narrative battle
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.080]  that we're fighting against isis explain what you meant by that well i meant to very specifically
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:40.000]  martha that we are taking the fight to them on the ground in iraq and in syria and the president
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.520]  is organized you're not you're not a little piece of felt within five thousand airstrikes that we've
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:48.880]  taken against isle targets in iraq and in syria what's important in the context of the political
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:54.080]  debate is to remember that isle is trying to assert a narrative that they represent the religion
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:59.040]  of islam in a war against the west and in a war against the united states that is a mythology
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:04.000]  that is a falsehood that is not true that is a bankrupt ideology that they are trying to wrap
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.760]  in the cloak of islam and to suggest that somehow we should treat muslims differently or suspect them
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:14.240]  as terrorists just because of their religion is something that we should do well we certainly
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:18.000]  have heard that kind of inflammatory rhetoric from republican i didn't we're not talking about
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:21.680]  that here because that that's clearly not what's happening but i wanted to ask the question about
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:25.280]  the isle narrative earlier today and it is important that we don't play into that narrative and that
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:29.040]  is what too many republicans have been willing to do all right well this all right let's discredit
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:36.080]  this little turd right now first off hillary saying it isn't a bombing isn't a terror attack let
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:42.480]  these people in and it's protecting them and we just heard the russian saying our government
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:49.600]  is protecting and air striking the syrian military so isis takes over so you're totally
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:55.280]  discredited and you let isis take over you stood down for two years while they did it on purpose
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:00.080]  and you've been caught and you'll never change that narrative and i can tell you the council on
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:05.440]  farm relations and others are panicking that they've lost on this narrative and they thought changing
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:11.840]  the name from al-qaeda to isis would change that it hasn't done it let's go to roger in arizona
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:18.080]  roger thanks for holding your own here worldwide thanks thank you uh i really like your show a
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:22.560]  long time with the first time call thank you brother so um yeah so looking at the uh the
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:28.080]  overall plan for what i think is coming so they can steal the election what they're going to pull
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:32.400]  um you know if you look at the playbook and you look at uh current events i've got kind of
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:37.360]  basically two points one thing is um what's in plain sight no one seems to talk about i mean
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:42.960]  the others men's online but there's no uh mainstream coverage which is really hillary can't fill
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:48.640]  high school gym and even the people are there half of its media half of it's just she has to show up
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:55.920]  to like town fairs rodeos city events to come to a crowd she can't get more than a hundred people
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:03.120]  literally the average is about 70 she's a total job yeah and so trump's got you know 10 000 20 000
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:09.040]  people at a time but here's the thing um ms mbc recently and along with a lot of other mainstream
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:14.720]  media has been caught rigging these polls um you know to make it look like it's close and so the real
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:19.280]  question is why why are they trying to continue to keep her close when everyone knows she's a
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:25.600]  toll fraud and the answer is uh what they're going to pull within the next seven weeks i think pro
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.640]  actively if people hit the mainstream just continue to hit the narrative why is no one
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.560]  showing up why is no one showing up how are these polls rigged it's funny you say that i've laid
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:38.560]  awake at night thinking how do we expose hillary and i think the fact that no one's showing up at
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:46.160]  her events uh that she's the ghost candidate is the way to go exactly so if you expose it that way
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:51.520]  quickly the polls start to melt here's the thing that's scary you've got the guy from princeton
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:58.400]  this uh this professor who recently says um hang on your feet because something's coming he he he
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:03.680]  judged linked to a report uh in hollywood as all the celebrities were speaking out that hillary was
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:08.800]  you know getting her butt kicked no that's right the headline is how hollywood panics begs well you
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:13.920]  told you that they're meeting two weeks ago about getting rid of her i mean look the secret service
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.640]  told us they said look she's falling down more than once an hour we don't know but it's getting
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.440]  worse and notice it all happened like we said i mean the secret service the real secret service
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:29.600]  told us that i mean that really happened so the head one of the heads of the networks there sat
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:33.760]  there and said don't worry she's going to win i can't tell you what's coming but she's going to win
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.240]  so they know that people who are in the know seem to know something so here's here's my things going
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:43.040]  to happen i believe what they're going to do is and i you know i hope the guy on a tinfoil had
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.960]  crazy um but if you look at what they've been up to and the way they've laid this out it makes
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:52.080]  perfect sense uh you got to keep your eye on lindy graham if you remember uh year two ago he was
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:56.640]  mr nuclear isis is going to go yeah no we exposed the fact that there was missing nukes in west
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:01.760]  texas and you notice they never denied it because we had that from from the base i mean we got it
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:07.360]  directly from people that were anyways the point is is that yeah and then the the next day they go
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:13.600]  missing nukes they're going to blow up you know the harbor on the east coast yeah so so here's how
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:17.920]  it could play out um grand was the boulder burger this year that wasn't quick they're going to say
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:22.960]  there's missing nukes how are the two candidates going to handle it yep but it goes further the
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:28.160]  turkey thing they made sure mainstream media said that turkey's now in bed with russia so when
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:34.160]  something happens here in the united states they're going to say it it was a nuclear device the isis
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:39.680]  got from russia they're working with islamics blah blah blah blah blah and all of a sudden we need
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:43.840]  to know i agree with you listen i don't know that's going to happen at may anything that happened i mean
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:49.360]  hell they're on bloomberg and abc news saying the russians bomb new york and new jersey folks i mean
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.560]  i mean they could literally show you a photoshop video of me like raping reindeer with santa claus

[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:27.280]  attacks kill me well this is what well watson will be co-hosting coming up at the five after or so
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:32.400]  and more of your calls coming up for those that are patiently holding from around the world roger
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:37.680]  stone great to have you wow hillary i don't know if you've seen this told abc news and others she's
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:43.440]  worried the russians bombed uh new york and new jersey saturday this after she came out and said
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:48.400]  it wasn't a bombing even though she called it a bombing it seems to be some of the most unintentional
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:55.280]  comedy ever i'm sorry we just lost audio so you're going to have to stick with us for a moment
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:59.840]  oh it's all right it's always part of the fun of the show yeah he sure is all right there we go
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:05.200]  roger what do you make of hillary uh not saying this was terrorism now saying it's terrorism but
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:10.640]  saying it may be russia i mean this is like ridiculous yeah the russian thing is an absurdity
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:18.080]  almost as absurd as the notion of the russians hacking our election which obama's cia a director
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:24.080]  has said alex first of all uh the traffic in new york is so horrific because of the un
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:30.880]  it's yet another reason to uh get the un out of the us i had to get out of my cabin uh hope it
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:39.760]  15 blocks but it is uh and in the aftermath of the uh terror attack the terror bombing in the chelsea
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:48.240]  area this entire city is on lockdown now hillary kind of has refused to admit that islamic
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:55.040]  terrorism exists at all uh trump got out there immediately with the forthright statement uh
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:59.120]  saying a lot more than i told you so but essentially saying this is going to continue
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:06.000]  uh unless america recognizes the problem and gets tough uh and i think hillary saw the
[02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:11.920]  strong response that got then she's now trying to sound like donald trump it's not the first
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:19.680]  time by the way that she has attempted to sound like trump you said last week it's
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:26.720]  trumps to lose he is the winner how is the witch hillary gonna strike back well first of all
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:32.000]  it's important as former president nixon coached me many times to look at presidential elections
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:39.440]  within the context of the electoral college rather than looking at a national poll uh and
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:46.160]  democrats uh and left-leaning journals like politico have said for some time that the
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:52.720]  democrats have an electoral college lock uh but with polls now showing trump pulling ahead in
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:58:02.800]  florida ohio nevada iowa we have broken that lock in my opinion and we are in a situation where
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:12.240]  there are multiple possibilities under which trump can win uh he could hide could for example
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:23.040]  carry pennsylvania or ohio uh either one of those would work uh in this kind of new construct
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:30.480]  that lets donald trump get to 270 um you know without virginia which i think is the one state
[02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:35.120]  where he appears to be allowed roger stone stay right there we'll be back with the former campaign
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:39.520]  manager donald trump to talk about the incredible things that are happening with 48 days left

[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:13.520]  job on the interview i got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:19.200]  minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears up got four and a half stars people really
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:24.240]  love it read about it find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise

[02:59:29.920 --> 02:59:33.680]  pulled it all night or like that in a while but i probably could not have done it without brain force

[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:17.360]  so
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:20.800]  roger stone's pushing to a better computer on skype we'll take a phone call right now
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:27.040]  paul lost is getting in the chair he's gonna go host the sour with us uh a lot is happening right
[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:32.240]  now um in fact stone is now back in his chair we've got de wayne in canada been holding
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:37.200]  for quite a while we've got uncle sam and louisiana we're gonna get to all of you uh roger can you
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:42.560]  hear me yes i can let me ask you this question i keep asking it every week of you how are they
[03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:46.720]  going to counter strike hillary seems desperate now her eyes aren't pointing the right direction
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:51.840]  there's a video of that she seems totally panicked uh there's articles in politica with the democrats
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:58.080]  are quote panicking as you said last week but now they admit total panic and then to see the
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:02.720]  democratic nominee claiming the russians are behind bombings in america i mean this seems
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:07.680]  to have entered lunatic land will the democrats kick her out remove her as if her talk of that
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.640]  no i don't i don't think that will happen i think she could only remove herself i can answer
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.920]  your question though in terms of what they're going to do in 1982 the republican national committee
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:25.600]  signed a consent decree with the federal court in which they in essence agreed not to combat
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:33.200]  or even seek uh voter fraud out uh this was after the aftermath aftermath of the 1981
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:41.360]  new jersey gubernatorial election uh therefore the democrats could go to court slightly before
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:46.160]  the election just days before the election make the argument that the republican national committee
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:53.600]  was an extension of the trump campaign he is after all the republican nominee for president uh and
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:00.800]  prevent the kind of stop the steel activities in the uh at the polling places that we have talked
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:08.880]  about on the show this consent decree is a is a ticking time bomb for the republic so to be clear
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:13.760]  correct me if i'm wrong we come out we say well what for fraud trump does a month and a half ago
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:18.720]  the feds of the president say that doesn't exist they panic though knowing we're going to be watching
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:24.240]  so now they're going to federalize it to keep it safe that means cover up their steel well not only
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:31.440]  federalize it to keep it safe as i said on this show watch watch but disarm us entirely through
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:40.160]  this consent decree which uh the republicans uh uh agreed to in 1982 uh it is uh it is therefore if
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:47.440]  we did anything theoretically under the decree uh we'd be violating this is i think a giant problem
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:53.200]  for the republicans so what keeps you up at night trump's clearly uh going from a surge to a wave
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:59.600]  to a tsunami uh but it's not in the bag yet well i'm feeling growingly confident i think for the
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:06.800]  first time i said on this show last week that i am confident now that he will win that's a question
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:15.120]  of holding on to it the momentum is in his direction and i expect that to continue however we have
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:23.200]  three debates coming up none of the moderators are friendly to donald trump trump himself preferred
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:29.600]  no moderator he'd like to just go at it with hillary like lincoln and douglas i agree with that idea
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:36.240]  i think it is outrageous that the libertarian party and green party candidates are not allowed
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:41.840]  to participate the presidential commission on debates is not appointed by the president not
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:48.960]  a commission and not about debate it's about limiting debate the idea that a candidate can't get on the
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:54.960]  ballot unless they have 15 percent and they can't get 15 percent unless they pardon me get in the
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:04:01.360]  debates unless they have 15 percent and they can't get 15 percent unless they're in the debates that's
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:08.320]  problematic i understand gary johnson's supporters are having a demonstration tomorrow outside the
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:13.840]  presidential commission on debates office in washington d state frankly i even though i'm 100
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:20.400]  percent for donald trump i wish i could join them i think that it would actually be a net positive
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:29.360]  politically for trump if jill stein and gary johnson were both in the debates i'll say this i'm
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:34.320]  always for third parties being involved but clearly donald trump has taken over a major party and i
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:38.400]  would basically see johnson as the establishment coming in taking over the libertarians but
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:42.160]  regardless i'm going to come back with paul watson he's got some key questions and then i've been
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:46.160]  asking the questions roger stone you were hot to get on today usually i'm begging you to come on the

[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:07.120]  and before paul comes in and asks his questions you said big news today in the last 10 minutes i
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:12.560]  was asking my questions what's front and center for you right now as donald trump is clearly
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:19.440]  way ahead the polls well i thought it was very significant that last week when trump pulled
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:26.400]  ahead in the polls you'll notice that the uh hillary campaign at first tried to resurrect
[03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:35.680]  david duke as an issue when that got no traction we went all the way back to birtherism uh this is
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:43.680]  because some clinton campaign poll somewhere shows that this damages down from among some voters uh
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.480]  i was particularly proud of trump in the way that he turned this back first of all he just said
[03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:55.040]  flatly okay obama was born here but the person who started this who started the entire birther
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:59.600]  genre and i love how they had to deny it even politico had to admit it was democrats i remember
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:06.320]  but sorry go ahead yeah and in politifacts which has now been caught being wrong a couple times
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:13.760]  supposedly the arbiter of what's true uh and cnn both insist no hillary's people did not start
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:18.560]  the that's like schnobs is run by a fat lady with a cat so she knows everything well here's
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:25.600]  what i do know mark penn writes about uh obama's birth and the strategy memo and sydney blumenthal
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:32.640]  the democrat dirty trickster guy who thinks he's ted sorenson but he's really hip talk uh it was
[03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:37.120]  promulgating this and pushing it hard sure and what do you make as you were saying that two weeks
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:41.680]  ago what do you make of cnn having to admit headline no hillary did start the birther ribbon
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:48.800]  i mean i was there in 2008 she did it yeah although i read the cnn story uh conversely i thought they
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:55.280]  were once again trying to absolve her the point i'm making alex is the level of desperation david
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:11:02.720]  duke birtherism none of these things are relevant to making this country great again to getting an
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:09.600]  economic resurgence in this country that will make us strong again allow us to rebuild our national
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:18.000]  defense uh and um there is absolute palpable panic among the democrats because as we saw only a month
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:26.080]  ago they were using the lbj very goldwater playbook remember the media said nuclear war the countdown
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:32.000]  that you know you know the daisy petals were all dead right right and that that has failed utterly
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:37.440]  to their shock to their shock so i asked the question again paul watson and then i want you
[03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:41.680]  to ask your questions of your host in this hour paul watson from london how do you see them
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:46.400]  striking back i mean they're clearly in full panic mode like stone said last week politico today
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:53.840]  had met cnn democrats in panic i mean it says they're panicking uh what's happening well you've got
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:59.760]  as you said earlier alex you know bloomberg reporters saying asking hillary was the isis attack
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:05.760]  staged funded provocative by russia while russia is bombing isis it's okay for the mainstream
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:11.120]  media to engage in the most flagrant bizarre conspiracy theories while attacking us for
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:15.520]  talking about hillary's health which we've been completely vindicated on of course it was our
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:21.040]  video that went viral that reignited that issue about six weeks ago you're talking about they're
[03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:27.280]  desperate how they're gonna strike back i think and this is what happened before brexit remember
[03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:34.800]  we had joe cox this anti brexit mp that was murdered in the street by this unstable racist
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:39.600]  pro brexit here person of course turned out he was just a mentally unstable individual not even
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:46.320]  really political but that didn't matter for the final two weeks before the brexit vote the media
[03:12:46.320 --> 03:12:51.440]  hammered on this narrative because they've got still a complete lack of self-awareness they don't
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:56.400]  know that just calling their opponents racist doesn't work anymore but they still hammered on
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:02.720]  that rhetoric that anyone who supported brexit was a racist right wing extremist why did hillary
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:07.840]  start talking about the alt right in that infamous speech now no i agree what you're about to say is
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:13.200]  they're they're they're planting the you know the ground right now for the claims that we want to
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:18.000]  kill hillary we're violent we see them when trump says hey if i can't have bodyguards you shouldn't
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.240]  have them they're spinning everything into we want to kill hillary is that what you're getting at
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:28.880]  so a stage assassination attempt well it doesn't have to be against hillary she planted that meme
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:33.360]  that the alt right was unhinged was dangerous was extremist you know you've got her official
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:39.360]  campaign website talking about pepe the frog for god's sake people kept asking why is she doing that
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:43.920]  why is she doing the one thing that you don't do which is to feed the trolls well it wasn't really
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:50.560]  to counter that narrative it was to set the stage to create this narrative that there's gonna be
[03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:56.720]  an unhinged racist right wing extremist so she can censor the internet yeah so you could have a
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:03.520]  you know a trump supporting maga hat wearing pepe the frog meaming white supremacist you know going
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:08.160]  to a school in a black area of the country i think you're right it'll be still in a full pepe
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:14.000]  frog outfit attacking black school yeah and you know the media has created the environment where
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.520]  that doesn't have to be even contrived it doesn't have to be a conspiracy you know if you lecture
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:24.160]  people all day as the media and the left have done they've pushed this narrative that donald trump
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:29.840]  is literally hitler and that his supporters are brown shirt nazis not only does that embolden
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:35.760]  extremists on the left who threaten and in some cases plan to assassinate trump it emboldens
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:41.360]  actual neo-nazis who think that's right i agree let's get let's get roger stones take on this we're
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:44.800]  skipping this network break and then we're gonna so and i'll leave it about 10 minutes paul take
[03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:50.160]  over what do you make of that i mean how will they strike back is that a valid point i totally
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:55.520]  agree with paul's analysis first uh they're going to try to remove our whole watchers that's the
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:15:02.160]  point i was making about the consent decree to allow them to steal at will and as i said last
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:09.840]  week i still fear for trumps safety as the bankers and the financial interests in this country uh and
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:16.720]  the globalists get more panicky and they realize what a threat to them donald trump is uh the thing
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:23.840]  that leaves me awake at night worrying is about his personal safety uh now i don't rule out that
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:31.760]  they might try to stage some assault on hillary but uh sadly i i think an attempt to kill trump
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:37.840]  is not outside the realm now people are going to call me a conspiracy theorist right up until the
[03:15:37.840 --> 03:15:43.360]  time that somebody tries this so i pray for trump every night i agree we have the new york times and
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:48.000]  others calling for the assassination of trump if he gets assassinated or somebody tries to
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:54.560]  they're gonna have blood on their hands there's no question about that but the hysteria uh is is out
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:16:02.080]  of control alex if you go on twitter today there are literally thousands of tweets accusing me
[03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:07.440]  of planting the bomb in new york city i know no no they're saying i did it you did it the russians
[03:16:07.440 --> 03:16:12.320]  did it i mean because because trump says we're bringing in millions of radical muslims so we're
[03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:17.440]  gonna end up getting attacks and then when he's right it's it's our fault we must have done it no
[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:24.400]  these muslims really do this that they you know this is they're at war with logic it's like muslims
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:32.800]  can't do terror hillary isn't it really the russians well the insinuation that you or i or anyone who
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:39.680]  supports trump is behind the bombing when you go look a little closer they're they're all bots they're
[03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:46.320]  all automated this is a david rock operation rock is the joseph gerbils of no way talking about
[03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:52.560]  brock he admits he's offering all this money for vote but quote data on trump i i'm tempted to offer
[03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:58.960]  a million dollars for data on hillary and clinton and there'll be a graduated stage if we use it
[03:16:58.960 --> 03:17:04.320]  10 000 you have a huge 50 000 but the coup de grace i think i'm thinking about offering i'm
[03:17:04.320 --> 03:17:08.960]  thinking about my october surprise i think i'm gonna launch it next week one million dollars
[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:14.080]  for dirt on the clinton's to be released what do you think well i'd be the first one to apply
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:20.080]  alex because i've got plenty i know you do by the way we should talk later you know i've got a little
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:27.600]  september surprise planned for later in the week well uh look i still think that the 80 scandal
[03:17:28.320 --> 03:17:34.160]  is not fully exposed the way the clinton's have raped the Haitian people they were in charge
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:39.040]  essentially they took the lead they only gave five percent of the 100 million they raised to the
[03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:45.920]  people that is incredible george hw bush today says he's going to vote for hillary wow no surprise
[03:17:45.920 --> 03:17:52.880]  there the bush clinton prime syndicate are the ones most responsible for the rape of Haiti the
[03:17:52.880 --> 03:17:59.920]  bush clinton haiti fund is the biggest scam that they pulled together so the establishment
[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:06.400]  circling the wagons uh no surprise by the way another added plus as you know new dc leaks new
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:10.800]  wiki leaks and others coming out more coming out soon with the whole republican establishment
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:16.160]  bohemian grove you know colin pal saying oh god the republican establishment hates him i mean isn't
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:22.320]  that more just a certification that trumps the real deal yes and i still believe that the entire
[03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:29.200]  backstory on libya is going to hit the fan shortly uh and we're going to have a re-examination of
[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:36.400]  whether the removal of qaddafi and the billion dollar war uh that we staged in that country
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:42.640]  was worth it and what it was really all about so i still think that hillary's got some very tough
[03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:47.520]  matches ahead well she doesn't look as arrogant now and it's metaphysical that she's collapsing
[03:18:47.520 --> 03:18:51.120]  paul watson you're taking over here in just a few minutes but other questions for roger stone or
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:56.240]  comments paul watson yeah the other comment is with this october surprise of course hillary linked
[03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:01.920]  to the alt right said it was basically controlled by putin we know that they've considered having
[03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:07.440]  provocations where they send up a you know a jet painted in un colors have saddam hassein
[03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:13.920]  shoot it down back in 2002 to start the iraq war that was in the downing street memo you know hillary
[03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:20.640]  has linked putin to trump said that he's cozying up to work to putin so could they have an event
[03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:25.120]  a provocation with russia you know serious heating up we had russia supposedly bomber
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:32.560]  un8 convoy we had the us bomb syrian troops in syria could they have a military confrontation
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:37.200]  with russia you know a shootdown of a russian or an american jet that's a good question that's a
[03:19:37.200 --> 03:19:41.920]  good question let me ask you this you wrote about the cnn professor global is saying some
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:46.400]  big surprises coming the next month they'll challenge trump and hillary you were saying you
[03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:50.480]  thought it could be i mean a couple different things but what else could it be what about financial
[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:56.960]  collapse paul it could be anything i think it's more likely to be you know a racial attack caught
[03:19:56.960 --> 03:20:02.800]  on camera you know trump supporters beating up african americans rodney king style it could be
[03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:08.400]  anything along those lines it could be a confrontation with russia and don't put it past them i mean
[03:20:08.400 --> 03:20:14.960]  clinton's a completely ruthless they'll do anything sure hire a couple criminals tell them you're
[03:20:14.960 --> 03:20:18.640]  gonna go to jail for six months but we're gonna give you millions of dollars of criminals will be
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:22.320]  killed in jail and have them go beat up some little black kids at a bus stop that'd be perfect
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:28.400]  wouldn't roger son yeah look i think they're capable of absolutely anything and having the cia
[03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:34.000]  director come out last week and say that he fears that the russians are going to hack
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:40.800]  and rig our elections this is the same cia director who told us when the 9 11 28 pages were
[03:20:40.800 --> 03:20:46.640]  released by the congress several weeks ago that they didn't say what they said that's right uh
[03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:52.000]  that the saudi royal family and their retainers financed the attack on america that's right he said
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:57.920]  it doesn't say the saudi's royals funded it when it said in clear english they did yeah so this guy
[03:20:57.920 --> 03:21:04.640]  has no credibility he's now been politicized the same way the fbi director has been politicized
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:12.160]  and the russian meme is one that clearly must be showing in their polling as one that you can fool
[03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:18.000]  people with uh don trump's an american patriot he's not in league with budin he's never even met
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:25.600]  and uh he is uh he is well he's praised his qualities as a leader he's criticized
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:30.000]  his philosophy and his ways and hillary's been caught getting 30 plus million to give him
[03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:34.080]  one fifth of our uranium and all his other deals the truth is she's the one up her eyeballs and
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:40.320]  all of it what about this issue regardless what happens to hillary or even uh trump
[03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:44.880]  roger stone and paul watson as well do you agree with me that we're seeing the death of the dinosaur
[03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:51.200]  meeting in the establishment whatever comes out of this it's a pyrrhic victory just like the the
[03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:56.880]  the british empire one world war one but it actually killed their empire isn't this the
[03:21:56.880 --> 03:22:03.120]  type of victory you win the war uh but then you end up losing right after the war this is only
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:08.240]  possible because of the technological changes in america the fact that half the voters are now
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:14.000]  getting their information right here on their handheld device on demand when they want to
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:20.720]  and this has taken the power away from broadcast television and away from cable ironically uh
[03:22:20.720 --> 03:22:26.080]  this is the wave of the future we don't have to go through cbs to reach the voters anymore
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:33.440]  info wars is reaching on as we speak uh and this lack of control is driving the establishment
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:39.040]  insane that's why they want to regulate i was about to say make no mistake if they steal it from
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.080]  trump the next order of business and we're going to paul watson is coming after drudge
[03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:50.960]  alex jones roger stone breitbart do you agree with that without any question
[03:22:52.240 --> 03:22:56.880]  paul watson we've already i've already experienced it i'm banned on cnn you've been
[03:22:56.880 --> 03:23:03.680]  banned on msnbc uh because they they don't like uh like jack nicholson said and if you're a good man
[03:23:03.680 --> 03:23:08.960]  they can't handle the truth you want the truth you can't handle the truth paul watson i'm going to
[03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:12.080]  hand the baton to you here in a moment but uh final questions for roger stone we have him here
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:19.840]  final questions would be i mean we had wiki leaks and julian assange back what 10 days ago now say
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:24.960]  that their next huge reveal was coming out in the next week that seems to be delayed again
[03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:30.960]  when do you think the next big email leak or document batch drop will happen you know coming
[03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:36.080]  from wiki leaks when do you think we can expect that i have reason to believe that it is imminent
[03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:43.040]  i think for uh ethical reasons they like to put out emails in blocks that are complete
[03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:49.600]  so that there's not any one email that is misleading uh or gives the wrong impression
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:55.440]  there's a lot of integrity in the way they are leaking this information now there's been a great
[03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:02.960]  campaign online to try to disparage and discredit assange which is kind of funny because the left
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:07.440]  loved him when he was exposing the bush administration at this point he's got complete
[03:24:07.440 --> 03:24:13.760]  credibility he's a hero yeah there's no question he's a true teller uh into hero yeah i mean i said
[03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:17.680]  time will tell because i said hey i hate bush good job but i said if you don't go after democrats
[03:24:17.680 --> 03:24:22.800]  later he did even even even more than bush and he says hillary is a literal demon i mean what does
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:26.720]  that tell us roger stone no i think that's exactly right what's interesting here is the
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:33.760]  establishment doesn't understand that george bush the elder endorsing hillary merely confirms
[03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:38.080]  for the voters that the political class you said it i was going to ask you that question that's the
[03:24:38.080 --> 03:24:44.160]  one question i forgot roger stone the stonecultures.com uh bestselling author uh his books by the way
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:50.160]  available in forestore.com doesn't it show the total gulf and disconnect that some addled you
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:54.960]  know disconnected space cadet at 90 years old thinks it's going to help hillary endorsing her
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.840]  i mean it gives me hope to know these guys are not all powerful they may have all the wizardry
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:04.960]  of nsa technology but they don't know how to use it it's like a a monkey trying to fly a spaceship
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:10.400]  well and look i'm telling you laura bush is in the wings she's going to endorse hillary that's
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:16.960]  coming no they're they're tone deaf the bushes have always been tone deaf uh and they're discredited
[03:25:16.960 --> 03:25:23.200]  their presidencies are both failures i've checked failures but they don't get it you see the people
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:28.480]  are on to them yeah they don't know their name is shit no and and and the people have figured out
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:35.200]  that it's really one party it's a two-party duopoly trump's nomination is the hostile takeover of
[03:25:35.200 --> 03:25:40.000]  the republic that's right he's the beautiful fall of this kleptocratic system it'll be up to us
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:43.120]  i've said this though and i want to pull out the final question roger a great interview today by
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:47.680]  the way i think the best ever if trump and that means us don't deliver we don't really try to
[03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:52.560]  make change if we don't really cut taxes and empower the economy and do all this the country's doomed
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:57.440]  i mean this is a magic moment that's happening if he gets in we've got to make this work we've got
[03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:02.800]  to deliver if we do same old same old i'm going to give up yeah but i gotta tell you i've known
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:11.040]  donald trump for 40 years this is a guy who is incredibly stubborn he knows what his agenda is
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:17.360]  and he's not going to waver from it and he understands that if he delivers on his agenda he will go
[03:26:17.360 --> 03:26:23.680]  down in history as one of the greatest presidents we've ever had and if he lets the establishment
[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:31.360]  co-opt his agenda or sideline his agenda uh then he won't he's the patriot he's running because he
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:37.600]  loves his country not because he has to be president to be somebody he already is somebody
[03:26:37.600 --> 03:26:42.400]  so he doesn't want the job for the job sake like george hw bush who believed in nothing
[03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:48.400]  he's doing this at great cost well i totally agree with you and look look at his work ethic
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:53.760]  look at all the great coups he's done from mexico to meeting with the egyptian president to fight
[03:26:53.760 --> 03:26:59.280]  radical islam uh to go into new orleans the arrogance of the current elite is what's frightening to me
[03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:03.520]  they're totally disconnected paul watson final question before you take over with roger stone
[03:27:04.640 --> 03:27:10.000]  well i completely agree there's a total lack of self-awareness they think they can bring down
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:15.360]  trump by continually claiming that he's this racist demagogue you know if it wasn't trump
[03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:21.520]  it would be someone else this populist wave this people's insurgency against the political class
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:28.000]  has swept the west for the past two three four years it didn't just arrive with donald trump
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:32.720]  so if they think they can tear down this whole movement by just calling trump a demagogue and
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:37.760]  a racist they've got another thing coming it's a complete lack of self-awareness you know the
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:43.840]  media got caught with hillary's health dismissing it as a conspiracy theory she came out she collapsed
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:49.760]  they said oh my god we got rumbled this was actually true that was a shining example of their complete
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:55.120]  lack of self-awareness it cost them with brexit where they thought they could defeat us just by
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:27:59.440]  calling his old and they're saying nobody knows what election fraud is and a month later they're
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:05.600]  federalized in the election well not not only that if you can go back three years ago to an
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:11.440]  interview i did on cnn with brian stelter in which i told him that hillary had significant health
[03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:18.080]  problems that they were degenerative that it may even made it likely she might not make the race
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:23.840]  but if she did they would hamper her campaign and he of course dismissed all that attacked me it was
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:30.160]  all unfounded and now it's probably my sources were impeccable they were i society new york democrats
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:34.720]  and they were right and now the now the emails with colin palin others are high-level democrats
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:39.280]  going she can't walk up three three steps she's what what the hell's going on with her pal's like i
[03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:44.160]  know it everybody tells me she's dying the secret service doesn't know they just say she's collapsing
[03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:49.600]  every 20 30 minutes i mean and we told you this a month ago and then it happens folks this is real

[03:30:26.240 --> 03:30:30.640]  what exactly is in these training sessions but the navy will soon send out messages with more
[03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:35.360]  information in the meantime leadership is looking forward to putting together a commander's toolkit

[03:32:47.440 --> 03:32:52.000]  a system i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that
[03:32:52.000 --> 03:33:07.920]  didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com
[03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:21.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:29.440]  we're back live in the fourth hour on the alex jones show we're gonna hit some news here in a
[03:33:29.440 --> 03:33:34.800]  moment but again just going back to what we were covering in the last segment hillary clinton is
[03:33:34.800 --> 03:33:41.520]  desperate the polls are tightening she's absolutely ruthless she's desperate as i said before the
[03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:48.480]  brexit vote in the united kingdom we had this incident which was relentlessly exploited by the
[03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:55.120]  mainstream media by the left by the anti brexit crowd where this mentally ill unstable individual
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:34:03.440]  went out murdered someone on the street that someone happened to be an anti brexit leftist mp the gas
[03:34:03.440 --> 03:34:10.160]  mileage they got out of that in the week that followed right up until the brexit vote was huge
[03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:16.480]  it almost swung it for them again they didn't realize that constantly demonizing their political
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:22.640]  opposition as racist and bigots doesn't work anymore that only influences weak minded people
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:27.600]  who are probably going to vote for that side anyway and again it didn't work for them but we
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:34.080]  could see it again with hillary this is a very real possibility that you could have some kind of
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:40.640]  violent incident blamed on a donald trump supporter a few days or a week before the election again
[03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:46.640]  they've been setting the stage for months you saw it again on the emmy's what was it last night a
[03:34:46.640 --> 03:34:52.000]  couple of nights ago where you know they're getting up on stage and again saying that donald trump is
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:58.400]  literally hitler if you create that kind of political environment you embolden extremist not only on
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:03.760]  the left and we've had people threatening to assassinate trump you see on twitter every day
[03:35:03.760 --> 03:35:09.600]  we had the guy who actually went to a trump rally the british guy sanford i think his name was who
[03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:15.280]  you know tried to grab an officer's gun tried to assassinate trump but you will get it on the other
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:21.920]  side as well you will get actual neo-nazis that want to act out this this bizarre dream that
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:27.200]  they have of you know greasing the skids for the reincarnation of adolf hitler or whatever
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:33.360]  demented dream they have and again the media is responsible for creating that environment
[03:35:33.360 --> 03:35:40.960]  with this completely reckless rhetoric so you could have an incident where a maga hat wearing you
[03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:47.840]  know pepe the frog meming trump supporter acts out you know a white supremacist whether the
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:53.520]  incident is contrived or not again doesn't have to be a conspiracy doesn't have to be a false flag
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:59.040]  for one of these individuals who is already on the fringe to go postal and of course hillary
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:06.160]  clinton will swoop in to political point score off such an incident again why is she talking
[03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:12.880]  about the alt right why is her official campaign website posting articles about a cartoon frog
[03:36:12.880 --> 03:36:18.160]  this isn't for nothing they've thought about this they're setting the stage for this
[03:36:18.960 --> 03:36:23.600]  this is not nowhere near outside the realm of possibility you know that you could have
[03:36:24.240 --> 03:36:30.080]  a group a mob of trump supporters allegedly caught on camera beating up an african-american
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:35.680]  and that if this happens if this is the october surprise you know it's imminent here within
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:41.360]  the next month to six weeks and this is surely what's going to happen it happened right before
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:48.560]  brexit the other scenario is again you've had hillary say vladimir putin is the leader of the
[03:36:48.560 --> 03:36:54.560]  alt right donald trump is cozying up to vladimir putin again you've seen what happened in syria
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:37:02.320]  massive escalation the us bombs syrian troops russia allegedly bombs unaid convoys you could
[03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:08.240]  have an incident where a russian fighter jet or an american fighter jet gets shot down in syria
[03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:15.920]  and again a huge military escalation a huge provocation hillary grandstands said that says
[03:37:15.920 --> 03:37:22.400]  that trump is anti-american because he's cozying up to the the dictator that hates america vladimir
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:29.600]  putin that again is a very real possibility as we count down to the final weeks of this
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:35.840]  presidential race with the polls tightening with hillary clinton now doing just one event
[03:37:35.840 --> 03:37:42.720]  again what is it 48 49 50 days to go to the election over the next six days she's doing
[03:37:42.720 --> 03:37:50.720]  just one event the polls are basically neck and neck now and she's more absent from the campaign
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:55.120]  trail again because she's breaking down because she's having these coughing fits because she's
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:38:02.320]  collapsing in the most intense phase of the race she's disappearing she's getting more desperate
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:07.840]  she's a cornered animal so don't think for a second that this couldn't happen in fact it would be
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:15.040]  completely naive to think that it wouldn't given what we've seen in the past given that back in
[03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:22.240]  2004 just days before that presidential election we had a sama bin laden pop up on tape and basically
[03:38:22.240 --> 03:38:28.160]  encourage people to vote for john carrey when he was running against george w bush you know
[03:38:28.160 --> 03:38:34.800]  walter cronkai commented that this was so convenient for bush that it almost looked like a carl row
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:42.400]  setup afterwards both bush and carrey said that that victory for george w bush was swung
[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:48.800]  by that a sama bin laden videotape so there is precedent for this you don't always get a big
[03:38:48.800 --> 03:38:55.680]  october surprise that swings the presidential election but it can and it has happened so yes
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:00.960]  we could have documents coming from wikileaks we could have hacked emails but from the opposite
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:09.120]  direction we could also see hillary clinton's campaign contrive exploit provocateur some kind
[03:39:09.120 --> 03:39:14.640]  of violent incident to be blamed on trump and his supporters or some kind of military escalation
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:20.640]  provocation with russia and again when i put out a video on this like i did with hillary's health
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:26.480]  which went viral the media is going to call it a conspiracy theory just like they called
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:32.800]  questions over hillary's health a conspiracy theory of course we were completely vindicated on that
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:38.080]  and the media had to scuttle away with their tails took between their legs admitting that
[03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:44.960]  they got it completely wrong so there's a video coming out on that tomorrow in which we will delve
[03:39:44.960 --> 03:39:50.880]  into the possible scenarios for the october surprise so that's going to be a really important video
[03:39:50.880 --> 03:39:56.960]  to get out to people and of course we've got another big expose of hillary clinton coming up
[03:39:56.960 --> 03:40:03.120]  probably on thursday again unknown unseen information involving whistleblowers it's
[03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:09.680]  going to be a big story and i encourage everyone to get that out but more on that later on in the
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:16.720]  week as for now we've got a top story up on info wars dot com another exclusive which the media will
[03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:22.000]  claim is a conspiracy theory but we've got the video exclusive leaked video shows obama railing
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:30.800]  against white people during kenya trip now this is from 1990 but again never before seen video
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:39.200]  it's obama in his 20s on a trip to kenya with michelle obama and he's basically denouncing
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:46.080]  white people railing against white privilege now the video isn't out yet it's going to be
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:52.480]  our exclusively on info wars dot com in the pretty near future but we've got an exclusive quote from
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:58.560]  that video in which obama says quote i'm deeply saddened by a sense that whites are still superior
[03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:03.280]  in this country in some sense that if you sit a restaurant they're served before a kenyan is served
[03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:07.280]  if you go through customs a white person is going to have an easy time going through customs
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:13.920]  so again it emphasizes the point that obama was obsessed with these with this race baiting
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:20.000]  many many years before he came into office and of course he's turned out to be the divider
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:26.400]  in chief race relations in america you know the worst they've been for decades you've got him
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:34.400]  cozying up him embracing black lives matter a george soros funded group which is not not
[03:41:34.400 --> 03:41:41.520]  grassroots it's completely astroturf again their ideological inspiration assata chicore is a convicted
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:48.160]  cop killer who is on the fbi's most wanted domestic terrorist list we've seen their supporters kill
[03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:54.880]  cops in dalas in other cities this is a divisive group it's controlled from the top in fact you had
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:42:01.120]  original black lives matter activists one that was killed recently come out and call them out for
[03:42:01.120 --> 03:42:07.920]  what they were again a top-down controlled movement to stoke more racial division in america and obama
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:14.720]  was into that from the very beginning which is why this video is very revealing now they're trying
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.240]  to crowdfund its release because it literally cost them ten thousand dollars just to get a
[03:42:20.240 --> 03:42:27.680]  private eye to get this video out which is filmed in fact by obama's sister so again that video is
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:33.280]  going to be exclusively on info wars dot com as soon as that target for the crowdfunding is met
[03:42:33.280 --> 03:42:38.320]  which you can you know you can help support that in the article there's a link to that so again
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:45.680]  damning proof that obama was obsessed with race baiting years and years before he took office
[03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:51.600]  at the white house again that's another info wars dot com exclusive with the comments in the article
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:57.840]  moving on let's get to hillary's health now of course again we got the viral video out it
[03:42:57.840 --> 03:43:04.560]  was an issue but we reignited the issue about six weeks ago now with that viral video that got
[03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:11.440]  nearly five million views now mystery and this is at the top of drudge report what was going
[03:43:11.440 --> 03:43:15.920]  on with hillary's eyes during philly speech this is out the american mirror during a speech in
[03:43:15.920 --> 03:43:20.000]  philadelphia pennsylvania on monday democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton appeared
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:24.880]  to have something quite off about her appearance and you can view the video it's up on info wars
[03:43:24.880 --> 03:43:31.200]  dot com hillary's eyes appeared not in sync with one another as the left eye looked to be cockied
[03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:36.960]  and displaced especially as she looked towards the left the montage of hillary's eye catching moments
[03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:43.440]  before a small group of temple university students can be seen in the footage and again one eye is
[03:43:43.440 --> 03:43:51.520]  off in one direction another is off in the other direction absolutely bizarre footage given that
[03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:56.560]  it's complemented by all these other issues of course by hillary's major collapse in new york
[03:43:56.560 --> 03:44:05.280]  just a couple of weeks ago jimmy fallon had to help hillary onto the tonight show stage again
[03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:10.480]  this is out the american mirror during hillary clinton's entrance on the tonight show host jimmy
[03:44:10.480 --> 03:44:15.360]  fallon who of course was panned merely for having donald trump on his show a few days ago
[03:44:15.920 --> 03:44:25.280]  gave her a firm grasp and hand up two stairs onto the stage just two steps and thick hillary clinton
[03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:32.720]  had trouble making it onto the stage his mark dies with some commentary on that clip jimmy fallon
[03:44:32.720 --> 03:44:38.160]  had to literally help hillary clinton climb onto the stage on the tonight show on monday she wasn't
[03:44:38.160 --> 03:44:44.320]  wearing high heels so either jimmy fallon is sexist thinking that a woman can't walk up two simple
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:50.320]  steps on her own two feet or hillary clinton as she's been shown in the past has a hard time
[03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:56.320]  maintaining her balance and climbing up stairs we're standing for long periods of time have a
[03:44:56.320 --> 03:45:03.280]  look at the clip here he disguises his help as just a simple handshake but as you can clearly see
[03:45:03.280 --> 03:45:09.680]  he is helping her up you can see he's actually biting his lip trying to cover up his smirk as
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:17.680]  he realizes that he has to help this poor woman step up two simple steps meanwhile donald trump is
[03:45:17.680 --> 03:45:24.240]  climbing over concrete barriers while he was campaigning after a mob of thugs blocked a free
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:30.160]  way earlier this summer during one of his campaign events last week when fallon had donald trump on
[03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:35.920]  the show liberals absolutely freaked out and it was trending because they thought that they treated
[03:45:35.920 --> 03:45:43.520]  quote hitler too nice hillary clinton's pre-planned jokes written by the studio fell flat and barely
[03:45:43.520 --> 03:45:48.880]  got any laughter out of the audience and jimmy fallon wore a surgical mask as soon as she came
[03:45:48.880 --> 03:45:54.560]  out the stage because he was afraid to get sick as most people know now hillary clinton has serious
[03:45:54.560 --> 03:45:59.440]  health problems despite the campaign and the liberal media claiming for months that it was just
[03:45:59.440 --> 03:46:06.480]  a conspiracy theory now after the shocking footage of her collapse at the 9-11 memorial her coughing
[03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:12.480]  fits and her pneumonia people now are starting to realize something is seriously wrong with hillary
[03:46:12.480 --> 03:46:18.800]  clinton still unable to step up two simple short steps to get on to the tonight's show stage i'm
[03:46:18.800 --> 03:46:22.960]  mark dice thanks for watching subscribe to my channel here if you're new and stay tuned new
[03:46:22.960 --> 03:46:30.160]  reports every day so i'll see you soon okay there's mark dice with commentary on sick hillary's
[03:46:30.160 --> 03:46:36.320]  latest medical episode another headline out of american mirror mystery again we've covered that
[03:46:36.320 --> 03:46:41.280]  jimmy fallon helps hillary up on tonight's show stage we've had mark dice's commentary on that
[03:46:41.280 --> 03:46:46.160]  here's another headline tired after today hillary has nothing on public calendar until
[03:46:46.160 --> 03:46:54.880]  debate in six days so 49 50 days before the presidential election but that's not stopping
[03:46:54.880 --> 03:47:00.320]  hillary clinton from apparently laying low for the next six of them clinton held a rally at
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:04.560]  temple university and according to a public schedule posted at hillary speeches dot com
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:12.000]  she has nothing public planned until the first presidential debate on september 26 so again
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:18.080]  you've got these polls tightening the race virtually neck and neck you would think that hillary
[03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:23.680]  to the best of her ability given that she's a walking zombie now apparently would at least
[03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:29.600]  be maintaining the same schedule but she's going to be even more absent from the campaign trail
[03:47:29.600 --> 03:47:36.960]  even as she's lost her lead over donald trump what does that tell you about her medical stay
[03:47:36.960 --> 03:47:42.720]  again they can't legitimately dismiss it as a conspiracy theory anymore and we've had more
[03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:47.920]  and more examples of that over the past few days let's get to another article out of life set
[03:47:48.800 --> 03:47:55.600]  nyc mayor says islamic terror vanishingly rare in the wake of a radical islamic terrorist attack
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:48:01.840]  on new york city which was a bombing yes i use the politically incorrect term bombing cnn says
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:06.400]  you can't do that anymore you know bbc says using the word terrorist is politically incorrect but
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:11.200]  we're going to continue to do it because we're interested in reality in the wake of a radical
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:16.160]  islamic terrorist attack on new york city mayor bill de blasio is telling citizens not to worry
[03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:21.440]  about the threat of jihadist violence and pushing for even more questionably vetted migrants to be
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:30.000]  resettled in the united states now again he was visited by the mayor of paris which i was in paris
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:38.480]  a couple of weeks ago is now a basically an open air migrant camp you've got migrants mostly men
[03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:45.120]  99% men with mattresses just splayed out in the middle of the street sitting there all day
[03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:51.680]  it's an open air migrant camp you've got the mayor of the islamic caliphate of london uh
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:58.320]  sadeek khan also writing an editorial again with bill de blasio new york mayor in which they should
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:06.240]  say that militant violence is vanishingly rare vanishingly rare from refugees from migrants
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:11.760]  despite the fact that we've had this wave of attacks in europe again germany three in a row
[03:49:11.760 --> 03:49:18.240]  a couple of months ago and again they've come out with this big op-ed saying that mass migration
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:23.120]  is a positive thing this is the quote from the article and we're going to go through some of them
[03:49:23.120 --> 03:49:29.600]  refugees and other foreign-born residents bring needed skills and enhance the vitality and growth
[03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:36.560]  of local economies that's what mayor bill de blasio and sadeek khan said in this editorial well
[03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:42.640]  the problem with that is the fact completely contradict it out of the one million refugees
[03:49:42.640 --> 03:49:49.840]  coming into germany as the ft reported last month only 63 have been employed yeah that's
[03:49:49.840 --> 03:49:55.760]  really revitalizing the economy isn't it that's really putting these people to work again look
[03:49:55.760 --> 03:50:04.880]  at sweden 58 of welfare payments in sweden go to immigrants who represent just 16 of the population
[03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:11.920]  so how in any way is that revitalizing the population quote it's wrong to characterize
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:18.480]  immigrant communities as dangerous said khan and de blasio in reference to these millions of muslim
[03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:23.520]  migrants pouring into europe and if hillary clinton gets into office pouring in at record
[03:50:23.520 --> 03:50:30.320]  numbers into the us well again there's a problem with that it's called the fact german crime wave
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:36.560]  new data crime weights in germany would have remained roughly static since 2014
[03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:46.080]  yet the country recorded an extra 402 000 crimes committed by migrants over the past year so again
[03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:51.520]  completely disproven by the fact migrants are responsible for 95 percent of all crimes in
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:58.800]  sweden overrepresented by 430 percent yet khan de blasio say that it's perfectly safe we need to

[03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:36.400]  end tonight let's get into a few file news stories here cnn puts words in trump's mouth runs headline
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:42.960]  saying he wants quote racial profiling cnn has once again come under fire for manipulating the news
[03:55:42.960 --> 03:55:47.840]  to fit its own agenda as the network ran headlines saying that gp nominee donald trump called for
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:55.680]  racial profiling to combat terrorism there's just one problem with that he never used the words race
[03:55:55.680 --> 03:56:03.120]  he never used the word racial he was talking about how israel profiles to catch terrorists
[03:56:03.120 --> 03:56:11.280]  based on their behavior if they're acting suspiciously not on their race but cnn flashed up the words
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:19.360]  racial profiling over and over again cnn you know they did it with the bombing in new york
[03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:25.680]  hillary clinton came out and said this bombing they then savaged donald trump for calling it a
[03:56:25.680 --> 03:56:30.240]  bombing despite the fact that hillary had done the same and edited out the clip of her doing so
[03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:39.280]  now cnn is openly faking quotes and attributing them to donald trump to make him look bad again
[03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:47.440]  dispensed with any semblance of neutrality and impartiality now they're just brazenly inventing
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:54.480]  things that he didn't say to make him look bad let that sink in now we got another story related
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:01.840]  to trump junior in this case and again if leftist got as upset about islamic terrorism
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:08.000]  than they do skittles memes then might maybe ices would be in more trouble than they are because
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:15.040]  that is what triggered leftist this morning donald trump junior tweeted out an image of a bowl of
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:21.360]  skittles with the quote if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you would
[03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:28.880]  you take a handful that's our syrian refugee problem absolute explosion of outrage donald
[03:57:28.880 --> 03:57:36.240]  trump junior is the worst thing ever for tweeting out a meme about skittles of course he underplayed
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:45.360]  the problem because as polls show 21 percent of syrian migrant support isis so it's not just a few
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:53.600]  skittles in a bowl of 100 skittles it's actually one in five of them support isis so he actually
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:57:59.600]  underestimated the problem but now he's an evil bigger and a racist for tweeting out a meme of
[03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:06.560]  skittles of course hillary clinton the policies that she supported led to the destruction of syria
[03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:13.760]  led to thousands of deaths led to the international migrant crisis but that's okay donald trump
[03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:20.640]  junior is bad because he tweeted out a skittles meme and that is what has triggered leftist today
[03:58:20.640 --> 03:58:26.960]  again if they were as upset about islamic terrorism as they are skittles memes ices
[03:58:26.960 --> 03:58:31.600]  would be in a lot more trouble that's going to wrap it up this edition of the alex dome show alex
