[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  Google, which is owned by Alphabet Incorporated, is worth roughly 1.7 trillion dollars.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  I consider myself as an entrepreneur, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our times.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  Sergey Brin, who is, as you know, the co-founder and president of Alphabet.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  A number that rivals the GDP of some First World nations.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  This Goliath recently decided that the First Amendment no longer applies to U.S. citizens.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  Think of this as a search engine for your fact checks that can help you determine fact from fiction.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  To add claim review markup, you'll need to provide the following information.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  The URL of the article, the name of the organization that conducted the fact check.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  Once you've provided this information, you can click create to add the markup to the article.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  Google will then crawl the article and add the markup to its database.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  While others in Silicon Valley tied to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations continue to build a Trojan horse of neo-feudalism.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  Reducing that hateful content from being seen is one of the best examples how X is committed to encouraging healthy behavior online.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  Internet censorship has grown since the Obama administration to be an unregulated wild beast.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  Social media, once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Fast forward to 2023 and the barely acknowledged federal lawsuit, Missouri versus Biden,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  is revealing a cancerous censorship network that grew between big tech U.S. intelligence agencies and the Biden administration.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  While given cover by a mockingbird media that violently drowned the First Amendment in favor of a level of totalitarianism that directly threatens national security.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and they're killing people.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  Judge Terry Doty calling the Biden administration's efforts a massive attack against free speech and targeted suppression of conservative ideas.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  The decision means top White House officials and several federal agencies,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  including the FBI and the Department of Justice, cannot communicate with social media companies for the purpose of urging,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free speech.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  Had a big couple of weeks here, Stuart, with uncovering really a vast censorship enterprise.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  At least 45 folks from the Biden administration were in constant communication with these social media platforms to censor and suppress speech.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  Had weekly calls on censorship calls. These social media platforms were changing their terms of service to deplatform folks.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  And in addition to that, you had literally a high ranking Facebook official texting the Surgeon General of the United States saying,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  hey, we did what you asked, what more can we do?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  As the New York Post reported, so far, 67 officials or agencies, including the FBI,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  have been accused in the lawsuit of violating the First Amendment by pressuring Facebook, Twitter and Google to censor users for alleged misinformation or disinformation.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  The problem is the miss and disinformation proved to be true.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  Right. Who makes the decision of what's disinformation, what's truthful and what's not?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  I mean, after all, we saw a Russia hoax for years and that turned out not to be true.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  We saw the doctors in front of the Supreme Court building talking about potential other treatments.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  And those videos were all taken down. Now we know that those treatments could have saved many lives.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Unhindered, the Department of Defense contracted a New York based A.I. company to deploy software to target disinformation on social media in real time.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  Meanwhile, Google continues to interfere in U.S. elections, pioneer the forced entry of A.I.'s deep mind into our personal lives and replace the propagandist Mockingbird media with A.I. journalists,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  while creating an online media ecosystem that will eliminate disinformation, a.k.a. independent journalism.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  However, Section 230 continues to shield big tech from a tsunami of lawsuits.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  As our bought and paid for do nothing Congress allows Google to quickly replace them with a one world government.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  That is an incredibly important report. It's in band on video. Get it and share it. Let's stop these monsters.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you love and people want it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  And it funds our Operation 360 Win Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  Jam packed a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation and empowers your neurological system.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  You name it. I mean, it's just so amazing. God gave it to us.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there. Other leading brands are like 70 percent humanoid.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  Most brands are five percent human. And that still does a great thing for you. This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  Ninety five percent humanoid. I am so glad this is back.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  I have been out of this myself for months. We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula back in stock. Twenty five percent off info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:18.971]  Big brother mainstream media government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well so does
[00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:29.851]  he? Live from the info wars dot com studios, it's Alex Jones. Sleepwalking into Armageddon,
[00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:41.651]  sleepwalking into thermonuclear war. The psychopaths running Ukraine out of the US government are
[00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:49.931]  marching us directly down the threat ladder of escalation or up the ladder to hell. And
[00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:59.731]  that's where we are here today. And I'm not resigned about this but I've really I guess
[00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:06.851]  let it settle into my psyche, settle into my soul that this is happening and that I
[00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:10.291]  would be lying to myself and lying to you if I did not tell you there's a very good
[00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:18.571]  chance that most of us will be dead soon. There is a normalcy bias in living your life where
[00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:23.171]  you just think everything's going to go on great forever and then you go to work one
[00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:29.171]  day and you get a call and your wife's been t-boned with your son or daughter and your
[00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:32.571]  wife's dead and your son's fighting for his life. You see those stories all the time
[00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.731]  it's happened to many of you that are watching and listening. And it just sets in that wow
[00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:41.811]  this this really happened and then four or five six days later you're burying your loved ones
[00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:58.051]  or your son or daughters in a coma. Now that's on a mini scale and basically the globalists,
[00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:07.491]  to use another car wreck analogy, are racing around on a Saturday night at about 10 p.m.
[00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:15.131]  running every red light they can just hoping somebody pulls out in front of them and they
[00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:20.691]  can t-bone them. That's what they're doing. So I don't know exactly when they're gonna run
[00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:25.291]  into somebody. I don't know exactly when the crash is gonna happen but if you drive around
[00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:30.131]  in say downtown Austin 100 miles an hour through red lights you're gonna kill somebody,
[00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:32.331]  probably yourself too. It's gonna happen.
[00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:40.039]  Might take five minutes, might take an hour. You're gonna be in a horrible car accident.
[00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.919]  And so we're all strapped in this car racing around at 100 miles an hour on a Saturday
[00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:49.799]  night and people are coming out of restaurant parking lots and people are going to the grocery
[00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:54.358]  store and people are coming home from the football game and we're just all strapped
[00:08:54.358 --> 00:09:01.618]  in with these lunatic psychopaths. I mean yesterday, here's just a microcosm. Mitch
[00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:08.179]  McConnell's doctor came out and said, oh he's never frozen and he's not having any mental problems.
[00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:14.499]  And the White House press secretary says Biden did a perfect job in Maui and
[00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:16.659]  has really responded well to it.
[00:09:19.618 --> 00:09:23.699]  And it just goes on and on from there. Little things like that. I mean Biden doesn't even know
[00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:27.779]  where he is now. They're starting to make their moves to remove him. Now they're saying,
[00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.338]  oh it's going to be avenuesome. That's all over the news.
[00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:35.858]  That man is a completely psychopathic demon.
[00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:41.059]  And of course the World War III issue is World War III has already begun,
[00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:48.819]  declares Ukrainian security chief. We'll put the full show headline up there.
[00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:54.179]  I'll read that for radio listeners. Nuclear war alert, head of Ukrainian military declares World
[00:09:54.179 --> 00:10:00.499]  War III has begun. Must watch live transmission. I mean I think that's self-explanatory, isn't it?
[00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:07.299]  So let's just be honest about that statement. It's completely true.
[00:10:09.939 --> 00:10:15.779]  And the Russians are escalating. The West is escalating. And we're in the Russians' backyard.
[00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:21.539]  George Soros brags on CNN nine years ago that he helped overthrow the Ukrainian government.
[00:10:22.098 --> 00:10:25.459]  We've been in this proxy war since then and now it's going into a hot war.
[00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:31.139]  U.S. troops are over there dying. Heavier weapons are being sent in, F-16s.
[00:10:33.618 --> 00:10:39.779]  And it's complete insanity. Absolute insanity.
[00:10:45.218 --> 00:10:50.338]  What are we going to do about it? And that's really the thing. When I look at our enemies,
[00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:56.019]  and I'm talking about Alexander Soros and people like that, these are really screwed up people.
[00:10:56.019 --> 00:11:00.579]  I mean you can go research him and go watch his college thesis speeches and just
[00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:08.338]  see his activity. I've done a deep dive on him. And the man is a psychotic demon
[00:11:09.138 --> 00:11:15.138]  who through his philanthropy causes the collapse of countries, the theft of pension funds,
[00:11:15.138 --> 00:11:21.218]  mass crime, death, letting hardened murderers out of jail after like two days.
[00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:30.739]  It's the total destruction of our civilization. And then you look at the scum that's doing it.
[00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:33.218]  And you look at all the other people that take the money.
[00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:42.419]  It's now over a thousand DAs and county attorneys that they own. 20, at least 21
[00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:48.819]  state attorney generals. You see the weaponization, what these DAs do to Trump and
[00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:55.218]  anybody else gets in their way. They can commit any crime they want,
[00:11:55.218 --> 00:12:00.179]  any amount of money laundering, any amount of corruption. And then they constantly hound us
[00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:06.978]  inventing things we've done that we haven't done. The good people, the wholesome people,
[00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:13.539]  the upstanding people from upstanding families, with upstanding histories, with upstanding
[00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:21.378]  outstanding records are the bad people. And the people from bad families with horrible records
[00:12:21.378 --> 00:12:27.218]  are in control. We are in the grasp, we are in the clutches
[00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:35.378]  of basically people that would make the Joker from the Batman universe blush.
[00:12:37.618 --> 00:12:43.618]  Nihilistic crazies. And if you've studied criminology, it's fascinating.
[00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:48.179]  There's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo that goes into it, but here's the final equation.
[00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:55.539]  Even high functioning psychopaths that kill 20, 30, 40 people almost always
[00:12:57.618 --> 00:13:04.179]  get reckless at the end. Whereas they were careful up front, their own subconscious
[00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:08.659]  program, even though they're innately evil, and once in control of their cerebral cortex is
[00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:14.419]  anti-human, the cells of their body want to stop them.
[00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:24.259]  There's still some human essence there. So they start getting reckless, they start bragging,
[00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:28.499]  they start trying to get caught. And that's what all this is. That's why they
[00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:33.779]  just push the most incredible pedophilia and the most insane corruption and the most
[00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:39.858]  antithetically anti-logical statements, like two men can have a baby and they're an X and Y
[00:13:39.858 --> 00:13:45.618]  chromosomes don't exist. That's a more ridiculous statement than saying the tooth fairy exists
[00:13:45.618 --> 00:13:49.779]  to say it doesn't exist. And they teach in textbooks, there's no chromosomes.
[00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:56.338]  So they actually teach two plus two equals five in public schools all over the country.
[00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:03.138]  I saw a graphic I meant to cover two days ago and I sent it to the crew.
[00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:06.259]  You guys are geniuses at finding stuff quickly. It was from Twitter.
[00:14:07.378 --> 00:14:14.259]  And it shows that yellow-toothed teacher in Colorado with a handsome little boy,
[00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:21.699]  conservative, nicely dressed boy scout type. And he's got a little Gadsden flag on his backpack
[00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:27.059]  and she says, that's not allowed. Well, in the graphic, it shows the door of the classroom
[00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:30.898]  is all the leftist flags and LGBTQ, all that crap.
[00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:38.499]  And she says, but your flag's not allowed. And then that literally is happening everywhere
[00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:45.218]  in colleges and best buys and businesses, the latest James O'Keefe investigation.
[00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.138]  Yeah, there it is. Go ahead and take the lower third down, thanks.
[00:14:48.819 --> 00:14:52.579]  Yeah, leave that up. I'm going to skip the break. Just leave that up for a couple minutes.
[00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:58.179]  Satire, that's real. No flags allowed in this school.
[00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:07.299]  And so the best buy employee
[00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:19.299]  shot video of their computer nerds office that was in there or other services,
[00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:26.739]  rent a nerd or whatever it's called. And we've all seen the trucks. I've never used them,
[00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:31.138]  but I've been in best buy. I've seen them, you know, the geek squad, geek squad,
[00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:36.338]  thanks. I was thinking of the name and the guy goes, Hey man, I'm not against any,
[00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:39.378]  you know, these gay people or whatever, but what's going on in the office.
[00:15:39.378 --> 00:15:45.218]  There's flags and signs and just crap everywhere. And the LGBT, you know, P
[00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:52.019]  flag and just all of it. And the whole queer theory thing is about pedophilia at its base
[00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:54.499]  by its founders. And they said, well,
[00:15:57.138 --> 00:16:01.779]  you're not allowed to have a cross on your shirt or a cross around your neck or a cross
[00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:05.539]  at your desk. She said, can I have a cross at my desk? Cause I've been told I can't. No, you
[00:16:05.539 --> 00:16:11.779]  can't because you're not going to force that on us. You're not born a Christian. We can't
[00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:15.699]  help it. If we're gay, we're born this way. So we're going to put this everywhere. I mean,
[00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:22.098]  it's bullying one way street, total censorship, an absolute cult. And if you just joined us,
[00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:25.299]  it's so powerful. I think I'm going to air it again.
[00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:31.138]  As John bounds, new report and everything he says in there is true, but he puts it so
[00:16:31.138 --> 00:16:37.059]  much in five minutes. He just spends 30 seconds on what Google announced with the EU two weeks
[00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:43.618]  ago and what has officially been done. Google will now delist
[00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:55.618]  everyone except for a handful of news sites that they certify. And if you want even per article,
[00:16:55.618 --> 00:16:59.939]  cause your site won't ever be searchable by Google, not Google news, not Google web.
[00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:03.299]  You won't be able to get to it. They're going to block you completely from the search engine.
[00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:11.938]  And then per article, you've got to send it through their computer, their AI, and it will tell you
[00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:20.099]  if it's accurate or not, and we'll allow it to then be searchable. Now all the big globalist
[00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.259]  groups, they're the ones that are already certified. So they don't even have to run
[00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:29.938]  it through a computer program, but anybody else, Oh, you have an ability to come here and have
[00:17:29.938 --> 00:17:35.458]  it searchable, but each article you want to be searchable, you've got to go apply to us.
[00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:40.978]  And they can always change those standards as they go. And they admit that the W E F and the
[00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:47.458]  UN and the EU, along with the ADL, the CIA, and the FBI, and hundreds of other consortium
[00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:54.418]  groups in Wolf packs or piranha schools or locust swarms
[00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:01.458]  say is okay. And then you're, Oh, well be nice to the ADL.
[00:18:04.498 --> 00:18:08.978]  They're just defending Jews. And then if you don't want to be surveilled and censored and
[00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:14.659]  controlled about medicine, about your body, about open borders, about election fraud,
[00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:20.899]  about new lockdowns, about Afghan withdrawals, there's hundreds of subjects and they're adding
[00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:27.779]  new ones all the time that are prasada non grata from the word go is not going to be searchable.
[00:18:28.418 --> 00:18:33.458]  Google has over 90% of the world searches. And every time a new search engine pops up
[00:18:34.659 --> 00:18:37.219]  and gets popular, Google or somebody else buys them.
[00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:46.099]  So this is the same as you get a knock on the door and a guy's in the delivery outfit and you
[00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:50.899]  go, Hey, what's going on? And they shove a gun up under your throat and say, go sit on the
[00:18:50.899 --> 00:18:55.059]  couch. I'm tying you up. Where's the, where's the jewelry, but they're not just taking your
[00:18:55.059 --> 00:19:01.458]  jewelry. They're taking everything. You've got the right to your body, the right to communicate
[00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:05.299]  the right when you're being attacked to say something, whether you're in a group or whether
[00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:10.179]  you're an individual. I mean, this is the change baby going on your body.
[00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:16.978]  And if you don't want Ukrainian war, hell, they won't just censor you and call you a Russian
[00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:22.019]  agent. They will all over the world. Now people are being killed in their houses.
[00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:27.859]  They're being blown up. They're being burned to death by Ukrainian literal Azov battalion,
[00:19:28.498 --> 00:19:35.699]  men and women with swastika tattoos are going around killing people all over the place.
[00:19:38.498 --> 00:19:44.418]  So we are being raped. We are being abused. We had been captured
[00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:52.659]  and the dungeon is fortifying the doors right now. If we politically with our will
[00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:55.699]  through the legislatures, through the attorney generals that we've got
[00:19:55.699 --> 00:20:00.739]  that are starting to figure this out and starting to talk about it, starting to investigate it.
[00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:07.859]  The door is a heavy fortified wooden door right now, but we're still men. So if you need to,
[00:20:08.418 --> 00:20:14.498]  you can, you can, you can run into that thing, even though it's got metal hinges and a metal
[00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:20.978]  lock, you can break it down. Your shoulder's not going to feel good later, but you can,
[00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:26.498]  you can break through that door folks. They are now pulling up with delivery trucks
[00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:36.739]  with giant steel doors and steel cage to put around us. So the steel cages are going up.
[00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:40.899]  Okay. And you think all this do my job. We'll keep my head down. No, no. They're coming for
[00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:44.978]  your children. They're coming to brainwash them. They're coming to literally mutilate them.
[00:20:44.978 --> 00:20:50.739]  It's really true that pedophilia is their operating system
[00:20:50.739 --> 00:20:53.299]  and their currency. Cause if you'll do that, you'll do anything.
[00:20:56.899 --> 00:21:01.938]  And it's, it's horrible. And when they get their full control in, cause the last
[00:21:01.938 --> 00:21:07.619]  cupboard release was just a test. Once they get their system in place,
[00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:13.859]  they're going to release a real virus or a nanotech system. You saw the Pentagon talking
[00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:18.659]  about yesterday. And so everybody needs to understand. And I'm talking to people that
[00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:21.859]  work for the system, whether you work in the corporate system, the governmental system,
[00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:27.458]  anywhere you understand wife, as you know, it's over and you can pretend you're part
[00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:31.219]  of the power structure. You can pretend if you go along with this monster, it's going to eat
[00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:38.259]  you last. And there's such a fundamental laziness and a fundamental. I see people,
[00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:42.339]  particularly young people went out of the grocery store or a coffee shop or sitting in traffic.
[00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:48.259]  I'm very observant. And you'll just see the teenage kids just laying there with a phone
[00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:51.938]  while their parents drive. They have no desire to drive a car. They have no desire to date.
[00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:56.259]  And you look at them and they're, they're asleep. They're in a trance.
[00:21:57.938 --> 00:22:02.659]  So we have these psychotics who are completely out of control and are always one-upping each
[00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:09.219]  other. So there's a evolution in this, a social Darwinistic predator class that are replacing
[00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:14.739]  each other with worse and worse predators all the time to where you're just dealing with just
[00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:22.498]  absolute madmen psychotics with a total lust for mad scientist. Hell is the best way to describe
[00:22:22.498 --> 00:22:28.498]  them. That's their, that's where the top of the pyramid in this gold rush for immortality and
[00:22:28.498 --> 00:22:32.339]  singularity and worshipping AI gods. I mean, that's what it is.
[00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:40.259]  And we're just expendable genetic information and research information
[00:22:40.978 --> 00:22:46.019]  like booster rockets on the space shuttle. And we just fall away
[00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:53.299]  and they ascend, but of course they're not going to ascend. If there were two globalists left
[00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:57.379]  in the world, cause you know, they're not going to stop at 500 million people. They say,
[00:22:57.379 --> 00:23:01.699]  we're going to leave 500 million alive. That's official UN official WEF. They're not going to
[00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:08.498]  stop it at 500 million that they love killing people. They love controlling people. You could
[00:23:08.498 --> 00:23:20.819]  be down to two Rothschilds or two King Charles in this process of evil, in a high tower together,
[00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:26.339]  who've killed everybody. And they both got live essentially technologies and they,
[00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:30.339]  and they think they're immortal and all the rest of it. They won't really be what they were,
[00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:34.978]  but there'll be a thing that does go on an entity in their own statements.
[00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:39.139]  And those two would start trying to kill each other.
[00:23:40.498 --> 00:23:45.219]  So it's beyond the Pandora's box. It's a countdown to total destruction.
[00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:52.739]  And I'm just really sad about it. And I'm very, very resigned, but I really understand now when
[00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:58.259]  Christ said, forgive them father for they do not forgive them father because they know not
[00:23:58.259 --> 00:24:10.339]  what they do. It is a process of hubris and arrogance and chutzpah.
[00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:16.659]  It is a process of only thinking one dimensionally, even when they think they're thinking
[00:24:16.659 --> 00:24:23.779]  multidimensionally. And it's really because they're so selfish and don't care about anybody,
[00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:27.299]  including themselves, because people that don't care about others,
[00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:30.339]  they think they've got a leg up because they don't care about anybody.
[00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:35.139]  They think that's an advantage. And it is until you program the entire system
[00:24:35.139 --> 00:24:39.458]  to be sociopathic. And by that, I mean, it's predatorily at a beast level.
[00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:45.299]  At some point you can see it as only caring about yourself, gets you material goods and
[00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:50.259]  centralizes control and gives you a power trip. But then things like that kind of
[00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:57.059]  lower the overall success of the system and productivity, ingenuity, and freedom
[00:24:57.779 --> 00:25:05.699]  and camaraderie and love and passion and honor and will and civilizational society and culture.
[00:25:06.978 --> 00:25:10.019]  Look at the globalist culture. It's pure death. It's ugly. It's stupid. It's bad
[00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:12.579]  because they don't want you to have anything beautiful to lift you up.
[00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:15.219]  But the process, they lower themselves down even more.
[00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:24.418]  But at a sick level of just transactional one-dimensional thinking, yes, you could say
[00:25:24.418 --> 00:25:27.779]  early on, cancer is growing in the body. You can take over whatever it wants.
[00:25:28.418 --> 00:25:32.978]  It's really strong. It's great. Hey, it's the boss until it brings down the entire organism
[00:25:32.978 --> 00:25:39.458]  and the cancer itself dies with the host. And we're stage four cancer.
[00:25:40.418 --> 00:25:47.458]  The planet is absolutely infested with evil. And they are themselves aware of that.
[00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:52.659]  And that's why they say, oh, we're really doing this to accelerate the decline
[00:25:53.699 --> 00:25:57.859]  so that we can then start the cycle over and it will be nice once we've got control.
[00:25:57.859 --> 00:26:03.058]  That's not the case. This is the cycle to end all cycles because they're trying to
[00:26:03.058 --> 00:26:11.619]  control that cycle. And in that process, destroy everyone, including themselves.
[00:26:12.659 --> 00:26:18.819]  It's guaranteed. It's the way it is. And you see in this cowardly system
[00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:26.978]  that it expresses the very worst of us, the most delusional, the most disconnected,
[00:26:26.978 --> 00:26:34.659]  the most arrogant. Well, it takes really hard work and serious people to run nuclear reactors
[00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:40.259]  and telecommunications systems and air traffic control and to control these bio weapon labs,
[00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:44.418]  even if you're going to have them. And as you get a more and more delusional,
[00:26:44.418 --> 00:26:48.739]  more and more evil, more and more corrupt society with greater and greater power in its
[00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:56.739]  hands, we will have what I've called the Atlantean syndrome or the Atlantean moment.
[00:26:56.819 --> 00:27:01.219]  Whether you believe Atlantis existed or not, and they've all found almost everything Plato
[00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:05.299]  said existed that they didn't even know existed. They said, oh, that was just fiction.
[00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:09.538]  And they find the cities he said were where and they find the battles he said happened.
[00:27:09.538 --> 00:27:14.018]  And he said there was this big island in the Atlantic Ocean that had flying machines
[00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:19.699]  and big mechanical automatons, exoskeletons, it's all described. And then it had a power
[00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:27.058]  source flying machines and it blew up. Now, whether that existed or not,
[00:27:28.498 --> 00:27:32.179]  and obviously it did, that's why there's same pyramids all over the world and
[00:27:32.179 --> 00:27:36.099]  they have the same systems and they find jade that's only in Japan,
[00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:40.498]  in Mexico, in the Aztec temples. I mean, there was a whole global system.
[00:27:43.058 --> 00:27:46.819]  And whatever the cataclysm was, was destroyed.
[00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:50.659]  Well, we're at that moment again.
[00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:55.779]  And they can say, oh, we released a virus and practice a lockdown
[00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:59.779]  because it's inevitable. Some terror groups can release it, but it's them doing it.
[00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:02.739]  They always have an excuse. They tell their minions, oh, we're doing this
[00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:05.699]  as a dress rehearsal. Like Sean Penn said, Sean Penn, you know, we know there's going
[00:28:05.699 --> 00:28:09.938]  to be a new bio attack that's real this time. And so we, this lockdown is good training
[00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:19.219]  for all of us. They're just training you to sit there and die in your house when
[00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:24.418]  they release the big one. So I love God. I love my family. I love you.
[00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:28.579]  And I am resigned to this. I'm going to fight it as hard as I can.
[00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:31.859]  We have souls. God's in control, but I'm just telling you,
[00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:35.058]  everybody out there that serves the devil, you're fools.
[00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:42.339]  You're absolute fools. We can turn this around. And I believe we read the Bible. We do.
[00:28:43.058 --> 00:28:49.538]  But one fourth of the world's population will be killed in the process. If you believe
[00:28:49.538 --> 00:28:54.099]  revelation, I think it's very optimistic. So you better hope it's true because there's
[00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:57.379]  a good chance everybody dies. All right. We'll be right back. Please stay with us.
[00:28:58.899 --> 00:29:01.779]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this
[00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:07.058]  morning. It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll body's ultimate formula.
[00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:12.739]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot. Please
[00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:24.498]  look how full this bottle is right to the top folks, right to the top with these 95%
[00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:31.938]  human. Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%. Some are maybe 10. The other strongest brands
[00:29:31.938 --> 00:29:40.339]  are 75%. This is 95%. Super constant. So like taking one pills, like taking
[00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:47.139]  10 of the average bill. It's that powerful or more. So they're available at info war store.com

[00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:22.410]  The man who won't bow down to the elites. It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:33.490]  It's not about not bowing down to the elites. It's about not joining Satan in destroying
[00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:42.910]  the earth. That's not why I choose God. And I am blessed and honored to be here. And any
[00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:49.810]  success we have is because of God working through you, the listeners, and this crew, so we can
[00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:55.770]  do the best job we can to take on this evil. Because never forget, God is watching
[00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:59.170]  and God is real.
[00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:05.290]  All right, here's what I want to do. I want to take your calls in the second and third
[00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:10.410]  hour. We have a guest joining us and we want to cover the new lockdowns that are rolling
[00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:17.690]  out, all the new viruses that are out there, the record level deaths that are happening.
[00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.610]  I just decided I want to do that. We already have a guest coming on, but there's so
[00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:27.950]  many articles, so many studies, so many insurance actuarials that show a 44% increase in death
[00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:37.330]  in the countries that took shots on average. That's the greatest level of death, even
[00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:42.810]  higher than World War I or World War II. And that's happening right now. And then
[00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:47.010]  the starvation from the lockdowns around the world is 80 plus million, the UN says.
[00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.890]  And I've looked at the numbers. I agree with those. And it's the UN that had the policies
[00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:54.250]  that did that and then they sit there as the sabers while they do it. I mean, those numbers
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:59.050]  don't even compute, do they? 80 something million people. We just round it down. I
[00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:04.690]  think it was like 86 million last time I checked, New York Times. And they sit
[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:12.810]  there as writers quoting the UN global food director. We played clips of him. Hell
[00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:19.090]  on earth this year, hundreds of millions now set to starve to death. And they're trying
[00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.570]  to bring in new lockdowns around the world. They've got the celebrities wearing masks
[00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:29.050]  to get on TV. It's all there. It's the same rollout. So guys, pull up some of the latest
[00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:33.730]  numbers from Edward Dowd and the insurance companies and statisticians. We need to show
[00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:40.090]  some of that, but we are adapting to being killed. We're just normalizing. And again,
[00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.290]  I want to ask people that serve the system and go along with it because I care about
[00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:52.810]  you because we're in this together. That's what empathy is. Do you feel safe in the system like
[00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:58.930]  this? I mean, you like this. You think it's cute. You, you dilute yourself. Some of you
[00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.010]  know, and then just think, Oh, that's not true. Uh, the hell it isn't.
[00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:16.569]  So, this is not a broadcast about entertainment. This is not about playing footsie with people.
[00:36:16.569 --> 00:36:25.970]  People ask me, why haven't you sold out or why don't you back now? Bashing down means
[00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:31.850]  knowing this is going on, and then having four children and not fighting to secure
[00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:37.790]  their future. Why would I not see? And that's why I make this point a lot. I'm not a hero,
[00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:43.069]  and I don't want you to think you're a hero either for fighting evil. That's what you're
[00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:48.250]  supposed to do, people. You're not a hero when you breastfeed your baby when you're
[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.370]  a woman or you change the diaper.
[00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:56.689]  You're not a hero when somebody tries to kidnap your child to fight back.
[00:36:56.689 --> 00:36:59.669]  You're doing what you're designed to do.
[00:36:59.669 --> 00:37:04.189]  And when we get to the point of realizing that what I've done, thanks to your support,
[00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:12.990]  because you understand this is the right thing to do, is the default position, like
[00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.950]  not putting your one-year-old in the backyard at night by the pool, because you know they're
[00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.830]  going to fall in and drown.
[00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:27.089]  It's not heroic when you've got a backyard pool to put a fence up around it.
[00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:28.209]  It's what you're supposed to do.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:39.740]  And that's really all I'm trying to do is saying, as a culture, we're run by people
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.460]  that are so delusional and have so much power to commit corruption that they don't understand
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.540]  they're their own worst enemy.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:53.580]  They're like a monkey that you hand a hand grenade with the pin pulled out of it.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.980]  Here monkey, here have a hand grenade.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:04.060]  And then I'm trying, the globalists are like a deranged monkey on PCP, and they've got
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.940]  a hand grenade holding the lever, and if they turn it loose, it's going to blow up and kill
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.940]  them.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.020]  And I pick the pin up and I'm like, nice monkey, here's a banana, let's put the pin
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.020]  back in.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.740]  Monkey, come here monkey.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.460]  I'm talking to the government and the globalists and all you, to the Pentagon, listen, monkey,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:29.060]  I got the banana, here, just give me, you give me the hand grenade, give me the hand
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.060]  grenade.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.540]  Sweet, come on, you can trust me, just take, I have the banana, give me the, good,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:43.340]  thank you, here's your banana, good, now let's put this hand grenade away now.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.580]  But no, you don't want me to have power.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.060]  I'm going to release the lever, okay?
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.580]  And I've read the philosophy of the globalists, they talk about we'll blow the earth up to
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:03.780]  continue willing, our nihilism is unrivaled, I've got quotes in Endgame, and it's a satanic
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.300]  lunatic spirit.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:13.020]  So, folks, I'm just trying to put the pin back in the hand grenade, and we've got
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:19.280]  all these yes-men in the government and in the corporations that are going along with
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:27.260]  insane, inbred lunatics like the royal family in England, and I've gotten to know a lot
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.020]  of people who've seen a lot of stuff in my life, I don't know any multi-generational
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.580]  billionaires whose children are not complete lunatics.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:42.020]  And they all hate themselves, and they self-harm, and they go get sex changes, and they cut
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:47.980]  themselves up because they know they're bad and they want to die, but they want to do
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.660]  it slowly.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:55.020]  Well, if they want to kill themselves, go ahead, knock yourselves out.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:00.940]  But I don't want to be on that ride with you, on that ship with you.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.780]  And so this is a no-brainer, our work is a no-brainer, we can sit here and cover
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.820]  all the facets of what they're doing and the war and the destruction of our country
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.100]  and the collapsing third world and all the things they're doing, and they're doing it
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.100]  deliberately.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.860]  They're struggling to make sure as many people as they can are trafficked.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.340]  They're struggling to make sure as much fentanyl can get in.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:25.500]  They're struggling to have the police not bust the fentanyl dealers all over the country.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.980]  They are struggling to hold us under water.
[00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:33.810]  While they are holding themselves under water too.
[00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.590]  It's like they've got bowling balls tied to themselves.
[00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.350]  They tied them to us and they're holding us to the bottom of the pool and you're sitting
[00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:44.190]  there through the water like, you're on a brown tube, let me go, let's go to the service,
[00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.190]  stop, please.
[00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.630]  They're like no, I'm going to get you, I'm going to get you.
[00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:55.350]  I got power, I got power, I got power.
[00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.350]  That's what they do.
[00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:09.310]  All right, I got a lot of news to cover and a lot of things to get into, but I went on
[00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:15.830]  the number one show in Russia for an hour last night at midnight, 8 a.m. their time.
[00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.590]  And I just told the truth there, even though I know it puts an even bigger glowing target
[00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.590]  on me from the CIA.
[00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:31.030]  Well people at the CIA, if they have any self-preservation instincts, need to stop yourselves.
[00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:37.630]  You need to quit now and it's going to become more evident by the day and by the week.
[00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.250]  And again, I'm not asking you to do some Operation Valkyrie because there's not one
[00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.290]  guy to take out.
[00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:49.050]  You have to psychologically, culturally, mentally, at the New World Order, look in the mirror,
[00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.930]  really think about what you're doing and how you've incrementally gone along with
[00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:56.430]  the lunatics and how you're destroying your own future.
[00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.170]  And there's still time for you to salvage your humanity.
[00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:06.290]  And that's the allegory of Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi, is like this guy just
[00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.290]  tried to kill me and flush me.
[00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.330]  Now he's killing my son.
[00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.090]  Why am I doing this?
[00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.890]  Why have I been serving this person for 40 years or whatever it is?
[00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:25.210]  And he grabs Palpatine and throws his ass down the reactor shaft and is saved in the
[00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:30.330]  end, is reprieved.
[00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:36.170]  We have to culturally, not murder anybody, not kill anybody, but metaphysically get
[00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:43.850]  Satan off our back and throw him down the reactor shaft.
[00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.570]  Now we're going to get ZAP, those that are willing to do it, we're all going to
[00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:47.570]  die anyways.
[00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:52.410]  So grab him, he's going to fry us, but don't sit around and wait for somebody
[00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.010]  else to do it.
[00:42:54.010 --> 00:43:21.850]  Grab him and dump him, be right back.
[00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.090]  We have not sold out of X3, it's still 40% off, but it'll be sold out today.
[00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:33.290]  X3, Infowarsstore.com or triple A 2533139 will be 10 weeks or more till we get more
[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.290]  in.
[00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.290]  It's the missing link in your body.
[00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.290]  Everybody needs to have this.
[00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.030]  It makes you resilient and a lot stronger.
[00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:43.050]  Also we have the other great products like nitric boost that is so good to clean out
[00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.090]  your blood, your heart, your brain.
[00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:50.010]  Well the natural compounds God gave us, nitric boost, everybody needs it, Infowarsstore.com
[00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:56.770]  or triple A 2533139, we've got books, films, t-shirts, water filters, more, Infowarsstore.com
[00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.770]  or triple A 2533139.
[00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:04.490]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had, I don't think anybody can
[00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:09.050]  deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.130]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:19.410]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison
[00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:23.970]  Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven
[00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:24.970]  days a week.
[00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.970]  It's really just incredible.
[00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.290]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support and only
[00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.970]  encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:36.970]  us.
[00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.690]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing
[00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:44.490]  it, but most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy
[00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.970]  great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time give us on
[00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.970]  air.
[00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:52.610]  More than less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:57.010]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding
[00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.010]  problems will be over.
[00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.330]  Please take action now.
[00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.010]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.570]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can
[00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:05.570]  be defeated.
[00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.770]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:12.290]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's
[00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:17.650]  body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with and you do it with
[00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.570]  the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:24.330]  This thing does 10,000 gallons, you can sit there and put hundreds of gallons
[00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.330]  through it a day.
[00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.970]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-
[00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:29.970]  detectable levels.
[00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.130]  This is what I use, which my family uses, it's the very best system out there
[00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.730]  for the lowest price, for a limited time, 10% off on top of that, exclusively
[00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:42.770]  at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in stock and
[00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.730]  replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.930]  Get it today and it funds the Infowars.
[00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:48.930]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.050]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the
[00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.930]  globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water
[00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:55.930]  supply.
[00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.570]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.210]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years because the
[00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.050]  price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:10.490]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.010]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try
[00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.650]  their coffees, I was blown away.
[00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.370]  We finally had three great coffees that are the best they have to offer
[00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.130]  available to you right now.
[00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.390]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.570]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever
[00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.570]  drank.
[00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are
[00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.610]  now available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively.
[00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.170]  Escape the prison planet light roast, tastes great, it's the strong one,
[00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.170]  really strong.
[00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.650]  But these are all close second and thirds, medium roast,
[00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.650]  wake of America.
[00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:43.650]  Woo!
[00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.650]  That's what my go-to.
[00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:49.210]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.210]  strong.
[00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.210]  Gives you that pep.
[00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.770]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation.
[00:46:54.770 --> 00:47:06.529]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen rule book.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:37.800]  I got a proposition for you, I got a deal for you.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:43.800]  You can get incredible compounds that God created and you can fund an operation that
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:50.240]  is blessed and has been put into the front lines by God in the fight against evil.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.120]  Now that sounds like a deal I'd take.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.160]  And God, for whatever reason, likes to keep me very hungry.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.800]  I do not like spending up to half my time just battling to stay on air and fundraise
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.560]  and defeat the enemy.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.060]  And I really don't ever pray and ask God for anything but that God lead God and direct me.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:15.200]  But I do ask God, God, it'd be so much easier if you just moved somebody's heart to make
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.120]  a bunch of big donations so we'd have plenty of money to fight the enemy.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.060]  And these are great products that people would, you know, only a fraction of our listeners
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.080]  ever go buy the products.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.200]  If more would just go do it, then we could do fabulous things.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.200]  But I'm sure in God's, I know, God's infinite wisdom, there's a reason for that.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.360]  But I do have a lot of projects I want to launch, a lot of things I want to do, I want to focus
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.340]  on information.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.200]  And I've grown up a lot, I've gotten better in many ways, I've been persecuted a lot,
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.440]  and I've realized that really made me smarter, more informed, stronger.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:55.680]  So I know in the future chapters it will be revealed why I have to scrabble around
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.400]  doing things that I can't stand.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.080]  But these really are great products, but you know, just messing with all the details
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.080]  of it is not fun.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040]  I guess God says, well, then the people need to respond.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.040]  I guess that's the way, or I need to be better at explaining it to people.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.320]  We're barely in the black and in full wars, but that's one reason to get the products
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.920]  so we can expand in the face of the enemy, not just be a stalemate.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.120]  But also, these are really great products, folks.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.920]  This is one of the strongest, highest quality formulas out there.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.440]  It's been sold out for four or five months or longer.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.000]  DNA Force Plus is finally back in stock.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.480]  It's 25% off at info-war-store.com.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.320]  And it's got the winning formula that actually is known to make your telomeres last longer.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.080]  Doesn't grow them, makes them last longer, which is basically the same thing.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.480]  DNA Force Plus, for Info Wars Live, back in stock, 25% off.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.280]  It's a very expensive product to make.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.480]  That's why it's got a price tag on it that's a little high.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.760]  But leading brands that are similar are twice the price,
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.800]  because they want to mark stuff up three, four times.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.920]  We don't do that.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:07.240]  So DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.520]  while adapting your body to handle to the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:17.400]  We know it's important to supplement your body with the most potent bioavailable antioxidants.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.560]  That's why DNA Force Plus is exactly what you need to provide yourselves with protection.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:30.320]  The powerhouse ingredients in DNA Force Plus include ELEVATP, PQQ, CoQ10,
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:37.960]  Organic Reishi, Astragalus, Minbaracokinas Root, and even more amazing ingredients.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.720]  And blood vessel health promote energy production of the body, clean out the cells,
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.400]  the mitochondria, energy production, boosting mental health,
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.240]  assisted supporting healthy skin, and more.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.440]  Now, what is this formula?
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.560]  I'm 49 now, I was 40 years old, and I was on an airplane,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.960]  and they had this big wellness clinic sponsored the magazines.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.400]  Like half the magazine was for this big fancy clinic.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.880]  And I thought, you know, I'm 40, I never go to the doctor.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.960]  Shane Steiner, my good buddy, told me about this great doctor he goes to.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.920]  This clinic is all over Texas, and they do your blood test, your genetic testing, all of it.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.880]  And I said, I'm going to go there.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.960]  It wasn't the one advertised in the magazine.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.160]  So I go, they take my blood, they do all this stuff, they get my DNA tested, the report comes back.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.400]  And the doctor comes to me, great guy, and he said, you know, we could sit there
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.520]  and got drugs and stuff with your genetics would help you, but you don't need those.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.760]  He goes, what you need is this product.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.840]  And then we just basically went and made a cross between his product and the one
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.120]  that was being advertised in the airport, airline magazine,
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.240]  with the highest organic quality.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.600]  So, and this is still the top thing in clinics.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.640]  And it's like 150 bucks in clinics, and it's 60 bucks with us.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:04.400]  So you can get it, it's amazing, and a lot of quality is in this, it's filled to the brim.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.279]  And whether you're young or old, everybody should be taking at least one of these a day.
[00:52:08.279 --> 00:52:09.800]  And I'm not a big pill guy, folks.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.080]  I know there's a big market in it, it works, it's great.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.200]  I've trained myself to take the supplements that I sell, and when I forget to do it,
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.640]  I really feel the change.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.760]  So it works, it's amazing, and DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:31.279]  Let me tell you what else works, and it works like a horse and carriage together.
[00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:35.080]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is the strongest humanoid on the market.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.560]  We went to the top manufacturer and maker, concentrator of it, and we said,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.880]  what is the strongest formula that you make?
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.680]  Because they make it for dozens of groups.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.240]  And they gave us a report back and said, the average raw turmeric has great effects,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.840]  but it's at about 5% or 4% who are humanoid.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.200]  They said, the strongest one we make is 75%.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.960]  And I said, what's the strongest you can make?
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:03.360]  And they came back and they said, we can do 95%, but it'll cost twice as much,
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.600]  and we can do 95%.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.680]  This is all tested, this is all, FDA's up everybody's ass.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.560]  I mean, this is the real, when I tell you this stuff, it's,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.600]  they got a fine tooth comb on our butt, we got white glove inspected.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.120]  This is the strongest turmeric on the market,
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.840]  and it's got a bunch of other amazing ingredients to supercharge it.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.880]  It's back in stock.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.440]  You get both these products together, 35% off.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.400]  DNA Force Plus embodies, and that's how we fund the operation.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.200]  They're amazing products, so please get yours today.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.840]  And it can be a straight donation.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.360]  You know we're fighting, you know your money's going somewhere good,
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.000]  but why not get a great product?
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.640]  That way we form a relationship with you.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.760]  That's how good works.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.920]  It's like, it's good for me to be honest.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.520]  It's good for me to bring you something good.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.200]  You get it, you love it, you keep buying it.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.320]  It's like a restaurant you go to
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.480]  that has great delicious food every time.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.040]  Never get food poisoning, you go there for 30, 40 years.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.440]  So I guess, you know, you get old or move or whatever.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.120]  It's why, it's the same thing.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.840]  I want a relationship with you.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.840]  I'm not a Satanist that wants to screw you
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.360]  and dominate you and throw you in a ditch.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.640]  I want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.640]  So that's why I bust my tail
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.800]  to try to be as accurate and truthful as I can,
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.720]  even though sometimes it's embarrassing.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.200]  I feel led by the Holy Spirit to say
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.360]  I've killed probably 10 of my children.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.400]  I don't know the full number.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.760]  I am a murderer, but God has forgiven me.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.720]  And the left always runs headlines and says,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.960]  why would this guy who's against abortion
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.080]  admit he's a hypocrite?
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.520]  It's not hypocritical.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.240]  It's like if I was an arsonist, which I would never was,
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.320]  and later I received Christ and said it was wrong
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.320]  that I used to like to go burn barns down
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.200]  or businesses down.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.120]  That's not hypocritical.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.040]  That's saying that was wrong that I did that.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.200]  And you know, I'm young.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.200]  The girls are like, hey, I'm pregnant.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.080]  Give me money.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.279]  Or I'd find out about it later.
[00:54:50.279 --> 00:54:53.120]  And then I tried to stop it a few times
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.720]  and I kind of had a conscience.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.360]  And then I just realized, hey,
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.800]  the only way to do this is to stop having sex
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.120]  because when I was younger,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.680]  I could look at a woman and get them pregnant.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.480]  And so it didn't matter if I wore a condom, any of it.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.920]  These women would get pregnant.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.840]  And I'm sure in every case it wasn't my baby.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.720]  The point was I was involved in abortions.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.440]  I would die in a millisecond for any of my four children.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.000]  Even thinking about them makes me get tears in my eyes.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.440]  And the fact that I gave birth,
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.800]  that I brought them into the world
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.480]  and someday they'll die, but they're eternal.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.480]  Their spirits are eternal.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.400]  So I want to defend them.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.279]  I want to defend their souls.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.440]  And I think about my children were chopped up,
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.320]  vacuum-cleanered out of their mother's wombs.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.640]  So I'm not a hero, folks.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.800]  I have murdered children.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.400]  But the difference is I know it was wrong
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.160]  and I repented and that I was given forgiveness
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.560]  and that I was given a mission.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.160]  And that's why I don't care if they kill me
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.880]  or put me in prison because that's penance.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.440]  God's like, okay, I'll forgive you.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.279]  But here's your mission.
[00:56:01.279 --> 00:56:03.600]  I literally was told, here's your mission.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.600]  Here's your mission.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.640]  And you will be forgiven if you truly repent
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.320]  and you follow these directives.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.560]  Now it's your choice.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.960]  Just like the devil has a contract.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.200]  Contract, sign that contract and it's going to be painful.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.400]  You ready for this?
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.480]  Yes, sir, I am.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.080]  Let me sign my name right here.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.720]  I am so sorry.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.360]  Thank you for creating me.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.840]  You are so amazing.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.960]  There's my signature.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.160]  I am on board.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.000]  You tell me what to do.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.240]  And have you seen what we've done?
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.240]  Have you seen how real this God is?
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.480]  Yes.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.520]  And that God tells me to tell you I'm a dirty murderer.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.160]  And that's what's important.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.720]  All these people that commit these sins and evil
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.440]  harden their heart when the Holy Spirit comes
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.080]  and says, this is wrong.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.520]  And they don't go, oh my God, I'm sorry, you're right.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.279]  And I accept that I'm wrong.
[00:56:58.279 --> 00:57:00.120]  And I will now follow the mission.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.279]  Instead they go, screw you God.
[00:57:02.279 --> 00:57:04.800]  And that's why abortion leads to Satanism
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.279]  and all the rest of it and depression and death
[00:57:07.279 --> 00:57:09.440]  because we know it's wrong.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.120]  If you had an abortion and you didn't know,
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.200]  say you're sorry to God.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.440]  And tell God, tell you what to do
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.240]  because faith without works is dead.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.680]  And you can then be separated from the evil
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.680]  you've been part of.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.120]  If you don't, you're going to be put in the Phantom Zone
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.200]  with the rest of the other bad spirits.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.520]  As this energy doesn't go away,
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.320]  it's just simply transferred.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.400]  Your number one mission
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.200]  should be separating yourself from Satan
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.760]  and getting as close under God's wings as you can.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.400]  We'll be back with our number two.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.240]  Stay with us.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.080]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.279]  Help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility,
[00:58:17.279 --> 00:58:20.360]  assist in joint function, bolster your immune system
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.720]  and so much more.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.880]  Regular turmeric from the store contains
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.080]  about one to 5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.880]  but our super powerful extract using bodies
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.720]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.080]  No other product can compare
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.240]  with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.320]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.120]  to the test, then look no further.

[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.440]  With the supply chain breakdowns
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.920]  and all the problems in the economy,
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.279]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver
[00:59:01.279 --> 00:59:04.320]  for almost three years back in stock.

[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.960]  from the top lab.

[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.680]  but if you want to experience
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.160]  and have in your medicine cabinet,

[00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:57.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:06.470]  Google, which is owned by Alphabet Incorporated, is worth roughly $1.7 trillion.
[01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:14.470]  I consider myself as an entrepreneur, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our times, Sergey Brin,
[01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:19.470]  who is, as you know, the co-founder and president of Alphabet.
[01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:23.470]  A number that rivals the GDP of some First World nations.
[01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:30.470]  This Goliath recently decided that the First Amendment no longer applies to U.S. citizens.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:35.470]  Think of this as a search engine for your fact checks that can help you determine fact from fiction.
[01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:40.470]  To add claim review markup, you'll need to provide the following information.
[01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:45.470]  The URL of the article, the name of the organization that conducted the fact check.
[01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:50.470]  Once you've provided this information, you can click create to add the markup to the article.
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:54.470]  Google will then crawl the article and add the markup to its database.
[01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:59.470]  While others in Silicon Valley tied to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations
[01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:03.470]  continue to build a Trojan horse of neo-feudalism.
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:16.470]  Reducing that hateful content from being seen is one of the best examples how X is committed to encouraging healthy behavior online.
[01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:23.470]  Internet censorship has grown since the Obama administration to be an unregulated wild beast.
[01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:27.470]  Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good?
[01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:33.470]  Social media, once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity,
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:44.470]  has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.
[01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:51.470]  Fast forward to 2023 and the barely acknowledged federal lawsuit, Missouri versus Biden,
[01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:59.470]  is revealing a cancerous censorship network that grew between big tech US intelligence agencies and the Biden administration,
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:05.470]  while given cover by a mockingbird media that violently drowned the First Amendment
[01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:11.470]  in favor of a level of totalitarianism that directly threatens national security.
[01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:16.470]  The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and they're killing people.
[01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:22.470]  Judge Terry Doty calling the Biden administration's efforts a massive attack against free speech
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.470]  and targeted suppression of conservative ideas.
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:29.470]  The decision means top White House officials and several federal agencies,
[01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:34.470]  including the FBI and the Department of Justice, cannot communicate with social media companies
[01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:41.470]  for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner the removal,
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:46.470]  deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free speech.
[01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:51.470]  Got a big couple of weeks here, Stuart, with uncovering really a vast censorship enterprise.
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:57.470]  At least 45 folks from the Biden administration were in constant communication
[01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:02.470]  with these social media platforms to censor and suppress speech.
[01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:05.470]  Had weekly calls on censorship calls.
[01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:09.470]  These social media platforms were changing their terms of service to deplatform folks.
[01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:14.470]  And in addition to that, you had literally a high ranking Facebook official texting the Surgeon General
[01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.470]  of the United States saying, hey, we did what you asked. What more can we do?
[01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:24.470]  As the New York Post reported, so far, 67 officials or agencies, including the FBI,
[01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:29.470]  have been accused in the lawsuit of violating the First Amendment by pressuring Facebook,
[01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:35.470]  Twitter and Google to censor users for alleged misinformation or disinformation.
[01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:40.470]  The problem is the mis- and disinformation proved to be true.
[01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:44.470]  Right. Who makes the decision of what's disinformation, what's truthful and what's not?
[01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:48.470]  I mean, after all, we saw a Russia hoax for years and that turned out not to be true.
[01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:53.470]  We saw the doctors in front of the Supreme Court building talking about potential other treatments
[01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:58.470]  and those videos were all taken down. Now we know that those treatments could have saved many lives.
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:03.470]  Unhindered, the Department of Defense contracted a New York based
[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:08.470]  A.I. company to deploy software to target disinformation on
[01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:13.470]  social media in real time. Meanwhile, Google continues to
[01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:18.470]  interfere in U.S. elections, pioneer the forced entry of
[01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:23.470]  A.I.'s deep mind into our personal lives and replace the propagandist
[01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:28.470]  Mockingbird media with A.I. journalists while creating an online
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:33.470]  media ecosystem that will eliminate disinformation, a.k.a.
[01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:38.470]  independent journalism. However, Section 230 continues to
[01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:43.470]  shield big tech from a tsunami of lawsuits as our bought and paid for
[01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:48.470]  do-nothing Congress allows Google to quickly replace them with a
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:53.470]  one world government. John Bound reporting.
[01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:58.470]  Google will conquer the United States and do more than that if we don't stop them.
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:03.470]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.470]  really, really good news because it's a great product you love and people want it.

[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:15.620]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:22.819]  you're listening to the alex jones show all right there are two false narratives being
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.020]  in the press today
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.819]  and the republicans like ryan paul are not doing it on purpose but he is a medical doctor
[01:06:31.939 --> 01:06:35.299]  and i know he pushed the shot at first with trump so he's being like trump
[01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:39.540]  that trump's gone further now saying we should investigate the shots may be bad
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.700]  he said that a few days ago on a show i meant to get to it we'll play that this hour like a
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:49.700]  three-minute clip but there's a narrative that everything's fine and nobody's dying and there
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:55.459]  is no covid and it's you know it's just the flu it's just a cold and there is no virus so you
[01:06:55.459 --> 01:07:03.220]  basically heard that talk and then on the other side it's oh my gosh it's terrible and we need
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.660]  masking for everybody and the president's going to wear a mask and here it is schools across
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:15.140]  america bring back covid masks in classrooms amid rise and infections colleges are saying you
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:20.980]  got to have the new quote booster you can't go yes as we told you two and a half weeks ago
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.700]  they're rolling it out in mid-september it's just begun and you know they're not going to
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:31.620]  change course so by the 15th i expect they'll go ahead and say okay tsa workers got to wear a
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:38.259]  mask unless they change course and in my experience they don't but at least we're not caught unaware
[01:07:38.259 --> 01:07:50.100]  so in between those two stories is nothing's going on or it's the end of the world cupboards back
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.020]  and the truth is not in between it's a totally different subject
[01:07:57.299 --> 01:08:04.819]  i read hundreds of articles a day i scan three four hundred more i watch
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:13.220]  50 100 videos a day i interview all the experts that we can get on i know you're tuned in you're
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.900]  informed as well i'm just saying there's a lot of knowledge here and it's hard to condense it
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.940]  we're going to talk about the next few hours and taking calls our special guest
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:31.700]  but what i'm trying to get at here is i know when i got co but it wasn't that i've been
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.660]  hyped up and pre-programmed that this was bad when i got delta
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:47.620]  two plus years ago he almost killed rob do almost died our news director almost killed my dad
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:54.019]  and i felt like a gorilla was sitting on my chest for a week and if i wouldn't have had
[01:08:54.019 --> 01:08:59.540]  the bedesedine and the other things i mean my wife is healthy as a horse she got it after
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.500]  me and she's like i go to the hospital i can't breathe i said baby just take the
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.740]  bedesedine take avermectin and she's like oh gosh yeah it feels a lot better i don't
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.340]  i mean you know she's but when she got sick she was 40 something years old
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:16.660]  and she'd been around she's like i've never felt anything like this i can't breathe
[01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:46.910]  because it has that constricting you've never had asthma i've never experienced asthma i'm told that's what asthma is like i mean it's like an asthma doctor so so yeah it's real okay yeah there's a cooked up virus yeah they inject this with something that creates prions that slough that i just showed you pending on videos in 2017 saying we'll release this it will cause strokes heart attacks they'll think it's a virus but it's really a self self-replicating nanotech
[01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:58.590]  we've developed and then we have eco-help alliance in 2017 approaching trump saying we're going to release it in china to quote study it and the pentagon said are you crazy that's biological warfare that's world war three
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:10.299]  just like biden said sending abrams tanks or f-16s to ukraine is world war three but now they're doing it
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.780]  so i've had edward doubt on i've had the statisticians on they've had the congressional hearings
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:26.219]  the deaths in 2020 were nothing it was hype it was mainly flu then the vaccine comes in it starts
[01:10:26.219 --> 01:10:32.299]  replicating it starts shedding that's what it was doing then people get prion infections
[01:10:32.299 --> 01:10:40.059]  and it was a hundred percent real and the death numbers don't go up in 2020 2021 2022 23
[01:10:40.059 --> 01:10:45.259]  they're going straight up and it's the vaccinated that are mainly doing it but
[01:10:45.259 --> 01:10:50.620]  they're also shedding i can see it i have the studies i have the reports we have the information
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:58.299]  so you need to get fortified you need to get healthy you need to get ready
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:06.139]  because whatever they've fandangled whatever they've set up whatever mutation they know is
[01:11:06.139 --> 01:11:14.219]  going to be in this shot that rolls out in eight days i predict when they start giving
[01:11:14.219 --> 01:11:20.139]  the shot just like last time all hell's gonna break loose and how many women millions of them
[01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:26.299]  went online and said my boyfriend got the shot and now i have periods twice a month or three
[01:11:26.299 --> 01:11:31.099]  times a month or no periods at all 80 year old women are having periods 20 years after menopause
[01:11:31.099 --> 01:11:37.099]  30 years after and we have studies out of university colorado zurich switzerland all of
[01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:45.900]  them that it is shedding so they're about to release their bomb they're about to release their
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:55.980]  weapon and all hell's about to break loose and that's why they'll have the backdrop of the
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:02.540]  new lockdowns is because they're going to do it all over again and we've shown you the graph
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:08.860]  pull it up again that showed in israel and in morocco and the uk and in australia and in
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:13.820]  canada right when the shots come in here's the level of illness hospitalization death
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:22.139]  every time boom every time boom every time and the studies are there it's mainly the vaccinated
[01:12:22.139 --> 01:12:26.219]  that are getting sick hospitalized and dying but then they also are hitting us
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:33.660]  shedding is confirmed moderna and pfizer admit it they make us the engines they
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:37.900]  don't need drones to deliver this or a beetle to deliver the bio weapon like the pentagon
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:49.259]  which gates is doing they're doing it through our bodies so get ready and i've had all the experts
[01:12:49.259 --> 01:12:54.380]  on i'm not a phd or medical doctor virologist or epidemiologist but i've had them all on i've
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.299]  got the studies i've got the reports you know there's william shakespeare not the original but
[01:12:58.299 --> 01:13:04.460]  named after him took the shot dead a week later hank erin the list goes on and on all the heart
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:09.099]  attacks myocarditis exploding the number and now headlines oh it's normal for kids to have
[01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:13.900]  heart attacks it's the new normal oh covid did it yeah covid's causing heart attacks later
[01:13:16.139 --> 01:13:19.099]  all right she's gonna be with us for an hour and a half or two hours if she can do it
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.900]  i appreciate her coming on dr stella manual
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.860]  she is famous of course for leading the charge for therapeutics
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.940]  and being demonized attacked for it with the press conferences in dc
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:39.580]  she's a fellow uh texan lives here in texas dr stella md.com
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:48.860]  she's an md successful physician has treated hundreds of thousands of people for telemedicine
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.019]  thank god trump got that law passed and of course tens of thousands herself personally
[01:13:53.019 --> 01:13:56.540]  so we're going to talk about the current developments the current news how we prepare
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:02.700]  for this what we do because the ran pauls are on tv saying oh this is all hype everything's fine no
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:07.820]  no no no no no ran paul you pushed it at least trump's backing off now it's going straight up
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.299]  and that's the big thing they said the cdc said last week i guess monday
[01:14:13.179 --> 01:14:20.460]  we'll pull the headline they said if you've had the so-called covid vaccines
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.019]  you're more susceptible to the new variant
[01:14:23.019 --> 01:14:30.780]  they're saying if you've had shots before it's erased your immune system you need more
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:37.179]  remember what that pfizer chief scientist we played the clip over and over again him saying
[01:14:37.179 --> 01:14:42.059]  oh in our tests we did we found you have almost no you know antibodies after your third
[01:14:42.059 --> 01:14:49.900]  shot you'll need continued shots so this is a plan people and we're walking into it right now
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.219]  so just like i told you two and a half weeks ago they were going to roll this out starting
[01:14:54.219 --> 01:15:01.340]  with hysteria and mask and it's here i'm telling you that when these people get injected in eight
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:06.299]  days it usually takes in all the graphs two weeks for it to replicate and start shedding
[01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:08.780]  and all hell's gonna break loose
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:18.299]  i want to play a clip of her and then go to her but here we are three years ago plus in the
[01:15:18.299 --> 01:15:23.980]  middle of the so-called pandemic dr stella manual being censored being attacked being blocked
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:31.340]  simply trying with a bunch of other doctors to say we have treatments we have therapeutics
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.860]  which they've all been vindicated remember they were censored by big tech they were banned
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.139]  they were blocked they were attacked people called for their arrest the government went after
[01:15:38.139 --> 01:15:43.820]  some of them clinics got raided they're gonna people vitamin c or vitamin d that's evil
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:50.219]  that's cold-blooded but they want us to forget that we were the ones that were right
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.860]  and they were the ones that are wrong and now we got to not just say we were right
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:16:00.540]  and warn people and get people ready we've got to expose that they're incubating this and using
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:06.860]  us as engines ourselves to create the nanotech that i played the pentagon official in globalist
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:13.099]  yesterday talking about here she is play the clip i'm here because i have personally treated
[01:16:13.099 --> 01:16:20.219]  over 350 patients with covet patients that have diabetes patients that have high blood pressure
[01:16:20.219 --> 01:16:27.259]  patients that have um asthma all people i think my oldest patient is 92 87 year olds and the
[01:16:27.259 --> 01:16:31.420]  result has been the same i put them on hydroxychloroquine i put it on zinc i put it
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:37.179]  on zitromax and they are all well for the past few months i've taken care of over 350
[01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:42.379]  patients we've not lost one not a diabetic not a somebody with high blood pressure not somebody
[01:16:42.379 --> 01:16:49.340]  with asthma not an old person we've not lost one patient and on top of that i've put myself
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:54.299]  my staff and many doctors that i know on hydroxychloroquine for prevention because
[01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:59.660]  by the very mechanism of action it works early and has a prophylaxis we see patients
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:04.540]  10 to 15 covid patients every day we give them breathing treatments we only wear surgical
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:10.780]  masks none of us has gotten sick it works so right now i came here to washington dc to say
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:17.099]  america nobody needs to die the the the study that made me start using hydroxychloroquine was
[01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:24.299]  a study that they did in under the air nih in 2005 that's how it works recently i was doing
[01:17:24.299 --> 01:17:29.099]  some research about a patient that had hiccups and i found that they even did a recent study
[01:17:29.099 --> 01:17:36.299]  in the nih which is our national institute um that is the national nih national institute of of
[01:17:36.299 --> 01:17:41.740]  health they actually had a study and go look it up type hiccups and covid you will see it
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:46.940]  they treated a patient that had hiccups with hydroxychloroquine and it proved that
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:55.580]  covid is a symptom of hiccups it's a symptom of of covid so if the nih knows that treating
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:01.259]  the patient with hydroxychloroquine proves that hiccup is a symptom of covid then they
[01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:07.259]  definitely know that hydroxychloroquine works i'm upset why i'm upset is that i see people that
[01:18:07.259 --> 01:18:12.860]  cannot breathe i see parents walk in i see diabetic sick in my office knowing that this
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.179]  is a death sentence and they can't breathe and i hug them and i tell them it's gonna be okay
[01:18:17.179 --> 01:18:23.740]  you're gonna leave and we treat them and they leave none has died so if some fake science
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:28.540]  some person sponsored by all these fake pharma companies comes out say oh we've done studies
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.860]  and they found out that it doesn't work i can tell you categorically is fake science
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:36.139]  i want to know who is sponsoring that study i want to know who is behind it
[01:18:36.139 --> 01:18:41.340]  because there is no way i can treat 350 patients and counting and nobody is dead
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.379]  they've taken up four or five medical licenses in the u.s alone from the people she's talking
[01:18:48.379 --> 01:18:52.460]  about that said ivermectin hydroxychloroquine didn't work that just came out last few
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:58.219]  months so the comeuppance is happening the truth is coming out but here she is in july of 2020
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:03.900]  saying she's treated 300 now it's i forget the number hundreds of thousands an insane number
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:08.940]  but but just think about that knowing in their own studies government studies
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:13.420]  that it would save people not letting you have it that's what murdered them
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:18.700]  was failure to render aid the violation of the hippocratic oath of hypocrisy continue
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:25.500]  tell me that you treated 20 people 40 people and it didn't work i'm a true testimony so i
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:31.900]  came here to washington dc to tell america nobody needs to get sick this virus has a cure it is
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.860]  called hydroxychloroquine zinc and zitromax i know if you want to talk about a mask hello
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.379]  you don't need mask there is a cure i know they don't want to open schools no you don't
[01:19:42.379 --> 01:19:47.259]  need people to be locked down there is prevention and there is a cure and let me tell you
[01:19:47.259 --> 01:19:52.059]  something all you fake doctors out there that tell me oh yeah i want a double-blinded studies
[01:19:52.059 --> 01:19:55.820]  i just tell you squeeze sounding like a computer double-blinded double-blinded is you i don't know
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:01.580]  what are your chips are malfunctioning but i'm a real doctor i have radiologists we have plastic
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:07.019]  surgeons we have neurosurgeons like sanjay gupta saying oh yeah it doesn't work and it causes
[01:20:07.019 --> 01:20:11.660]  heart disease let me ask you dr sanjay gupta hear me have you ever seen a covid patient
[01:20:12.299 --> 01:20:15.900]  have you ever treated anybody with hydroxychloroquine and they died from heart disease
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.139]  when you do come and talk to me because i sit down in my clinic every day and i see this
[01:20:20.139 --> 01:20:25.740]  patient walking every day scared to scared to death i see people driving two three hours to
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:30.860]  my clinic because some scared of the texas board or they are scared of something and
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.620]  they will not prescribe medication to these people i tell all of you doctors that are
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:41.179]  sitting down and watching americans die you're like the good nazi the good one the good
[01:20:41.179 --> 01:20:47.420]  germans that watch jews get killed and you do not speak up if they come after me they
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.139]  threaten me they threaten to i mean i've gotten all kinds of threats or they're gonna report me
[01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:56.460]  to the boards they're gonna i say you know what i don't care i'm not gonna let americans die
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:01.660]  and if this is the mount in this the hill where i get nailed on i will get nailed on it
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.740]  i don't care you can report me to the boards you can kill me you can do whatever but i'm not
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:11.259]  gonna let americans die and today i'm here to say that america there is a cure for covid
[01:21:11.259 --> 01:21:16.139]  all this foolishness it's not does not need to happen there is a cure for covid
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.139]  dr stella emmanuel and now the federal courts have ruled they've all ruled ivermectin all of it works
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:30.059]  they suppressed it they lied they murdered people following a waf un directive and the adl
[01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:35.420]  talking about jews getting killed by hitler worked to censor with their systems people
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.420]  talking about alternative treatments so we're literally talking about what happened in nazi
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:45.179]  germany dr stella manual i appreciate you joining us i'm sorry i got times messed up with you i was

[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:05.420]  trying a new rollout you contacted me over a month ago before the whistleblower and said listen i'm
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:12.219]  seeing a lot of new cases it's happening uh so so again we know where it's coming from
[01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:19.660]  we're going to get into so many big subjects uh here with you today i've got a whole
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:25.660]  list of them that we're going to be talking about people are asking about malberg lockdowns

[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:56.299]  we'll talk more about that as well but but wow looking back three plus years ago
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:01.179]  uh i i know it's bittersweet you've saved a lot of people how many patients have you
[01:23:01.179 --> 01:23:09.099]  and your team not treated now there was 300 back then we've probably seen over 120 000 patients
[01:23:09.099 --> 01:23:13.980]  and counting and of course uh we've taken care of that many patients but of course the
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:20.059]  app we reached out because at some point we just sent out uh you know sent out our protocols
[01:23:20.059 --> 01:23:25.099]  to defend doctors and everything all over the world so we don't know the the level but we
[01:23:25.099 --> 01:23:29.980]  know that at least on record we've probably taken care of 520 000 patients and we're
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:34.780]  sitting here of a lot of patients still today and i tell the american people covid is treatable
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:40.540]  covid is preventable there's no need for people to get scared and do not say you know like you
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:45.660]  said earlier it's not don't say that it doesn't exist we know that they've not really been
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:51.019]  able to isolate exactly what we're dealing with but we know it's causing sickness and disease
[01:23:51.019 --> 01:23:56.059]  and we know that non-specific antivirals like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works
[01:23:56.059 --> 01:24:01.340]  we also know how to treat respiratory illnesses we know how to treat people that are in respiratory
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:07.340]  distress that can breathe with beresinide and alveolar breathing treatments we know how to
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:12.460]  take care of patients when they can smell and they're not eating and they need some ivy fluids
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:17.820]  we know how to do that so i this is the first time in medicine they are telling people
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.259]  just go home you know i know you can't breathe but just go home and wait oh i know you're
[01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:27.179]  dehydrated but i'm not going to give you ivy fluids go home and take some Tylenol
[01:24:27.179 --> 01:24:33.420]  it is it is atrocities beyond what we can even think but i tell the american people it's good
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:39.580]  to be prepared to be ready that is why i think that's why god moved me to texas because
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:43.580]  i'm sure if i'd been in louisiana i don't think that i'll still be practicing but god
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:48.379]  moved us to texas where there's a little bit of freedom and kept people in the texas
[01:24:48.379 --> 01:24:52.219]  center that we didn't really protected the doctors and allowed us to practice medicine
[01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:58.700]  like we see fit so i tell the american people we have the telehealth services right now don't
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:03.259]  wait till the thing gets to your house don't wait till you can't breathe i'm telling you
[01:25:03.259 --> 01:25:07.500]  people call me even last night somebody was calling me oh they have covid in the hospital
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:12.059]  i can't help people when it's already too late the best time to treat covid is when
[01:25:12.059 --> 01:25:17.099]  it's early so if you get hydroxychloroquine ivermectin in your medicine cabinet i've been
[01:25:17.099 --> 01:25:21.660]  screaming from the roof these things when i've read don't hurt you my personal medical
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.540]  doctor says ivermectin is therapeutically good to take a few times a year anyways to cleanse
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:31.340]  yourself from all sorts of things the minute you feel like you have a cold sore throat sniffles
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.620]  uh sinus infection the minute you start getting sick you got to take a 10 they knew that that's
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.460]  why they would turn people away and say come back when you can't breathe then they'd ventilate
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:47.900]  them they get 53 000 for murdering them yeah so covid is treated early and if you have
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:53.580]  the medication at home you know i you know i trained in west africa nigeria i'm from kamruno
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:58.860]  originally by training in west africa where we were used to taking care of malaria and we grew
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:03.420]  up taking sunday sunday medicine for malaria but the reason why covid did not really sit
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.900]  into west africa did not really affect in west africa is going to have anti-malaria over
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:12.299]  the counter and the mindset back home is if somebody gets a cold get a fever they go
[01:26:12.299 --> 01:26:16.299]  over the counter they buy malaria medicine they take it it knocks the covid out so that is
[01:26:16.299 --> 01:26:22.460]  why could not really cause the kind of destruction it did out here in sub-saharan africa so that's
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:28.139]  why i tell go on our website drstellaind.com make an appointment make a telehealth appointment
[01:26:28.139 --> 01:26:30.940]  we're going to look at your medical records we're going to look at your allergies we're going
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:34.780]  to look at your weight and everything and we're going to prescribe the medication and then we're
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.740]  going to send it to our mom and pop pharmacists that will ship it to you most mainstream
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.820]  pharmacists will not feel hydroxyl could be an affirmation till today they will not do it
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.540]  so we have been lucky enough to act to be able to call like mom and pop that's right
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.099]  in my view before there's a big run before there's a big run people need to get ready
[01:26:53.099 --> 01:26:56.700]  do you agree with me because i've seen the studies i've seen reports that it's the shedding
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:00.940]  and right after people take the shots that's when you see the explosions not just in illnesses
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:06.299]  of those that took the shots but then those around them uh and and and so i'm i'm expecting
[01:27:06.299 --> 01:27:10.780]  what do you think of my breakdown that once this new booster rolls out in eight days we're
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:16.299]  going to see all hell break loose oh yes oh yes shedding is a real phenomenon a lot of people are
[01:27:16.299 --> 01:27:23.179]  like shedding did not just start remember alex when they will tell people that take the chicken
[01:27:23.179 --> 01:27:28.940]  pork shot not to hang around pregnant women because they can shed on them although terry dies
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:35.260]  he took the live mmr vaccine don't hang around people that have like low immunity or cancer
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:40.059]  patients because it can actually affect them because shedding is a real scientific phenomenon
[01:27:40.059 --> 01:27:45.900]  that is why they did that and a lot of people are being shed upon right now and shedding is real
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.900]  and people are getting sick and people are complaining you see people that the husband
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.379]  took the shot and now the wife is getting recurring colds and everything i put my patients
[01:27:54.379 --> 01:27:58.139]  that have family members that are close to that are shedding on them i put them weekly
[01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:02.780]  hydroxychloroquine or weekly ivermectin and i tell them to get vitamin c d zinc and quercetin
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:07.660]  to keep themselves safe so yes shedding is real and i'm well i know i know a lot of medical
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:14.139]  doctors top people including my doctor and my nurse practitioner and they said every doctor they know
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:22.299]  is taking uh ivermectin twice a week and you were saying sunday sunday people that don't
[01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:26.700]  know i looked it up africa had the lowest infection rate of covid the lowest death rate
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:32.459]  only six percent took the shots and africa out of any country basically it didn't exist there
[01:28:32.459 --> 01:28:36.700]  to explain what af and i know indians do it too they all know about ivermectin they know

[02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:17.380]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:22.100]  all right i want to go to your phone calls here momentarily but i want to bring up something
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:27.060]  really important that we focused in on a few years ago and we see similar syndromes in humans
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:33.220]  this is for pbs this chicken vaccine makes its virus more dangerous
[02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:37.860]  2015 see that
[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:45.380]  here's another one uh this is pubmed an anti-tumor vaccine against marex disease
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:52.420]  virus induces differential activation of memory response of yot cells and cdat cells and chickens
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:57.620]  revaccination with marex disease vaccine induces production infection
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:05.460]  and superior immunity marex disease and poultry basically they give these chickens this
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:09.300]  vaccine to stop them from getting a virus bird flu and other things
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:14.980]  and then it erases their immune system they've got to have more and more of it and finally
[02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:20.020]  they just mutate all their joints swell up they turn to big giant fat blobs that guy's
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:24.500]  typing marex disease a chicken with marex disease it's incredible you look at all the
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:29.300]  public they look they already got it but this is just one example of the type of stuff
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:34.420]  uh that's going on and then dr stella emmanuel you were also going to get into
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:39.060]  uh mauberg and a lot of these other things that are going on
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:43.780]  that they're hyping up and that they're fear-mongering right now what's going on with that
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:50.420]  uh well there's something going on we're hearing about my book we started hearing about
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:55.380]  malbork it's a hemorrhagic fever like ebola we started hearing about it like maybe a year
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:08:00.900]  and a half ago we actually um so i went on the nih website and i was usually i always like
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:04.900]  to look at you know different studies that they've done on how they can help different
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:10.820]  diseases so um there was a study that was done on the nih website about uh proteases
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:17.060]  like you know non-specific proteases in effects on malbork or hemorrhagic fevers because you know
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:22.260]  malbork virus has a glycoprotein covering and that if the proteases can split that
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:27.860]  glycoprotein covering it can reduce its infectivity and transmission so we went on
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:34.580]  and so we read that and then so we kind of put together a supplement that has like non-specific
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:40.660]  proteases and has elderberry and ecgc and other things that can just give you immunity
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:44.660]  we call it viral immune plus it can give you immunity for other things so so that people
[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:52.020]  you can help people protect themselves against malbork um we're hearing that i don't know i don't
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:58.180]  have a confirmation of this but there's stories going around on how uh they injected the
[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:03.380]  malbork virus was actually programmed into the shop and that a particular pause of fire
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:08.100]  yeah that's what judy minkovich says judy minkovich says they rolled out all the
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:12.420]  covid shots infected with everything to cover up that all the old vaccines did this already
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:19.300]  got it as well yeah i am i cannot confirm that i know dr bata you know the physician that passed
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.980]  away that's one of the things that he said just before he passed away about the whole
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:29.220]  malbork thing so that so we are hearing that i don't know and i can't confirm that
[02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:33.300]  i i usually would like to get better confirmation before i put my neck on something
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:36.980]  so i don't know so a lot of people ask me doctor said what do we do about malbork i
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:41.460]  said well we have uh via immune plus that can help you build your immunity against
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:45.460]  hemorrhagic fevers because we started caring about it a year and a half ago
[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:49.700]  alex that's what we've been doing like when when they say something is coming up with
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:55.300]  we start looking around and we have our network with naturopathic doctors you know to
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:10:00.500]  just see how we can produce something to build the immunity towards it i mean they're planning
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:04.100]  something big we know the shots create shedding and illness they're getting ready to roll a new
[02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:11.780]  one out show get ready uh we got laura we got nurse keith we got zach ryan david mary chas
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:19.220]  and samara dominique granny green we're gonna go to all of you in the order your calls are
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:24.660]  received laura in illinois you're on the air with our special guest dr stella manual
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:32.980]  hi dr stella um and hi alex thanks for taking my call um last week i was uploading my 14 year
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:38.900]  old twins medical information for their high school and i noticed on their immunizations that
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:47.860]  they had covet 19 they had the covet shots that were given to them in may of 2021 and the
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:55.140]  next month later um in 2021 and i wasn't the person who did it so i found out that they were
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:11:00.580]  given at walmart and my ex-husband went behind my back and vaccinated them without my permission
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:10.660]  oh i'm destroyed i've been looking everywhere um i found your website and nothing's happened to them
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:18.980]  so far yet but um i did order spike support from i think the wellness company but it's hard
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:23.540]  for me to get them to take anything because they're so brainwashed by their dad let me give
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.980]  you the good news let me give you the good news we have another u.s let me give you the
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:30.820]  good news let me let you know here's the good news
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:40.020]  if they don't keep it below 87 degrees the the the nanotech dies that's in the studies
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:45.540]  that's they admit that so a lot of places are lazy and so and when we get cellos taken
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:54.020]  this is what i know and globally half of the shots were saline they now admit in range finding
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:12:01.860]  then about 40 were a small dose of the poison and between 10 to 5 depending on what country they hit
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:07.540]  or red areas red areas more like 20 liberal areas more like five so you're in illinois
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:12.660]  that's more leftist so who knows i mean there might have been 10 of the shots where you were
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:17.780]  were loaded or they might have been hot so so i keep going to sell out dr stella's chomping
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:24.020]  at the bitter okay and i'm just out i don't know what to buy i mean i'm i'm on your site
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:30.100]  what what can i do to help them detox from these what these um shots well that's the most
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:34.740]  common thing i i get told is just in general whether you get it from get it from cell or
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:39.060]  anybody uh and we're i don't think we're claiming a panacea here because this is all
[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:43.860]  next level stuff but uh doctor what do you do personally to try to you're around a lot of
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:49.060]  patients we obviously you're getting shut it on what do you do uh to to help people that have
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:53.700]  been shut it on or that we believe have this spike protein infection a long COVID what are
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:59.300]  they doing for long COVID they admit exist yeah what we do like i said one of the things that
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:04.580]  we do all our all our staff we're all on weekly either ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:11.380]  we take the daily vitamin c d zinc and quercetin uh man one of the things that because i i see
[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:17.460]  this as not just a physician but also somebody that is a minister of the gospel if you go on my
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:24.660]  twitter feed i i posted like a really amazing prayer that you can pray for people that have
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:27.860]  gotten this vaccine that i've scared i can pray for your children you know what i'm saying
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:34.020]  because we are in warfare that is both physical and spiritual so you can do detox and you can
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:38.660]  also pray for them i know because our family members very close family member that took the
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:43.380]  shot and i just couldn't they're brainwashed and i couldn't do anything about it so we all have to
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:47.220]  just keep praying for them and hopefully that they will take the detox we have a detox on our
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:52.340]  website you see vax detox where you know it's like um he has a cleanse that has like
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:57.540]  milk thistle and elderberry and you see all kinds of stuff in it so if they will agree to
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:02.420]  take it you know they can take it we also would advise people that took the job to first of
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:06.100]  all go on a course of ivermectin what we do is that we put them on a course of ivermectin
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:11.780]  hydroxyclopine we tell them to take the detox pack and then after that we put them on weekly
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:16.740]  hydroxyclopine like or weekly ivermectin like everybody else i'm so sorry about what happened
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:22.580]  to your children but i want you to just you know hold the faith and pray and just pray for
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:27.460]  them you know that you know that god all the studies show prayer is prayer is amazing both
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:33.700]  for people and for yourself but let me bring this up to her the good news is laura is that
[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:38.500]  in many cases they didn't keep it refrigerated and and half of it was just saline that that's
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:44.740]  confirmed so uh so so thank god uh you know your children haven't shown any signs that that that's
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:51.300]  that's wonderful well god bless you all and i have hope and i pray for you alex i buy your
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:57.060]  products and i'm going to go buy dr stella mds plastics well we're all in this together
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:01.220]  it's all a win-win thank you so much but yeah it's horrifying and
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:07.300]  you know the same thing happened to me with one of my children i'm gonna leave with that
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:12.980]  so i'm in the i'm in the same uh same same place with you it's it's outrageous uh let's
[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:18.180]  go to nurse keith in oregon and your experience uh with cupboard and patients go ahead thanks for
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:28.900]  calling hello alex hello dr emmanuel um i'm a nurse i'm a uh e-care specialist and
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:32.500]  e-care specialist and um i have to deal with
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:42.340]  um about 60 patients a week shedding on me you know just dealing with whatever illnesses
[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:48.020]  they have and dr manual knows this that most of our patients are
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:16:18.220]  the problems they have or kind of self imposed. And so it's our job as clinicians to figure out how to root out the problem and then, you know, fix whatever acute thing we're dealing with, or chronic thing. And I'm not terribly concerned about COVID. I'm exposed to it all the time.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:46.220]  But like I said, people don't take care of themselves. Simple little things like taking, you know, the products you guys make are awesome. It's the best stuff out there and I'm getting it cheap. If I were to go to whatever trendy store and buy their top shelf stuff, it's the same stuff you guys are selling. But I'm paying half the price.
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:17:07.220]  And so, you know, a lot of times when I'm dealing with these patients, and I'm trying to fix a wound that I've been chasing for, you know, three, four months, and you know, I happen to look at all their comorbidities and figure out why is it that, you know, why is it that this wound is not healing, etc. A lot of times it boils down to what are they doing to themselves.
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:20.220]  And so, all this fear about catching them, it's a bloody cold, for crying out loud. You know, yeah, is it going to kick some people's butts? You bet.
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:47.220]  No, I agree with you. But there's the long COVID from the spike protein. And so it sounds like you've got some great immunity and your body knows how to kick this out. All I know is the statistical numbers is that we have the highest death rates and the life expectancy in the Western world is dropping for the first time ever. So something big is going on. You're saying, yeah, it's the GMO, it's not getting exercise, it's not drinking clean water. What do you think it is, Nurse Keith?
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:18:10.220]  Well, it's all those things. And, you know, like I was trying to allude to is that most of the things that we have going on with us are self imposed. You're not getting enough sun, you're not eating good food, you're, you know, going too hard in the paint on, you know, whatever your vices are.
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:40.020]  And little things that you can do, like, I, okay, so the other day, I was exposed to a COVID patient. And so I came home, I grabbed a bunch of your supplements out of my, out of my, my cabinet. You know, I popped, you know, I popped the, what was it I grabbed, I grabbed the C and zinc, and then I grabbed some vitamin D gummies. And then I made my
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:45.780]  self a juice smoothie. And then I said, Okay, I'm just going to relax today and let my body just
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:46.220]  heal.
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:19:09.980]  Yeah, just like just like in Judaism, taking Saturday off or Sunday off. It's so important. Thank you for the call. Yeah, I mean, I will say this, when I feel like I'm getting sick. And boy, does it annoy the family. I love garlic. But I will go home. And I will slice a bunch of garlic and onions and grill it. And I'm talking about like a whole garlic club at least or two. And then I scramble some eggs.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:24.500]  And put it on top of there. And I eat the whole thing. And it works like a charm. Because what is it Dr. Emanuel? We'll get more calls in a moment. What is it? I mean, we know there's this essence. What is it about garlic? Because I know that that's really helpful as well, right?
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:54.420]  We have, I don't know the specific on garlic. But one of the things we do is we do medicinal herbs, like we do a ginger, turmeric, a moringa, a lemon, mint, you're something we have medicinal herbs, you know, most schools, when if you can actually take like ginger and turmeric and make a tea out of it, it can help you when we're growing up, if you start having malaria or fever, the parents, we got parents who put all kinds of stuff and put lemons on top of it.
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:20:04.500]  And if you put lemons on grass and everything, boil it up and cover you with it and you will inhale it. So there are many, many things that like the last call I said that can help you to build your immunity.
[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:21.500]  And like I said, the reason why we have a lot of colds and viruses in the winter is low vitamin D. That is why we put together the COVID vites that has vitamin C, D zinc and quasitin. If your vitamin D is up and your vitamin C and everything, it can help.
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:38.500]  Let me ask you a question about this, because we now know from science, so many of the Asian, African, European, Latin American folk remedies are all actually based in science. What type of folk medicine did you have before you got a medical degree and when you grew up in Africa?
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:21:00.500]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. We did teas with pinning back and we had all kinds of meds. My parents, my mom used to actually go and cut some grasses and grind them and everything and treat cough and all kinds of things. I wish I didn't even know what those things are, but we grew up taking a lot of, you know, all these herbs and teas and everything.
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:06.500]  Have you ever heard of what black Americans in the south called Hindu tea?
[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:27.500]  Well, my dad, my dad was my grandmother's firstborn and he had a black nanny that was a member of the family and she was, you know, kind of like a witch doctor. She knew all this old African medicine and my grandmother kept him so clean, my dad, and wouldn't let him crawl in the dirt and stuff that he was sickly when he was about two.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:41.500]  And then she snuck and went in there because they had, you know, chickens and got chicken manure, boiled it, called it Hindu tea, I guess to give him immunity. And then after he was given Hindu tea, he was basically never sick again.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:49.500]  So that's just, and who knows what's in that chicken manure, but that was like some African remedy that had been passed down from her ancestors when they got hauled over here.
[02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:58.500]  But my grandmother got sold on it and then started letting him play in the dirt and do everything because he wasn't getting the natural immunity, but she put it in him with that chicken crap.
[02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.500]  I don't know about chicken manure.
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:12.500]  That's just something my grandmother, he was not sick for like five years after that. She gave him that and it was over. I guess he got the flora of it. Who knows what it does?
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:30.500]  There's something, Alex, that I want to correct. The last caller said that COVID is just bloody cold. It's a little more serious than that. And I don't know what it is, but it sits on people's chest and they can't breathe.
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:40.500]  Usually flu doesn't sit on people's chest and they can't breathe. So there's a level of COVID that's just a cold, but there's a level of COVID that actually gets into the system
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:43.500]  and really can make people can't breathe. It's not like this.
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:57.500]  No, I totally agree with you. He's just been blessed. He hasn't had it yet or hasn't had what I had or others have had, but notice they just pulled up a study on chicken manure tea as an incredible probiotic in a major study. So boom, I didn't even know that.
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:04.500]  That's put that back on the screen. Chicken manure tea, effective microorganisms, enhanced growth. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:11.500]  Uh-huh. Okay. I mean, we get new stuff every time. I have to look into that.
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:26.500]  Absolutely. Well, that was something passed down from her African ancestors, literally brought over here on the slave ship. She's pretty important information. I never even knew that. I never tried to search it. My dad says it's amazing. And then they ended up giving it to his brother and he was great too.
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:30.500]  Let's talk to Zach in Florida. You're on the air with Dr. Stella Emmanuel. Go ahead.
[02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:36.500]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Dr. Stella. Thank you guys for all you do, sacrificing to bring the people truth.
[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:38.500]  Thank you.
[02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:48.500]  We're grateful. There's a lot of us, but exponentially more waking up daily because of what you guys do. So the nation and the world really is indebted to you all.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:50.500]  No, we're indebted to you. We love you. Thank you.
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:24:10.500]  Thanks, Al. My question is about the new vaccine and vaccine shedding in general. If we're around somebody who has multiple vaccines or a vaccine, this new vaccine, and if we're surrounded by shedding, is that similar to kind of taking the vaccine ourselves?
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:23.500]  And I'm also kind of just wondering if this can be spread from mosquitoes because in Florida, that freak Bill Gates released a bunch of mosquitoes in our backyard. So I just kind of wanted to kind of clear up on that.
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:27.500]  Yeah, let's talk about Bill Gates and his mosquito operation.
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:41.500]  Bill Gates is weird. That guy is, I don't know, he is really weird. But okay, let me talk about shedding. I talk about shedding. I talk about COVID, long COVID, and then vaccinated.
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:48.500]  If you have COVID and then you recover from it, you have COVID and it stops the production of the spike protein.
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  If you get shed upon, that means somebody is producing the spike protein and it's affecting you. If you move away from that person, it stops affecting you.
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:05.500]  But if you are vaccinated, you are actively producing the spike protein. So it's not the same as if you're shed upon.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:13.500]  So I tell people that if you have like, if your husband is vaccinated and you're kind of concerned, I have one of my staff that the husband is vaccinated.
[02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:20.500]  She used to get cold all the time, cough all the time, and I kept like, she's always sick. So at some point I said, I think you're going through shedding.
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:26.500]  Now she takes hydroxychloroquine weekly and she takes a COVID vise daily and she's really fine.
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:40.500]  So the same way that we would help to protect people that are vaccinated from getting the COVID, because people that are vaccinated, we actually think it's a must for them to actually be on weekly hydroxychloroquine and vitamins,
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:49.500]  so that they could kind of protect themselves from actually just even catching the disease. So the same way we'll protect them, that's the same way we'll protect regular people and those that are shed upon.
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:56.500]  But I just want people to not feel like shedding, it's like you're doomed because, or you can move away from the person that's shedding on you.
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:02.500]  But if you're living with a person in the house, I'm not going to tell somebody to divorce their husband or wife because they got vaccinated.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:10.500]  So what I do, I tell them to protect themselves by taking weekly hydroxychloroquine or eformectin and get on the vitamins so that they can stay safe.
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:23.500]  Absolutely. But how amazing is that? You know what's crazy? My dad's black nanny and I knew her. She died when I was about eight years old.
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:32.500]  We used to go visit her three or four times a year when we'd go see her. She looked like 80 years old, 90 years old. Her name was Stella and they called her Aunt Stella.
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:41.500]  I forget her last name. That's just crazy. And she looked just like you and she dressed just like you. That's what's crazy is she kept all that African culture even through that.
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:48.500]  And then there she was. She would also, I heard about this when I was a kid, my dad told me about it and I'd read about it later.
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:56.500]  She would go with all the different clays in the county and dig clays out and then she would eat that clay. Obviously, we know it has minerals in it.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:03.500]  And we also noticed the deer would go eat the same clay. So it's just crazy all that folk medicine that's been passed on that we've lost.
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:14.500]  And with white culture, we lost almost all of it. I think it's a great thing. It's terrible that black people were so poor and oppressed, but it made them go with the natural things they knew and a lot of that's been passed on.
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:17.500]  Have you heard about how good some of these clays are?
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:29.500]  I know that some people crave eating clay when, you know, especially like they call it limestone, you know, when they start eating clay.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:39.500]  I think it's because they actually just crave minerals. But Alex, unfortunately, I was also programmed by the white people if that's, you know, I went to medical school.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:47.500]  So pretty much it's right now that I'm beginning to look into natural medicine. I practically went to medical school when I graduated medical school at 25.
[02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:53.500]  And, you know, I've been a physician for a long time, 30 something years and just practice like program like every other.
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:28:03.500]  I mean, I'm not attacking Catholics, but it's well known. The Catholic Church for a thousand years all over Europe killed all the herbalists saying they were witches.
[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:11.500]  And so that's why that was all lost. So we don't have much of that. We have the Asian, which is incredible. Everybody knows how amazing their stuff is.
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:24.500]  And we have the African and we have the Mesoamerican. We don't have all the ancient stuff of the white people because you got literally murdered, burned at the stake if you talk about it.
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:29.500]  So this is the first time governments and systems have tried to suppress medical information.
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:42.500]  Yes, because they know that they don't want to do those about medicines and everything, because if they do that, then how can, you know, how can, you know, kafelas make money from their crazy medicine that they got everybody into, you know?
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:50.500]  Dr. Stella, stay there. We got to go to break. Drstellamed.com. Drstellamed.com promo code Alex, get huge discounts, telemedicine, amazing supplements.

[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:16.500]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:21.500]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[02:30:55.500 --> 02:31:03.500]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:07.500]  I turned down so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:11.500]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:17.500]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:23.500]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted, it smells amazing, and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:31.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively.
[02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:36.500]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast. Tastes great, it's the strong one, really strong.
[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:41.500]  But these are all close second and thirds. Medium Roast, Wake of America, woo!
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:48.500]  That's what my go-to dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:52.500]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation.

[02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:28.369]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover us. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[02:33:28.369 --> 02:33:34.089]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.089 --> 02:33:54.769]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, September 7th
[02:33:54.769 --> 02:34:00.009]  transmission. We're going to race quit with your calls to get to everybody. Ryan in California,
[02:34:00.009 --> 02:34:05.210]  you're on the air with Dr. Stella Emanuel. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Hey, Dr. Stella. I love
[02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:10.609]  you guys so much. I appreciate all that you do. Yeah. And you may not be heroes, but your
[02:34:10.609 --> 02:34:15.830]  willpower is something to behold. I've been watching you, Alex, since 2000 and the public
[02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:20.650]  access days in Austin. Long time, man. I've seen a lot of stuff come true. No, but
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:24.250]  you said it. We're not heroes, but we are fighters and so are you. And our wills
[02:34:24.250 --> 02:34:31.490]  are strong. Exactly. It's not, it's not, it's not heroic to fight tyranny, but it is good
[02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:35.589]  to be strong in a fight against it. And I will give you that our wills are strong.
[02:34:35.589 --> 02:34:40.369]  So is yours. Yeah. And imagine if everyone had took their willpower and used it the
[02:34:40.369 --> 02:34:45.089]  way that you guys do, we'd be out of this mess a long time ago. Anyway, I was calling
[02:34:45.089 --> 02:34:50.250]  to call in. I've been wanting to call in all week about the booster coming up as
[02:34:50.250 --> 02:34:53.570]  the trigger for the next COVID lockdown. So I felt like that was being overlooked.
[02:34:53.769 --> 02:34:58.130]  So it's really crazy that you started talking about it today. Oh, that's it.
[02:34:58.130 --> 02:35:02.810]  That's the weapon. The weapon gets deployed in eight days. Yeah. Tucker was saying, you know,
[02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:05.490]  oh, they're not going to be able to pull this COVID thing off. And we're all like,
[02:35:05.490 --> 02:35:09.250]  oh yeah, they can't do it. You know, people are pissed. They're not going to take it this
[02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:13.089]  time, but I feel like they're, they're a little smarter than that. And like you said,
[02:35:13.089 --> 02:35:16.449]  they're just going to roll this thing out. And let me say, I think it will be far
[02:35:16.449 --> 02:35:20.289]  worse. I think it's gonna be horrible. Gut level. I've been waking up at night having
[02:35:20.289 --> 02:35:25.490]  anxiety. My brain's been scanning it. My spirits, you're dead on. I think all hell
[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:29.410]  breaks loose within two weeks. All hell breaks loose. Yeah. And people, people, you're crazy
[02:35:29.410 --> 02:35:35.410]  if you don't go to Dr. Emanuel's site like today and get hydroxychloroquine, get Ivermectin,
[02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:39.330]  give you the fact that we can even get it in this country and you're in the mail. Cause
[02:35:39.330 --> 02:35:43.570]  I had Delta when it came out. COVID is definitely real. I'm a guy that takes care of himself.
[02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:48.289]  I got a medicine cabinet full of Alex's supplements and every other thing on earth.
[02:35:48.289 --> 02:35:51.089]  And I got sicker than I've ever been in my life. It was all in my stomach.
[02:35:51.089 --> 02:35:54.529]  Oh yeah. I mean, I've had flu, I've had colds. I used to get sick every five years.
[02:35:54.529 --> 02:35:57.170]  This hammered my ass. I've never had anything like it.
[02:35:58.050 --> 02:36:03.009]  Yeah. So we got to warn people that anyone that doesn't have to take this next booster
[02:36:03.009 --> 02:36:07.890]  and then anyone that's on the fence about it, please just try to tell them not to take this.
[02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:12.289]  Obviously people are going to be forced by their government jobs and everything else.
[02:36:12.289 --> 02:36:16.529]  It's going to get out. And I mean, we got so much to deal with this coming year.
[02:36:16.529 --> 02:36:22.050]  Beyond that, we got the economy coming down. We got world war three people. We got to use our
[02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:27.570]  willpower, get out there, spread Alex's message and just, we've got to take care of ourselves.
[02:36:27.570 --> 02:36:32.130]  I agree. Everybody, whether it's one man or one woman should be out with signs saying no
[02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:36.849]  lockdowns, arrest Fauci, no world war three. I mean, we got to get in the streets.
[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:42.769]  Absolutely. Yep. And, uh, you know, just once again, thank you guys for all you do.
[02:36:42.769 --> 02:36:46.689]  I heard them. Somebody mentioned wants to try to get Whitney Webb on. If you could try it once
[02:36:46.689 --> 02:36:50.929]  again, she's amazing. She wrote a book called, uh, one nation under blackmail. It's a two-part
[02:36:50.929 --> 02:36:55.410]  book. Unreal. She's got a memory like yours, Alex. She knows every little factoid
[02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:58.050]  about all these scumbags. It'd be an amazing show.
[02:36:58.050 --> 02:36:59.890]  All right. We'll look into it. Thank you so much.
[02:37:00.609 --> 02:37:02.689]  Dr. Stella, you want to comment on that before we go to David?
[02:37:04.449 --> 02:37:10.210]  Yeah. Uh, like you said, it's, it's time for us to stand up for humanity to be just
[02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:14.849]  rise up and say, no, we're not going to let this happen. And the war, you know,
[02:37:14.849 --> 02:37:19.970]  Alex, you've been talking about info war. This is an information war. So take the information,
[02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:26.369]  spread it, share it to your family. That is how you participate in the battle by taking what
[02:37:26.369 --> 02:37:31.490]  we do and sharing it. That is how you participate in battle by getting information,
[02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:36.769]  getting medication, getting supplements for your family members. Sometimes you might have your
[02:37:36.769 --> 02:37:40.929]  leftist family members that are not listening to COVID hits them and then they come to your house
[02:37:40.929 --> 02:37:44.689]  and be like, okay, come, come, come. I have something for you. I can help you out. So we
[02:37:44.689 --> 02:37:49.410]  are all part of the battle. And as we speak, your part of the battle as you listen to us is
[02:37:49.410 --> 02:37:54.130]  to share as wide as possible and get information out to everybody.
[02:37:54.929 --> 02:37:58.929]  Absolutely. And you know, it's crazy. I was sitting there talking to you and remembering
[02:37:58.929 --> 02:38:03.009]  my dad's nanny. It was like a mother to him. And I was like, Stella, Stella,
[02:38:03.009 --> 02:38:06.609]  that was her name. It's just, it's just crazy how we're all interconnected and how they want
[02:38:06.609 --> 02:38:11.410]  to divide us, but we're just one family. That's beautiful. Let's go to David in Seattle. David,
[02:38:11.410 --> 02:38:18.210]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex and Dr. Stella. I have stage four
[02:38:18.849 --> 02:38:24.529]  metastasized melanoma of the lung. I've been living with it for four years and I'm
[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:31.890]  feeling pretty good actually. Can I take Ivermectin or the other
[02:38:32.609 --> 02:38:38.529]  medicine you're talking about as a cancer patient?
[02:38:40.289 --> 02:38:45.570]  Okay. Yeah. I actually read an article on the NIH about Ivermectin and cancer.
[02:38:46.130 --> 02:38:51.970]  I don't know. I don't know what is the dosage for it. I don't know exactly what
[02:38:51.970 --> 02:38:56.529]  to give you. Let's be clear. We're not treating anybody here,
[02:38:56.529 --> 02:39:01.009]  but I do know according to Dr. Megavich and a bunch of stuff, Ivermectin is anti-cancer.
[02:39:01.009 --> 02:39:04.929]  I'm a lay person, but is that, is that, that's like known in the literature, right? Why is it,
[02:39:04.929 --> 02:39:10.929]  why isn't it anti-cancer, doctor? We don't know why. They did some studies and they
[02:39:10.929 --> 02:39:16.689]  find out. Call it, don't hang up, David, but why is Ivermectin won the Nobel prize,
[02:39:16.689 --> 02:39:20.449]  but it's horrible and we shouldn't tell you. Why is it so special? What is the mechanism
[02:39:20.449 --> 02:39:24.210]  that it's anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti, anti-parasite?
[02:39:26.449 --> 02:39:30.369]  Anti-parasitic. Ivermectin is one of those tiny molecules
[02:39:30.369 --> 02:39:34.929]  that works in like all kinds of ways. Ivermectin is like really good medicine,
[02:39:34.929 --> 02:39:38.449]  but I tell you. What is Ivermectin? What is it made of? What's the molecule?
[02:39:38.449 --> 02:39:44.130]  Guys, pull up the molecule for Ivermectin. So what I tell people is that I can prescribe
[02:39:44.130 --> 02:39:47.890]  Ivermectin for you for cancer, because I don't know the dose. I don't know how it works,
[02:39:47.890 --> 02:39:52.929]  but if you come and get Ivermectin for COVID and you can use it, that's between you and you,
[02:39:52.929 --> 02:39:58.849]  you and you, you know, so you have something. So people have a way of getting around things.
[02:39:58.849 --> 02:40:03.089]  And if you're taking Ivermectin to prevent COVID and it can help you with cancer, I guess
[02:40:03.089 --> 02:40:06.689]  that's good, but we don't know the dosage, you know, so we can't treat it.
[02:40:06.689 --> 02:40:11.730]  I can't possibly, I can't. She can't treat you over there. She's not a,
[02:40:11.730 --> 02:40:17.650]  she's not a cancer doctor, but I mean, all I know is go do your own search about
[02:40:17.890 --> 02:40:24.050]  Ivermectin and, and, and, and cancer research. It's very well known. I mean, Stella,
[02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:28.529]  do you know the history of it when the Japanese invented it and what they first used it for?
[02:40:29.730 --> 02:40:34.609]  Ivermectin has been used around for like over 65 years, over 65 years in,
[02:40:34.609 --> 02:40:38.769]  in sub-Saharan Africa. They use it for river blindness and they use it for
[02:40:38.769 --> 02:40:43.170]  strontoliosis. They use it for all kinds of parasites, you know, something that is why they
[02:40:43.170 --> 02:40:49.650]  even give it to animals to treat parasites. So it's been around for a long time. It was declared
[02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:55.009]  like WHO, one of the best, one of the top drugs in WHO for years right now. So Ivermectin has
[02:40:55.009 --> 02:40:59.250]  been around for a long time and they use it. It's over the counter in many, many countries.
[02:40:59.250 --> 02:41:04.210]  It's just in America. All right. Hey, David, does that answer your question? She can't,
[02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:07.089]  she can't give me that answer. You've got to do your own research.
[02:41:07.089 --> 02:41:12.449]  Really asking for a cancer cure, but yeah, I understand. And I'll do some more research.
[02:41:12.449 --> 02:41:19.570]  One more quick question about the doctor's website. Do I have to join or do I have to do a
[02:41:19.570 --> 02:41:27.970]  telemedicine before I can get Ivermectin? Because I don't see it listed in your product.
[02:41:30.929 --> 02:41:34.449]  Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are prescription in this country. In many other
[02:41:34.449 --> 02:41:39.330]  countries, it's over the counter. You can just go buy it. We don't sell medicine. So we see
[02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:44.369]  you and look at your medical record and then write your prescription according to your weight
[02:41:44.369 --> 02:41:47.810]  and then send it to the pharmacy. Then the pharmacy will fill it and ship it to you.
[02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:51.410]  So Ivermectin, Budesana and hydroxychloroquine, it's not over the counter.
[02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:54.689]  Yeah, let me answer David's question this way. David, thank you. We're going to be 100%
[02:41:54.689 --> 02:41:59.650]  clear. Dr. Stella has amazing supplements. I use them. Ours are great too.
[02:42:00.849 --> 02:42:04.769]  Got them right here. Give them to everybody. Okay. Here, let's put this on the desk right
[02:42:04.769 --> 02:42:08.369]  here. This is the supplements that are over the counter and are amazing.
[02:42:10.210 --> 02:42:16.929]  Okay. That you can get in her book right away at DrStellaMD.com and she supports us.
[02:42:16.929 --> 02:42:19.890]  We get a percentage of it. Keep us on air. We help everybody. We help you.
[02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:23.009]  We help ourselves to win-win. Okay, symbiotic.
[02:42:24.609 --> 02:42:30.689]  For the prescriptions, you call her and of course they have to then talk to you and it's a real
[02:42:30.689 --> 02:42:36.130]  consultation. Then they don't sell you the drugs. They put you in contact with a pharmacy
[02:42:36.130 --> 02:42:41.970]  like any other doctor does. She's not selling you Budesana. She's not selling you Ivermectin.
[02:42:41.970 --> 02:42:47.890]  She's not selling you hydroxychloroquine. You call and do, it's the law, an online meeting with
[02:42:47.890 --> 02:42:53.970]  them and a doctor or a nurse practitioner then sets it up for you. So there's two things.
[02:42:53.970 --> 02:42:59.650]  There's supplements you can get at DrStellaMD.com with promo code Alex. Get a discount.
[02:42:59.650 --> 02:43:03.330]  And then there are the medical prescriptions. That's how it works. Go ahead,
[02:43:03.330 --> 02:43:08.929]  Stella. Thank you, sir, for the call. Yes, you got it right, Alex, because
[02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:15.009]  since we have to legally see you and see you as a patient, I have a doctor-patient relationship
[02:43:15.009 --> 02:43:18.769]  before we can prescribe it to you. So that is the telemedicine part.
[02:43:18.769 --> 02:43:23.970]  But on the supplement side, like I said, we have the COVID vites that I think everybody
[02:43:23.970 --> 02:43:28.449]  should be on COVID vitamins because we have vitamin C, D, zinc and quasitane and I can help
[02:43:28.449 --> 02:43:32.929]  you deal with the spike protein. You know what I'm saying? And then, of course, they heard about,
[02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:39.009]  everybody's talking about Ebola and Marlboro coming. Marlboro coming. We have a viral
[02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:45.169]  immune plus that we put together that has proteases, peptides. It has ECGCL, the berry,
[02:43:45.169 --> 02:43:49.330]  echinacea. And those are things that can help you build your immunity against many,
[02:43:49.330 --> 02:43:54.130]  many viruses. So we have all that. We have not. When you have respiratory illness,
[02:43:54.130 --> 02:43:59.890]  it helps you to, you know, it's antioxidant. I can help break loose code. We have all kinds of
[02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:04.929]  stuff that we have put together. We even put together pox defense to prevent against
[02:44:04.929 --> 02:44:09.330]  monkey pox and stuff like that. Let's explain things. Let's explain things. I didn't know,
[02:44:10.050 --> 02:44:14.130]  doctor, I didn't know, we'll go more calls. I didn't know that when I just said, hey,
[02:44:14.130 --> 02:44:19.330]  my dad's black nanny gave him, you know, old African, you know, before there were doctors,
[02:44:19.330 --> 02:44:22.449]  you know, medicine for his immune system, I didn't know they pulled the study and it
[02:44:22.449 --> 02:44:26.210]  was actually a big thing and people love it. And it really, you know, I didn't know that.
[02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:31.169]  It's the same thing. Before there were modern medicine, the last 200 years, Western medicine,
[02:44:31.169 --> 02:44:36.609]  every culture had these things through compounds and through herbs and through plants.
[02:44:37.650 --> 02:44:42.050]  That's the old medicine. Big pharma has a lot of great things, a lot of bad things too.
[02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:47.650]  It's trying to outlaw all this. It's trying to shut all this down. And so you have those
[02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:53.650]  two branches. So we have the supplements that are the science, the research on what God's compounds
[02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:57.650]  are. And of course, all the ancients were giving people the same plans for the same things.
[02:44:57.650 --> 02:45:01.890]  They didn't know why. They didn't have microscopes or spectrometers, but they knew it
[02:45:01.890 --> 02:45:06.289]  worked. Now we have the science on the supplements. That's the right arm, I would say,
[02:45:06.289 --> 02:45:11.490]  that God gave us. Then you have pharmaceuticals that are the left arm. And so Stella has both
[02:45:11.490 --> 02:45:18.449]  those at StellaMD.com, DrStellaMD.com, whether it is the natural or whether it is the pharmaceutical,
[02:45:18.449 --> 02:45:23.570]  but with the natural, you can get it right away. The telemedicine meeting is super easy
[02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:30.130]  to get the other stuff. Yes. You know, COVID-19 is one of the most...
[02:45:30.769 --> 02:45:35.730]  When we put COVID-19 together, we did it to help people dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. Now
[02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:38.849]  all of us did it. You know, everybody loves it. It gives you energy. It has
[02:45:38.849 --> 02:45:45.250]  pomegranate. It has Korean ginseng. It has guarana. It has CoQ10. It just has a lot of stuff,
[02:45:45.250 --> 02:45:49.169]  and it has vitamins that you need. And right now, we created gummies for children,
[02:45:49.169 --> 02:45:52.849]  because everybody wanted to know about gummies. So we created gummies for children, too.
[02:45:52.849 --> 02:45:56.050]  This has been a very interesting time in my life, Alex. So the past three years,
[02:45:56.769 --> 02:46:01.009]  my brain has shifted from just, I'm a medical doctor that writes prescription,
[02:46:01.009 --> 02:46:06.449]  to wanting to really teach people about wellness and put together supplements. And each time,
[02:46:06.449 --> 02:46:10.689]  they are thinking about bringing up something else. We start looking at the science behind
[02:46:10.689 --> 02:46:13.810]  the supplements that we can put together to help people. So that's what we've been doing.
[02:46:13.810 --> 02:46:16.289]  And what's incredible is, they have all the studies on ivermectin,
[02:46:16.289 --> 02:46:19.490]  ivermectin, and they knew it worked. As you pointed out in that press conference three
[02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:24.929]  plus years ago, three years and three months ago, I mean, we know. And they know,
[02:46:24.929 --> 02:46:28.689]  and they're suppressing it, because they don't want you to know. So there's two paths.
[02:46:28.689 --> 02:46:32.609]  There's the pharmaceutical route, which they're trying to block to you, of therapeutics,
[02:46:32.609 --> 02:46:36.050]  because they want you to take the poison shot. She has that. And then there's the supplement
[02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:40.689]  route that is the modern version of what the ancients did. And again, I'm up here like,
[02:46:40.689 --> 02:46:45.009]  hey, my dad's black nanny gave him boiled chicken manure, and he totally was not sick
[02:46:45.009 --> 02:46:51.009]  anymore. And then we pulled up a study. I mean, the ancients already had it figured out,
[02:46:51.009 --> 02:46:56.529]  folks. They didn't have doctors. They had people that tested things out to see what would work.
[02:46:56.529 --> 02:47:00.689]  And they passed it on over thousands and thousands of years. And that's what supplements are,
[02:47:00.689 --> 02:47:04.689]  is that knowledge now scientifically conducted in?
[02:47:06.529 --> 02:47:12.130]  We're actually doing medicinal herbs, like really just, we're putting, like we have,
[02:47:12.130 --> 02:47:19.410]  right now we have ginger and turmeric grown from back in Africa. My family grows it
[02:47:19.410 --> 02:47:24.369]  with non-GMO. And then we're going to be putting moringa, mint, and lemongrass,
[02:47:24.369 --> 02:47:28.769]  which you can make in a tea that is like non-GMO, grown from back home,
[02:47:28.769 --> 02:47:29.810]  and just talking some sense.
[02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:34.449]  Beautiful. Think about that relationship. Africa is such a giant garden, sub-Saharan
[02:47:34.449 --> 02:47:39.169]  Africa, and then grow it there and use it here. It's just beautiful. And we all win.
[02:47:39.169 --> 02:47:41.810]  And then Africa will be so successful, we'll all want to move there.
[02:47:43.090 --> 02:47:43.650]  Yes.
[02:47:43.650 --> 02:47:45.810]  All right, let's take some more calls. Dominique and Denver,
[02:47:45.810 --> 02:47:47.330]  you're on the air with Dr. Snell O'Manuel. Go ahead.
[02:47:48.529 --> 02:47:53.730]  Hey, guys. I love you very much. Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:47:54.609 --> 02:47:59.890]  And now I've been doing a lot of research, and I've been...parasites
[02:47:59.890 --> 02:48:05.410]  might have something to do with this. Dr. Terry Mege found that parasite in that vaccine sample.
[02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:11.410]  Dr. Brian Artis has been going on and on lately about his parasite research and cancer.
[02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:18.289]  And then ivermectin has had such an outstanding effect on people and their health.
[02:48:19.090 --> 02:48:23.650]  I think that maybe these parasites, they've been evolving for millions of years. They
[02:48:23.650 --> 02:48:28.449]  know how to move around inside of us. They control our thoughts, make us want to...
[02:48:28.449 --> 02:48:33.090]  Oh, by the way, they admit the cat brain worm, something like a third of India has it.
[02:48:33.090 --> 02:48:38.210]  That's why they call them crazy cat ladies. A microscopic worm, some of the syphilis,
[02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:42.130]  programs your brain where you want the smell of more cat piss,
[02:48:42.130 --> 02:48:46.130]  which is associated with the brain worm, and then you get more and more infested.
[02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:50.929]  There's also another brain worm that gets in a slug, makes the slug climb to the top of a
[02:48:50.929 --> 02:48:57.090]  tree, so birds eat it and crap it back out and create more that the slugs eat.
[02:48:57.090 --> 02:48:59.250]  I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[02:49:00.449 --> 02:49:06.529]  And I recommend everyone do a parasite cleanse. Yes, toxoplasmosis is a lot more prevalent
[02:49:06.529 --> 02:49:10.609]  than we know it makes you docile, makes you not want to resist, makes you not want to fight,
[02:49:10.609 --> 02:49:16.130]  and it's a perfect chapter out of this globalist playbook that they would spray these things
[02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:20.849]  down because you can breathe them in. You transfer millions of organisms just by shaking
[02:49:20.849 --> 02:49:26.769]  a hand, touching a telephone. I think that these parasites are more prevalent than we think,
[02:49:26.769 --> 02:49:30.130]  even though we take three showers a day, live in the suburbs, have millions of dollars.
[02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:36.210]  We think we're clean. Think again, and I would throw everything in the kitchen sink at COVID
[02:49:36.210 --> 02:49:43.730]  with neem leaf, diatomaceous earth, apple cider vinegar, black walnut hull, ginger, turmeric,
[02:49:43.730 --> 02:49:48.449]  everything that you've guys been saying on that natural front. And I'm sure Dr. Stella knows all
[02:49:48.449 --> 02:49:53.410]  about it being from Africa and fighting these creatures that look like serpents inside of you,
[02:49:53.410 --> 02:49:58.210]  telling you what to do, who to make love with to transfer this parasite to other people.
[02:49:58.769 --> 02:50:04.210]  It actually is a lot deeper. And in slaughterhouses, they'll admit they keep the
[02:50:04.210 --> 02:50:09.810]  cats and the mice there to transfer that toxoplasmosis into the cattle so that they
[02:50:09.810 --> 02:50:13.890]  are more docile and they are just open to the slaughter.
[02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:19.490]  Wow. Thank you for the call. Wild call. Granny Green in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:50:21.169 --> 02:50:26.689]  Thank you so much, Alex and Dr. Stella, for all you do. We Canadians truly appreciate you.
[02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:32.609]  The reason for my call today is, I don't know if you know this, but in Canada, our
[02:50:32.609 --> 02:50:37.890]  dictator is now making it so very soon, trying to pass a law that we're not going to have
[02:50:38.529 --> 02:50:43.090]  the availability to have natural vitamins and supplements without getting a prescription.
[02:50:43.090 --> 02:50:47.650]  Absolutely. And he is a dictator. He got 30 percent of the vote. He's parliamentarian
[02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:52.929]  manipulation to stay in power. And he says, I want to be a dictator. I admire dictatorship.
[02:50:52.929 --> 02:50:58.210]  Go ahead. Well, he has definitely got his desire because he is truly addicted.
[02:50:58.849 --> 02:51:05.009]  Now, the thing is that where we live, we're not in an area. There are some farms around us,
[02:51:05.009 --> 02:51:09.730]  okay, where, you know, you could possibly get some ivermectin that way. But in reality,
[02:51:09.730 --> 02:51:14.130]  like everybody's keeping it for their family and their animals and stuff and such.
[02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:17.970]  But I've been racking my brains for the last couple of years, and I, you know,
[02:51:17.970 --> 02:51:23.970]  dabbled in a lot of different home revenues and that because of my granny. And I just was
[02:51:23.970 --> 02:51:29.730]  wanting to ask Dr. Stella, she has mentioned a few, but I wanted to ask her what she would
[02:51:29.730 --> 02:51:37.090]  think for people like this in my area. If we use a dye mask, I can never mention earth,
[02:51:37.090 --> 02:51:45.009]  and the neem powder and a variety of squash and pumpkin powders. I have the moranga. I have
[02:51:45.009 --> 02:51:53.650]  Brazilian nut powder. I have berberine. And also, I grow all of my herbs, my own herbs,
[02:51:54.289 --> 02:52:01.330]  all a variety of peppermint, oregano, variety of basils, rosemary, thyme, as well as my own
[02:52:01.330 --> 02:52:08.050]  garlic, as well as my own ginger. I have also like organic turmeric. I am wanting to know
[02:52:08.849 --> 02:52:15.410]  if I put all of these compounds together with, I mean, they're all anti-parasitical, anti-worm,
[02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:21.650]  anti-fungal, you know, anti-inflammatory. I'm just wondering if this combination,
[02:52:22.369 --> 02:52:28.769]  and we took that, say, and added to a smoothie, would that be somewhat of a benefit along with
[02:52:28.769 --> 02:52:34.609]  like the, you know, vitamin D3C? Yeah, it's all in there. She's not a nutritionist.
[02:52:34.609 --> 02:52:39.090]  As she said, she's a medically trained person in that, but obviously what God gave us is what
[02:52:39.090 --> 02:52:42.050]  we're supposed to have. Thanks for the call. Dr. Stella, comments on that?
[02:52:42.050 --> 02:52:50.449]  Yeah. I think like, we have like in our supplement, the COVID cleanse, we have NIM,
[02:52:50.449 --> 02:52:55.410]  no, we have NIM actually in the COVID spray because NIM helps with allergies,
[02:52:55.410 --> 02:52:59.890]  and then we have like milk t-cells and COVID cleanse and everything. So what I usually do is
[02:52:59.890 --> 02:53:04.529]  that we actually go through a real manufacturer and we tell them these are the different things
[02:53:04.529 --> 02:53:08.289]  we want to put in there. And then they sit down and they look at the compounds and look
[02:53:08.289 --> 02:53:13.890]  at how they mix and interact with one another. So I can't tell you, I'm not a chemist,
[02:53:13.890 --> 02:53:17.490]  so we actually do have somebody that sits down and look at how they interact with each other
[02:53:17.490 --> 02:53:20.609]  before we put them in supplements. Well, I mean, obviously natural foods
[02:53:20.609 --> 02:53:24.849]  and all the ancient things that are known, like you said, turmeric, mint, all of it.
[02:53:24.849 --> 02:53:27.810]  Let's talk to Chaz in North Carolina. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:53:30.289 --> 02:53:35.890]  Well, good evening, y'all. Just to lay the groundwork for my question is,
[02:53:36.609 --> 02:53:41.970]  I work a very demanding job, which I'm doing right now. I'm out in the 100 degree heat,
[02:53:41.970 --> 02:53:52.369]  sweating in the sun, lifting heavy things. And at my workplace, they went through the whole mess
[02:53:52.369 --> 02:53:59.650]  of if you even feel under the weather, stay out for a week, get a COVID test, blah, blah, blah.
[02:53:59.650 --> 02:54:07.330]  Since 2017, I've only been seriously ill once I got the flu in 2021.
[02:54:08.449 --> 02:54:13.330]  At least I believe it was the flu. I went and got a COVID test that day.
[02:54:13.330 --> 02:54:17.009]  I threw up 30 minutes before I got the test and it came back negative.
[02:54:18.210 --> 02:54:22.929]  I've been around dozens of people who have caught COVID once or twice.
[02:54:23.890 --> 02:54:26.529]  I've been around a handful of people that are vaccinated.
[02:54:27.730 --> 02:54:33.810]  And somehow I have yet to catch COVID. So I have a question I think I might know the
[02:54:33.810 --> 02:54:40.929]  answer to already, but why haven't I caught COVID? That's a great question. Doctor, your view?
[02:54:42.289 --> 02:54:48.449]  I mean, different people have different levels of immunity. And remember that COVID is a
[02:54:48.449 --> 02:54:52.609]  coronavirus and it's been around for a long time. It's not new. There are some people that
[02:54:52.929 --> 02:54:57.970]  caught SARS-CoV-1 that have developed immunity to what is coming right now.
[02:54:57.970 --> 02:55:05.650]  And maybe you caught a subclinical COVID that healed your immunity. So it's
[02:55:05.650 --> 02:55:10.529]  everybody has a different level of immunity. You never got sick because you beat it, never knew it.
[02:55:12.050 --> 02:55:17.890]  Yes. So I mean, coronavirus is a common cold that we get all the time is the coronavirus.
[02:55:17.890 --> 02:55:19.570]  So coronavirus has been around for years.
[02:55:20.449 --> 02:55:23.890]  It's just enhanced and souped up. Anything else Chaz?
[02:55:23.890 --> 02:55:24.390]  Yes.
[02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:30.369]  Yeah. I mean, you know, if that's the case, I caught it and I didn't know it, then it's just
[02:55:31.330 --> 02:55:38.130]  the fact that I am a product of the Infowars products. I take religiously the Whole Foods
[02:55:38.130 --> 02:55:43.650]  multivitamin. I used to take the hair and beard formula because it was the best value.
[02:55:43.650 --> 02:55:48.929]  Get so many pills for such a low price. I moved on to the Whole Foods multivitamin.
[02:55:49.650 --> 02:55:54.689]  I have three packages of vitamin mineral fusion waiting on me.
[02:55:54.689 --> 02:56:00.210]  I've been using the same bottle of X2 nascent iodine for almost two years now,
[02:56:01.009 --> 02:56:06.130]  because there's like 650 servings in one bottle. It's insane. I take it every day.
[02:56:06.130 --> 02:56:09.730]  It's really strong. It's finally going to come in soon. So hard to manufacture though.
[02:56:10.849 --> 02:56:16.769]  But I take the vitamin C with zinc a couple of times a week. I take the vitamin D3
[02:56:16.769 --> 02:56:21.250]  and calcium. Every time winter comes around, I start taking that a couple of times a week.
[02:56:21.810 --> 02:56:27.650]  But religiously every day, I take the multivitamin. I take turmeric. I take the
[02:56:27.650 --> 02:56:32.210]  krill oil or the fish oil, whatever happens to be opened. I go back and forth.
[02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:37.890]  And I take the nascent iodine and ultra B12 under the tongue every single day.
[02:56:37.890 --> 02:56:41.650]  Chaz, that's beautiful. Thank you so much. We got a guest host coming up,
[02:56:41.650 --> 02:56:46.289]  but I want to continue. I want to take a little bit of their time to talk to Anne Marie,

[02:57:35.410 --> 02:57:44.769]  Dr. Stella Emanuel and then the guest host takes over. Stay with us.

[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:22.800]  X3, I don't know when we're going to get it back in. It's hard to manufacture this
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:26.320]  stuff. It's so high quality. The missing link is iodine. This is the best iodine you're
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:32.440]  going to find. X3 is about to sell out but I'm keeping it at 40% off despite that.
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:37.560]  This will be sold out probably today. Get X3 now, infowarsstore.com or triple

[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:49.160]  tune in now. Share clips. You're doing a great job. Coffee has not been available
[02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:53.480]  at infowarsstore.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality
[02:58:53.480 --> 02:58:58.200]  was starting to go down. I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner
[02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:01.600]  with us. But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try
[02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:06.120]  their coffees, I was blown away. We finally have three great coffees that are the best
[02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:10.840]  they have to offer available to you right now. This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:15.560]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:21.080]  these three single source Colombian coffees are now available at infowarsstore.com
[02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:26.600]  exclusively. Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast. Tastes great. It's the strong one,
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:31.160]  really strong. But these are all close second and thirds. Medium Roast, Wake of America.
[02:59:31.960 --> 02:59:36.760]  That's what my go-to. Dark Roast, Tip of the Spirit. Tastes the best and is amazing and is
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:41.800]  still very, very strong. Gives you that pep. They're all three available at infowarsstore.com
[02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:46.120]  and they fund our operation and each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen robot.
[02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:54.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:54.760 --> 03:00:10.360]  Take the highway to the end of the night, end of the night, end of the night.
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:24.360]  Bright midnight, end of the night, end of the night.
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:30.760]  Anne Marie in Pennsylvania. You're on the air with the mighty Dr. Stella Emanuel. Go ahead.
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:35.720]  Yes. God bless and protect you both and your families, first of all.
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:42.520]  Thank you. Dr. Emanuel and Mr. Jones. Okay. Back when all they put their foot on our
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:48.440]  neck so we could really feel it, you know, when all this COVID garbage started. I sent my husband
[03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:56.200]  all the videos that you put out, Alex, and videos from other truth tellers about why not to take
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:01.080]  the shot and how bad it was. And he swore up and down he wouldn't take it. Well, I found
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:09.480]  by accident that he did take it. And aside from the spike proteins, aside from getting COVID,
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:15.720]  okay, which I think I've already had because I'm a nurse, with the graphene oxide and the
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:22.520]  self-assembling nanoparticles, I have not had sex with my husband since I found out that he
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:28.840]  took the shot. And I want to know from Dr. Emanuel, please, if I'm doing the right thing
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:32.760]  because I'm afraid. Well, I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I see the studies years after
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:38.920]  the shots, half the people that took it, they put it, you know, part of it, still are producing
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:47.880]  spike protein doctor. Ma'am, I, because I'm also a pastor, I cannot tell you break up with your
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:54.600]  husband because they took the shot. But there is the risk of him shedding on you from taking the
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:59.880]  shot. So those are things that you're going to have to deal with. I have a staff that
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:04.120]  the husband took the shot and she gets sick all the time. We put on hydroxychloroquine
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:10.520]  and hydroxychloroquine weekly and vitamins because those are choices that she and her husband made.
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:15.640]  This stuff that we're dealing with, people make wrong choices. And some of the times those
[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:20.440]  wrong choices affect the rest of us, especially people that are around them and love them. So
[03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:25.080]  I don't know, ma'am, I don't really know what to tell you on that one. You know,
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:29.320]  maybe you could use a condom. I don't know. I don't know how you price, what I respect,
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:34.920]  can go through that or not. But I will tell you just, you know, I'm not gonna take you
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:39.240]  break your marriage because of that. Because many, this is all of us are under attack.
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:42.680]  So that's why I will tell you make sure that you take your vitamins, take some
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:48.280]  ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine weekly. And the rest of it, you know, I will just pray
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:53.000]  because it's between you and God on that one. I really don't, I can't, I'm not qualified
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:57.720]  to give people advice on what to do with their house. Yeah, because here's the issue.
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:02.040]  I'm not a doctor, but even touching people or doorknobs, there's spike proteins everywhere.
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:10.280]  So I would rather mitigate with supplements and things by protein than, you know, and I'm sorry
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:14.120]  your husband did that. But, you know, I don't want to see you. I mean, it's really up to
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:22.040]  you. So I don't think we can tell you what you're going to do. The self-assembling
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:26.840]  nanoparticles and the graphene oxide, is that transmitted in the semen too? Does anybody know?
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:31.800]  Well, yeah, it's a blood product. I mean, yeah, obviously you can touch somebody in a major
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:35.880]  University of Colorado study that came out last month. You can get it. Well, I mean, of course,
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:39.800]  I mean, we're a doctor, you're a doctor. Dr. Stella, she's asking a question. Sorry.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:45.720]  It's transmitted in all your body fluids. In fact, you can just transmit it from skin,
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:49.640]  sweat and stuff like that. And it's transmitted through body fluids, yeah.
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:54.760]  Okay. Well, thank you. That's what I go to thought.
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:01.000]  Thank you very much. Thank you. That's very sad. If you love him,
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:06.920]  I'd roll the dice. I mean, you know, at the end of the day, it's everywhere. But I'm not
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:09.560]  going to, like you said, doctor, we're not going to give her advice on what to do with
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:13.400]  her husband. That's up to her. Yeah. Just get some supplements and, you know,
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:18.440]  and ride it, you know, that's, that's what you get. Have your husband,
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:23.160]  have your husband detox, detox. Yeah. Both of you detox. Yes. Well,
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.560]  you get married. It's your ride or die partner. You know, you said, you know,
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:31.080]  for better for worse. So I don't know. All right, we're going to go to break.
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:36.120]  Drstellamd.com promo code Alex, pick discounts. What is the main detox products you've got?

[03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:26.280]  Welcome back to our number four, the informative, the dynamic,
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:33.800]  the amazing Hernandez sent to take over in about five minutes. But we're taking a few final calls
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:39.560]  with Dr. Stella Emanuel and in New York and Virginia and North Carolina. Go ahead.
[03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:46.680]  I'm in New York City. And I am so happy to have this opportunity to speak to both of you.
[03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:54.280]  Thank you so much. Thank you. When I when I saw Dr. Stella on on my computer because I don't
[03:06:54.280 --> 03:07:00.120]  have TB, that first day when she was saying nobody has to die. I liked her immediately.
[03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:06.120]  I immediately went to her website. And I got the hydroxychloroquine and I failed through the
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:11.320]  whole pandemic years. And there were people who told me that not only was she not a real
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:17.160]  doctor, there were people who told me she wasn't even a real person. And the other thing,
[03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:22.680]  Dr. Stella that I want you to know is that I had the opportunity to meet you at an event in
[03:07:22.680 --> 03:07:28.360]  New York briefly. And there was something about to your glow your energy, long story short,
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:34.360]  you are the inspiration for me, going back to church, opening up the Bible,
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:41.160]  I became born again, as a result of your, your ministries, and the things that you
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:47.880]  talked about in your book, and on the internet, and just looking at your faith. And I just,
[03:07:47.880 --> 03:07:53.400]  I'm 73 years old, and I was thinking, I want to be like her when I grow up. And so I want to
[03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:56.760]  thank you for that. I want to thank you for everything that you've done. I've already got
[03:07:56.760 --> 03:08:02.840]  my supply of a hydro toxic work when I call it my Tuesday, Tuesday medicine for whatever
[03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:06.760]  they're going to throw at us next. And I just want to thank both of you for just
[03:08:07.560 --> 03:08:12.280]  the information keeping me awake, just everything that you're doing. Thank you.
[03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:18.520]  Thank you. Beautiful. He said, Do you have any questions or comments?
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:20.760]  Yeah.
[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:28.760]  Well, fighting the devil here, we need Jesus to find it.
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:36.280]  So we need to like, get our hearts back to God, get back to prayer. So be prepared spiritually,
[03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:41.160]  physically, medically, and make sure that you're not afraid. Because I tell people,
[03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:45.000]  those that are prepared are not going to be afraid. Remember, don't be so afraid to die
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.440]  that you're willing to let them inject whatever in your body because if you give your life to
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:52.920]  Christ to die in crisis game. So that's one of the things that I tell people, I'm not afraid
[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:58.280]  because I know I'm a child of God, and I belong to Jesus, and I'm able to stand and fight this
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:04.440]  body because of that. So I tell people, get prepared, get ready to day to day to day,
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:09.800]  get hydroscopic in your medicine cabinet. Today, don't wait till you get sick,
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:16.520]  go get COVID bites, you know, take it daily, make sure that you are safe. And if you go on
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:21.880]  our website, if you use promo code Alex, you get a discount. So just try and be prepared today.
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:26.200]  And that's, you know, just be prepared and read the Bible. We're in the book of Revelation,
[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:31.160]  read Revelation 13. The CBDCs are coming. You're not going to be able to buy or sell
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:35.880]  without taking a mark. Be prepared, stock up food, water, everything. Just make sure that
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:40.840]  you're paranoid enough to build up a fortress where you can survive.
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:47.320]  Very well said. Thank you, Ann. Let's go to Virginia Last Caller before the great
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:51.160]  Duran Andes takes over. Go ahead, Virginia Last Caller, you're our tell gunner.
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:56.600]  Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Dr. Stella, praying for you both. My question for Dr. Stella is
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:02.600]  this. A couple of years ago, I came down with COVID. Both my husband and I got very sick. I
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:08.440]  did take supplements, but unfortunately it got the better of me. I was hospitalized.
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:14.280]  And their protocol, of course, was, and I knew nothing about Rendesovir. They put me on a five
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:19.400]  day regimen of Rendesovir. But by God's grace, I walked out of that hospital because God was
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:24.600]  watching over me. And I do take all of the supplements that Dr. Stella is talking about.
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:33.320]  I have ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, dudecidin. I mean, we're just stacking up on all of it.
[03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:39.400]  My question for Dr. Stella is this. What else can I do, Dr. Stella, since I was given
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:45.720]  this Rendesovir a couple of years ago? It's very toxic. Thank God. I am okay. I praise God
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:52.600]  every day for that. I do drink teas. I drink Get Clean, dandelion root tea, pine needle tea.
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:58.360]  I do detox with milk thistle. Is there anything else? I mean, God is the one who's in charge,
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:05.640]  and thank you both. But is there anything else that I can do for myself to make sure,
[03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:11.880]  and I do not believe in vaccines. Yes, I was vaccinated as a child, but not these vaccines.
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:18.200]  These are poison. This is the devil working through these demonic people. And so is there
[03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:24.760]  anything else I can do, Dr. Stella, that you can suggest? You seem to be quite on top of
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:28.760]  everything. Like I said, if Rendesovir didn't kill you in your hospital and you're okay,
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:33.320]  we're thankful for that. And, you know, just continue to, you know, build your immunity,
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:37.480]  get stuck up and be ready. So I think you're doing the right thing. And on top of that,
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:42.360]  you know, trusting God to take care of all of us. Yes. And everybody should be like you,
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:46.520]  stuck up on your hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and make sure that you have your vitamins,
[03:11:46.520 --> 03:11:51.320]  make sure you're taking vitamin D and, you know, turmeric and ginger and stuff like that.
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:56.600]  And I mean, if you go on Alex's website, on my website, we have enough for you to suck up.
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:02.040]  We have something we call the plandemic prep pack that actually has something for, you know,
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:07.000]  COVID and something for just the different pandemics, including even getting nuked and,
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.560]  you know, getting potassium iodides to get nuked. That's right. So DrStellaMD.com

[03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:29.960]  bless you. God bless you. Totally vindicated. It's all coming out. They're trying to lock

[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:52.040]  Gab McGinnis. All the other great work he takes over now. Alex, thank you. You guys
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:58.200]  are now watching the fourth hour of the most banned show in the universe, the Alex Jones show.
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:02.600]  Like Alex said, I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez. Lock and load, guys. We are in it
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:07.640]  for the remainder of the show until the war room comes on with the great Owen Schroyer,
[03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:15.720]  as always. But guys, I mean, it's very interesting. Can you just feel it? I could feel it every time
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:19.240]  I'm listening. I mean, every time I've ever listened into the Alex Jones show,
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:23.640]  War Room, American Journal or throughout the years listening on Infowars, all the great
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:29.800]  hosts and guest hosts, you just hear this increase of Christ and Jesus getting inserted
[03:13:29.800 --> 03:13:34.120]  into the conversation no matter what's being talked about. Have you guys noticed that no
[03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:38.840]  matter what's being talked about, whether it's some kind of climate lockdown on the verge of
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:46.360]  society, Agenda 2021, Agenda 2030 or Agenda 2050, or whether we're talking about the incoming
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:51.400]  COVID restrictions and lockdowns that are looming over the horizon again for the future of the
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:55.560]  United States of America, no matter what we're talking about, whether we're talking about the
[03:13:55.560 --> 03:14:01.320]  hacking of the genitals of children or human beings at that or all of these degenerate
[03:14:01.320 --> 03:14:06.760]  agendas that are attacking humanity, that are depopulating humanity, whether it's the warp
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:11.720]  sciences of the New World Order and the Dr. Fauci's of the world that are imposing
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:17.640]  their own expert advice on the peasants, which, by the way, Dr. Fauci came out the other day.
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:21.400]  I'm pretty sure this was covered all over Infowars, but I found it interesting and I wanted
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:26.040]  to comment on it when Dr. Fauci was interviewed by CNN recently because they're rolling out the
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:29.480]  great high priest of the COVID cult. He's got to make a comment because they're
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:33.880]  locking and loading and getting ready for all the COVID restrictions.
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:36.920]  Don't you find it interesting? They're like, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:42.680]  Some of the media was saying it was a conspiracy when Alex dropped the fed whistleblowers
[03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:48.040]  that came out to warn the world that incoming COVID restrictions and possible lockdowns are
[03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:52.119]  coming. Some of the media said conspiracy theory and some of them tried to get ahead of it
[03:14:52.119 --> 03:14:56.040]  because that's the agenda they're all going with. Then they roll Biden out and Biden says,
[03:14:56.280 --> 03:15:03.080]  well, we're fully funding an incoming vaccine and we're considering recommending it, right?
[03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:07.880]  And then they roll out Fauci and Fauci's on CNN telling everybody,
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:13.880]  well, I hope that the people, I don't know. He was signaling to the federal government.
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:20.040]  I don't know. I really hope that the people, they do abide by the recommendations. I don't
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:25.400]  really know. And a lot of people on Twitter, I think with good intentions, they'll take that
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:29.880]  and try to make a narrative out of it and say, you see Fauci's scared. Fauci's scared.
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:36.040]  No, Fauci is the great high priest of the COVID cult in the New World Order.
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:41.480]  And whatever that guy says, go. So that's a part of the plan. They're all building blocks.
[03:15:41.480 --> 03:15:47.240]  They're all building blocks that get inserted, removed, replaced. And he's definitely one of
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:53.160]  those founding building blocks of the New World Order lockdowns and COVID restrictions and vaccine
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:59.320]  mandates in the United States of America, even predating that to rolling out AIDS upon Americans
[03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:05.400]  and rolling out AIDS on citizens of planet Earth. But that's a whole other conversation.
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:09.720]  But in terms of the COVID cult, we all know that the great high priest Dr. Fauci is
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:15.400]  definitely a prominent voice when he comes out and he signals to the world. And of course,
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:20.840]  the United States, we know how this works now. How is the United States government functioning?
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:24.600]  We have a deep state and then we have bureaucrats that are all New World Order
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:29.800]  plants that come from organizations like the World Health Organization,
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:36.280]  organizations like the CDC, organizations that are not necessarily government established,
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:40.440]  but they're somehow government funded. They get around to it.
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:45.720]  There's some kind of legislation and funding or they'll just use an NGO proxy to somehow
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:49.880]  fund the organization so they could just show face and say, well, you see, it's not actually
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:56.200]  happening. But I think everyone woke up to the reality and the fact that in 2020 and post 2020,
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:17:02.040]  it were these bureaucrats. It was the experts and they turned to the experts that are all New
[03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:06.520]  World Order plants. They do the same thing with social media, with the fact checkers.
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:11.000]  The fact checkers are the experts. They're the arbiters of truth. They are the ones that
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.680]  are overseeing your soul. They are the ones that are overseeing whether you are going to
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:19.080]  believe in something or not, or whether you can believe in something or not.
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:25.400]  Who fundamentally has the right to pull the trigger, not only in what I want to see and
[03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:30.440]  what I want to watch or what I want to read or what I want to listen to, but who has the
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:36.920]  authority to pull the trigger on what I want to believe myself as an autonomous human being?
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:42.119]  You say this is why the info war is so important to understand. The federal government
[03:17:42.119 --> 03:17:47.400]  understands we're in an information war, the New World Order. And when I say New World Order,
[03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:52.440]  you could point to organizations like the CDC, the World Health Organization, the United Nations,
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:58.600]  the EU, the World Economic Forum and all of their proxies. And it's like
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:03.080]  umbrellaed all the way down with all these separate organizations and nonprofits
[03:18:03.080 --> 03:18:07.960]  that are all unified under one mission, one mandate, one vision.
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:15.720]  And that is a global unified police state that is surveilled with AI technology in the future.
[03:18:15.720 --> 03:18:18.760]  That's why Klaus Schwab comes out and says, oh, we love China. They're so great. They're
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:23.800]  the model. Bill Gates, too. Whoever masters the technology of the future, masters the future.
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:27.880]  You'll become the master of the future. All these people are in unison because they're
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:32.280]  all abiding by the satanic antichrist agenda. We all know that. That's when the cashless
[03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:37.480]  society comes in. The digital dollar already exists. They want to do away with physical currency.
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:44.200]  They've already rolled out all of these systems where they can implement it any day now, by the
[03:18:44.200 --> 03:18:50.040]  way, any day this can get rolled out. It's only a matter of time. But one thing I think people
[03:18:50.040 --> 03:18:54.280]  need to always remember is just exactly how this is fully operating out in the open.
[03:18:54.280 --> 03:18:58.520]  These people don't operate in the shadows as much as they used to. These people are not
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:04.360]  necessarily a shadow government anymore. You know, I haven't really been using that term a lot
[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:08.360]  lately. And it's not because I don't believe in it anymore. And it's not because it's not a reality.
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:11.480]  The shadow government is out in the open.
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:16.520]  Anyone like why do you think in Georgia all the blacks are waking up?
[03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:20.440]  Because they understand what Rico means and they slap that on Trump and everyone's all the
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:24.920]  black people in Georgia like, oh, well, that's that. That's a fed up. That's a total fed up.
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:28.520]  They're slapping Rico on Trump. We know what that means because all of their families have
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:33.320]  gone through that. They understand what's going on there. You see, the more tyranny begins to
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:39.640]  rise in advance. And I'll even use the word succeed. If tyranny is going to succeed in our
[03:19:39.640 --> 03:19:46.280]  culture and our society, that only means one thing. That only means freedom is inevitable.
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:50.040]  That only means America first is inevitable. That only means I mean,
[03:19:50.680 --> 03:19:56.520]  I'll tell you for for sure. Christ is king is inevitable. The Kingdom of God is at hand.
[03:19:56.520 --> 03:20:00.600]  Two thousand years ago, Christ Jesus was walking the earth and proclaim that
[03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:07.080]  very publicly and bluntly to his generation of that day. And those words still echo right now,
[03:20:07.080 --> 03:20:11.400]  two thousand years later, and we're still talking about it right now, live on the air
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:17.000]  on Infowars.com band video. This gospel has made its way all around to the ends of the
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:23.640]  earth, just like God prophesied it would. You see, Christ is king. The Kingdom of God is
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:28.040]  inevitable. But who has the authority back to the question, who has the authority
[03:20:28.840 --> 03:20:33.080]  to mandate and pull the trigger on what you decide what you're going to believe in?
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:39.560]  See, now we're getting into Brave New World and 1984 and every single one of us are Winston.
[03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:45.800]  And every single one of us are being told that two plus two equals five and anything otherwise
[03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:52.520]  makes you a threat to the state. And why are you a threat to the state?
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:54.760]  Because it's not about whether the statement is true or not.
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:00.440]  It's not about whether the statement that we are telling you to reside or excuse me,
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:06.200]  that we are telling you to state two plus two equals five. It's not about whether that's true
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:11.480]  or whether that's false. It's about whether we say whether it's true or whether it's false.
[03:21:11.480 --> 03:21:15.400]  And it's about whether we told you to say it or whether we told you not to say it.
[03:21:16.200 --> 03:21:23.400]  We want you to get death jabs, you'll get the death jabs. Well, what about the research?
[03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:28.600]  What about the research? You see, two plus two equals five. Well, why should we get
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:33.560]  mandated to death jabs? What about the science? What about the negative side effects, especially
[03:21:33.560 --> 03:21:38.040]  for people that are compromised already with your immune systems? Well, no, no, no, no,
[03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:44.840]  two plus two equals five. You don't research anything. You don't look into anything.
[03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:54.200]  You don't even read, okay? Do not read, do not enhance or amplify your IQ to educate yourself.
[03:21:54.200 --> 03:22:01.400]  The last thing the New World Order wants is a fully armed, educated and informed
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:07.240]  info warrior that is in this war that totally understands what's going on around them.
[03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:13.960]  Whether you're a grandma boomer or you're Gen Z just getting ready to take on the future
[03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:20.040]  for the next 70 to 80 years or even younger than that. The last thing these people want
[03:22:20.040 --> 03:22:29.560]  is not just one person, 10 people, 100 people, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1 million.
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:35.560]  The billions that occupy this planet, the last thing they want is us waking up to the
[03:22:35.560 --> 03:22:40.119]  reality fully informed. That's why they're engaged in the info war. That's why they
[03:22:40.119 --> 03:22:45.080]  run their disinformation campaigns. That's why they call everyone a conspiracy theorist.
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:48.040]  They try to discredit everybody. CIA tactics, we all know this.
[03:22:48.920 --> 03:22:53.800]  They understand what the info war truly is. That is a battle for the mind. It is a battle
[03:22:53.800 --> 03:22:58.680]  for ideology. And ultimately, from a spiritual perspective as a Christian and a biblical
[03:22:58.680 --> 03:23:03.320]  perspective, the info war is all about what? The battle for the soul. The information
[03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:09.160]  of the gospel unlocks what? It unlocks the mind, which leads to the unlocking of the soul.
[03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:14.760]  The unlocking of salvation and the forgiveness of sins forever,
[03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:21.640]  which leads to the ultimate unlocking of an eternity with God and paradise and heaven
[03:23:21.640 --> 03:23:26.440]  forever. Talk about an information war, that's ultimately where this goes.
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:31.480]  Because when Jesus was asked, what's the greatest commandment, right? They try to catch
[03:23:31.480 --> 03:23:35.960]  him. They try to catch him slip in. And because he was God in human flesh,
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:39.480]  he turns around and says, well, love your neighbor.
[03:23:40.440 --> 03:23:43.560]  Excuse me, love the Lord your God with all of your heart, your soul,
[03:23:44.119 --> 03:23:50.040]  your strength. And all that else did he say? Your mind. You want to talk about an info war?
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:54.760]  Christ understood this as well. And then he said to love your neighbor as yourself.
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:58.360]  Without that, you cannot love anybody in proximity around you.
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:24:05.400]  You will constantly always be aggravated. You will constantly and always be at odds with
[03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:11.240]  somebody. Because if you have no peace with God, if you have no stable relationship with God,
[03:24:11.240 --> 03:24:14.920]  you cannot have a stable relationship with anybody in your life. Whether it's your wife,
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:18.600]  whether it's your kids, whether it's your co workers, those that work under you,
[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:22.280]  or someone that works above you, you will not have the stability to be able to
[03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:26.200]  deal with anybody. Because if you don't have peace with God, you will not have peace with
[03:24:26.200 --> 03:24:32.200]  humanity. The Bible is very clear because that's flipped and says the unbeliever is at
[03:24:32.200 --> 03:24:37.880]  enmity with God, is at war with God. So they cannot have peace with humanity in any way,
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:42.280]  shape or form because they live based off of the violation of according to Jesus,
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:46.600]  the greatest commandments. Love the Lord your God with all your soul, your strength,
[03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:50.360]  your heart and your mind and your neighbor is yourself.
[03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:54.840]  So they're inverted on that because they're anti Christ. So that's why they're ultimately
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:58.760]  Psalms chapter two. They're at war with God. They're at war with Messiah. They will see
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:03.560]  that out to the very end. That's what all the anti Christ agendas are all about across the
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:10.119]  entire board. The depopulation of the attack of traditional biological marriage instituted by God.
[03:25:10.119 --> 03:25:15.240]  Okay. The depopulation agenda of the so-called trans hacking the genitals of human beings,
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:21.240]  male and female depopulation, whether it's the death jabs being implemented on human beings.
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:24.520]  And right now we're just experiencing the COVID ones. Just wait till they roll out the
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:28.440]  more serious ones and wait till they, like Alex said today, wait till they roll,
[03:25:28.440 --> 03:25:34.119]  or he said it today or yesterday, wait till they roll out a more serious bioweapon
[03:25:34.119 --> 03:25:39.000]  virus on humanity. You think the fear hysteria was bad over COVID?
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:45.080]  Just wait till something more serious gets rolled out. And then you will see some serious fear
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:52.200]  and mass formation going on because people will be in a total panic and hysteria beyond
[03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:57.720]  what we've already seen in 2020. And it gives them the excuse to roll out the lockdowns.
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:01.400]  There are studies coming out saying that locking down actually got more people killed.
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:05.000]  I think that's an Epoch Times study that came out today. I was reading it earlier this morning.
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:10.440]  Anyone can go find that right now. But also whether the depopulation agenda, like I said,
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:18.119]  is rolling out a bioweapon, decrease the population or vaccine mandates, decrease
[03:26:18.119 --> 03:26:25.080]  the population, or rolling out the cashless society, world coin, which already exists,
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:30.840]  doing away with physical currency, doing away with precious metals at the end of the day,
[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:37.640]  doing away and making everything centralized and digitized in one central location.
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:41.720]  And it's all AI driven, so it's controlled, and the entire world could be monitored,
[03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:45.560]  and it will be enforced without even someone having to look at it.
[03:26:46.119 --> 03:26:51.080]  All you need is a program that understands human behaviors. Those things all exist today.
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:55.960]  Sounds like a sci-fi movie if you were to talk about something like that, maybe in the 60s,
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:01.320]  70s, and 80s. But the technology has rapidly advanced, and it exists in our day
[03:27:01.320 --> 03:27:06.760]  here in 2023. And that could get rolled out any moment now. Again, depopulation,
[03:27:06.760 --> 03:27:11.400]  if you do not have access to the economy, you do not have access to food. Therefore,
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:15.800]  you do not have access to survival. Therefore, you will die, okay?
[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:20.280]  So that's depopulation. All of these agendas, whichever one we want, and of course the climate
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:27.240]  cult, they start locking everybody down. They start locking you out of access,
[03:27:28.119 --> 03:27:34.040]  social credit score, your carbon footprint is too high. Right now, listen, this is the sequence
[03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:37.240]  with the climate change cult. I'll tell you what it is. You want to know what it is?
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:43.080]  The sequence is, they start with the fossil fuels, they attack gas, nuclear energy,
[03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:48.760]  they attack oil, demonize it, demonize it, demonize it, attack it, attack it,
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:54.040]  roll out Al Gore, attack it, attack it, attack it, right? And then they go to
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:28:00.200]  inanimate objects. They go to planes, then they go to cars, and they want to roll out
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:05.720]  all the EVs, and they want to be full EV by 2050 or 2030. It's coming in the next
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:10.600]  two or three decades. They go to cars, and then they go to your stove,
[03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:14.600]  and then they go to your refrigerator. Well, that's too high, we need to get rid of that too.
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:17.960]  And then they go to your AC, and then they go to your heater.
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:23.160]  Biden administration this year announced that they are going after gas powered generators.
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:28.520]  They not only want to ban the ones that exist, they want to push forward a ban
[03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:34.119]  to discontinue the future manufacturer of any gas generators in the future.
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:37.480]  So then they go to machines and in that inanimate objects,
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:42.600]  because those carbon footprints are too high. And they'll do that with anything. That's why
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:46.440]  you got the whole ESG right now. By everything and all these companies are
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:51.160]  what we're environmentally friendly, because our building itself might be our building or itself.
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:55.720]  Well, if we have to have a high carbon footprint that our business can exist in the New World
[03:28:55.720 --> 03:29:02.200]  Order, because it's just a mask. It's just six feet. It's just non essential businesses.
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:07.160]  It's just non essential workers. It's just until we work it out.
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:14.520]  It's just a bar. It's just a restaurant. It's just nursing homes. It's just schools.
[03:29:15.160 --> 03:29:20.360]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services. It's just until the cases go down.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:25.560]  It's just to flatten the curve. It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[03:29:26.119 --> 03:29:30.040]  It's just for a few more weeks. It's just gyms,
[03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:36.760]  salons, spas, and sporting events. It's just churches and mosques. It's just singing.
[03:29:37.320 --> 03:29:43.880]  It's just travel. It's just until we get a vaccine. It's just for the greater good.
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:51.640]  It's just fact checking, not censorship. It's just mandatory. It isn't just at all.

[03:29:56.760 --> 03:30:01.720]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the answer.

[03:32:03.160 --> 03:32:07.720]  Body's ultimate memory formula. And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:19.000]  Overhead shot, please. Look how full this model is. Right to the top, folks. Right to the top
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:27.640]  with these 95% of humanoids. Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%. Some are maybe 10.

[03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:43.400]  like taking 10 of the average pill, it's that powerful or more. So they're available at

[03:32:58.280 --> 03:33:04.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.100 --> 03:33:19.620]  Alright guys, I want to apologize, I cut myself off, that's me, you know.
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:26.380]  Retards do retard things, got to pay attention, but anyways, so uh, I really want to break
[03:33:26.380 --> 03:33:34.540]  down what I think the sequence of the climate cult is going to kind of look like for the
[03:33:34.540 --> 03:33:36.380]  next few decades.
[03:33:36.380 --> 03:33:39.860]  And what we've already been seeing, you didn't catch it before the break, is they started
[03:33:39.860 --> 03:33:48.020]  with attacking fossil fuels, oil, gas, nuclear energy, et cetera, and then they've transitioned
[03:33:48.020 --> 03:33:53.540]  to inanimate objects, they've transitioned into machines, and they've gone after planes,
[03:33:53.540 --> 03:33:58.500]  they've gone after cars, they've gone after machines that are gas powered, they've gone
[03:33:58.500 --> 03:34:05.180]  after nuclear energy, they've gone after, well, the plants as well, they've gone after trains,
[03:34:05.180 --> 03:34:09.740]  they've gone after coal, they've gone after anything that's powered by that, and ultimately,
[03:34:09.740 --> 03:34:13.660]  like they've been rolling out more aggressively this year, they're going after the household
[03:34:13.660 --> 03:34:14.660]  appliances.
[03:34:14.660 --> 03:34:21.160]  So they go from, you know, the corporate America, they go after businesses, they go
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:25.220]  after tools, and then they go after cars, and then they go after, like I said, planes,
[03:34:25.220 --> 03:34:28.100]  and then eventually, they're invading your home now.
[03:34:28.100 --> 03:34:32.940]  They're going after your stove, they're going to go after your heater, your AC, and like
[03:34:32.940 --> 03:34:37.100]  I said, the Biden administration this year has openly come out and said that they are
[03:34:37.100 --> 03:34:42.900]  going to be going after the gas powered generators and attempting to stop and discontinue
[03:34:42.900 --> 03:34:46.300]  the manufacture of any gas powered generators in the future.
[03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:48.880]  You see, what's the leap from there?
[03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:52.300]  And we know a couple days ago, this huge news that's been breaking out that the Bill
[03:34:52.300 --> 03:34:59.340]  Gates affiliated donations are funding organizations that want to chop hundreds of acres, acres
[03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:03.300]  of trees down, bury them in the ground, and they say, Well, why do we got to do that?
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:05.060]  Why do we got to take out all the trees?
[03:35:05.060 --> 03:35:09.620]  Because they have too high of a carbon footprint to another going after plants.
[03:35:09.620 --> 03:35:11.340]  Now they're going after trees, which is interesting.
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:14.780]  I wonder how all the tree huggers are dealing with that one.
[03:35:14.780 --> 03:35:17.300]  I would love to interview one of the kind of how's that supposed to work?
[03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:19.620]  You know, you love the environment.
[03:35:19.620 --> 03:35:21.060]  And you say we need to go full green.
[03:35:21.060 --> 03:35:26.340]  But hey, got all Willy over there just chopping down the forest because that's too high of
[03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:27.340]  a carbon footprint.
[03:35:27.340 --> 03:35:28.340]  So what happens?
[03:35:28.340 --> 03:35:29.340]  What happens?
[03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:31.580]  Are the tree huggers going to go hug the trees and they get chopped down and they
[03:35:31.580 --> 03:35:35.140]  get buried underground and Bill Gates is sitting there just laughing.
[03:35:35.140 --> 03:35:38.300]  Yes, so good.
[03:35:38.300 --> 03:35:41.100]  Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:42.260]  And then they'll go to animals.
[03:35:42.260 --> 03:35:43.260]  That's the big one next.
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:44.260]  They've already done that.
[03:35:44.260 --> 03:35:46.100]  That's why they're pushing synthetic meat.
[03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:47.620]  That's why they're pushing bugs.
[03:35:47.620 --> 03:35:48.620]  Yes.
[03:35:48.620 --> 03:35:52.140]  That's why they're literally there's some viral videos that went out the other day where
[03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:56.300]  these psycho psycho New World Order plants.
[03:35:56.300 --> 03:36:02.460]  Oh, you know, we have a substitute for milk and it's just it's it's it's it's black
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:07.500]  fly larva and we just we take like hundreds of them and then we blend them and it looks
[03:36:07.500 --> 03:36:08.500]  like milk.
[03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:13.220]  And it was crazy because in the video it was like these like woke New World Order,
[03:36:13.220 --> 03:36:19.940]  you know, white women and they're making this like black fly larva smoothie at the
[03:36:19.940 --> 03:36:20.940]  end of the video.
[03:36:20.940 --> 03:36:25.860]  They're like feeding it to black people and the black people are the black people
[03:36:25.860 --> 03:36:26.860]  are like.
[03:36:26.860 --> 03:36:28.900]  And they're like, should we eat this?
[03:36:28.900 --> 03:36:30.140]  And they didn't tell him what it was.
[03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:34.820]  And at the end of the video, the woman is like, oh, well, it's not ice cream.
[03:36:34.820 --> 03:36:36.220]  It's not milk.
[03:36:36.220 --> 03:36:41.420]  Would you be shocked if I told you it was insects?
[03:36:41.420 --> 03:36:44.100]  The woke white women feeding black people, insects.
[03:36:44.100 --> 03:36:45.100]  You got to love it.
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:46.100]  You got to love that.
[03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:47.100]  It's somewhere on my Twitter.
[03:36:47.100 --> 03:36:48.100]  I think if you guys want to find it.
[03:36:48.100 --> 03:36:49.340]  But it's just it's so good.
[03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:50.340]  It's so good.
[03:36:50.340 --> 03:36:51.580]  You see, but this is what they're going to continue to do.
[03:36:51.580 --> 03:36:55.940]  And then they'll go to the animals that you will not be able to have livestock anymore.
[03:36:55.940 --> 03:36:59.220]  They're attacking the farms while Bill Gates goes and buys up on the farmland because
[03:36:59.220 --> 03:37:00.220]  he's going to survive.
[03:37:00.220 --> 03:37:01.220]  Right.
[03:37:01.220 --> 03:37:02.220]  I'll go out to the animals.
[03:37:02.220 --> 03:37:04.640]  They'll execute and slaughter all the animals.
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:11.060]  They'll start with livestock first and then they'll go to pets and domestic animals.
[03:37:11.060 --> 03:37:13.480]  You're going to have to slaughter your dog.
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:16.260]  You're going to have to euthanize your cat.
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:20.640]  You're going to have to euthanize and it'll all be facilitated.
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:26.460]  In veterinary by veterinarians and pet hospitals or wellness centers for animals, and you'll
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:30.380]  have to euthanize all your animals because that will be mandated by the New World Order
[03:37:30.380 --> 03:37:35.100]  that will be mandated by the feds and PETA PETA is going to have to make a decision.
[03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:36.460]  They're going to have to make a decision.
[03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:42.220]  It's either do you get along with the New World Order or do you continue to fight for
[03:37:42.220 --> 03:37:44.460]  animals to survive?
[03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:46.400]  Because if you don't, we're not going to survive.
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:37:49.860]  We're all going to die because they are causing too high of a carbon footprint.
[03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:50.860]  Do you see all that?
[03:37:50.860 --> 03:37:51.860]  Do you see what they're doing?
[03:37:51.860 --> 03:37:55.940]  Do you see the amount of the cat litter that you're spending every single month?
[03:37:55.940 --> 03:37:58.940]  The dog food unit, they'll just attach it to something.
[03:37:58.940 --> 03:38:04.400]  They'll attach it to a damn manufactured company to who makes the dog toys.
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:05.400]  You know what I mean?
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:06.400]  Well, there you go.
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:08.840]  You see, they're going to get us killed by the next 30 years.
[03:38:08.840 --> 03:38:12.620]  You've got to execute and euthanize your dog.
[03:38:12.620 --> 03:38:15.840]  You've got to execute and euthanize your pet kitty.
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:19.200]  The family kitty's got to go.
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:26.600]  Go to domestic animals, slaughter all the animals, and then the last stop will be humanity.
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:28.120]  The last stop will be you.
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:29.120]  That's the end game.
[03:38:29.120 --> 03:38:32.120]  The end game, total depopulation will be you.
[03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:33.120]  It'll be you.
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:34.120]  It'll be me.
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:38.480]  They'll start, you know, maybe they'll get old school with it.
[03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:39.480]  You know what I mean?
[03:38:39.480 --> 03:38:42.000]  Like they'll get old school eugenicists.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:47.000]  First they'll start with executing the political opponents that resist.
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  They'll start there.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:52.680]  They'll start there against their will while these people do not want to submit, just
[03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:56.080]  like you don't submit to the lockdowns, you don't comply to the COVID lockdowns or
[03:38:56.080 --> 03:38:58.100]  restrictions or vaccine mandates.
[03:38:58.100 --> 03:39:02.680]  When they roll out the COVID cult lockdowns, they'll start executing, because this is
[03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:04.440]  like life or death for these people.
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:08.160]  You know how they lost their minds and all the psycho, all the psychos with 10 masks
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:09.160]  on all over the street.
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:11.480]  You're, you're not staying home and selling lives.
[03:39:11.480 --> 03:39:13.640]  You're not staying home and saving lives.
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:15.200]  You're not vaxxed 10 times.
[03:39:15.200 --> 03:39:16.420]  You're going to get us killed.
[03:39:16.420 --> 03:39:17.420]  You're a murderer.
[03:39:17.420 --> 03:39:18.420]  You're a murderer.
[03:39:18.420 --> 03:39:20.640]  Why is this person in prison?
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:25.040]  It doesn't matter if you get sent to prison, they'll just let you out because of COVID.
[03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:27.200]  Well, right now.
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:33.920]  But with the climate, the climate cult lockdowns, they'll take it to another level, dude.
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:39.200]  Because the hysteria will be brought to a level again, even heightened.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:42.840]  Well, they all, they all believe the end of the world is coming, the giant tsunami
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:43.840]  is coming.
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:45.920]  Oh, we're going to get incinerated by a solar flare.
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:48.000]  Oh, we're going to go into the next ice age.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:49.640]  We have to prevent that.
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:51.760]  Our entire world is going to rise in temperatures.
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:56.360]  We're all going to be living in 200 degree temperatures and have to live underground.
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:39:57.360]  What a psyop.
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:39:59.640]  I think they could actually pull that off.
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:02.800]  You know, where things are right now, they could convince the entire world.
[03:40:02.800 --> 03:40:07.160]  I mean, obviously you and I wouldn't fall for it, but the next five years we're going
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:10.560]  to experience temperatures over 200 degrees.
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:13.640]  We have new 15 minute cities, but they are updated.
[03:40:13.640 --> 03:40:15.880]  They will be underground in a hive.
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:18.280]  You got to live there or die.
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:23.480]  There would be, I guarantee there'd be millions of people that would flock to that crap, unfortunately.
[03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:26.120]  But so they'll start with those that are resisting.
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:30.680]  They'll start with the rebellion, the resistance people that listen to info wars, the Patriots,
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:35.000]  the Trump supporters, just people that want freedom and humanity.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.360]  They'll start with their mass executions.
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:38.360]  They'll round them up.
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:40.080]  They'll use all the FEMA camps.
[03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:43.240]  They'll establish concentration camps by region.
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:46.240]  If it's in the United States, obviously they all already exist.
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:51.800]  They'll round everybody up, show it to your house, they'll measure your carbon footprint.
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:54.800]  Maybe they'll give you an opportunity to lower it.
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:41:01.420]  But if you have already been living for more than a year and you've already been mandated
[03:41:01.420 --> 03:41:08.080]  to lower your carbon footprint by your appliances, executing your trees and your plants, executing
[03:41:08.080 --> 03:41:14.520]  your pets, eating nothing but bugs, if you still can't make it OK, then you are mandated
[03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:16.360]  to get executed.
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:20.640]  And if you don't comply to any of that, then you you will be first.
[03:41:20.640 --> 03:41:21.640]  You will be first.
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:25.440]  They'll start there and then maybe they'll start with the homeless, maybe they'll start
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:26.440]  with the homeless.
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:30.800]  They'll go to them next because they're just no one's going to, you know, in their mind,
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:32.520]  no one's going to speak for them.
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:36.240]  They could just get executed and no one would ever know about it.
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:40.120]  And then and then maybe they'll get old school and they'll and they'll go to like, you
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:45.440]  know, the maybe maybe like the mentally impaired or the physically impaired, the physically
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:46.800]  disabled.
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:47.800]  They'll go old school.
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:49.040]  I mean, they still are eugenicists.
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:51.440]  They're still psychopaths like Bill Gates.
[03:41:51.440 --> 03:41:56.040]  Maybe they'll go there, you know, they'll go straight up Hitler, like we need to get
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:02.760]  rid of anyone that has a physical disability and a mental disability because it requires
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:08.480]  too much of a carbon lifestyle to keep these people alive.
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:13.520]  You don't say like they can go so many ways with this and they'll just start executing
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:14.520]  everybody.
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:16.800]  And the elites will remain at the top.
[03:42:16.800 --> 03:42:19.400]  The elites will still have their jumbo jets.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:22.880]  The elites will still have their oil reserves.
[03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:30.600]  The elites will still have their fossil fuels, fossil fuel powered Lamborghinis and cars.
[03:42:30.600 --> 03:42:35.880]  They'll still have their homes that are fully operational fossil fuel powered or
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:42.600]  you and I will be living in the streets eating bugs, owning nothing, being happy,
[03:42:42.600 --> 03:42:46.280]  just waiting for our execution.
[03:42:46.280 --> 03:42:48.360]  And if all else fails, there's more.
[03:42:48.680 --> 03:42:51.560]  When we come back, I think it's even deeper.
[03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:53.040]  So don't go anywhere, guys.
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:55.240]  Band out video, band out video, Infowars.com.
[03:42:55.240 --> 03:42:56.240]  Get it out.
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:42:59.600]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:03.280]  really, really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you
[03:43:03.280 --> 03:43:05.160]  love and people want it.
[03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:07.400]  And it funds our operational 360 win.
[03:43:07.400 --> 03:43:11.840]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[03:43:11.840 --> 03:43:17.200]  Jam packed a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation and empowers
[03:43:17.440 --> 03:43:19.320]  your neurological system, you name it.
[03:43:19.320 --> 03:43:21.320]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:24.760]  God gave it to us and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:28.160]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[03:43:28.160 --> 03:43:32.880]  Most brands are 5% human and that still does a great thing for you.
[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:37.800]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:40.360]  I am so glad this is back.
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:42.240]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[03:43:42.240 --> 03:43:45.160]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:51.280]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula back in stock 25% off info war store.com or
[03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:53.880]  triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[03:43:53.900 --> 03:44:01.660]  Hey everybody Rodney Arbron here. I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to
[03:44:01.660 --> 03:44:08.220]  River University. Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do with the

[03:47:37.900 --> 03:47:44.920]  So in the future, this is this is what I predict in the future with the climate cult lockdowns
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:48.380]  and that full roll out the total end game.
[03:47:48.380 --> 03:48:00.020]  There will be there will be Pfizer CDC type World Health Organization suicide assistant
[03:48:00.020 --> 03:48:01.240]  centers.
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:05.680]  Kind of like you can go you know how they had their little they were like always ghost towns
[03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:07.920]  in 2020 and 2021.
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:12.280]  They had like their little vaccine tents, you know, like little drive through tents
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:13.800]  where you can go and get your jab.
[03:48:13.800 --> 03:48:14.840]  It's totally awesome.
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:20.920]  Or you can go and get a covid test so we could stick this gigantic we could stick
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:21.920]  this day.
[03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:25.200]  We could stick this gigantic stick straight up your anus.
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:26.200]  You like that?
[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:28.220]  Oh, let's see if you got covid.
[03:48:28.220 --> 03:48:29.220]  You got covid.
[03:48:29.220 --> 03:48:32.100]  And it's like some pervert, just like, you know, some gay pervert.
[03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:33.100]  Yeah.
[03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:35.100]  Let's see if this guy's got covid.
[03:48:35.100 --> 03:48:36.100]  Yeah.
[03:48:36.100 --> 03:48:37.100]  Covid.
[03:48:37.100 --> 03:48:39.220]  I love this job.
[03:48:39.220 --> 03:48:42.420]  Isn't it crazy?
[03:48:42.420 --> 03:48:46.500]  Like those are the kinds of people that end up in those kind of jobs, like, like,
[03:48:46.500 --> 03:48:49.940]  why would it or how could it be end up there anyways?
[03:48:49.940 --> 03:48:58.460]  But so so like these FEMA camps, they'll have these very similar suicide assistance,
[03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:00.900]  you know, camps or tents or centers.
[03:49:00.900 --> 03:49:04.180]  I mean, they're already doing that in Canada, aren't they?
[03:49:04.180 --> 03:49:09.940]  There are already programs that exist today to assist you in suiciding yourself if you
[03:49:09.940 --> 03:49:13.600]  decide to no longer live anymore.
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:15.580]  But they'll you know what the crazy part is.
[03:49:15.580 --> 03:49:16.940]  They're already rolling that out now.
[03:49:16.940 --> 03:49:19.740]  So there it is, the suicide booth in years.
[03:49:19.740 --> 03:49:21.900]  People can just come and suicide themselves.
[03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:23.100]  It's all it's all right.
[03:49:23.100 --> 03:49:25.660]  I'll tell you guys that this is the future.
[03:49:25.660 --> 03:49:27.380]  It's literally the future.
[03:49:27.380 --> 03:49:33.380]  It'll be suicide booths where you can just walk up, drop in a quarter, you know, or there
[03:49:33.380 --> 03:49:34.380]  won't be quarters.
[03:49:34.380 --> 03:49:36.300]  There won't be quarters in the New World Order.
[03:49:36.300 --> 03:49:42.140]  It'll just be you just you flash your right hand up, you flash your biometrics
[03:49:42.140 --> 03:49:43.500]  or your eye scanner.
[03:49:43.500 --> 03:49:49.520]  You go like that and then your whole life flashes before your eyes and then some kind
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:54.100]  of laser just shoots you straight in between the eyes and you're dead and then you
[03:49:54.100 --> 03:50:00.220]  fall and then a gigantic, you know, hole opens up and it swallows you forever and
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:04.220]  you fall and you get incinerated in the center of the earth and you're never to be heard
[03:50:04.220 --> 03:50:05.220]  from ever again.
[03:50:05.220 --> 03:50:06.980]  So that's how they're going to fight climate change.
[03:50:06.980 --> 03:50:11.100]  But you know, the thing about it is there will be people lining up for this stuff.
[03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:12.100]  There will be lines.
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:17.040]  I'm talking lines, just like when world coin was dropped, OK, just like when the vaccines
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:23.620]  are dropped and just like when the covid tests, you had people lining up in some places
[03:50:24.140 --> 03:50:28.460]  around the world because they were so desperate or just like people were desperate for toilet
[03:50:28.460 --> 03:50:36.220]  paper for toilet paper in 2020, just massive lines out the door, people getting ready
[03:50:36.220 --> 03:50:42.660]  to suicide themselves because they'll be told, well, you know, if you want, it's always
[03:50:42.660 --> 03:50:43.660]  the same thing.
[03:50:43.660 --> 03:50:44.660]  The message won't change.
[03:50:44.660 --> 03:50:45.660]  It won't change.
[03:50:45.660 --> 03:50:46.660]  What do they always say?
[03:50:46.660 --> 03:50:53.060]  Well, this is for the future of our children and your children's children, your grandchildren.
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:50:55.200]  How are they going to have a future?
[03:50:55.200 --> 03:50:56.780]  They're all going to die.
[03:50:56.780 --> 03:51:01.720]  Because if you don't sacrifice yourself, then we have no future for humanity.
[03:51:01.720 --> 03:51:07.020]  If you don't sacrifice yourself and it'll be done in the name of self-sacrifice, some
[03:51:07.020 --> 03:51:09.180]  like because they all have a God complex.
[03:51:09.180 --> 03:51:11.180]  So it'll be like some messianic move.
[03:51:11.180 --> 03:51:12.460]  You know what I mean?
[03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:15.500]  They'll convince everyone that they're all like Jesus Christ.
[03:51:15.500 --> 03:51:20.340]  They'll convince they'll convince everybody that their blood, atonement and sacrifice
[03:51:20.340 --> 03:51:24.940]  I mean, humanity has already experienced this, haven't they?
[03:51:24.940 --> 03:51:30.940]  Like the Aztecs and the Mayans, like just straight mass human sacrifice, just chopping
[03:51:30.940 --> 03:51:38.860]  limbs and slitting throats and blood gushing out and falling heads, tumbling down decapitations,
[03:51:38.860 --> 03:51:46.620]  tumbling down, you know, these pyramid structures, these altars, why would they do that to
[03:51:46.620 --> 03:51:49.940]  appease the gods so they don't get judged by the gods?
[03:51:49.940 --> 03:51:52.140]  Because the god needed enough blood.
[03:51:52.140 --> 03:51:55.940]  So if they have enough blood and atonement that they will be able to survive or gain
[03:51:55.940 --> 03:52:01.700]  access to more information for the future, for humanity to progress, humanity has already
[03:52:01.700 --> 03:52:02.700]  been there.
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:04.900]  What I'm saying is not too far out there.
[03:52:04.900 --> 03:52:06.940]  It's already happened.
[03:52:06.940 --> 03:52:14.940]  It'll just be done with technology and some kind of technological sophistication in the future.
[03:52:14.940 --> 03:52:19.780]  We're not that sophisticated as a society, to be honest, because we are degenerate.
[03:52:19.780 --> 03:52:21.580]  We are totally depraved.
[03:52:21.580 --> 03:52:25.140]  We are living amongst serious reprobation.
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:28.980]  I mean, it is happening all around you.
[03:52:28.980 --> 03:52:32.580]  So I mean, people will be lining up for this and they'll be willfully, it's the same
[03:52:32.580 --> 03:52:33.580]  thing.
[03:52:33.580 --> 03:52:34.580]  It's a cult.
[03:52:34.580 --> 03:52:35.580]  It's a death cult.
[03:52:35.580 --> 03:52:40.220]  People will be lining up and they'll think they have, they all have, I mean, the SJWs
[03:52:40.220 --> 03:52:41.260]  all have a god complex.
[03:52:41.260 --> 03:52:42.580]  They all think they're saving the world.
[03:52:42.580 --> 03:52:46.500]  They all think they're freaking Tony Stark, Black Widow.
[03:52:46.500 --> 03:52:47.500]  You know what I mean?
[03:52:47.500 --> 03:52:52.100]  They all like, it's like, they have like this false image and reflection of themselves.
[03:52:52.100 --> 03:52:59.940]  They're all like warped and they're like 480 pounds overweight, you know, with the
[03:52:59.940 --> 03:53:05.080]  blue and the green hair and they're all disgusting and pale and you know, the women
[03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:06.080]  all look the same.
[03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:07.420]  They like shave their heads.
[03:53:07.420 --> 03:53:10.980]  They try to look like they're seven year old little boys with like the gentleman's
[03:53:10.980 --> 03:53:13.460]  cut and something weird happened.
[03:53:13.460 --> 03:53:15.580]  I don't know what it is with these, with these lesbians.
[03:53:15.620 --> 03:53:19.860]  They get the, they get the haircut and they all try to look like seven year old little
[03:53:19.860 --> 03:53:24.860]  boys and they all like, their necks are like this.
[03:53:24.860 --> 03:53:25.860]  I don't know what, it's like weird.
[03:53:25.860 --> 03:53:26.860]  It's like a costume.
[03:53:26.860 --> 03:53:27.860]  I don't know where it comes from.
[03:53:27.860 --> 03:53:28.860]  It's strange.
[03:53:28.860 --> 03:53:31.980]  It's some weird New World Order thing that's happened.
[03:53:31.980 --> 03:53:38.420]  Maybe it's their diet, but they forsake all feminine qualities and they try to be
[03:53:38.420 --> 03:53:40.420]  men.
[03:53:40.420 --> 03:53:44.380]  But I think what you're going to see is a furtherance of this because they all look
[03:53:44.380 --> 03:53:45.380]  like NPCs.
[03:53:45.380 --> 03:53:47.460]  They like, yeah, the lesbian.
[03:53:47.460 --> 03:53:48.580]  It's weird with these lesbians.
[03:53:48.580 --> 03:53:51.980]  I don't know if you guys have, I mean, it's the famous meme, the NPC.
[03:53:51.980 --> 03:53:52.980]  They all look like that.
[03:53:52.980 --> 03:53:53.980]  It's really weird.
[03:53:53.980 --> 03:53:56.780]  I don't know what it is, but you know, in this future you're going to see it.
[03:53:56.780 --> 03:54:00.420]  It's totally dystopian, but people will have a Messiah complex.
[03:54:00.420 --> 03:54:02.420]  They all think they're going to save the world.
[03:54:02.420 --> 03:54:07.620]  They're all disgusting and they think they look in the mirror and they see Tony star.
[03:54:07.620 --> 03:54:21.460]  They think, you know, like 480 pounds, like Bill Gates, I love Bill Gates, Bill Gates.
[03:54:21.460 --> 03:54:25.140]  You're a cis white male, you know, like these people and the women are all gross
[03:54:25.140 --> 03:54:30.260]  and overweight and disgusting and slobs just want to murder their children.
[03:54:30.260 --> 03:54:34.340]  They think they look in the mirror and they see Black Widow.
[03:54:34.340 --> 03:54:39.300]  They think they look in the mirror and they see like some hot NCU chick and that's how
[03:54:39.300 --> 03:54:44.780]  they view themselves that way because they view that they have this Messiah complex.
[03:54:44.780 --> 03:54:50.300]  So they'll all be lining up, willingness, maybe that's not such a bad idea, you know,
[03:54:50.300 --> 03:54:51.300]  I don't know.
[03:54:51.300 --> 03:54:55.140]  I'm just, these people, I mean, they need to be saved.
[03:54:55.140 --> 03:55:00.220]  They need to be saved so they can go to heaven, but you know, these, these will be
[03:55:00.220 --> 03:55:05.460]  the ones that willfully, you know, it's like useful idiot taken to a whole new level.
[03:55:05.460 --> 03:55:09.340]  You know, it's like Hitler Youth taken to a whole new level where these people will
[03:55:09.340 --> 03:55:14.900]  be willing to self sacrifice, not, not, not, not in like not running into war,
[03:55:14.900 --> 03:55:16.660]  convinced that they're fighting an enemy.
[03:55:16.660 --> 03:55:17.660]  You know what I mean?
[03:55:17.660 --> 03:55:20.620]  They'll just be convinced that the end of the world is imminent and you will be the
[03:55:20.620 --> 03:55:26.540]  reason why that tsunami comes and obliterates, obliterates your grandkids.
[03:55:26.540 --> 03:55:31.620]  You will be the reason why these mass temperatures are going to incinerate humanity and your
[03:55:31.620 --> 03:55:34.500]  children and their children's children will not have a shot.
[03:55:34.500 --> 03:55:42.380]  So if you do not, if you do not come and you do not allow us to assist your suicide,
[03:55:42.380 --> 03:55:44.420]  then we're going to kill you anyway.
[03:55:44.420 --> 03:55:47.620]  So no matter what, just, just let us do it.
[03:55:47.620 --> 03:55:48.620]  It'll be all nice.
[03:55:48.620 --> 03:55:49.620]  It'll be all gravy.
[03:55:49.620 --> 03:55:55.580]  It'll be all, it's kind of similar with what's happening today, right?
[03:55:55.620 --> 03:56:01.540]  Like the feds, how they go after patriots, they surveil them.
[03:56:01.540 --> 03:56:05.380]  They monitor them, violate their civil rights.
[03:56:05.380 --> 03:56:06.380]  You know what I mean?
[03:56:06.380 --> 03:56:12.060]  But it's it's like it's done in the name of, well, we're doing this civilly.
[03:56:12.060 --> 03:56:13.540]  We're doing this cordially.
[03:56:13.540 --> 03:56:17.900]  We're just we're violating your rights peacefully.
[03:56:17.900 --> 03:56:20.840]  We're just peacefully violating your civil rights.
[03:56:20.840 --> 03:56:24.820]  So because we're doing it peacefully, it's acceptable.
[03:56:24.820 --> 03:56:29.740]  Because if we were to violate your rights aggressively and violently, well, then maybe
[03:56:29.740 --> 03:56:31.980]  you kind of got a case against us.
[03:56:31.980 --> 03:56:35.100]  But we're going to violate your rights with a smile on.
[03:56:35.100 --> 03:56:36.100]  So it's better.
[03:56:36.100 --> 03:56:37.100]  OK.
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:38.100]  All right.
[03:56:38.100 --> 03:56:43.580]  So we could either do it the hard way and we'll just kill you in the climate change
[03:56:43.580 --> 03:56:44.680]  cult lockdown.
[03:56:44.680 --> 03:56:48.200]  We could do it the hard way because we want to survive.
[03:56:48.200 --> 03:56:50.220]  And you are no longer one of us.
[03:56:50.220 --> 03:56:54.540]  And if you want to be one of us, then you will take yourself out.
[03:56:54.540 --> 03:57:00.180]  Or you can do this the easy way and you can go right into that booth over there.
[03:57:00.180 --> 03:57:02.380]  Just put your eyeballs in the scanner.
[03:57:02.380 --> 03:57:05.900]  The scanner will identify you and there'll be a laser that pops out.
[03:57:05.900 --> 03:57:10.140]  But don't mind that you won't even remember what's going to happen because you've done
[03:57:10.140 --> 03:57:14.420]  your job as a good citizen of the New World Order and you've allowed yourself to be
[03:57:14.420 --> 03:57:15.420]  taken out.
