[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  It's happened, the Zika virus is now beginning to infect many areas of the entire planet
[00:07.280 --> 00:11.600]  via the globalist tool known as the Rio Olympics.
[00:11.600 --> 00:13.160]  That's all coming up in a special report.
[00:13.160 --> 00:16.600]  And then Donald Trump has responded to the false claim he's dropping out.
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.960]  We're going to be breaking that down on the other side of the break and a lot more on
[00:20.960 --> 00:26.040]  this Friday, August 5th, 2016, Global Transmission.
[00:26.040 --> 00:29.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host and infoawards.com.
[00:29.240 --> 00:34.480]  He is undoubtedly the very front line when it comes to fighting for human liberty worldwide.
[00:34.480 --> 00:40.720]  Just four days to go before the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics, an Olympics that
[00:40.720 --> 00:45.200]  is already appearing to be a perfect storm for a major terrorist event.
[00:45.200 --> 00:51.760]  On Sunday evening, a robot was sent into the Maracana Stadium to detect a suspicious toolbox.
[00:51.760 --> 00:54.760]  An explosion was heard soon after the robot went in.
[00:54.760 --> 00:56.400]  No injuries were reported.
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.000]  The Maracana Stadium will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympic
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  Games.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.160]  Was this a test?
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.880]  Why did a toolbox have an explosive in it four days before the opening ceremonies?
[01:08.880 --> 01:12.480]  The globalist's fingerprints are all over the entire debacle.
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.040]  The International Atomic Energy Agency provided high-tech radiation monitors in order to detect
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.200]  a dirty bomb, while the United Nations claims ISIS has a high probability of dropping a
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.480]  dirty bomb on the Olympics due to the weak security.
[01:26.480 --> 01:31.080]  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization downplayed the threat of the Zika virus in order to bring
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.840]  more unsuspecting Olympians and foreigners to the potential hell pit.
[01:35.840 --> 01:41.720]  Sydney Levy, CEO of the Rio 2016 Committee, has been on a media blitz, reassuring the
[01:41.720 --> 01:46.200]  world that there is no threat of the Zika virus that is exploding in Rio.
[01:46.200 --> 01:47.920]  The winter just started in Rio.
[01:47.920 --> 01:50.360]  It was a proved fact.
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.640]  Every year we measure that, and the winter masters no muskets whatsoever.
[01:55.640 --> 02:01.200]  However, Dr. Amir Adaran, writing for the Harvard Public Health Review, says otherwise.
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.400]  Dr. Adaran wrote, Brazil's Zika problem is inconveniently not ending.
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.120]  The outbreak that began in the countries northeast has reached Rio de Janeiro where
[02:11.120 --> 02:12.640]  it is flourishing.
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.800]  Clinical studies are also mounting that Zika infection is associated not just with the
[02:16.800 --> 02:22.640]  pediatric, microcephaly and brain damage, but also adult conditions such as Guillain-Barre
[02:22.640 --> 02:29.720]  syndrome and acute disseminated encephaloamyelitis, which are debilitating and sometimes fatal.
[02:29.720 --> 02:35.160]  Simply put, Zika infection is more dangerous, and Brazil's outbreak more extensive than
[02:35.160 --> 02:39.440]  scientists reckoned a short time ago, which leads to a bitter truth.
[02:39.440 --> 02:46.280]  The 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved or both, as a precautionary
[02:46.280 --> 02:47.280]  concession.
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.240]  Dr. Adaran goes on to mention five reasons the Games must be postponed.
[02:52.240 --> 02:59.520]  First, Rio de Janeiro's suspected Zika cases are the highest of any state in Brazil, 26,000,
[02:59.520 --> 03:05.560]  and its Zika incidence rate is the fourth worst, 157 per 100,000.
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.840]  And contrary to Mr. Levy, Rio has never experienced a winter with Zika before.
[03:10.840 --> 03:17.160]  In Rio de Janeiro, dengue cases in the first quarter of 2016 are a shocking six-fold higher
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.440]  than a year ago.
[03:18.440 --> 03:23.000]  With the startling baseline of Adas-born disease so much higher this year than last,
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.040]  it is far from guaranteed that the coming winter's ebb will make a safe environment for the Games.
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.320]  Second, although Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, the viral strain that
[03:34.320 --> 03:40.360]  recently entered Brazil is clearly new, different and vastly more dangerous than old Zika.
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.720]  Third, while Brazil's Zika inevitably will spread globally given enough time, viruses
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.880]  always do, it helps nobody to speed that up.
[03:48.880 --> 03:55.000]  In particular, it cannot possibly help when an estimated 500,000 foreign tourists flock
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.960]  into Rio for the Games, potentially becoming infected and returning to their homes where
[03:59.960 --> 04:06.000]  both local Adas mosquitoes and sexual transmission can establish new outbreaks.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.080]  Fourth, when, not if, the Games speed up Zika's spread, the already urgent job of inventing
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.120]  new technologies to stop it becomes harder.
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.000]  By spreading the virus faster and farther, the Games steal away the very thing, time,
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.480]  that scientists and public health professionals need to build such defenses.
[04:25.480 --> 04:29.600]  Fifth, proceeding with the Games violates what the Olympic stands for.
[04:29.600 --> 04:31.800]  The International Olympic Committee writes that,
[04:31.800 --> 04:38.040]  Olympism seeks to create social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical
[04:38.040 --> 04:39.040]  principles.
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.680]  But how socially responsible or ethical is it to spread disease?
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.840]  The globalists behind this are willing to create a worldwide epidemic as an act of controlled
[04:48.840 --> 04:55.040]  folly that will begin incubating in just four days on your local idiot box.
[04:55.040 --> 05:06.800]  An article up at the Washington Post, wearing, don't tread on me, insignia could be punishable,
[05:06.800 --> 05:12.120]  racial harassment, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as F-A-G, among its
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.640]  other functions decides hostile work environment, harassment claims brought against federal
[05:16.640 --> 05:17.640]  agencies.
[05:17.640 --> 05:23.000]  On January 8, 2014, a complaint filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.320]  on the basis of race in the fall of 2013, a co-worker repeatedly war-capped to work
[05:29.320 --> 05:34.680]  with insignia of the Gadsden flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the face, don't tread
[05:34.680 --> 05:35.680]  on me.
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.880]  Complainting stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans
[05:39.880 --> 05:45.160]  because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.520]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden flag originated
[05:48.520 --> 05:52.480]  in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context.
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.480]  Boom!
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.480]  Facts!
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.480]  Boom!
[05:55.480 --> 05:56.480]  Liberals down!
[05:56.480 --> 06:00.320]  This has been Joe Biggs, serving you some information at Infowars.com.
[06:00.320 --> 06:01.320]  Enjoy!
[06:01.320 --> 06:23.280]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[06:23.280 --> 06:31.280]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[06:31.280 --> 06:47.040]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[06:47.040 --> 06:52.480]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[06:52.480 --> 06:54.240]  quality lab standard.
[06:54.240 --> 06:56.760]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[06:56.760 --> 06:59.760]  At Infowars.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[06:59.760 --> 07:02.080]  Thank you for your attention now before we sell out.
[07:02.080 --> 07:04.080]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.080]  Try a bottle of it.
[07:05.080 --> 07:06.920]  Rob Doe joins us.
[07:06.920 --> 07:09.440]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.920]  Tell us what brainforce did.
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.920]  I had been working all day.
[07:11.920 --> 07:14.320]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[07:14.320 --> 07:16.320]  I get in here at 8.30.
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.760]  I was kind of run down.
[07:17.760 --> 07:19.760]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[07:19.760 --> 07:21.480]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[07:21.480 --> 07:23.360]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there.
[07:23.360 --> 07:27.320]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind
[07:27.320 --> 07:28.320]  of clears up.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.360]  It's got four and a half stars.
[07:30.360 --> 07:31.600]  People really love it.
[07:31.600 --> 07:32.600]  Read about it.
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.640]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really
[07:36.640 --> 07:41.280]  does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[07:41.280 --> 07:44.280]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.280]  it without brainforce.
[07:45.280 --> 07:47.280]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[07:47.280 --> 07:51.600]  I took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in.
[07:51.600 --> 07:57.600]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-248-5255.
[07:57.600 --> 07:59.600]  Read 888-253-3139.
[08:27.600 --> 08:41.440]  My friends, we are live on this Friday, the fifth day of August, 2016, worldwide transmission.
[08:41.440 --> 08:51.520]  We got three months and change, 90-something days from the 2016 major general election.
[08:51.520 --> 08:53.200]  And so much stands in the balance.
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.760]  We're talking about upwards of three, four, maybe even five Supreme Court justices.
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.880]  We're talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership that the bipartisan Republicans and Democrats
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.480]  say they're going to foist upon us, even though we're not allowed to read it, and so much
[09:07.480 --> 09:08.480]  more.
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.840]  Obama has been acting outside of law, opening up our borders.
[09:12.840 --> 09:16.560]  Hillary admits she's coming after our guns.
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.200]  She's also come out in a new speech and said she does plan to raise taxes on the middle
[09:21.200 --> 09:23.520]  class.
[09:23.520 --> 09:24.520]  It's incredible.
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.720]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[09:28.720 --> 09:34.120]  And then we've got Khan going on international Islamic television saying, Allah is tripping
[09:34.120 --> 09:36.160]  up Mr. Trump.
[09:36.160 --> 09:44.760]  Well, only if Allah is really the devil, because the establishment globalist system that is
[09:44.760 --> 09:52.760]  in the news today legalizing human animal splices in the U.S. has started going on.
[09:52.760 --> 09:56.960]  The very groups shelling baby parts, they're the ones that don't like Mr. Trump.
[09:56.960 --> 10:04.280]  So how could any supposed Muslim claim that they're following God's commandments, the
[10:04.280 --> 10:05.280]  Ten Commandments?
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.880]  I know Muslims say they follow that and support all this.
[10:09.880 --> 10:17.580]  Noah's daughter has been videotaped and photographed twerking, shaking her butt in a sexually
[10:17.580 --> 10:26.120]  suggestive way, simulating the act of sex.
[10:26.120 --> 10:31.000]  And he's come out and said, listen, women aren't supposed to be all reserved.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.800]  They shouldn't have to be demure.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.320]  Let women be open and free and libertine, laissez-faire.
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.000]  Well, I say women have the right to do what they want as long as they don't hurt anybody.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.360]  I agree with Obama.
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.200]  The problem is, is that he promotes the most hardcore forms of Islamic Sharia law that the
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.320]  Wahhabi has pushed and gets massive amounts of money from them.
[10:50.320 --> 10:57.360]  That's what's so hypocritical about all this and throwing thousands of homosexuals off
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.520]  roofs just in the liberation of Egypt that our media promoted as a wonderful thing.
[11:02.520 --> 11:08.000]  The Muslim Brotherhood liberating it from the freedoms it had previously.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.080]  Very, very serious situation.
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.320]  Homeland Security's announcing domestic spy drones.
[11:12.320 --> 11:14.040]  They've always been doing it the last decade.
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.280]  The media would say we were conspiracy theorist, but that's being announced today.
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.240]  That's some of the headlines up on drudgerport.com, some of the stories up on infowars.com.
[11:23.240 --> 11:29.160]  Harry Reid wants CIA to give Trump fake intelligence briefings, but kind of like, you give the
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.640]  American people, because Trump can't be trusted.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.720]  He's not a globalist selling the country out.
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.120]  These globalists that have sold us out to the Communist Chinese, Reid's even worse than
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.800]  Hillary, they're the custodians of the country.
[11:42.800 --> 11:44.440]  They can be trusted.
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.440]  They're the good people.
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.280]  But let me get to the main issue.
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.280]  And I shot a special report that's going to be up the next hour at infowars.com right
[11:52.280 --> 11:54.480]  before I went live on air today.
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.000]  And that's the fact that there is a giant hoax that's been going for 48 hours, that
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.320]  Donald Trump is going to drop out of the race, that there's been an intervention by the Republican
[12:04.320 --> 12:11.560]  party and by a rents previous and everybody else meeting with Trump and that they're trying
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.800]  to get him to step down.
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.240]  Now, it's the Republican Party and Democratic Party at the highest levels putting this out.
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.640]  Then the Republicans come out and say he is the nominee.
[12:19.640 --> 12:22.440]  He will be the nominee to act like they're not part of it.
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.840]  They couldn't steal the nomination from the American people like they did Sanders on the
[12:26.840 --> 12:27.920]  Democratic side.
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.160]  So they're trying to create the illusion that he's not in the race.
[12:31.160 --> 12:32.440]  Where did I hear that before?
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.040]  Ben Carson again, 5.30, 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the heavy voting starting.
[12:38.040 --> 12:43.920]  He's in second place in voting, feels good, gets on a plane to go to the next state.
[12:43.920 --> 12:47.440]  While he's in the air for two and a half hours, who was he flying, it was Florida.
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.200]  While he's in the air for two and a half hours, they announced, oh, we talked to him.
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.680]  He did step down and he said he, you know, endorses Cruz, the tweets were saying and
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.320]  oh, that a bunch of people flipped for Cruz and Cruz got second place.
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.000]  Cruz later had to admit that his campaign head did indeed do that and he had to step
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  down.
[13:08.000 --> 13:15.440]  Now, fast forward to June 18th of this year, Politico, the New York Times, they all ran
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.880]  with it as a beta test and they all announced in different news articles, Trump is stepping
[13:21.880 --> 13:22.880]  down.
[13:22.880 --> 13:25.920]  Trump is dropping out due to not being able to raise money.
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.120]  He only raised 60 million so far in the months before.
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.640]  And then you read deeper in the articles, they had to get a response from Trump.
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.080]  He says, this story's total fabrication from you and Politico as usual.
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.980]  The New York billionaires sent an email sent by his campaign manager, I will never leave
[13:41.980 --> 13:45.600]  the race, nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[13:45.600 --> 13:51.280]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal anyway, did Obama and the Clintons get you
[13:51.280 --> 13:52.560]  to write this garbage?
[13:52.560 --> 13:59.080]  Now what's funny is, this was the 16th, a little less than a month later, in fact, almost
[13:59.080 --> 14:05.200]  a month later the day, the Hillary emails come out on the eve of the RNC on the 15th,
[14:05.200 --> 14:14.200]  a month after this, 29 days after this, and it's her directing Politico Associated Press,
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.720]  ABC, NBC, MSNBC, on what to say and what to do and how to attack Trump and how to attack
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.720]  Sanders and how to send their people dressed like Sanders supporters to attack Trump people
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.920]  so those two sides would fight with each other, positioning herself in the general election
[14:29.920 --> 14:35.320]  to inoculate psychologically Sanders supporters to hate Trump people, which is not happening.
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.640]  In mass they're going to Trump, he was 10 points ahead in major polls that were skewed,
[14:40.640 --> 14:47.040]  probably 15, 20 points ahead, so now they start sampling 15% more Democrats in all the
[14:47.040 --> 14:53.520]  major polls are now doing this, Reuters and others led the way to then give her a lead.
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.880]  I mean, wow, now to create the perception those polls are real, they announced he's
[14:57.880 --> 15:04.400]  sliding, losing support, they have a big string of Rhino Republicans and neocons, all the
[15:04.400 --> 15:12.440]  usual suspects, the Rockefeller Republicans from John McCain to Crystal, just everybody,
[15:12.440 --> 15:14.880]  coming out against Trump.
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.680]  They have Gennrich come out and say, oh yeah, there is interventions, he is in trouble,
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.160]  the trusted little buddy who you notice Trump didn't pick as his VP, even though he's offered
[15:24.160 --> 15:30.880]  300 million by Adelson, the casino owner at the end and that's been confirmed.
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.760]  So now they're running the Cheyenne hoax and Trump came out Wednesday night a few hours
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.080]  into this and said, we've never been more unified, everything's great, he didn't want
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.480]  to add fuel to it, he didn't want to give it power and say, of course I'm not dropping
[15:43.480 --> 15:44.480]  out.
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.680]  Well, now he needs to.
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.320]  And that's what I've said, on air and off air.
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.600]  I know some of his advisors are like, oh, that makes us look weak, look, they're putting
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  that out everywhere.
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.840]  You have to say, how dare you come out and claim I'm dropping out when in many polls
[16:02.840 --> 16:06.600]  and in swing states, I'm 10 points ahead like Florida.
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.720]  How dare you with these fake Reuters polls and other sample, 15% more Democrats to skew
[16:11.720 --> 16:15.840]  it and give her a 10 point lead when I really have a five point, even though skewed polls.
[16:15.840 --> 16:19.800]  And how dare you do what you did to Ben Carson and come out and announce I'm dropping out
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.320]  to create the illusion that all you've got Hillary.
[16:24.320 --> 16:28.680]  How dare you, I want an apology from all these different mainstream media outlets and the
[16:28.680 --> 16:31.840]  Democrat Republican Party pulling this latest scam.
[16:31.840 --> 16:35.080]  No wonder I think you're going to try to rig the general election.
[16:35.080 --> 16:42.560]  You tried to rig the primary against me says that they're in deep trouble.
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.760]  Now some thinking is let them run this hoax, let them get even more extreme and claim that
[16:47.760 --> 16:53.200]  his wife's a prostitute and he's a racist and he's dropping out and he's bankrupt and
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.000]  all the rest of this and he's a Russian spy and just let it percolate then have Trump
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.400]  still standing there and come out later and talk about it.
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.480]  And again, there's some thinking that this is the establishment destroying itself right
[17:04.480 --> 17:06.880]  now and that there's going to be a backlash to it.
[17:06.880 --> 17:11.560]  And I tend to think that that is the case, but still I would counter it right up front,
[17:11.560 --> 17:17.240]  not wait for it to basically percolate because it's meant and here's the key.
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.880]  He raised $60 million, spent another 60 something of his own, that's 120 plus million up until
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.080]  last month after that RNC event and that incredible speech and his incredible family
[17:28.080 --> 17:29.280]  and the other speakers.
[17:29.280 --> 17:38.200]  He raised $97 million in the last three weeks and they went into complete panic mode because
[17:38.200 --> 17:45.600]  he'd be able to raise billions in the next seven, eight weeks.
[17:45.600 --> 17:48.040]  He's proven that he can go outside the system and do it.
[17:48.040 --> 17:49.040]  He's incredible.
[17:49.040 --> 17:50.040]  What a maverick.
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.560]  And so that's why they are in a conniption fit deception mode right now.
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.760]  So people keep saying, where's Donald Trump's statement?
[17:57.760 --> 18:02.520]  When they first floated it, believe me, Politico is the heart of the system now with this info.
[18:02.520 --> 18:08.320]  When they first floated this, he said, this story is a total fabrication from you and
[18:08.320 --> 18:09.520]  Politico as usual.
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.200]  The Newark billionaire sent an email sent by the campaign manager, I will never leave
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.600]  the race, nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[18:16.600 --> 18:18.880]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal.
[18:18.880 --> 18:21.480]  Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.440]  And of course we got the emails one month later on the eve of the RNC that indeed this
[18:27.440 --> 18:29.640]  was the case.
[18:29.640 --> 18:36.240]  So there is Trump's response back to the future and they're going to continue to push this,
[18:36.240 --> 18:38.400]  they're going to continue to put out outrageous stuff.
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.480]  Remember they put out that he raped a 16-year-old girl in Houston and it was all a made up name
[18:43.480 --> 18:44.680]  and a made up person?
[18:44.680 --> 18:46.720]  We told you here first, it was made up.
[18:46.720 --> 18:50.280]  Two days before the media had to put in the back of the paper, okay, that was a fake name,
[18:50.280 --> 18:52.040]  a fake lawsuit.
[18:52.040 --> 18:57.160]  I could go down and file a fake lawsuit pro se at the Travis County Courthouse in Austin,
[18:57.160 --> 19:03.960]  Texas by Easter Bunny Jones and claim that Donald Trump raped me while writing a purple
[19:03.960 --> 19:04.960]  rhinoceros.
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.240]  Now, it's totally not true, but it doesn't matter, the mainstream media would probably
[19:10.240 --> 19:12.200]  go with it if I made it sound more realistic.
[19:12.200 --> 19:17.840]  And I said my name was say, you know, Will Smith.
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.280]  And you know, Donald Trump did something to me, they would run with it because this is
[19:21.280 --> 19:22.280]  what they're doing.
[19:22.280 --> 19:23.840]  And I've never seen anything like it.
[19:23.840 --> 19:24.840]  It's incredible.
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.040]  And it shows how desperate these globalist criminals are that have hijacked their nation
[19:29.040 --> 19:30.040]  that they're doing this.
[19:30.040 --> 19:37.520]  This is a real return, remember about a week and a half ago, I got up here on air, it was
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.760]  less than that, it was Saturday, and I put out the emergency message to Trump about
[19:41.760 --> 19:44.360]  how they tried to steal it from him, but he had a landslide so they couldn't stop him.
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.120]  They did steal it from Sanders, and now they got all these illegals voting, and how they're
[19:48.120 --> 19:49.840]  allowing him to register to vote.
[19:49.840 --> 19:53.400]  And he needs to make a big issue out of that, and of course he did, because he already
[19:53.400 --> 19:55.080]  sees what I see.
[19:55.080 --> 19:59.240]  And they had a conniption fed over that, but let me tell you, he knows what he's doing,
[19:59.240 --> 20:01.240]  we'll talk about it when we come back.
[20:29.240 --> 20:36.240]  We'll talk about it when we come back, and we'll talk about it when we come back.
[20:59.240 --> 21:06.720]  Man, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality

[23:11.120 --> 23:13.920]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pigments and antidepressants.

[24:22.640 --> 24:32.280]  All right, we are obviously going to be putting out more special reports documenting the fact
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.200]  that there has been organized crime against this country.
[24:36.200 --> 24:41.280]  There are federal and state election laws that say one person, one vote, there's the
[24:41.280 --> 24:46.640]  Civil Rights Act and so many other serious laws in play that it is on average a very
[24:46.640 --> 24:53.880]  serious felony to steal someone's vote or imply their voting but then to misdirect them
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.080]  or to not accept that vote.
[24:58.080 --> 25:00.800]  And I don't need the constitutional lawyers to know that but we're actually going to be
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.080]  interviewing them and putting reports together and showing this to everybody.
[25:06.080 --> 25:14.720]  Delegates on horseback used to be pledged then they would ride in and they would vote
[25:14.720 --> 25:19.360]  for who they had pledged.
[25:19.360 --> 25:21.720]  That's the way this system works.
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.680]  In a modern sense they have changed the rules to claim that they can disregard the popular
[25:26.680 --> 25:32.300]  vote but that wasn't until 1972 for the Democrats, 1976 for the Republicans and I know for an
[25:32.300 --> 25:36.720]  audience you already know this, I know I've hammered this but the general public still
[25:36.720 --> 25:44.680]  doesn't understand this and they still don't understand what happened in 10 major states
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.320]  that he won by landslides.
[25:48.320 --> 25:52.160]  In other states they were engaged in election fraud against Sanders and stole it from him
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.120]  as well because you'd have exit polls showing 10, 15 percent more for Sanders but Hillary
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.200]  still won.
[26:00.200 --> 26:01.880]  That's unprecedented.
[26:01.880 --> 26:07.160]  How Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination on a day nobody voted and then Zero Hedge
[26:07.160 --> 26:13.120]  links to the Associated Press, The New York Daily News and others where they met the night
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.120]  before at the rich donor's house with the AP and others and then they decided how she
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.880]  would win and what numbers to put out the next day and some decided to be burning people
[26:23.880 --> 26:30.440]  so you know there'd be percentages isn't that cute like a little tea party, musical chairs.
[26:30.440 --> 26:36.560]  So Obama comes out, in fact I'm going to play that clip first in a press conference yesterday
[26:36.560 --> 26:42.000]  and says you know what Trump's wrong that we have rigged elections that's funny that
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.560]  doesn't happen that's a conspiracy theory.
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.240]  Local governments and local media and local communities because he knows full well how
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.920]  it works it was called voter news services till the mid 90s over lawsuits it was owned
[26:53.920 --> 27:02.680]  by the Associated Press which itself has been controlled by the CIA since the 40s late 40s
[27:02.680 --> 27:07.080]  and they will take the different conglomerates and then they will announce who wins and they've
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.280]  been caught stealing elections over and over and over again in key swing states.
[27:13.280 --> 27:21.520]  Remember 1996 what happened in Arizona the exit polls all showed Buchanan with massive
[27:21.520 --> 27:29.480]  triple digit and by triple digit I mean not 10 not 20 but 30 plus percentage points.
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.560]  So this is what we're dealing with and I have been sitting here watching it for 25 years
[27:34.560 --> 27:38.920]  from the grassroots level 25 years ago I was at the election center downtown in Austin
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.320]  Texas watching election fraud experiencing it with my own eyeballs with Pat Buchanan
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.080]  getting 70 80% of the vote the Republican primary and on the nightly news he didn't
[27:49.080 --> 27:56.880]  even get 10% remember staying up till till till till midnight and there it was Buchanan
[27:56.880 --> 28:02.040]  with nothing and I was there at the main center looking at getting the sheets ready getting
[28:02.040 --> 28:06.160]  them all stacked up to go on the computer Pat Buchanan bubbled in at the top Pat Buchanan
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.000]  bubbled in you couldn't find people other than Pat Buchanan hardly and I talked to
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.880]  everybody else you see a Pat Buchanan they're like yeah you stick it in the computer it
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.480]  goes on a computer tape by the time it came out it was something else and then he wants
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.400]  to get up here and act like this is crazy this is bizarre this is weird here is the
[28:23.400 --> 28:28.840]  president being forced to respond see this is how Trump is changing the narrative and
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.960]  how info wars is changing the narrative we're not just gonna lie down Obama of course the
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.760]  elections will not be raked what does that mean of course Obama cares free the federal
[28:39.760 --> 28:46.680]  government doesn't run the election process that's right AP does states and cities and
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.200]  communities all across the country they're the ones who set up the voting systems and
[28:52.200 --> 28:58.640]  the voting don't even give a name now if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy
[28:58.640 --> 29:14.360]  theory that is being propagated across the country including in places like Texas where
[29:14.360 --> 29:21.120]  typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths that's ridiculous that doesn't
[29:21.120 --> 29:31.440]  make any sense they do not like the Texan do they wonder who that's a message to oh boy
[29:31.440 --> 29:38.200]  here's another one why the AP called it for Clinton Politico the night before oh but there's
[29:38.200 --> 29:43.680]  no election fraud Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination AP we don't need
[29:43.680 --> 29:51.800]  the votes today before the AP announces the winner okay that's how it works we're on the
[29:51.800 --> 30:03.840]  March the Empire's on the notice now the president has respond info wars yesterday Dakota Meyer
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.560]  a US Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient decided to open his mouth and tweak
[30:08.560 --> 30:13.040]  this out if real Donald Trump wants to be commander-in-chief he needs to act like one
[30:13.040 --> 30:17.960]  and that can't start until he apologizes to the cons and we all know that the cons are
[30:17.960 --> 30:24.560]  a con job the support the fact that his son captain con voluntarily joined the military
[30:24.560 --> 30:29.840]  and fought radical Islamic terrorism and died the same kind of people that mr. con wants
[30:29.840 --> 30:35.040]  to bring into this country what do you stand for Dakota Meyer I do respect the things you've
[30:35.040 --> 30:40.000]  done but this this tweet is ridiculous and the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using
[30:40.000 --> 30:46.280]  it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald Trump is completely and totally disgusting
[30:46.280 --> 30:51.120]  all of the military is watching this right now our eyes are open what are you gonna do
[30:51.120 --> 30:54.960]  are you gonna do the right thing and take that down are you gonna sit there and actually
[30:54.960 --> 31:00.680]  help out the most corrupt person ever Hillary for prison Joe Biggs info wars dot com and
[31:00.680 --> 31:05.920]  I'm pissed off if you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting
[31:05.920 --> 31:10.200]  for an outrageously low price you are not going to want to miss this important message

[34:18.240 --> 34:25.760]  to fall humanity is destined with god's good graces to rise we must take that destiny and
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.640]  birthright in our hands now let's go back to this clip in case you missed it from a press
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.400]  conference with obama and of course it came out six years ago that i'm on the white house
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.400]  enemies list with matt rudge and i have gotten to experience being on the enemies list and
[34:43.400 --> 34:46.760]  i can tell you from being at the rnc and other events the globalists that were there like
[34:46.760 --> 34:50.840]  charlie rose and others are scared of us and not scared of us because they think we're
[34:50.840 --> 34:53.520]  going to punch them on the nose scared of us because they know we're aware of their
[34:53.520 --> 35:02.920]  operations and so here's the good news we have info wars last saturday i put out a
[35:02.920 --> 35:07.720]  special report my emergency measures donald trump about election fraud challenging him to go public
[35:07.720 --> 35:12.840]  and expose election fraud monday he started doing it word for word i'm gonna stop right there and
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.160]  not because he's getting his ideas from me but he concurs with my analysis
[35:20.120 --> 35:26.680]  and so do his other supporters it's just common sense now expanding
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.880]  expanding uh on that
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.880]  now obama is being asked about it in press conferences and is having to make a joke about
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.360]  it so we're elevating the awareness the consciousness of election fraud when i'm going to read to you
[35:44.360 --> 35:48.920]  from the associated press how hillary clinton clenched the nomination on the day nobody voted
[35:48.920 --> 35:57.080]  political why the ap called it for clinton ap clinton has delegates to win democratic
[35:57.080 --> 36:04.840]  nomination hillary and the super delegates met the night before at a rich patrons home
[36:06.440 --> 36:13.320]  a super PAC home and they decided that they were going to go for hillary before they even
[36:13.320 --> 36:18.280]  had the election the next day and then magically they had already apportioned the delegates that
[36:18.280 --> 36:21.400]  were going to go for burning and those that go for hillary so the public would think they were
[36:21.400 --> 36:26.760]  still actually voting and in case anybody thought they were going to get uppity and actually have
[36:26.760 --> 36:30.280]  the delegates and super delegates go with the popular vote they had to have a meeting the night
[36:30.280 --> 36:36.920]  before to explain it see they have to normalize it and act like it's no big deal it's a psychological
[36:36.920 --> 36:43.480]  warfare technique here's a new york daily news article super delegates will decide who wins
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.800]  the democratic nomination so i want to remind folks that when obama is running around acting
[36:49.800 --> 36:56.040]  like this is kooky to say don't try to steal the general election they certified that in
[36:57.240 --> 37:03.480]  the 2008 election in ohio and other states there was total complete fraud at the top
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.560]  but let's go back to what trump said a month before the emails got released that hillary
[37:09.560 --> 37:16.200]  is basically running politico the associated press abc news msnbc seeing in all of them telling them
[37:16.200 --> 37:22.120]  what to do that's already been known because they brag they give them the questions beforehand and
[37:22.120 --> 37:26.120]  are given what to say but but now we have the emails with them directing it and telling them
[37:26.120 --> 37:32.600]  what to do and so they had this headline would would donald trump really dropped out for 150
[37:32.600 --> 37:38.920]  million remember they put that hoax out and then the new york times and politico and others ask oh
[37:38.920 --> 37:44.040]  and then they have former insiders saying oh of course he would that's why he's lost hundreds of
[37:44.040 --> 37:49.320]  millions in businesses and lost revenue and boycotts and losing two different tv shows and everything
[37:49.320 --> 37:56.760]  else that that made hundreds of millions of dollars because he's a principled man that spent
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.720]  60 something million of his own money no they're putting all this out now because he raised 97
[38:01.720 --> 38:07.400]  million dollars in three weeks they are totally flipping out more than he raised in a year and a
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.320]  half before that in three weeks but let's hear what he had to say this story is a total fabrication
[38:14.200 --> 38:21.960]  from you and politico as usual i will never leave the race nobody has enough money to pay me to
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.000]  leave the race and if they did it would be totally illegal anyway did obama and the clinton's
[38:28.520 --> 38:33.960]  get you to write this garbage we should do a story just how trump was right in all these emails he
[38:33.960 --> 38:36.760]  would send a media saying did the clinton's tell you to write this about the clinton's told you
[38:36.760 --> 38:43.480]  to write this because it turns out they did and now the sanders people have had their elections
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.880]  stolen from them and we're here beating the drums saying we're going to point this out to them so
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.000]  they landslide crossover and that's what's starting to happen and vote for trump and so instead they
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.440]  have all these different polls i showed you yesterday from roiders and others where they will sample
[38:58.440 --> 39:08.680]  659 democrats to 450 republicans and then my gosh hillary's winning when you sample
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.480]  more democrats than republicans wow that's crazy that'd be like if i had scales and i put
[39:16.120 --> 39:22.120]  65 pounds on one and 45 pounds on the other the 65 pound side would be on the ground
[39:22.120 --> 39:29.400]  what you really you mean if i put my finger on the scale you mean hillary wins and they run around
[39:29.400 --> 39:33.560]  oh she's winning she's winning trump's dropping out trump's dropping out this is wife's a prostitute
[39:33.560 --> 39:39.400]  uh he's racist he's a mean to people in scotland by the way i've investigated the whole scotland
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.360]  story and i and i've got some scottish background in me great hard-working tough smart people
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.840]  now behind 57 but you know any scott will tell you they're the biggest tightwads and the worst
[39:50.840 --> 39:57.640]  to deal with them business anybody probably out there on earth i mean any scott will tell you
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.120]  and then once you start getting a business deal with them they're going to try to get the upper
[40:02.120 --> 40:10.680]  hand on you every time so that's what we're talking about here it's like with scott's they say hey you
[40:10.680 --> 40:16.440]  want to drink some beer are you buying and of course trump gets that he's mom is scottish
[40:16.440 --> 40:22.760]  in from scotland it's genetic trump is predisposed to try to get a better deal over somebody
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.880]  that's what he does but he doesn't want to screw over the country or the american people
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.960]  and he doesn't like seeing the globalist screwing us over and that's why they're so scared of it folks
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.040]  but it turned out when he was buying that golf course people at first and said they'd be part
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.560]  of it then they started trying to get out of it or demand more from him and he ran over them
[40:41.560 --> 40:49.000]  now i'm not defending the way imminent domain was handled in every case but the point is at
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.320]  least they weren't just taking land to give it to globalist to give it to some chinese you know
[40:53.320 --> 40:58.520]  uranium mine or something he was building a hotel building a golf course for people in that area but
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.960]  it doesn't matter is he a communist chinese agent no did he give weapons to al qaeda and isis no
[41:04.520 --> 41:07.080]  is he trying to shut down the free speech to take our second amendment no
[41:07.080 --> 41:14.360]  and the big news is we now have obama having to respond to this this is so good because there's
[41:14.360 --> 41:20.840]  going to be exit poll watchers there's going to be coverage in other elections when exit polls and
[41:20.840 --> 41:26.840]  local precincts are saying one thing but then they'll announce a state all of a sudden on fox
[41:26.840 --> 41:33.480]  cnn you name it oh the numbers are in they're projecting the associated press is projecting
[41:33.480 --> 41:45.800]  or state officials are projecting a barack obama win 2012 and then you go burrow into those areas
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.960]  and you look and it doesn't match up but by then done done done done yes obama reelected
[41:53.160 --> 41:58.520]  eight million more people vote but mint romney gets less votes you really believe mint romney was
[41:58.520 --> 42:09.400]  less popular than john mccain think about that so let's go ahead and go into that briar patch
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.280]  there's another headline perfect end of democratic primary anonymous super delegates declare winner
[42:16.280 --> 42:23.000]  through the media through the associated press and that was on june 7th
[42:23.000 --> 42:30.200]  you understand you get up in the morning you hear hillary's one before you even vote
[42:31.080 --> 42:36.360]  and then obama wants to sit there when he clearly stole the 2012 election and by the way trump
[42:36.360 --> 42:42.280]  tweeted and wrote letters the day after saying this is clearly fraud there's no way there were eight
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.560]  million more votes in the general election and then mit romney got less they stole it from him
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.000]  and trump isn't going to lie down and take it and neither are we and that's why hillary's campaign
[42:53.000 --> 43:00.040]  head calls it dangerous what trump's saying know what you're doing is dangerous opening the borders
[43:00.040 --> 43:05.800]  up bringing in tens of millions more illegals people with diseases you name it not even testing them
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.880]  for their own health for heaven's sakes telling us we're racist because we don't like you operating
[43:09.880 --> 43:15.160]  outside the law and the supreme court rules you're breaking the law months ago and you accelerate
[43:15.160 --> 43:20.520]  bringing the illegals in from all over the world and say you'll do whatever you want
[43:22.360 --> 43:27.880]  oh but you would never screw us over like the foreign insurance company said with obama care
[43:27.880 --> 43:31.720]  written with the republic of establishment that's why they hate trump he wants to repeal it it's a
[43:31.720 --> 43:38.520]  screw job made in hell the economy is tanking it's meant to take 30 something million people
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.560]  out of full-time employment and bring them into part time i told the story they're gonna play the
[43:43.560 --> 43:51.880]  clip back three four years ago i was going to barton springs during the spring and summer and fall
[43:51.880 --> 43:57.880]  almost every day i don't ever get a chance to go there now i'm so busy well i learned just
[43:57.880 --> 44:01.640]  nutraceuticals is the way to lose weight instead of doing two mile swims and not losing weight but
[44:03.240 --> 44:11.160]  long story short i remember the place is huge one of the biggest freshwater pools in the country
[44:11.160 --> 44:16.520]  or the world really they were everybody who i was and they were people with satan nasty remarks
[44:16.520 --> 44:21.960]  hardly would talk to me and all this stuff and then obama care kicked in two years ago two and a
[44:21.960 --> 44:26.360]  half years ago in travis county in austin texas and that's a city on pool they got like 50 60
[44:26.360 --> 44:33.720]  live cards they took them all from 40 hours down to like 20 hours and cut their pay because of
[44:33.720 --> 44:39.080]  obama care and i'm not exaggerating i had 20 of them or more come up to me in the next month and
[44:39.080 --> 44:47.480]  say we apologize we had no idea we we we heard you on air there's a show so popular here in austin
[44:47.480 --> 44:52.440]  saying it was going to put us to part time and the city told us it wouldn't but then they did it
[44:56.120 --> 45:00.680]  i didn't get any pleasure out of them going from being mad at me
[45:00.680 --> 45:09.080]  me oh there's that right wing jerk to oh my gosh you're right we apologize what do we do
[45:10.520 --> 45:14.520]  your whole world's fake okay i'm not a right winger there's no such thing it's a false
[45:14.520 --> 45:18.360]  paradigm there's a real right and a real left within a controlled system but outside of it
[45:18.360 --> 45:23.720]  there's are you for libertarian freedom or are you for command and control and then it's where do
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.800]  you want to be on that spectrum that was the history of the world for the last 160 years
[45:27.800 --> 45:33.560]  and they concocted this whole liberal conservative paradigm to further dumb everything down
[45:36.600 --> 45:44.680]  but let's go to the president implying oh especially out of texas obviously a message
[45:44.680 --> 45:47.720]  at yours truly i mean they know where the message came from the white house run media
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.560]  matters you know freaked out over it dozens of newspapers we know i've said oh god trump is
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.240]  quoting jones exactly and you know i think they've already figured that out so yes that is what's
[45:55.240 --> 46:01.640]  happening um for me it's not a power trip it is a great responsibility
[46:08.200 --> 46:14.840]  because we're dealing with serious criminals here i mean they will obviously plan to come
[46:14.840 --> 46:19.320]  after me even more especially if hillary's victorious or if hillary loses she'll even be
[46:19.320 --> 46:22.760]  more vindictive i've talked to some experts in international security services and
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.680]  they said fantastically they'd be worried actually uh if she uh if she loses
[46:32.200 --> 46:39.480]  not if she wins but i've just got to do this and info wars in 21 years on air is a testament
[46:39.480 --> 46:45.080]  to where to where you can go and what you can do even though we're this unnamed enemy we would put
[46:45.080 --> 46:49.320]  out reports about the carbon taxes and now they want to shut down power plants to bankrupt states
[46:49.320 --> 46:52.680]  and then we get picked up by drudge and go viral and then they would have the white house come out
[46:52.680 --> 46:58.920]  and say that guy in texas is a conspiracy theorist we don't want carbon taxes well everybody knows
[46:58.920 --> 47:03.320]  they do so i'm the guy in texas who's the conspiracy theorist no i'm the guy in texas that
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.120]  knows what i'm talking about i'm the guy in texas that actually doesn't go out and party all night
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.800]  or go out and watch movies or go out and play golf all day and i'm not saying you're bad if you do
[47:11.800 --> 47:16.120]  if you're a successful person the point is most people do the minimum amount of work they can not me
[47:16.120 --> 47:23.160]  i'm obsessed with this i know what i'm talking about i've proven i do and they're even more horrified
[47:24.360 --> 47:29.000]  that donald trump listens to me and others well we're the opposition to the new world order
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.800]  we've done the research we're not just here making up something we want to believe
[47:35.160 --> 47:37.960]  we're immersed in the data immersed in the facts
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.360]  and now it's up to the listeners of this broadcast to get the word out this is a hoax
[47:44.360 --> 47:48.680]  that he's dropping out and there's going to be more hoaxes because we asked him to get involved
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.960]  we asked him to go up against these criminals and now we're seeing the full power of the disinformation
[47:53.960 --> 48:00.280]  media used against trump and his family so i want to hear people admiring trump and thanking trump
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.160]  and appreciating what he's doing because we're getting to hear about the private
[48:03.160 --> 48:06.440]  federal reserve we're getting to hear about rigged elections we're getting to hear about one-sided
[48:06.440 --> 48:12.120]  trade deals and hillary being a communist shiny spy we're getting to hear about uh all of how the
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.680]  mainstream media is involved in deception and how they're coming to an end donald trump has
[48:16.680 --> 48:24.760]  absolutely paid off in spades in triplicate on everything he said he'd do if donald trump was a
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.840]  10 year savings bond he would be paying back 10 000 percent
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.640]  he's an absolute god's sin
[48:33.640 --> 48:45.080]  and that's why they're so scared of him now let's go ahead and go to obama responding to trump
[48:45.080 --> 48:50.520]  and info wars particularly and you know that came out of texas whoa oh the rule the right
[48:50.520 --> 48:57.000]  wingers down there oh yes the evil people that exposed the 2000 election as a fraud to al gore
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.920]  i don't like al gore but the fact is he did win they did engage in manipulation
[49:05.880 --> 49:09.560]  but we're seeing even bigger fraud now by the other side and the republican establishment
[49:09.560 --> 49:14.040]  that stole that election is now trying to block trump everyone must vote for trump here's the
[49:14.040 --> 49:21.320]  clip of course the elections will not be rigged what does that mean what does it mean the federal
[49:21.320 --> 49:29.080]  government doesn't run the election process it's right the ap does states and cities and communities
[49:29.080 --> 49:35.400]  all across the country they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting boosts and
[49:36.280 --> 49:44.440]  if mr trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated
[49:44.440 --> 49:51.160]  across the country including in places like texas
[49:54.920 --> 50:00.040]  where typically it's not democrats who are in charge of voting boost
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.720]  that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense and i don't think anybody would take that serious
[50:05.720 --> 50:11.000]  you see how he you see how he spins all this first he makes a nod to info wars and we're
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.400]  putting conspiracy theories out then he acts like we're saying there's going to be fraud in texas
[50:15.400 --> 50:22.760]  because i'm in texas i'm talking to the whole country in the whole world so he makes it all
[50:22.760 --> 50:29.160]  geographic and and again puts this info out he's very highly trained like the devil at every level
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.600]  just to spew disinformation to confuse people like hey that's a republican state who's claiming
[50:34.600 --> 50:39.080]  there's going to be election fraud there well they are eyeing on stealing in texas they because they
[50:39.080 --> 50:42.840]  know trump's got such a landslide in florida he's going to get it he might even win battleground
[50:42.840 --> 50:47.480]  states like pennsylvania he's got ohio unless there's total fraud and the word is uh that
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.000]  they're thinking about having the cruise people and others go in and claim that's how trump lost
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.840]  of course it would have been a theft but they just want the plausible deniability
[50:54.840 --> 50:59.480]  for the sheeple out there and then you'll get your hillary clinton as mentally ill as she is

[54:18.600 --> 54:23.000]  by the way i haven't even gotten into the 400 million dollars on an airplane illegally
[54:23.000 --> 54:29.720]  flown the iranians that obama had lied about previously so the media turns it into um
[54:31.720 --> 54:35.960]  trump getting confused by the news showing supposed footage of the plane when it wasn't
[54:35.960 --> 54:41.080]  footage that's the media getting that wrong but see oh trump has a crooked toenail he reported
[54:41.080 --> 54:46.520]  on it a little bit wrong about what video he saw so that's what matters not obama engaging in the
[54:46.520 --> 54:51.640]  crime and i was just watching hillary during a press conference uh or more of a press statement
[54:51.640 --> 54:59.080]  they're totally rigged and she looks like hell warmed over she looks worse than she's ever looked
[54:59.800 --> 55:04.760]  so i think time is basically running out for her but i was talking to don salazar why do you think
[55:04.760 --> 55:10.680]  obama is making comments about texas well that's because the media is all fully aware of the fact
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.480]  that when they talk about what we're doing they say oh the conspiracy theory out of texas that's how
[55:15.480 --> 55:20.760]  they that's the agreed upon language because we're so dangerous they dare not say our name the
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.560]  conspiracy theory out of texas that that hillary had super delegates till the election that's
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.600]  another fact that we've had major elections fraud in this country a major fact and see they don't
[55:30.600 --> 55:36.200]  know how to deal with it we had mainstream media at the dnc and rnc just marveling at our readership
[55:36.200 --> 55:43.800]  and our traffic and the fact that it just keeps coming true what we say because see our narrative
[55:43.800 --> 55:51.400]  is actually truth-based we don't get talking points from on top we create the talking points
[55:51.400 --> 55:57.560]  off of reality does that mean we're 100 right no we're about 97 right
[56:00.440 --> 56:02.920]  but people say is it the right strategy to come out and say
[56:04.520 --> 56:08.200]  they've stolen elections before hillary stole the nomination let's stand up against her
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.480]  and i say it's the right thing to do to defend our election system so stand up and speak out against
[56:13.480 --> 56:20.680]  it see as soon as we stop playing along with the fantasy land as soon as we quit trying to change
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.480]  the whole fraudulent system and just admit it's a fraud it begins to fall and that's what they're
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.880]  scared about they understand what we're doing we're outside their spectrum

[01:00:51.960 --> 01:01:04.840]  so
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.720]  president repeatedly now donald trump has said that this election will be rigged against him
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.680]  challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.120]  can you promise the american people that that this election will be conducted in a fairway
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.800]  and are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.600]  election and and if he does win given that you've just declared him unfit what will you say to the
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:39.800]  american people well at the end of the day it's the american people's decision uh i have one vote
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.840]  i have the same vote you do i have the same vote that uh all the voters who are eligible all across
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.040]  the country have i've offered my opinion but ultimately it's it's the american people's
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:58.120]  decision to make collectively uh and if somebody wins the election and they are president then
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.040]  my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:16.520]  i can to help them succeed it is uh i don't even really know where to start on answering this
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.480]  question uh of course the elections will not be rigged what does that mean
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:32.120]  the federal government doesn't run the election process states and cities and
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:38.440]  communities all across the country they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:47.640]  boosts and uh if mr trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is uh being
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:03:00.600]  propagated across the country including in places like texas uh uh where typically it's not
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:07.240]  democrats who are in charge of uh voting boost um that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:13.800]  and i don't think anybody would take that seriously uh now we do take seriously as we always do our
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:22.040]  responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process if we see signs that
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:30.040]  uh a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking then we inform those local authorities
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.600]  who are running the elections that they need to be careful uh if we see jurisdictions that
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:44.920]  are violating uh federal laws uh in terms of equal access and uh aren't providing
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:53.240]  ramps for disabled voters uh or are discriminating in some fashion or are otherwise violating
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:59.560]  civil rights laws then the justice department will come in and uh take care of that but this will be
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:09.880]  an election like every other election and you know i'm uh i think all of us at some points in
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:15.880]  our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a in a schoolyard or a sandbox and
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.480]  sometimes folks that they lose they start complaining that they got cheated
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.560]  but i've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.920]  okay again i thought you might just want to hear some of the garbage from obama's own mouth
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:38.280]  they tried to steal the delegates and said that votes didn't count and they did steal it from
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:45.880]  sanders so she is an illegitimate nominee obama he stole the nomination it'd be like if she got
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.680]  into the championship boxing match but it turned out the other guy'd taken a dive or whatever it's
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:57.160]  it's a fraudulent system election fraud's part of history it's part of our history and he should
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:05.000]  challenge it beforehand to let folks know we're watching harry reid wants cia to give trump
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  fake intelligence briefings the democratic senate minority leader harry reid said he would rather
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.040]  see the cia and other intelligence agencies give gop nominee donald trump fake briefings then to
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.640]  make sure he's informed before potentially becoming president reid suggested that it would be risky
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:29.160]  to divulge classified information pertaining to national security to trump so it should just
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.160]  be faked even more incredulous is the fact that reid is the one accusing trump of being quote
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.840]  dangerous trump is due to receive intelligence briefings in the coming weeks as is clinton
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.880]  it is standard procedure for both candidates to have limited updates so they're somewhat prepared

[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:05.400]  they took my saddle and here's
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:17.560]  broke my leg in the saturday lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.880]  in defense of human liberty alex jones i'll be looking parade when they pull that in
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.880]  and i hope that judging plan
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.800]  last saturday i came up here at about two o'clock in the afternoon and met with one of my camera
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.400]  people editors rob Jacobson and i shot a special report that went up a few hours later and was
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.760]  watched several million times on facebook listened to by millions of people here on the radio and
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.480]  seen by hundreds of thousands on other platforms like youtube and all i did was lay out the fact
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.560]  that they tried to steal the election from trump showed them admitting it showed republican saying
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.880]  your vote doesn't count showed the democrats stealing it from sanders saying your vote doesn't
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.840]  count and i pointed out that she was an illegitimate nominee and that she would then try to steal it
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:11.240]  from trump because at that time he was 10 points ahead in major polls and i said it was important
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:18.360]  to come out with it before they artificially lowered him in the polls trump came out a day
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.720]  and a half later it's become a big national issue obama responded last night specifically said you
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.440]  know that conspiracy theory it comes out of texas because you know don't mention info wars
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.440]  as if everybody doesn't know who you're talking about it's so ridiculous
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:42.920]  i love how animated he gets when he talks about the texan because they cannot stand the fact that
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.760]  they don't control the narrative it's like when they order robert gibbs as press secretary to get
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.880]  up on tv for three years and say there is no drone program there is no assassination program
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.920]  when it was admitted and public years before
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:04.840]  vladimir putin has come out and talked about the super delegates on cnn foreign cnn panels
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.200]  you know they've seen an international with farid zarkaria the billderberg globalist
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:15.480]  and just laughs at him and says you know your super delegates decide things this is ridiculous
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.400]  he should know under the old soviet union you had a central committee that was handing down power
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:29.560]  since 1917 no elections and then they would choose who could run for president but then of
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.560]  course everybody knew who was going to win it was whoever was favored joe stalin or whoever
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.480]  you go to china it's even worse they have a central committee
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:44.440]  that then lets the pollock bureau vote on who the president is
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.000]  a couple hundred people and you look at who runs things in china it's it's it's the generals
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.480]  it's the communists it's the people in the party they own the factories there's thousands of
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:03.720]  billionaires over there it's crazy but they're communists their slave masters is what they are
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:10.520]  so obama's trying to act like it's crazy that we'd raise this see oh here's the deal if we play
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:16.760]  along with fraud like mit romney or like john mccain or others or even al gore who had the
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:23.160]  election stolen from him as much as i hate him it's a fact it's fact if we go along with it
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.440]  they get away with it but if we don't go along with it it will bring down this corrupt illegitimate
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:35.240]  system if they would have allowed trump to have a super delegate's taken if the if those super
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.000]  delegates put in by the party would have been allowed to block the regular votes of the delegates
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.480]  you'd have a precedent for a new open imperium of the republican and democratic parties
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.280]  ruling the nation and sharing power openly and ending the popular vote as we know it
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.200]  that was such an incredible attempt and they succeeded on the democrat side
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:02.760]  now the republican insiders are still trying to sabotage trump after saying oh he's going to drop
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.920]  out any day oh we can't raise money precisely because he raised a record 97 million dollars
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:15.160]  in three weeks he raised 60 million in the year before that plus year and a half before that
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.520]  he matched it with his own 60 million
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:27.800]  so he had 120 million in a year and a half he raised 97 million it's it's incredible
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.000]  but suddenly in the last two days he's raised almost nothing it's like the spicket was turned
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.640]  off and roger stone was in california a few days ago and this was happening and the donors were
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:45.480]  saying i i'm not going to give he's going to drop out it worked on them see this is war people
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.000]  well and we know how they operate we've done the studying we're not special the average man
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.600]  who's watched baseball for 20 years and knows everything about it if he put that into say
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.200]  stock market research he'd be incredibly wealthy with small investments if you put political
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:06.280]  knowledge if you study oil painting you're going to become successful we've studied
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.840]  how things really work we've read the hundreds of books we've interviewed the thousands of guests
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:19.240]  we know the program when i explain this to people it's so you understand we're not up here
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:25.320]  winging this broad jest i'm not up here just hoping i know how things work oh i know how
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.920]  the shadow government works i know how the intelligence agencies work i know how the
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.760]  whole military system works i know how the special interest are controlling the nation
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.040]  i know what their goals are because here's the issue the new world order is so arrogant and
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.480]  thought they had this so sewn up that the last 50 years they've written hundreds of books
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.680]  hundreds and thousands of white papers admitting the whole stinking plan
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.520]  and i have read most of them i'll be honest the last decade or so i've been so busy covering news
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.600]  and research and family i rarely go get you know oh my gosh brzezinski has a new book out
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.920]  admitting world government and the plan to exterminate people i actually went and bought
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.560]  the book and read it the last one i like two three years ago i mean i remember memoirs came out
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.880]  like a decade ago david rockefeller admitting world government and the plan to bring in planetary
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.520]  rule and in nation states and if you believe he's doing that he says guilty is charged
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.760]  tragedy and hope between two ages the technotronic era the anglo-american establishment
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  ecoscience
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.560]  then you go read a book like none dare call conspiracy written by the father of the guy
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.360]  that runs politico talk about turning your back on your father
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.480]  and the he writes it it's all their own statements that's what the book's totally true
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.360]  you want to read a 200 page book or less it you'll understand everything i read that thing
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:00.600]  was like 10 or 11 years old and i'm sitting here watching their whole plan unfold and
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.840]  i've got their playbook and anyone could have their playbook you just have to go actually
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.320]  read what they said they do and then you sit back you're like whoa they're really doing it
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:14.680]  and then you go next step forced sterilization next step forced labor next step national
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:20.600]  compulsory service next step reducing the language next step creating a one-world religion
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:29.480]  next step no no no no no and then you realize you don't have a choice we've got to stand up against
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.520]  this the toll-free number to join us on this subject or any other you want to discuss is 800
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:45.160]  2599231 800 2599231 first-time callers 800 2599231 William Benny's going to pop in for 30 minutes
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.440]  former technical leader of the national security agency to elaborate on his statement that they've
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.120]  got all of Hillary's emails that's been big national news we're going to have an in-depth
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.560]  discussion of it coming up in team minus 45 minutes but let's get to these clips for the
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.000]  new audience that may have tuned in in the second hour plus one of these i haven't played it's a
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.640]  Putin saying what i just talked about here's trump one of three times he said this week
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.400]  that the whole election has been rigged he's afraid they're going to try to rig this one here it is
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:27.960]  we got we got almost 14 million votes think of that more than anybody in the history of republican
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:34.280]  primers that includes some great people like Ronald Reagan Dwight D. Eisenhower who won the second
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.960]  world war right he did win the second world war got elected because he won the second world war
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:46.840]  i got more votes than him that's good right and remember this i had 17 people i didn't i wasn't
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.280]  running against two people i had 17 people hillary clinton i got a similar number to hillary clinton
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:58.360]  and she had bernie and she had a hard time putting bernie away and bernie poor bernie he looked so
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:05.720]  upset he you know what he made a mistake he shouldn't have made a deal sometimes he lost
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.040]  he lost first of all it was rigged and i'm afraid the election is going to be rigged i have to be
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:16.760]  honest because i think my side was rigged if i didn't win by massive landslides i mean think
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.080]  of what we won in new york and indiana california 78 percent that's with other people in the in the
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:29.640]  race all right and then he's elaborated since then on other shows like hannity that hey they've
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:36.040]  got illegals voting you know 10 times each this is all confirmed now let's hear from obama again
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.880]  briefly where he makes a big joke out of this it says by the way it's coming out of texas here it is
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.960]  of course the elections will not be rigged what does that mean what does it mean
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.200]  the federal government doesn't run the election process the associated press does
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:18:00.040]  states and cities and communities all across the country they're the ones who set up the voting
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:07.960]  systems and the voting booths and uh if mr trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:18.120]  that is uh being propagated across the country including in places like texas
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:27.000]  where typically it's not democrats who are in charge of voting booths
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.520]  that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense and i don't think anybody would take that serious
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.200]  oh yeah no one takes it seriously that there's election fraud going on in the world now here's
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.800]  vladimir putin a few months ago on a big cnn panel with farid zarkaria there's a bunch of
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:51.080]  other tv networks there talking about election fraud here in the united states see america
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:57.000]  teaches everybody how to live in quote democracy but what you actually believe that they have
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:07.480]  democratic elections there this is the truth look twice in the u.s history president was chosen
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:15.640]  not by the majority voters but by the super delegates is that democratic
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:26.680]  and when we try to discuss this with our u.s colleagues and we do not criticize but merely
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:33.720]  have a discussion they say mind your own business this is how we do it well then why are you interfering
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:39.800]  in our business don't meddle in our business sort out your own issues first but i repeat again it is
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:47.400]  in fact not our business what's going on in u.s elections in fact there are reports even of
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:53.960]  prosecuting attorneys not allowing international observers into u.s polling stations and they
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:00.680]  threaten with jail time but that's their problem to sort out that's how they do it they like it that
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:09.080]  way america america is a great superpower uh most perhaps the only superpower of present time
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:15.960]  all right that's good so the whole world knows about the famous election fraud here and obama
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.520]  wants to just sit there and make a big joke out of it and then he knows how people think it's like
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.040]  when somebody says hey they're trying to bankrupt coal and somebody'll say to me well i don't own
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.280]  any coal stock why do i care because your electricity is going to skyrocket it's going to hurt the
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:34.360]  general economy it so he says sides that guy's down in texas saying this i mean republicans run
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.720]  that state what are you worried about election fraud as if it's not the whole country we're
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:42.440]  worried about they always play these games i'm telling you obama is scientifically trained
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:51.000]  this is so incredibly important now i want to go to your phone calls the toll free number to
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.760]  join us is 800-25-99-231 they've got democratic party operatives i'm going to get to running around
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.800]  claiming trump wants to have a civil emergency if he doesn't win the election but meanwhile that's
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.280]  what obama and others have been prepping and getting ready for and and trying to foment the
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:13.720]  cop killing activity and the civil war i mean it's clear who the bad guys are here and it's clear
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.280]  who's trying to stop this and and trying to countermand it i mean that's why i'm desperately
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.680]  for all the problems we have in government and all the corruption in america god knows we're
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.720]  slouching towards gamora i've reached out to police and military because they're going to be
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:32.760]  asked to carry out this evil and i've tried to say look at who runs you they're the globalist
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:37.000]  they're the bad guys it was in two mainstream news articles yesterday in fact you guys pull it from
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.760]  the stack i'm sorry i didn't cover it that okay the un really is going to run the local police
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.000]  review boards and have federal oversight and if they recommend the justice department comes in
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.920]  and they're going to come out for the police a that's incredible the strong cities initiative
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:01.000]  but b we've gotten to the point where i see it and they expand it and i don't even respond to it
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.520]  that shows i'm being conditioned i'm losing i'm being broken
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:15.000]  and i'm i'm going to be conscious of that and i'm going to get upset and i'm going to do something
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.600]  about it i mean i'll tell you i i have had so much energy lately i have been bouncing off the walls
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.760]  because this is history and then to have the responsibility to know that we really do have
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:30.120]  millions and millions of new viewers and listeners that are coming through every day
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:34.360]  and that people now are listening and that and that and that world leaders are listening and
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:42.200]  that we're having an effect if folks just duplicate our system of research it's game over
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:47.560]  for the new world order it is see i'm the opposite talk show hosts are like hey that's my material or
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.720]  hey give me attention for that or cover what i'm doing or i don't want you to go on that show
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:59.720]  i'm about beating the new world order i'm about trying to educate people to understand what's
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.840]  going on the globalists want to keep you in the dark and keep you stupid because they're parasites
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:14.200]  but it is an epic time to be alive and it's very very stressful um
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:20.040]  to have this kind of responsibility but i'm here to tell you you have that responsibility as well
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.920]  i have taken this responsibility on i pray to god every day that if it's god's will that i be given
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:30.840]  the information the oratory skill and the will and the managerial skills and the interpersonal
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:35.880]  skills to be able to hold this together and and create a system to try to actively resist the
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.680]  globalist and to try to educate the public in the belief that if the public is ever given
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.760]  basic information on how the system works and where it's taking them they're going to say no
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:53.720]  to it en masse and that is happening but the new world order is extremely predatory and it's very
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:01.000]  good at getting us in a whole false left right debate with their false left and their false right
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:08.120]  minions who battle over control over the system but who are all cogs and servants and officers of
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:13.400]  that system and i'm only reaching out and saying to people that are in the system whether they're
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:22.040]  journalists or police or doctors or corporate officers or cog type people you know this program
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.160]  leads us towards the industrialization a post industrial world a planetary world government
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:37.400]  a total tyranny and do you want to be a manager in that horrible system and do you want that bad
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:48.120]  spiritual behavior on you plus most of you know you're going to get ground up by this down the
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.640]  road anyways it's for your own selfish interest to not go with this that's all i'm saying i don't
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.800]  know how anybody could sign on to this world government i mean this thing isn't taking us
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.480]  to star trek and life extension and and happiness and you know the new world order is taking out
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.920]  radical islam and and and you know bringing freedom to those countries no they're putting
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:16.440]  radical islam in to suppress people the world government is out to get us it's evil how could
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:25.000]  you not want to throw yourself against it every fiber of my being is just oh my gosh this is really
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  evil well how do i figure out how to stop it and i tell you i i should be very very excited
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.800]  and i have been at certain levels to know that info wars is broken through not just here but
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.000]  globally and that our information accurate information most of it the enemy's own statements
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.160]  has now penetrated and has now hit an absorption rate in power structures especially security
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.600]  services worldwide and it's causing a decompartmentalization
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.680]  that's causing mass awakening and i am very proud of the fact that info wars has been able to at
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:09.560]  least at some level find the lever find the right domino to start the chain reaction of
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:19.080]  the life force the survival instinct the renaissance spirit to start rising again the the the life
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:25.320]  force the innovation and the enemy can feel that spirit rising as well and the enemy's
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:31.800]  rising to meet it and it is just an incredible time to be alive i'm going to come back play a

[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:40.200]  complain stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to african americans because
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.320]  the flag was designed by christopher gasin the slave trader and owner of slaves although a
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:50.040]  thorough review of the record it is clear that the gatson flag originated in a revolutionary war

[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:35.480]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones take me to the center
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:47.240]  you know there's this new thing i saw where this black congressman put out an ad and said
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.440]  everyone is welcome to apply but straight white males that's on info wars dot com
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:58.200]  and then i read where all over the place this is the new movement is for blacks and others to
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:03.080]  self-segregate and then to be allowed to discriminate and then the feds and the eoc
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.640]  don't block it i mean this is really getting crazy
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:14.520]  hillary refuses to meet white reporters in first press conference in 2016
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:22.120]  clinton has an elder press conference is december of 2015 nine months ago eight and a half months
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:31.960]  ago and then there's a whole stack of news i've got here with similar stuff going on
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:38.520]  it's just crazy and again it's invoking classical racist behavior
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:44.920]  but on the side of minorities but it's directed by the weirdo democratic party
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.440]  that always ran race-based politics in this country before and you can really see the
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.200]  sophisticated double cross they've engaged in and of course the people engaging in race
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.200]  behavior aren't going to go anywhere whether it's not going to help them it's just going to create
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:04.680]  more and more vulcanization in this country it's so incredibly cold-blooded here's some
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:12.600]  of the articles that are up on info wars dot com un backs secret obama takeover of police
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.040]  but it's not bright bar reports it's called strong cities initiative six months ago
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.600]  and it says the un will oversee the police departments
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  uh and they've got the un going after arpaio and the un investigating the texas governor because
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:36.200]  of the they dare arrest the legals that's just some of the news upon info wars dot com again
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.200]  william benny former leader of the nsa he actually ran the nsa spy he wasn't a political leader of
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:49.320]  it but the technical director he came out last week uh and said earlier this week and said
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.680]  on wavc erin clines program that hey listen they already got all hillary's emails in the nsa
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.200]  they save all of it so he's gonna be talking about that in more detail but i'm gonna go
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:05.800]  to your calls here in just a moment first richard in maryland and then ryan christ morris and
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:12.680]  ryan and others but the big issue here is this video just went live and info wars dot com
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:19.080]  and everybody needs to see it everybody needs to understand it because they're saying trump
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:26.600]  hasn't responded to the two days of them claiming he's dropped out and the truth is he did respond
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:33.320]  two nights ago saying the campaign's never been more unified and he responded earlier when they
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.000]  were saying it that it was preposterous and ridiculous but i do think we need to see a
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.720]  strong reaction from him to talk about why they're doing it just like saying ben karson
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.160]  dropped out and tied into the fake roiders polls sampling 15 more hillary so folks understand
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:51.640]  they're rigging everything and he's absolutely on target to say he thinks they're gonna try to
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:57.640]  rig the general election and you talk about it beforehand so there's sunshine and light on it
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:06.760]  so that they can't steal it as easily here's that special report in the history of us politics we
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:14.600]  have never seen more dirty tricks in an election season than we're now seeing in 2015 2016 we
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.040]  witnessed bernie sanders win more than 10 states including california and new hampshire and defeat
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.800]  hillary soundly and the super delegates simply stepped in and said the popular vote doesn't count
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.840]  the republican party tried it with donald trump but he won in such landslides and didn't stand down
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:38.520]  and didn't go along with it he didn't accept the theft of our electoral system in this country
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:44.040]  and so he became the nominee now the very same republican establishment with the democrats
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.160]  has been putting out for two days the lying rumor that donald trump is going to drop out
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.360]  and that donald trump is in all this trouble i've talked to the inside sources and my instincts
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:02.040]  were right about why this is happening he raised 97 million dollars in just a month and scared the
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.400]  hell out of him almost all of it grassroots donations this is so historical so they're putting
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:14.840]  out that he's dropping out just like in iowa when ben carson was going to be the establishment
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.040]  republican ted cruz as soon as carson's plane took off that afternoon they went on tv and said
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.480]  carson says he's quitting vote for ted cruz now and ted cruz came in second iowa this is a much
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:33.480]  bigger scandal than that and so i want to play a clip here of trump two nights ago in daytona
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:37.960]  florida saying our campaign's never been better we're doing great because he thought he didn't
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:44.600]  have to respond that hard to a pure lie because he'd already responded to it in the past in june
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:52.120]  so i just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well it's never been so well united and we
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:59.480]  started on june 16th i would say right now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.720]  since we began we're doing incredibly well we're leading in the state of florida you saw the poll
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.800]  we're leading in ohio you have bernie sanders people are going to be voting for trump something
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.560]  just came in they like trump they like trump but more important than his statement two nights ago
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:27.960]  is this politico article that will show you some close-ups of back in june of this year
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.760]  on the 18th would donald trump really drop out for 150 million dollars and they admit they just
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:39.880]  pulled it out of the air they just made it up as if he would do that for money when he's lost
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.400]  hundreds of millions of dollars in boycotts and all the rest of it in tv deals he's lost deep in
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:52.280]  the article they let trump respond via email this story is a total fabrication from u and politico
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.560]  as usual the new york billionaire sent an email sent by his campaign manager i will never leave
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:04.600]  the race quote i will never leave the race i will never leave the race nobody has enough money to
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.800]  pay me to leave the race and if they did it would be totally illegal did obama and the clinton's
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.480]  get you to write this garbage donald trump so they're now all over the news two days into this
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.840]  this this this huge rollout number one story everywhere donald trump's dropping out will he
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:25.080]  drop out the republicans are making him drop out his sons don't like him his campaign managers
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:30.200]  don't like him he's crazy it's all made up meanwhile hillary stumbling around i think
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.760]  she's having seizures in public reportedly has brain damage that's even in mainstream news
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.840]  umma avid he admits that she doesn't you know who she is part of the timing it's totally confused
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:45.400]  she's caught in the new wiki leaks actually directing the media to go after donald trump
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.920]  and other people just like trump predicted just a few weeks before this is amazing they know the
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.960]  new wiki leaks is coming out our sources have confirmed it's the Benghazi info with her directing
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:02.440]  weapons and ordering generals to stand down and to ship weapons to al-qaeda also known as ices
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:06.920]  that's why they're panicking that's why they want to create the illusion that he's a candidate you
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:12.280]  can't have and then he's dropped out of the race like ben karson this is a hoax this is a fraud so
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.720]  you'll be hearing from donald trump guaranteed responding to this very very soon he's already
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:23.160]  responded to it multiple times just like the whole made up kkk garbage and david do but i am
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.880]  responding here with his own words and his own statements and i will be standing up for everyone
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.840]  that wants to restore this republic not just donald trump because it's bigger than donald
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.800]  trump it's about our constitution our bill of rights and the right of voting in this country
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.360]  the fact that the entire power structure is lined up against him the democratic leadership the
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.560]  republican leadership offshore banks the pope the communist chinese president the mexican president
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.440]  the saudi arabians is the reason we've got to support trump we've got to have a landslide
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:54.920]  to counter their fraud and their election fraud trump knows there's been massive election fraud
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.240]  so far but he was able to defeat it with a landslide the primaries then obama comes out next like
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.960]  it's crazy he says that there could ever be any election fraud in america when there are thousands
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:11.160]  of documented cases just the last hundred years so now you've seen donald trump's response to the
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:20.040]  lie that he has dropped out there's that report my only problem is i had just worked out and just
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.720]  showered and i was still sweating i sweat for like 30 minutes after i work out really hard
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.720]  especially in the summer so i bet it's almost better than i'm like sweating and all upset
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:32.520]  because you know that's how real all this is that's how teleprompter free all this is
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:37.400]  donald j trump responds to dropout rumors and i put that out so there's something defending him
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.560]  something and i used his quote and his statement uh because again i've talked to folks in the
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.120]  campaign you name it they go no it's ridiculous and but uh you know he's he's sick of responding
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.520]  it's like if they ask him if he supports david duke he said like 50 times he doesn't but i guess
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:58.040]  he just keeps saying yes i deny yes i deny yes i deny you know you know i that i agree with him
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.920]  but again this is how they turn all this around look at drudgereport.com and i'm going to your
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:12.280]  phone calls iran shows off ransom cash expensive price to free hostages plane waited until money
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:20.840]  arrived win lose deal that hurts usa paper now tehran how tehran will spend the windfall
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.200]  and first they lied and said there was no plane there was no money then they got caught on an
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.640]  unmarked plane so they say oh it's for something else for money we owed them from decades ago
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:40.840]  so more lies and then right next to it we have con a la is tripping up trump it's just everywhere
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.720]  because in islamic countries it's not about producing it's about politically taking over
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.120]  so the average american isn't politically involved the muslims are and we are just overtaken
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:56.760]  overrun completely we're we're a joke i mean you know they tell us don't say this guy's ollie
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.920]  that killed people say his name's david we do it they covered up the latest london murders
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.080]  stabbing screaming a lot bar now it's come out of course he was a jihadi isis you know praised him
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.360]  but this is what they do this is how they treat us because it's a collection of criminals in our
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:18.760]  government allied with any other muscle they can bring in an islam works absolutely wonderfully
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:24.520]  they love it you know harry reid this is on info wars dot com wants cia to give trump fake
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.680]  intelligence briefings because this guy sold out the communist chinese even worse than hillary and
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:34.120]  that's hard to be worse than hillary but he's right up there uh no but oh trump you can't trust him
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:40.600]  to have these briefings yes in comments not while he reported this week democratic senator
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.280]  senate majority leader harry reid said he would rather see cia and other intelligence agencies
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.040]  give g o p nominee trump fake briefings that's illegal by the way that makes sure he's informed
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.880]  before potentially becoming president yeah that way he put out this info and then you
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:04.440]  could say that it was his fault in fact let's just play a clip of uh him saying it then i'm
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.680]  going to go to richard go ahead it's obvious that he doesn't know what he's talking about
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:15.480]  it's obvious he can't control his mind or his tongue and what i've suggested if now because
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:21.240]  he's the nominee for the party uh and he gets his entitled to briefings from the cia for example
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.840]  i told i said publicly give him fake briefings pretend your briefing don't tell him anything
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.200]  that you don't want to get out uh that's how i feel about it i think that the man is a loose cannon
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.360]  i think he's done so much to hurt our country with our international relations these are the people
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.040]  that let all the foreign governments penetrate the servers these people that let hillary have all
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:45.720]  these foreign governments on her illegal server these are the people that armed isis these are
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.960]  the people that have devalued our currency and put us under all this debt donald trump's done
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:55.560]  none of it i love the corrupt stinging establishment and and how he gave the communist government
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:00.920]  billions and billions in taxpayer paid solar panel farms in the us
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.720]  they won't even give the stimulus money to us companies and that little dirtbag
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.280]  who says the american people and land rights activists or terrorists he says we can't have
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.360]  donald trump all right richard in maryland richard thanks for calling her on the air
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:23.320]  yes uh elix i'd like to address my comments to all the bitfors out there i'm a 27-year
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:34.440]  veteran retired army sergeant i feel that voting for hillary clinton would be a would be um excuse me
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.040]  i feel that voting for hillary clinton would be coming um
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:49.720]  my goodness christ i'm sorry would be committing treason against the oaths i took to defend the
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:56.120]  constitution and i stand to consider all enemies born in domestic i consider henry clinton a domestic
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.240]  enemy and i would never vote for her uh absolutely sir it sounds like you are you on oxygen right
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:10.920]  now no sir i'm just just hyped up i understand i get hyped up too and angry i mean it really
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.440]  is crazy to watch them invert reality and claim trump some type of russian agent uh or that you
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.080]  can't give him a cia briefing when the law says he's supposed to as the nominee i mean how would you
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.960]  not do that uh i mean he's done nothing to hurt this country they're the ones that have hurt this
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.040]  country trump all the way sir i bless you i appreciate your call richard thanks for holding
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:37.560]  to talk about that look there's going to be a landslide for trump they just may try to steal it
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:44.680]  they're already fixing the polls folks okay that's uh that's so clear we've never seen such
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.280]  rigging and he's right to say no to it we may beat it because of that it's our only hope uh let's go
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:57.480]  to morrison on uh the phone from missouri go ahead morrison hey love you alex how you doing good
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:05.000]  brother good hey uh i just wanted to call in uh um there was a guy that called in last week and
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:12.680]  he had i thought he thought he had a great idea uh ron paul the blimp if you remember back in 2007
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:18.600]  he had that blimp who was ron paul google ron paul i thought that was one of the most effective
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.840]  political ads that i'd ever seen and i know that you said that you would like to get into blimps
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:27.960]  they're very expensive but uh you're working on the money to come up with that well there's only
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.920]  a couple companies that have them and they're big multinationals and when we called one company
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.360]  that does it they were the same one with the aircraft they said no once they learned it was
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:42.680]  hillary for prison so that's type of censorship that goes on and the control out there uh but i
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:48.520]  think trump has punched through overall with his message and doesn't need a blimp i do think messages
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.920]  with aircraft uh targeted uh are important but i think larger than that is the listeners
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:01.320]  and patriots in general sending out articles sending out videos that counter what the establishment
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.640]  enemy media is doing i think that's where the real battle's happening yeah the guy that called in
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:10.840]  last week i thought he had a brilliant idea he said uh why not come up with a uh uh hillary for
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:16.840]  prison bumper sticker and i know that every time that i place an order alex i've got dozens of them
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:22.280]  every time i place an order you throw in two or three bumper stickers yes i got them well deployed
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.600]  on my cars i hand them out to friends uh if they ask me where i got my hillary for prison
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:32.520]  prison t-shirt i give him a bumper sticker with info wars dot com uh i know several people that
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:38.280]  have gone and bought them but uh you can sell those for a buck a piece or buy a shirt get a couple
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:44.840]  free bumper stickers uh yard signs half you know those embroidered patches that people could sell
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:51.720]  on their jacket i'm sure and then have that money go towards blimps or something yeah but yeah towards
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.840]  yeah towards blimps or more more uh more you know more than banners flying well sure i'll
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.600]  tell you this i mean look just the bumper stickers just the airplanes in a few cities
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:06.600]  things but six cities so far as the money we had that came in shook up the mainstream because people
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.560]  are responding to it people people know they're being lied to people are looking for ways to come
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:17.400]  together uh and so i there are a lot of rich listeners out there uh and they should take action
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.400]  and put out the blimps they should put up the billboards i mean it's all of us doing this together
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.720]  sticking our necks out that's going to save us it's by not sticking our necks out
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.640]  that we're all going to get our heads politically chopped off we got to hang together or hang separate
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.720]  i appreciate your call god bless you morrison we're going to go to break and talk to james in
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:40.280]  hawaii chris in north carolina ryan in new york adam in arizona and others toll free number to

[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:53.640]  basic multi-city campaign does i'd put a giant blimp up there the problem is you go to the
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:58.920]  multi-nationals that have like the good year blimping stuff and they just say sorry we're not
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:04.360]  gonna let you do that because we love hillary in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a

[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:22.360]  you know, the closed captioning, you get to hear it in English. And she does a great translation,
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:27.160]  a very accurate translation from what I've heard from other Russian speakers who are also Americans.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:33.800]  And so I've got the full speech coming up where Putin warns of World War three and says, don't
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.880]  you know we're in great danger? Because I was watching the full speeches weekend and had forgotten
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.120]  to play the full thing. It was my fault. She done the full translation when I was up here working
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.200]  this weekend. I noticed that and she pointed it out later in the week. And then we have some other
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.040]  very, very important clips we're going to play after William Benny leaves us. But right now,
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.600]  let's go ahead and go to Brian in the beautiful state of Hawaii. Go ahead, sir.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:56:02.200]  Hi, thanks for fighting the good fight, you and your team. And I just have a brief, brief statement.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:09.000]  I think James Comey probably laid out just like Kerry Mason step by step by step,
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.040]  why she should have been convicted. And I think he did it on purpose. That's my opinion. I've
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.320]  talked to a lot of patriots around the country. I think that he thought she would be tied up in
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:23.320]  court system so well after the election. I just wondered what your opinion was on that.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.960]  Yeah, I got mad at him the first day. But I've been told by patriots that I know in government
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:32.840]  that look, Comey really believed me knows what's going on. And the word is that they were threatened
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:38.520]  to bring down the whole Justice Department and that he was basically threatened with a bunch of
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:44.360]  blackmail to go after agents, not him. Reportedly, he's clean, but that they would basically bring
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.280]  down the entire FBI. And so that's why he pretty much angrily went out there and listed everything
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:55.240]  of how horrible she was. But then said, I can't get prosecutors to do it, because the word we got
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.240]  from the White House sources is they are blackmailing them. And they're, I mean, they're
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.960]  threatening to go after people for stuff they didn't do too. So this is a war in the government,
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.760]  folks. This is a very serious time. So what your gut tells you, Brian is dead on.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:17.640]  Exactly. I think he wanted the American people to be the prosecution. And secondly, I love your
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:23.480]  show today about the corruption in the, and I have a way, I think we can probably at least
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:29.560]  monitor the polling agent and the people that I have a website. I won't say it on air. If you
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:33.000]  want it, you can keep me on. I don't care. I mean, we don't censor people. Just say the name of the
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:41.240]  website. Okay, it's exit poll army dot com exit poll army dot com. And what I want to do is
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:47.480]  find out exit polls are generally open about 12 hours, but teams of three patriots that want to go
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:55.800]  and register to be exit pollers at their polling stations. And then if it's so backward that she
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:02.040]  has 70% of the vote because it's fraud, and we have the opposite, we at least can hand the Trump
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:06.680]  camp and the American people some evidence. And that's what Trump's doing. I mean, I've told Trump
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:11.960]  and I've said it in reports. Look, please, sir, start organizing a defense for organizing a fight
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:16.760]  and he's doing it. So this is the fighter. This is total presidential material. We haven't had
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:21.560]  something like this in over 100 years. I mean, this is, this is something else. You know, they
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:28.520]  like it into Teddy Roosevelt or Andrew Jackson in big psychological pieces attacking him
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:32.120]  and the Washington Post. And you know what that is that he's like. And that's why they can't stand
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:37.640]  it. I mean, look, they liken him to kind of a mountain man, because for all the glitz and all
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.440]  the glamour, that's what Donald Trump is. We'll be back in 70 seconds. But by the way, there's
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:59:12.360]  nothing smarter than a mountain man. Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:24.280]  dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:40.240]  nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids that needs to do its healing work, you need to check out info wars team.com. Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:50.240]  And head over to info wars team.com. Your body will be very grateful on the web at info wars team.com. That's info wars team.com.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:38.240]  I remember about 18 years ago, there was a prospectus put out to the Pentagon for drones that would fly around with a face scan database that could even like look for criminals or also be weaponized and kill people. And so we wrote articles about it at infowars.com. And it's been a long time since we've done it.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:01:04.240]  And they had national news stories saying we were insane and it wasn't true. Drugsreport.com today. And it's mainstream news saying exactly that. The San Francisco Chronicle, drones that fly around for homeland security and face scan you and that are weaponized, you name it. I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:21.240]  I remember they tested out a hit piece on us about seven years ago. Now later on they were trying to keep drudge from linking to us because every time drudge would link to us, they were so scared of this information is so accurate getting out that they wanted to scare drudge away from linking to it.
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:36.240]  Of course, it just made drudge link to us more as drudge was doing his own research and knew we were doing real stuff. I mean, it's just great to see the enemy fail. But it's kind of scary to know there's drudge and info wars and then a few other outlets that are challenging the whole narrative successfully.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:51.240]  It's just, I want to see other folks pop up to get the full picture. And it's starting to happen. That's very, very exciting. Because I want to make myself obsolete, man. I don't like not be able to sleep at night because of the responsibility. I don't like, you know, this is not fun, folks.
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:56.240]  Let's talk to Chris in North Carolina. Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.240]  Hey Alex, love what you do.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.240]  Thank you.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:12.240]  Well, I first I have a point and it's about Ben Shapiro and Mark Mark Levy and those types who I term the enemy pundits within the Republican Party.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:19.240]  And here's the theme that I've noticed on our social media. They continuously discuss how crooked Hillary Clinton is.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:29.240]  And they continuously retweet articles about how bad Donald Trump is. They never mentioned the opening slot for the Supreme Court or the potential multiple.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:35.240]  Now, well, let me tell you, let me tell you what's going on. Okay. I mean, do you want to hear the absolute inside baseball? What's happened?
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.240]  Yes.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:40.240]  I mean, I have all the answers. I'm not bragging. I just really do.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.240]  Obviously, I know a lot of the top clear channel people because I've never been on clear channel, but I've been offered jobs there.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:50.240]  They put me on XM just because they were patriots, some of the high level, but not the top people.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:03:03.240]  Clear channel got partially bought out by Goldman Sachs subgroup and they now are calling their local host nationwide and they're telling people you won't have your contract renewed if you don't stop, you know, pushing Trump.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.240]  Now, Limbaugh is so powerful, he was still got a new contract this week despite that.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:11.240]  Sean Handy's been threatened at Fox. He's been threatened in the radio to stop it.
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:18.240]  And Mark Levin and all these other people have gone along with it and shame on them. And I don't want to get into fight with Mark Levin.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:25.240]  It's just, it's Glenn Beck's part of it too. And they're just cozyed up to the establishment, so shame on them.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:33.240]  And it's just crazy. It's horrible. And these guys are hedging their bets with the Republican establishment and I've never been part of that.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.240]  So, you know, that's why I'm all for Trump. Trump's the real deal.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:43.240]  But if Trump, if Trump wins, they're basically throwing their career away. They're going to be the next Dick Morrison.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:54.240]  Well, it's beyond that. This is about contracts and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others in a big multinational investment group have got taken over serious exam and part of Clear Channel.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:04:02.240]  Clear Channel's quasi bankrupt. I mean, they've taken it over. I mean, they're taking all the patriots off local radio.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.240]  I mean, I've had the local patriots telling me people that I know had top ratings. They've been on here 20 years.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:15.240]  And they said, yeah, I was in a meeting. They're going to take you off. You know, you got ratings and everything, but because they're going to put this quasi fake conservative show on.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:20.240]  I go, yeah, watch, you're going to be next. Two months later, it was them. They called, said, yeah, I was in the meeting.
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.240]  I basically could have shut up and backed off and I would have had my contract renewed.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:32.240]  I mean, this is going on all over the country, brother. They are taking over. They need me. Remember who came here last year? Matt Drudge.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:40.240]  He said they're coming out of the free speech next year and they're doing it. They just had a coup with Roger Ailes being taken out at Fox News.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:47.240]  So absolutely. But no, no, no, no. Listen, that's why you got to really come in people like Michael Savage.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:51.240]  Michael Savage had heat put on him to shut up and he didn't do it.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:05:02.240]  And Michael Savage tells the truth no matter what anybody does and so do I. So there's not many people that will do it. We will.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:31.240]  President Kahn voluntarily joined the military and fought radical Islamic terrorism and died the same kind of people that Mr. Kahn wants to bring into this country.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:38.240]  What do you stand for, Dakota Meyer? I do respect the things you've done, but this, this tweet is ridiculous.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:46.240]  And the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald Trump is completely and totally disgusting.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:53.240]  All of the military is watching this right now. Our eyes are open. What are you going to do? Are you going to do the right thing and take that down?
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:57.240]  Are you going to sit there and actually help out the most corrupt person ever?
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:20.240]  Hillary for prison, Joe Biggs, infowars.com and I'm pissed off.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:37.240]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:44.240]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SPI Jurex herbal processing technique.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:51.240]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:07:01.240]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:10.240]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:22.240]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse, so please listen. Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:42.240]  Amid no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun, whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:56.240]  The solar's worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for infowars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:12.240]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:27.240]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:47.240]  I'll tell you what shattered is Hillary Clinton's dreams to be El Presidente. If WikiLeaks head Julian Assange makes good on his claim that he's going to release information very, very soon that will cause Hillary to be indicted for sure.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:09:05.240]  He's normally pretty conservative about what he says. Now we had him on about a week and a half ago and then a few days after William Benny, former leader of the National Security Agency, the guy that actually ran it, not the political head, but the civilian general that actually ran it, famous code breaker,
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:19.240]  he went on Aaron Klein's show on WABC in New York with WorldNet Daily and Breitbart also picked it up and broke down the fact, NSA whistleblower agency has all of Clinton's deleted emails.
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:40.240]  And he's got some of the Snowden leaks here that have been made public that we're going to be going over today for radio listeners and TV viewers. Radio listeners will want to go to infowars.com forward slash show if you want to be able to see this presentation, not just listen to it.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:49.240]  But William Benny joins us, there's a new film coming out in a few months, a goodamerican.org, we have the trailer of that we're going to be playing, exposedfacts.org as well.
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:55.240]  He is the former technical leader of the intelligence with the NSA before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001.
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:15.240]  And he was SWAT team rated unanimant for going to Congress, which we're supposed to do, to talk about how they were illegally gathering citizens data. And he's been a great analyst helping the public with human research into exactly how high this power grab and this treason and this boondoggle goes.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.240]  So he joins us to discuss all this and more. Mr. Benny, thank you for coming on.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:30.240]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex. Wow. Well, I wish I would have asked the big question, but I'd like you to get back into it and flesh it out for us today as you've agreed to do.
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:43.240]  You know, proving for us, explaining to us exactly why you know as the guy that designed most of it, that indeed they do have all of Hillary's deleted 33,000 emails. William Benny.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:56.240]  You know, it's not really that they've hacked into the server or the DNC server or Hillary server. It's they've got they've got over in the United States in the Fairview program.
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:11.240]  They have over 100 taps on the fiber network in the United States. And they're doing just like Mark Klein exposed the one facility, one of the hundred in the San Francisco facility where they have nearest devices taking everything off the line.
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:20.240]  So that's what's going on. So to explain, they put gates in front of it and then copy it and scoop it all up before it ever gets where it's going.
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:30.240]  That's right. That's exactly right. As it passes down the line from all these service providers or all the telephone companies, they capture that as it's passing down the fiber network.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:41.240]  And the telecommunications companies are helping them do that. The ones that run the fibers, they allow them to come in and tap the thing. That's what that's what Mark Klein exposed in the AT&T facility in San Francisco.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:51.240]  But that's only one of the almost 100 that they have. And it captures 10 gigabits, tens of gigabits of data. So at each site.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:12:01.240]  So that means that's how they acquire the data. And then they're storing it in places like the Bluffdale facility that they had to build because they were collecting so much.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:13.240]  And now they're building another facility on Fort Me that's almost three times that size. It's 2.8 million square feet. So that's planning for the future because they're continuing to collect so much data on everybody.
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:26.240]  And then it goes into the databases inside NSA. And some of the material with the PRISM program and the NSA programs are all shown in that how PRISM data goes into it.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:35.240]  But it's also all other data, like off the upstream program, which are the fiber taps. All that data goes into the same programs internally in NSA.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:45.240]  And that drafts the data and indexes it so that people like the FBI and the CIA can go directly into those databases and pull information out.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:13:01.240]  So they've captured not just the data on Hillary, but on everybody else too. That's why I was calling this originally J. Edgar Hoover on super steroid because this gives them the ability to blackmail anybody.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:11.240]  William Benny is our guest former leader of the NSA, the guy that actually ran it, one of their top code breakers in history, according to even the NSA's fact pages.
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:21.240]  Mr. Benny, specifically on Hillary, folks are saying, and you've pointed out, hey, they've got copies of it. They grabbed it.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:38.240]  Obviously, other intelligence agencies have been closely watching her. Other governments were. Is there any estimation or guesstimation on how many agencies here or also foreign governments, corporations, you name it, would have been targeting her and scooping up the Secretary of State's data?
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:14:00.240]  Well, I mean, for governments, I mean, every government in the world would try to acquire data on her to the extent that they were able to do it. I would think certainly the most of the European countries, the Israel, Russia, China, I'm sure.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:09.240]  And we lost William Benny. That happens a lot when he's on with us. He says it happens a lot on other shows when he's doing shows. That dinner he's been under to visit us.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:20.240]  It's it's it's like a James Bond movie when you're sitting there going to have dinner with William Benny with your family. And you notice there's guys following you in. Mr. Benny, you're back. I'm sorry. Please continue.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:34.240]  I was just saying that virtually every advanced country in the world is probably looking at her and trying to find and get information on her. So I would think that probably on the order of 50 to 100 countries would be trying to tap into her data.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:47.240]  And obviously, as a Secretary of State and somebody who'd been involved in intelligence since she was in college, we now know there were CIA, her and Bill. She knows this. So why would she have a separate server? Why would she do something like this? I mean, it's crazy.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:58.240]  Well, if you're a if the type of if you're the type of person that likes to keep everything away from everybody and not have anybody know what you're doing, that's the kind of thing you do.
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:13.240]  If you're naive enough to think that you can do that in private, then you still do. Then that's the kind of thing you do. So I don't think she is technically as it, you know, indoctrinated or understands the technology that much.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:24.240]  And I think she wants to see from before I said I just say I thought she wanted to keep everything away from anybody, even in violation of the Records Act for the government.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:37.240]  Sure. And her former Obama's former head of the Environmental Protection Agency had to step down when she got caught with a gnome diploma and another server and a whole other parallel system she was using expanding on this.
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:51.240]  Mr. Benning, I've always thought a lot of people that are being charged with murder or other crimes, if they could use the NSA data to prove that they were indeed somewhere else when the government claimed they were another place.
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:16:01.240]  Do you think we're starting to see court challenges more and more where people are going to demand the NSA data for defenses in trial?
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:14.240]  It certainly should. I mean, even Senator Feinstein went back in 2013 when they were trying to unfund the NSA efforts, shortly after the initial Snowden releases.
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:27.240]  Senator Feinstein went on the floor of the Senate and said, speaking about the domestic spying program, she said, this is such a valuable program, we use it to put hundreds of people in jail every year.
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:37.240]  Well, I mean, how many thousands of people went to jail based on the NSA material, but was never told it was from NSA? Why? Because it's not admissible in the court of law.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:54.240]  So what they did was they did a parallel construction with the FBI or the federal agents did. They did a parallel construction to find data on them that would basically replicate the data from NSA and then substitute that in the court of law.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:06.240]  That's perjury, okay? That's also denying the defendant the right to discover or challenge discovery. And so all of those cases should be thrown out of court because of what they did.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:18.240]  And certainly, any future case could say there may be something in there. They could do a FOIA or a discovery type of request to find information about them to show that. Sure, absolutely.
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:33.240]  What is your knowledge of this new parallel system where Homeland Security, but also private corporations, but also local governments are in some cases, even in small jurisdictions buying up to 300 stingrays.
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:43.240]  For those that don't know, obviously, you know, Mr. Benny or small cell phone tower arrays that basically steal the data similar to Google cars that have been caught doing it worldwide.
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:53.240]  I mean, it seems to me not just government, but like a gold rush, an orgy of data theft by Fortune 100 tech companies, by local governments.
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:18:02.240]  I mean, this just sounds like Pandora's box has been opened. What is your view on what they're using all of these systems for?
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:15.240]  Well, I know in the case of the government, they have a program called Treasure Map. And part of the idea of the Treasure Map was to map every device on the network every minute of every day.
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:29.240]  That means phones, you know, your computers, servers, landline phones, satellite phones, everything, so that they want to know where everyone in the world is every minute of every day.
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:42.240]  And that's certainly the program is called Treasure Map One Word. And if your audience would like to Google it, all I have to do is Google NSA Space Treasure Map, and they'll get to read all about it.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:50.240]  And it is using various things like trace route and things like that to map the communications of everybody on the planet.
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:55.240]  And of course, we can thank Mr. Snowden for this. We might spend a minute on that, Mr. Benny.
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:02.240]  Yes, that's exactly where this data came from best. I mean, otherwise, we would not know.
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.240]  What do you make of Mr. Snowden? I think he's a hero.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:17.240]  I say he did an absolute, an absolutely public service for mostly everybody in the world.
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:25.240]  The problem is that when you see what should happen to him, well, he stole government property, so he should be indicted for stealing government property.
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:35.240]  But all these people who have violated the law put him in a position to make a decision about that, and that's coming out in his movie, too, that's coming up in Snowden.
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  It'll show you the dilemma he was in and the kind of things that he had to discuss.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:48.240]  Well, that's right. Let's give him six months for stealing some data, and then let's give the people that engage in mass architecture to overthrow the Republic.
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:50.240]  Let's charge them a treason.
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:55.240]  Right, exactly. That's exactly my view of it. It is treason against the founding principles of this country.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:56.240]  Damn right.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:00.240]  They are subverting the Constitution, scrapping it. There's a method to do that.
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:12.240]  If you want to change the Constitution, you put an amendment into the floor of the Congress, get them to pass it, then circulate it around the states for ratification, and if 75% of the states ratify it, you're in business.
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:18.240]  And let's expand on that. As you pointed out, for less than $20 million, I want you to recap this, sir.
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:23.240]  William Benning, former head of the NSA, joining us, former head of technical, former leaders, as they called it.
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:32.240]  They got that actually ran it. They're not, you know, not the Politico that ran around like Hayden. You look at this, and clearly, we're totally infiltrated by all sorts of foreign governments.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:39.240]  Hillary selling uranium to the Russians, giving them weapons secrets, but that's okay because, you know, she's got a political sign off.
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:42.240]  Meanwhile, they're saying Trump's a Russian agent because he doesn't want to have war with them.
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:49.240]  You've got all these special interests in here. We're totally penetrated by the Communist Chinese. They tell Hollywood what movies they can put out.
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:54.240]  There's so much data being grabbed that all these foreign interests are able to get into these data caches now.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:21:05.240]  And we're being penetrated as they, as you've talked about it years ago, but is now admitted by the amount of data we have, that all these spy grids actually is distributing all the data to allow it to be stolen.
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:09.240]  Clearly, the people doing this are the ones threatening our national security.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:27.240]  Yes. And, for example, one of the points I made on the Fox News when I was on there the other day, this attack that was used against the DNC server, for example, was a well-known attack previously used by Russian hackers.
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:43.240]  Well, if it's a well-known attack, that means many people know about it, and most of the, you know, services that you purchase to protect your networks should already have software to combat it and protect you against it, but they didn't.
[02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:55.240]  So, and part of the background is that NSA has two parts, the defense and offense. The offense likes to look into things to read what everybody's doing. The defense is supposed to protect us, right, from people looking in.
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:22:04.240]  Well, the problem is that if the offense finds a weakness in the system that allows them to look in, they won't tell the defense because they'll fix it.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:14.240]  And if they fix it, the window for the offense will close. See, so they have a vested interest in keeping that window open so they can see into what people are saying and doing.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:30.240]  Whereas the defense, being not aware of the weakness, doesn't fix it, so that leaves everybody out here, all of us. That's how OPM got hacked and all of them, all these hacks are coming in because they're all defenseless against this stuff.
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:38.240]  So, the point is, by doing that, everybody's exposed and vulnerable.
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:51.240]  Where do you see the situation going? Obviously, the Russians aren't the only technically competent country. I think you mentioned there's at least 50 or more nations that are very competent, maybe 100.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:23:01.240]  I mean, just to always blame the Russians, the Russians castly took credit for exposing the UN hack where they were hiding the decline of temperature and then, you know, to push a carbon tax.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:09.240]  So, I say if the Russians are exposing fraud by the UN, more power to them. I hope hackers expose Russian fraud and vice versa, Japanese fraud, American fraud.
[02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:23.240]  I mean, if it's fraud, changing the subject from the hacker away from the fraud, it's like saying, well, Hillary sent people to attack Trump rallies, dresses Bernie Sanders supporters, but maybe the Russians did it.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:35.240]  Look, I don't care. It's about the information, but separately, talking to a lot of sources, I wanted to ask you this. There's overwhelming evidence that we've got good people as contractors, not just Snowden, and good people in the military.
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:43.240]  I mean, if 90% of the military that I talked to, Mr. Benny, is awake to what's happening and against this whole police state and against Hillary Clinton.
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:54.240]  And if almost all the police I talked to and federal agents, you name it, from Secret Service to FBI, are mainly libertarians. They're bipartisan. They're not Republican or Democrat.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:24:05.240]  They're upset about the state of the country. Then it's not fair to just always attribute it to the Russians when I think there's a lot of evidence pointing towards corporate leaks, government leaks here domestically.
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:14.240]  Can you speak to the providence of these leaks and where you think they're coming from? And could they be coming from the U.S. intelligence community or an ally?
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:27.240]  Yes. And one of the things that really concerns me is there's a lot of people in here who don't think very well of the Russians and would like to use them to start a second Cold War.
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:37.240]  Because, especially in the military-industrial complex, because that means trillions of dollars of business over time. I mean, there's an awful lot of money.
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:48.240]  They have an opportunity to gain if they can start a second Cold War. So I think you need to be skeptical of our military-industrial complex.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:25:00.240]  That's what President Eisenhower warned us about in 1961 when he was leaving office. He warned us about this. And these are the kinds of things that motivate them is the opportunity to make more money.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:06.240]  And if they can keep these perpetual wars going, that's the thing that helps them make money.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:20.240]  So, you know, I just see that the commercial companies are so embedded and vested interest that they have a motive to direct things a certain way.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:28.240]  Well, Mr. Benny, former leader of the NSA, isn't that the trillion-pound elephant in the room that we think about Russians or Chinese?
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:36.240]  And sure, they're doing stuff. We need to watch them. But what about multinational corporations that are bigger than most governments that just drift around?
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:45.240]  They're doing stuff for the Russians, the Chinese, us, South Africans, the UK. I mean, that's who should be watched and no one's even looking at them.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:51.240]  Yeah, that's right. And they're all set up to fleece everybody of every penny they can get.
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:58.240]  And destroy our sovereignty. Yeah, start a war with the Russians to sell more weapons. They'll be nowhere to spend the damn money.
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:07.240]  In fact, since you mentioned that, one of the top Russian scholars in the United States, I mean, it's undisputed, Stephen Cohen shuts down CNN host.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:14.240]  And again, this guy heads up the entire department at a major university. Here he is on CNN talking about this new Cold War.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:18.240]  And this guy's not even a Trump supporter, but he's telling it like it is. Here's that clip.
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:24.240]  Professor Cohen, does Vladimir Putin indeed have a dog in our U.S. fight?
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:33.240]  Vladimir Putin wants to end the new Cold War, and so do I. Let me say I have no ties to the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign.
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:41.240]  But if I were to write your headline for you today, I tried on the way down here. I couldn't fit it on the front page, but it would go like this.
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:50.240]  We're in a new and more dangerous Cold War with Russia. We're approaching a Cuban missile crisis nuclear confrontation with Russia,
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:27:01.240]  both along Russia's borders and possibly over Syria. There is absolutely no discussion, no debate about this in the American media, including, forgive me, on CNN.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:12.240]  Then along comes unexpectedly Donald Trump, who says something that suggests he wants to end the new Cold War, cooperate with Russia in various places.
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:28.240]  What we used to call detente. And now, astonishingly, the media is full of what only can be called Neo-McCarthy-eyed charges that he's a Russian agent, that he's a Manchurian candidate, that he's Putin's client.
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:37.240]  So the real danger is what's being done to our own political process. This is the moment when there should be, in a presidential year, a debate.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:46.240]  Because Mrs. Clinton's position on Russia seems to be very different, has been a long time. Trump speaks elliptically. You've got to piece together what he says.
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:54.240]  But he seems to want a new American policy toward Russia. And considering the danger, I think we as American citizens deserve that debate.
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:59.240]  And not what will be given in the media today, including on the front page of the New York Times.
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:12.240]  I end by saying that these reckless branding of Trump as a Russian agent, most of it is coming from the Clinton campaign, and they really need to stop.
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:20.240]  All right. That's a liberal, by the way, and he's Princeton, NYU. I mean, there you go, William Benning.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:25.240]  Yeah, I pretty much agree with all of what he was saying there. I mean, the whole idea...
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:31.240]  By the way, you're a guy credited, you don't want to brag. You broke the Russian codes, you helped defeat them, and they gave you secret medals.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.240]  I don't even want to talk about this, but I mean, you've fought the Russians. You're not some Russian spy.
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:45.240]  No, in fact, but if you look at the situation, what's happening, so actually we started and initiated certain things that made them react the way they did.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:52.240]  I mean, we actually had a bloodless coup that we initiated or assisted in the Ukraine.
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:58.240]  And then we tried to move NATO into the Ukraine when we had a verbal agreement with the Russians before that, that we wouldn't do that.
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:05.240]  And we broke the perestroika deal to let, you know, as long as they didn't expand back, we wouldn't expand exactly.
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:13.240]  Exactly, yeah. And so what that meant was we were treating them like a threat, and so they started acting like one.
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:15.240]  But let's not be confused.
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:18.240]  Yeah, when you move nuclear cruise missiles up to somebody's border, they start getting upset.
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:22.240]  Yeah, and let's not be confused. They didn't start this. We did.
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:28.240]  Come at the powers, and a bunch of weirdo women have never been in the military started it.
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:35.240]  And it's not that I'm against women, but it really is. It smells of Armageddon when you got a bunch of weird women and liberals hopping around, messing with the Russians.
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:41.240]  It's just, I mean, Napoleon got his ass kicked, started Hitler, and they were warriors. You people are a joke.
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:49.240]  Do 10 more minutes with William Benning, then I've got an in-depth report with Putin basically saying we're moving towards nuclear war and new clips coming up.
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:51.240]  William Benning's our guest. Stay with us.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:30:12.240]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:30.240]  Breed suggested that it would be risky to divulge classified information pertaining to national security to Trump, so it should just be faked.
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:36.240]  Even more incredulous is the fact that Reed is the one accusing Trump of being, quote, dangerous.
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:41.240]  Trump is due to receive intelligence briefings in the coming weeks as is Clinton.
[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:48.240]  It is standard procedure for both candidates to have limited updates so they're somewhat prepared to take office when the time comes.

[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:42.240]  Hey, I grew up watching the Boston Celtics. My mom was a big fan of it. My dad was a fan of it.
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:44.240]  Play the Lakers.
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:56.240]  I grew up at Dallas Cowboy Football Games, sometimes in the second row. I like sports as much as the next person.
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:08.240]  But when it comes to defending our Second Amendment, our First Amendment, our sovereignty, when it comes to having the president not be able to just open the borders up and ignore the Supreme Court, that's the real fight.
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:12.240]  That's the good fight for what it comes down to.
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:18.240]  And my heroes are inventors. They're trailblazers. They're honorable people.
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:28.240]  They're folks that tell the truth like William Benny, who could have gone and worked for private industry and made 20 times the money he was making as the equivalent of a one-star general running the NSA.
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:36.240]  And he doesn't want to be talked about or praised, but the guy is a hero. I mean, he went to Congress for years, briefed them about the criminal activity going on.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:42.240]  He resigned, and then they swat teamed him in his house for intimidation purposes. He didn't back off.
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:50.240]  Then he didn't ever talk about it, but then he went through a lot of other stuff that happened, and someday maybe he'll talk about it.
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:56.240]  But the point is, is that there are a lot of people out there putting their whole lives in the line just so we have basic freedoms.
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:14.240]  And this spying does not keep us safe. This spying does not protect the public interest. It's used by special interests to rob us and to make hundreds of billions of dollars while they selectively enforce laws and while they take over our civilization.
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:26.240]  A GoodAmerican.org is the website for the film coming out in September. I want to play the trailer for A GoodAmerican. It's a documentary. We also have the Snowden film coming out, of course, with Oliver Stone.
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:34.240]  But here is the trailer for that, and we're going to go back to William Benny, former technical leader for Intelligence with the NSA.
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:45.240]  Recapping now for you once again an explosion underground in the garage section of the World Trade Center in New York City.
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:52.240]  The first attack on the Trade Center in 93 was the first thing that woke everybody up in terms of the threat of terrorism.
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:59.240]  We said this is not a one-time event. There is a larger movement here, and they're planning on doing more.
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:09.240]  The terrorists were burying themselves inside the ballooning communications network in the Internet and the phones, and so we had to figure out who was communicating with whom and who were the terrorists.
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:12.240]  And that was the whole idea of the Thin Threat program.
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:17.240]  Of all the analysts, Bill was by far the most astute.
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:22.240]  He was the person in the agency who knew the most about metadata.
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:31.240]  It was pretty clear that we were building the most powerful analysis tool that had been developed in history to monitor basically the entire world.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:38.240]  This little research organization had the keys to NSA's future.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:44.240]  We let it run 24 to 36 hours. We discovered critical intelligence that had never been discovered by NSA.
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:47.240]  NSA's response completely shut the program down.
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.240]  Does anybody even recognize what they have?
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:57.240]  Oh my God, the whole tower collapsed. It is gone.
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:02.240]  We would have caught the people. 9-11 would have been avoided.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:10.240]  They're taking data on every U.S. citizen in the country. That's not compatible with a democracy. It's like the Stasi on super steroids.
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:11.240]  What's wrong with this future?
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:16.240]  9-11 is a gift to NSA. We're going to get all the money we need and then some.
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:20.240]  It wasn't about making money, it was about protecting the country and the free world.
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:25.240]  We just find where the skeletons are, capture it all, and then bury the report as deep as possible.
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:27.240]  The FBI decided to raid four people.
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.240]  Fabricated evidence to get a warrant. They were after all the material that was related to thin thread.
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:38.240]  It was the largest failure in NSA history.
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:43.240]  I go to America. I'm South of September. I go to american.org.
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:48.240]  And I've studied this in depth. We'll get William Benny's final comments on this, but here's the bottom line.
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.240]  You spend chicken feed by targeted profiling.
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:59.240]  Where you target, you get total results and shut basically every criminal down.
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:03.240]  Every terrorist down. Every organized terrorist down.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:07.240]  Every premeditated murder one. You could stop it.
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:14.240]  But they don't want that because the globalists are busy backing many of the jihadis.
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:20.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, no, instead, they spy on all of us using the outside jihadi threat as a pretext.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.240]  And then all it is is political targeted garbage.
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:30.240]  William Benny is the former national leader of the national security agency exposed facts.org.
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:37.240]  Great right. Some of his articles a good american.org is the site for the film.
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:42.240]  It's one more than 20 major number one film awards at film festivals.
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:46.240]  But just like we promoted the nation's film, I have no financial link to it.
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:48.240]  It just exposes how evil Hillary is.
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:53.240]  Everyone in this film comes out and theaters needs to see it because I've talked to people that have seen the film.
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:56.240]  I haven't seen it yet. They say it's staggeringly powerful.
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.240]  So, Mr. Benny, I want to salute you for your courage.
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:03.240]  And again, in the beginning of patriots, a scarce man hated fear and scorn in time.
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:08.240]  When his cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot to quote Mark Twain.
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.240]  But I mean, I know you're just a guy trying to defend the country. You're like a sheepdog.
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.240]  But we really appreciate everything you've done.
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:26.240]  Well, thank you very much. I just feel that I'm doing what a citizen and someone who's signed up to protect and defend the Constitution should do.
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:31.240]  I mean, that's really the duty of a citizen of a democracy.
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:38.240]  If this country, anyway, we are to protect and defend the Constitution, that's what our leaders in Washington are not doing.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:42.240]  They're scrapping it in secret and they're lying to us about it.
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:48.240]  Now, you're a humble man, but I want you to spend five minutes because we reach millions an hour.
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:55.240]  And I want to take this clip and put it into rotation on the show so 28 million people in the next week see it.
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:04.240]  Five minutes. What are the keys for folks to know to understand what do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners, Mr. Benny?
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:10.240]  Well, I think the main thing I wanted to impart to everybody is that the government is not telling us the truth.
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:16.240]  They've been lying from the beginning saying that you had to trade privacy for security and that's been a lie from the beginning.
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:28.240]  There was always an alternative approach that we were working on back in the 1990s and it was running by 2000 and they killed it because it didn't cost enough money.
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:38.240]  Their motive is more about money and building an empire rather than protecting people and doing the functions that they're supposed to to protect the nation and people's lives.
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:48.240]  So they're continuing, there's so many people in the Congress and leadership especially, and in some of the courts, the FISA court for sure,
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:56.240]  and of course the administration, including the Department of Justice, the NSA, FBI and CIA as well as the White House,
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:04.240]  all of them are involved in this, they're all covering up for each other and ensuring that nobody gets exposed because of one of them is they all are.
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:14.240]  So they're trying to protect themselves in that way. And the basic point is if they did something right, they could save lives and they're not doing that.
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:22.240]  So they're basically trading the security of everyone in the country and the free world and in fact the world for money.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:38.240]  And their whole, I view their vision statement as keep the problem going so the money keeps flowing. And that seems to be exactly what they've been doing, not just in the terrorist area but also in the cybersecurity area.
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:47.240]  And now they're trying to start, in my view, another cold war so they can make more money, puremongering everybody, into fleecing them out of money.
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:56.240]  That's really the bottom line of what they've been doing and they've been doing that basically for the last 20 years at least.
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  And Mr. Benny, clearly I was against just random wars with Muslim countries but they're overthrowing moderates, putting radicals in and then bringing radicals in.
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:19.240]  So they attack and then when they attack, they can declare civil emergencies in Germany and France and take nationalist rights away to criticize their open borders. I mean, it's so transparent the Hegelian dialect they're using.
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:30.240]  Yeah, that's right. And the whole point is if you destabilize things, it'll only get worse and then you can use that as a way of fearmongering people into being submissive and doing what they're told.
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:38.240]  That's fundamentally what our government's been doing and we've been spreading this concept around the world, metastasizing it like a militancy does, you know.
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:44.240]  Around the world, the British have joined us and the Germans and others around the world have also joined.
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:48.240]  And even the Russians now are starting to have their own program like this.
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:59.240]  So we're infecting the entire world, not just democracies but also semi-totalitarian states also to adopt the kinds of things that we've been initiating.
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:03.240]  America leading the world into 1984.
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:14.240]  William Benning enclosing specifically on Hillary. I know you're nonpartisan, but a woman that would have a secret server lie about it, be caught, get away with it, all the foreign interests.
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:18.240]  I'm so concerned about blackmail. Think of what we don't know.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:24.240]  You know, just any other data on the issue of the fact that the NSA has her emails?
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:37.240]  Well, I think the NSA certainly has a motive to not want to deal with her very simply because she exposed what is called gamma material in NSA.
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:42.240]  And that's basically the most sensitive data that they work with.
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:46.240]  There's very compartmented and very restricted knowledge.
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:58.240]  And they had several officials of NSA talking openly to reporters from the Observer for their article back in March of this year talking about this gamma material,
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:03.240]  lifted directly out of gamma reporting, whole paragraphs, and plugged into her emails.
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:11.240]  Well, these emails are passed around to people who aren't cleared and managed by people who aren't cleared and put on servers that aren't secure.
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:17.240]  And so this basically compromised the fact that we were reading certain systems.
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:25.240]  The last gamma program that I remember being compromised was by Jack Anderson in 1971,
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:34.240]  and he compromised the fact that we were reading the encrypted phones in the limousines of all the leadership in the Soviet Union,
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:36.240]  Brezhnev, Kosig and all of them.
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:46.240]  And so once he compromised that, that all stopped and went away, but it also gave away a lot of the technical capacity.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:50.240]  He starts talking about technical capacity cuts out.
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:57.240]  So much of an implication in terms of the ability for NSA to proceed and work on and actually have improved intelligence.
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:00.240]  I mean, you can't have leaders who do that kind of thing.
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:01.240]  I mean, you just can't.
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.240]  I mean, they'll cripple your entire intelligence program.
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:12.240]  Well, I know you can't get into classification, but the way you describe it is you had a very inexpensive program that targeted terrorists,
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:16.240]  targeted groups that were calling for violence, and we just lost him.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:18.240]  So it just happens.
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:20.240]  William Benning talks about his phone works great.
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.240]  Anybody anywhere else?
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:22.240]  He goes on shows.
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:23.240]  It's just hammered hell.
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:24.240]  I'm getting back on.
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:25.240]  I want to finish this.
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:27.240]  They cannot stand this coming out.
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:28.240]  Let me just tell you my phones.
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:34.240]  Can you imagine talking about gamma material or world leader material or change material or leader material?
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.240]  Can you imagine when I'm on the phone with, you know, who?
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:40.240]  When I'm on the phone with other people?
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.240]  I mean, it's just like, it's like I'm talking to an audience of 500 people.
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.240]  I don't have computers recording when I say, I mean, I do.
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:50.240]  I got people listening.
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.240]  I've even had the bastards over the years sometimes pop in, you know, little smart ass comments and things.
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:58.240]  And so imagine you're like sitting here with your phone.
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:06.240]  There's private agencies and foreign governments and corporate groups and agencies all tuning in.
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:08.240]  Don't you people have?
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:10.240]  Mr. Benning, we've been having a lot of problems with your line today.
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:12.240]  I know you've gone through some censorship.
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:14.240]  Just I appreciate your time, sir.
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.240]  Thank you for everything.
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:17.240]  You were trying to finish up a point you were making.
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:27.240]  Yeah, I was just, I was just saying that you can't really afford to have leadership that that compromise with the ability and sources and means and methods for intelligence production.
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:31.240]  If you do, you simply have no intelligence system.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:43.240]  Well, I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you create a giant, panopticonic system where everybody's spying on everybody and then it seems like you've created a Swiss cheese system that gives you the opposite of security.
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:44.240]  Yes.
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:47.240]  And in fact, it, well, it gets, it makes it also makes everybody dysfunctional.
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.240]  They can't trust one another so they can't work together.
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:54.240]  So, you know, it's another, it's another catch 22.
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:56.240]  Another attack on humanity.
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:58.240]  William Benny, the film, I can't wait to see it.
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:00.240]  A good American.org.
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:03.240]  Thank you so much for your time again, because you got caught off earlier.
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:04.240]  Any other points?
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:07.240]  You're just bottom line saying, look, the NSA has Hillary's emails.
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:10.240]  Well, why don't we just call for a lawsuit or something?
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:11.240]  I mean, these are public emails.
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:12.240]  The FBI wants them.
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:14.240]  Can't we just call for the FBI?
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:17.240]  Should we call for the FBI to ask the NSA to release them?
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:20.240]  You see, the FBI didn't have to ask them.
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:21.240]  They already have access to them.
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:23.240]  Oh, talk about that, please.
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:29.240]  Yeah, well, that's the, that's the direct access that they have into the NSA database.
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:31.240]  And there's no oversight of that at all.
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:45.240]  That's how Feinstein's say they used it to put the hundreds of people in jail because the FBI and the DEA and others law enforcement were going in there, pulling that data out, using it to direct their people to arrest people.
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:52.240]  I mean, that's, that's been one of the violations of the Constitution and of legal, of the entire legal structure.
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:48:00.240]  So it's not just, it's not just, it's not just the DEA that has access to the FBI.
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:02.240]  Oh, it's more than that.
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:18.240]  Here, here, the DEA specifically has a special unit, the Special Operations Division, the SOD, and it composed members of the DHS, the CIA, FBI, NSA, of course, and IRS.
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.240]  So, so all of those people have direct, direct access.
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:29.240]  The IRS that, I mean, Nixon got impeached basically over having a list of 120 people, he might audit.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.240]  The IRS is in the illegal NSA database.
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:34.240]  Yes.
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:35.240]  Wow.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.240]  They're supposedly looking for money laundering and financial fraud.
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:43.240]  That is people avoiding tax.
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:44.240]  Sure.
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:46.240]  Putting accounts overseas and so on.
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.240]  But whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment?
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:49:03.240]  Yeah, well, I mean, I maintain they used it to go after the Tea Party, religious groups trying to get politically active, the Occupy Group, anybody who is politically active that they didn't particularly want them doing what they were doing, they'd use this data to do that.
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:04.240]  Wow.
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:16.240]  Well, I also say, and I think that they used this data against the Elliott Spitzer because he was going after the Wall Street bankers for the frauding people in the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis.
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:23.240]  No, I've got to say that there's few things I disagree with some of my guests on, but some of them are, can I anti-Elliot Spitzer?
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:25.240]  And I'm just like, Elliott Spitzer did a good thing.
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:27.240]  And who cares that he was seeing a hooker?
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:29.240]  Yes, that's right.
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  It's so clear that the FBI was targeting him and everything he was doing.
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:34.240]  Yeah.
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:35.240]  And what was their probable cause?
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:38.240]  The only thing I could think of was he's going after the bankers.
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:39.240]  We have to protect them.
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:40.240]  That's probable cause.
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:43.240]  So you think parallel construction was going on there?
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:45.240]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:46.240]  All right.
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:48.240]  Well, Mr. Benny, thank you so much.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:50.240]  This was the most incredible interview we've ever done.
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:51.240]  We've got a minute till break.
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:53.240]  Anything else you'd like to put out?
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:50:00.240]  No, except that this entire process of spying, unless we start standing up and saying, look, you got to stop this stuff.
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:04.240]  I mean, we're going to lose whatever we think we have as a democracy.
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:11.240]  Right now, they've married the secret agencies, the secret intelligence agencies with the police, and we've got a secret police.
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:16.240]  So, you know, it's heading down this very slippery path to a very bad outcome.
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:18.240]  You're talking about the threat fusion centers?
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:19.240]  Yes.
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:28.240]  Well, and also all the police organizations that are involved in interrogating all this data that NSA has collected and using it against people.
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:30.240]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.240]  Whoever you give this godlike power, it's going to become corrupting.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:36.240]  I mean, come on, folks, we shouldn't turn this loose.
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:37.240]  It's bad.
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:38.240]  We should get rid of it.
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:39.240]  We should curtail it.
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:46.240]  We should go back to a system like you said that's targeted outside or targeted against people that show some evidence of being involved in something.
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:48.240]  Bill Benny, let me say bye to you in the break.
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:49.240]  You're a hero.
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  And we should put out baseball cards with you on it.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.240]  I bless you, my friend.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.240]  Thank you.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:55.240]  The film coming out of Good American coming out in September.
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:56.240]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:57.240]  Thank you.
[02:50:57.240 --> 02:50:58.240]  Some more clips, more calls.
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:27.240]  Stay with us on our shows.
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:29.240]  We'll see you in the next one.
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:01.240]  Code 1-1-5-1.
[02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:30.240]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:33.240]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:52:33.240 --> 02:52:35.240]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:40.240]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:47.240]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners.
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:48.240]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:50.240]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:52.240]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:56.240]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:58.240]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:01.240]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:04.240]  Today, I became a biophoton woman.
[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:09.240]  I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:12.240]  and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m.
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:14.240]  Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day.
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:17.240]  But today, I felt energy and very clear.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:19.240]  My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on.
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:24.240]  She said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:29.240]  Normally, there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant.
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:31.240]  She said, I want some.
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:37.240]  A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful, abundant energy.
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:41.240]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt.
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:46.240]  The combination of one-world-way and five-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life.
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:50.240]  The kind that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus.
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:52.240]  And I'm 64.
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:55.240]  Seed oil in one-world-way for your fantastic health.
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:54:24.240]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:30.240]  If humans set up our system about preying on fellow humans, we're going to fall.
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:39.240]  We base it on reassociation and not being jealous of people that are better than us or smarter than us.
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:43.240]  We're going to go to the stars.
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:48.240]  But there is a race consciousness of the species and everything it's been through.
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:50.240]  And I'm not going to piss on that.
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:52.240]  That's what I'm committed to.
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:56.240]  By the way, that's where all the strength is.
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:54:57.240]  Everything is there.
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:00.240]  So you fools that don't join this are idiots.
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:03.240]  You're not experiencing anything that God had in store.
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:05.240]  Let's go to the special report and back to your phone calls.
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:07.240]  Here it is.
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:11.240]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:20.240]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries.
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.240]  One of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:28.240]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged.
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:30.240]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:32.240]  And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged.
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:33.240]  I have to be honest.
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:37.240]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.240]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  But what?
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:45.240]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:51.240]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump,
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:54.240]  you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:56:03.240]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this democratic party.
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:04.240]  It is going to rig.
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:07.240]  The political parties choose their nominee and that's the general public.
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:09.240]  That's very popular belief.
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:11.240]  Then why am I holding the primaries?
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:13.240]  That's a very good question.
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:17.240]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.240]  exactly the words, Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously,
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they're being done.
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:32.240]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:34.240]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:38.240]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:39.240]  And guess what there is?
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:41.240]  She stole the nomination.
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:43.240]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:45.240]  What does that mean?
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:47.240]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:48.240]  Today is the day.
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:52.240]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:55.240]  He now looks increasingly like the kamikaze candidate.
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:56.240]  An implosion.
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:58.240]  The likes of which I have never seen.
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.240]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:18.240]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas,
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  that's ridiculous.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:20.240]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:31.240]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:33.240]  There must be a response of good.
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:37.240]  But if good is sleepwalking, you'll never even know there was a fight.
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:39.240]  If you're awake, we will win.
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:41.240]  We always do.
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:46.240]  But I can tell you with the weapons that have been put on this planet by the devil himself,
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:51.240]  by the systems that have been set up, if we lose this fight, it's the beginning of the end.
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:54.240]  We're going to go to break, come back and take a few phone calls.
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:58:06.240]  But I just hope people that are arrogant like Obama really look into eternity and realize that the God of this world has given them power for a reason
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:10.240]  because they're carrying out a plan of destruction.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:16.240]  And Obama, you're not as evil as the controllers above you.
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:20.240]  You know deep in your heart, you're going to lose your soul doing this.
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:22.240]  And there's still time for you to turn back.
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:25.240]  Hillary is turned over to it.
[02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:27.240]  She's committed the ultimate sin.
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:28.240]  She's gone.
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:29.240]  There's no one left.
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:33.240]  Obama, there may still be something left for you.
[02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:35.240]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:40.240]  We're going to end this weekend with free shipping on all items.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:42.240]  And big discounts like 40% off on Brain Force.
[02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:43.240]  Take advantage of that.
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:45.240]  Back in 70.
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:51.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:53.240]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:54.240]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:56.240]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:58:56.240 --> 02:58:59.240]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:00.240]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:01.240]  I've been working all day.
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:04.240]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:59:04.240 --> 02:59:06.240]  I get in here at 8.30.
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:07.240]  I was kind of run down.
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:09.240]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:11.240]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:13.240]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:14.240]  I popped two of them.
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:16.240]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing.
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:18.240]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:20.240]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:21.240]  People really love it.
[02:59:21.240 --> 02:59:22.240]  Read about it.
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:25.240]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:31.240]  Because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:33.240]  I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while.
[02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:35.240]  I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:37.240]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:39.240]  Took three hours of sleep, got up.
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:41.240]  Took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:59:41.240 --> 02:59:46.240]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[02:59:46.240 --> 02:59:50.240]  or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:56.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:56.240 --> 02:59:58.240]  I can't believe this anymore.
[02:59:58.240 --> 02:59:59.240]  This is getting too crazy.
[02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:02.240]  I'm sure night will play it.
[03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:16.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:19.240]  From the epicenter of the resistance.
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:25.240]  Because we've spiritually chosen this fight.
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:28.240]  Because we see the enemy.
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:32.240]  Storiesuponinfowars.com right now, it's incredible.
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:34.240]  We're getting the video right now.
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:36.240]  Hillary's having a total mental meltdown.
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:42.240]  It's so important that everybody basically hope and pray that she falls and her evil side be shown.
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:45.240]  Go to camera 3, I can show folks.
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:49.240]  Bizarre Hillary calls Trump her husband.
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.240]  Bill Clinton comes to her mind when Hillary says opponent.
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:01:00.240]  We've got the other clip we've got ready of Hillary raise taxes on the middle class from KETV7.
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.240]  Let's play that clip first.
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:13.240]  Because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich.
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:20.240]  Well, we're not going there, my friends.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:25.240]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class,
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:29.240]  and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:31.240]  I should have been playing that all day.
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:33.240]  I want to play it every 10 seconds.
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:35.240]  I hope not plays it five times coming up.
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:38.240]  That should be folks.
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:44.240]  This is how she bamboozles her viewers, her supporters, her listeners, her slaves.
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:50.240]  Trump wants to cut the corporate tax so that they're forced to bring the money back here.
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:55.240]  When they raise major corporations lobbied to make foreign corporations move offshore
[03:01:55.240 --> 03:02:00.240]  so they could direct the investment to China, India, Mexico, and 100 plus other countries.
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:02.240]  Plus, 160 plus.
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:03.240]  It's social engineering.
[03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:10.240]  Trump wants to lower it to the lowest so they'll move the damn jobs back here.
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:17.240]  If she gets up there to these poor, poor people and goes, I'm not going to let that happen.
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:20.240]  She looks like the seahag from Popeye.
[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:21.240]  Holy Toledo.
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:24.240]  Have we been able to grab the next clip here yet?
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:25.240]  Let's play it.
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:26.240]  This is as he gets worse.
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:28.240]  Thank God is cursing her.
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:29.240]  Let her get into office.
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:31.240]  I'm telling you, she's going to die.
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:32.240]  I can feel it.
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:33.240]  God's going to strike her down.
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:34.240]  I'm serious.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:35.240]  This is epic.
[03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:36.240]  The woman is a goddamn demon.
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:37.240]  Here it is.
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:44.240]  I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:46.240]  Play that again.
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:47.240]  What a creeperzide.
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:49.240]  What a freak show.
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:53.240]  I would go to the other side of the street and not to walk by her.
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:03:04.240]  Of course, I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:05.240]  Man.
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:06.240]  I'm out of time.
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:07.240]  I have a lot of phones.
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:08.240]  I apologize, I haven't got to you.
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:13.240]  David Knight may want to punch you out of the calls or take him where everyone's due.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:15.240]  We live in a very, very historic moment at this point.
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:18.240]  David's about to come to the studio and take over.
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  I'm just glad I'm not with these people.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:22.240]  I should have been playing that all day long.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.240]  We're going to raise taxes in the middle of the class.
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:28.240]  Obama already did.
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:31.240]  And they got rid of all these loopholes that weren't loopholes.
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:38.680]  Like if I build a new studio for $300,000, I have to pay tax on it like I own it.
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:39.680]  I don't own it.
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:43.800]  The dang is a giant bowling ball around my neck.
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:51.680]  You think having employees and having a building and having all this crap is a asset?
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:56.040]  I couldn't sell this stuff in here for $50,000.
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:57.400]  There is no market for it.
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:58.800]  There's no market to hire people.
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:02.960]  There's no market to actually build things in this country.
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:06.520]  But oh my gosh, I'm so rich, I owe this money.
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:11.600]  Yeah, if I wanted a private jet, I can write the whole damn thing off, but not a building,
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:12.600]  not hiring people.
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:17.600]  They've got the whole thing set up to shut this economy down.
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:19.320]  That's why I say you've got to go against the system.
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:23.280]  You've got to buy tons of our products, the t-shirts, the books, the nutraceuticals, free
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:26.480]  shipping ends this weekend, ends on Sunday.
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:31.960]  Because then I can somehow swim upstream like a crazy salmon, pass the Kodiak Bears, and
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:34.080]  actually get the ball in the basket here.
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:35.080]  And I'm not complaining.
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:36.080]  We're kicking ass.
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:38.760]  It's just that I can't imagine the average person trying to deal with this.
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:40.800]  It's designed to make you give up.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:47.800]  It is designed the inspectors and the harassers and then they have this attitude when they
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:49.600]  show up like you've done something wrong.
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:55.120]  I mean, it's just like all I'm trying to do is just not have nuclear war, and it brings
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:56.520]  your hotties in.
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:57.520]  David Knight's coming up.
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:04:58.520]  Stay with us.
[03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:06.560]  An article up at the Washington Post, wearing, don't tread on me, insignia could be punishable,
[03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:07.800]  racial harassment.
[03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:12.600]  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as F-A-G, among its other functions
[03:05:12.600 --> 03:05:17.400]  decides hostile work environment, harassment claims brought against federal agencies.
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:22.760]  On January 8, 2014, a complaint filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:29.080]  on the basis of race in the fall of 2013, a co-worker repeatedly war capped to work
[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:34.440]  with insignia of the Gadsden flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the face, don't tread
[03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:35.440]  on me.
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:39.640]  Complainting stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans
[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:44.920]  because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[03:05:44.920 --> 03:05:48.280]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden flag originated
[03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:52.240]  in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context.
[03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:53.240]  Boom!
[03:05:53.240 --> 03:05:54.240]  Facts!
[03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:55.240]  Boom!
[03:05:55.240 --> 03:05:56.240]  Liberals down!
[03:05:56.240 --> 03:06:00.040]  This has been Joe Biggs, serving you some information at Infowars.com.
[03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:01.040]  Enjoy!
[03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:03.520]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:06:03.520 --> 03:06:05.560]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:08.440]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:14.480]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.440]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:24.400]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[03:06:24.400 --> 03:06:29.520]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[03:06:29.520 --> 03:06:31.240]  you can to purify your air.
[03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:36.240]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:39.240]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:41.440]  The general public doesn't.
[03:06:41.440 --> 03:06:45.400]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:49.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:52.560]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:55.760]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:06:55.760 --> 03:07:00.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:07:00.520 --> 03:07:06.640]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:10.120]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:07:10.120 --> 03:07:11.120]  Here's why.
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:15.040]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:07:15.040 --> 03:07:19.640]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:24.320]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and
[03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:26.040]  produce electricity from the sun.
[03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:30.960]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[03:07:30.960 --> 03:07:33.360]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:36.040]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:07:36.040 --> 03:07:40.640]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:45.200]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:47.280]  price for Infowars listeners.
[03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:49.000]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:52.440]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:56.280]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:07:56.280 --> 03:08:12.400]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:18.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:43.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Friday, August 5th, 2016, this is a fourth
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:45.520]  hour on David Knight.
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:48.920]  We have a very interesting guest coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:52.600]  We're going to be talking to a scientist from Berkeley, California about to his company
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:56.480]  that is working on what used to be called cold fusion.
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:01.080]  Now they call it low energy nuclear reactions, and we're going to talk about that.
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:06.560]  The Defense Department has said this has potential to be a hugely disruptive technology, and
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:07.560]  of course it does.
[03:09:07.560 --> 03:09:10.000]  It would change everything.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:13.880]  Even politically, understand that our currency is based around the petrodollar, so it's got
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:18.960]  massive political issues at stake as well.
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:24.320]  But it's important as we look at this, as we look at history, as we look at technology,
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:29.360]  you know, I keep seeing the same MOs repeated over and over and over again.
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:32.200]  You know, Hillary's getting her Nixon on.
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:35.760]  She's got her own plumbers trying to cover her leaks, but they're not doing it.
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:40.080]  You've got people internally, I think, that are trying to expose what she's doing.
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:44.600]  We've had multiple people in intelligence that are very, very upset with what Hillary
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:45.800]  Clinton is doing.
[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:49.480]  We had Judge Napolitano, who was a point out earlier in the week, saying he's talked to
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:54.200]  a lot of people in the intelligence community that believe that what she has done has resulted
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:58.680]  in the direct deaths of agencies that have been exposed.
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:01.880]  Alex was just talking to William Benny in the last hour.
[03:10:01.880 --> 03:10:02.880]  Amazing interview.
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:05.440]  If you haven't seen that interview, you need to watch that interview.
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:09.840]  One of the key takeaways that I think Mr. Benny had to say, and I'm not going to say
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:16.520]  I have so much respect for William Benny, this guy truly is a winter soldier.
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:19.960]  And by that, I don't mean Captain America stuff, a villain, okay?
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:23.680]  No, winter soldier in the sense that he's not a sunshine patriot.
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:26.520]  This is a guy who tufts it out in Valley Forge.
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:31.720]  He does the right thing, even when everything is against him.
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:38.040]  One of the things that he said, which I think is very true, this whole lie about privacy
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:39.680]  versus security.
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:42.680]  William Benny said, this was a lie from the beginning.
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:43.680]  It has been.
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:49.840]  As I've said before, you cannot be secure if you have no privacy, if you have no freedom.
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:55.560]  If you trade your liberty for the promise of security and safety, as our founder said,
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:10:58.360]  you'll get neither, you deserve neither.
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:00.320]  Slaves are never free.
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:03.160]  People who have no privacy are never free.
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:07.560]  People who trade their prosperity, their private property for the promise of safety and security
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:08.560]  are never free.
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:14.320]  So you just become a prisoner, you just become a serf, a slave to the degree that you trade
[03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:15.320]  that out.
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:17.960]  And he said, look, they just want power over you.
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:19.560]  He said they're covering for each other.
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:21.600]  In other words, it's a criminal conspiracy.
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:24.800]  We've told you this, it's simply a criminal conspiracy.
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:28.680]  And this quote from William Benny, I wrote these things down as he was talking, trading
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:30.400]  our security for money.
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:35.080]  He said they keep the problems going, so the money keeps flowing.
[03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:38.120]  That's the basis of the military industrial complex.
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:41.360]  So I'm very anxious to see this movie when it comes out, A Good American.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:44.320]  He was talking about that, but he was not talking to plug a movie that he's in.
[03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:48.160]  I'm sure knowing William Benny, he gets paid very little of anything.
[03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:49.400]  This is a documentary.
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:54.040]  Somebody is putting together William Benny and these other NSA whistleblowers like Thomas
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:56.600]  Drake, they gave up everything.
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:58.800]  They didn't do this for money.
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:01.920]  They gave up everything to protect the Constitution.
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:04.560]  And so this is a key interview.
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:06.680]  You need to see what he has to say.
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:09.920]  And I think it's interesting, this article that's on the Dredge Report today about the
[03:12:09.920 --> 03:12:16.160]  new Snowden movie that's coming out by Oliver Stone, I was very disappointed to see Judicial
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:20.080]  Watch take this position because I have a lot of respect for Judicial Watch.
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:23.480]  They have done a great job of exposing the crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:27.600]  As a matter of fact, I don't know where it is right now, but there is a court case that
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:35.200]  Judicial Watch has put together to try to get Hillary to testify in a lawsuit.
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:41.440]  So it's a civil lawsuit and it was happening just before the political conventions came
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:42.440]  up.
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:44.880]  There was supposed to be a ruling by a judge as to whether or not she would be compelled
[03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:49.680]  to testify in this civil lawsuit because it involved her.
[03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:56.000]  And remember, it was a civil lawsuit testimony that Bill Clinton testified in that caused
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.040]  him to commit perjury.
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:12:59.040]  That's why he was impeached.
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:01.640]  He wasn't impeached for his affairs.
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:06.280]  He was impeached because he committed perjury as part of a civil lawsuit.
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:12.160]  So Judicial Watch has a civil lawsuit coming against Hillary Clinton for these security
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.360]  violations and other issues.
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:19.240]  And we're still awaiting, I still have not seen whether or not the judge is gonna compel
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:20.240]  her to testify.
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:21.520]  That would be incredibly important.
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:26.260]  So Judicial Watch does amazingly important information.
[03:13:26.260 --> 03:13:31.340]  They have revealed information about what happened with Benghazi and other things through
[03:13:31.340 --> 03:13:33.360]  regular channels.
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:38.960]  But they came out and said that they believe that Snowden is not a hero, but a traitor.
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:45.160]  And because he's a traitor, in their opinion, they think that this movie would be allowing
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:49.440]  the makers of the movie, Oliver Stone and others, to profit from treason.
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:52.920]  And that should be a reason that people come out after them.
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:54.920]  Let me say this, okay?
[03:13:54.920 --> 03:14:01.760]  The enemies knew what was going on and what they were doing when they revealed this was
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:07.800]  they were telling the country that the government was violating the law.
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:12.000]  They're violating the law because they're compiling all this information in a massive
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.480]  way, as William Binney has pointed out.
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:19.520]  They had trailblazer, which would go in and would allow them to get the information in
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:24.080]  an anonymous way and look for certain things, rather than doing dragnet surveillance, rather
[03:14:24.080 --> 03:14:27.280]  than collecting all this information on everyone.
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:30.800]  That's why other whistleblowers within the NSA had done.
[03:14:30.800 --> 03:14:35.080]  And then they saw that the NSA was not interested in doing it that way.
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:39.960]  They wanted to go into the police state mode, and that's when they became whistleblowers.
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:41.880]  They went through regular channels.
[03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:45.480]  They went to Congress, Congress yawned and did nothing.
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:50.840]  And then we had Thomas Drake, who talked to a reporter in general about what was going
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:51.840]  on.
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:56.920]  And when you reveal that criminal action is going on, you are a whistleblower.
[03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:03.720]  Now their position is that because Al Qaeda was alerted to the idea that the government
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:10.080]  was using methods to intercept their communications, that that somehow caused lives to be lost.
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:14.960]  I don't think that is anywhere close to the same league as what Hillary Clinton does.
[03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:17.400]  She revealed detailed information.
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:19.280]  She got into the GAMA program.
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:24.120]  The GAMA compartment, as William Benning was talking about, she gave specifics to people.
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:25.560]  They were talking about general things.
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:30.600]  They were saying, they were showing slides that said, look, the NSA is laughing at you.
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:34.680]  They're saying, who would have thought in 1984, they had a series of three slides.
[03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:42.440]  Remember, they had a picture of the 1984 iconic commercial that was promoting Apple Macintosh.
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:43.440]  And so they showed that picture.
[03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:47.280]  I said, who would have thought in 1984, because this one that came out is referenced in 1984,
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:52.880]  that this, the next slide, shows Steve Jobs holding up an iPhone, that this would become
[03:15:52.880 --> 03:15:54.360]  Big Brother.
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:57.760]  And then they show the third slide, which shows people queued up to get it, and that
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:15:59.960]  people would willingly pay for it.
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.680]  They are laughing at you because they are illegally doing dragnet surveillance on the
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:07.120]  American people through their devices.
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:12.720]  And you're stupid enough to go out and pay for it yourself and get enthralled with this
[03:16:12.720 --> 03:16:14.720]  new technology.
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:17.480]  So that's what was revealed with Snowden.
[03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:19.320]  That's why he is a hero.
[03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:23.560]  And I think William Benny is absolutely right.
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:27.640]  The entire world owes a debt to him because this kind of corruption, this kind of secret
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:34.200]  police state that used to be combined to places like East Germany and the Stasi, has now becoming
[03:16:34.200 --> 03:16:35.200]  globalized.
[03:16:35.200 --> 03:16:38.640]  It's not just the American government, it's all governments are starting to do this.
[03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:39.640]  So it's a very key thing.
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:43.120]  And it's a very different thing to tell people that your government is breaking law than
[03:16:43.120 --> 03:16:49.520]  it is to reveal details of conversations, to reveal names of people.
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:50.760]  That is a very different thing.
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:52.960]  Now, where is this all headed?
[03:16:52.960 --> 03:16:58.600]  Look at this article that was up on the Drudge Report, Chicago police using pre-crime AI
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:17:02.480]  to arrest people before they commit a crime.
[03:17:02.480 --> 03:17:03.640]  Before they commit a crime.
[03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:04.640]  This is from technocracy.
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:10.840]  They say police are arresting people for crimes, they're not committed yet, using a new computer
[03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:14.360]  algorithm that will predict future crime.
[03:17:14.360 --> 03:17:18.360]  It's called predictive policing, it's being used, of course, where else?
[03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:22.160]  Chicago, where all the criminal stuff begins, okay?
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:30.040]  Strategic Subject List, the SSL, and the Chicago Special Order, S10-06, okay?
[03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:35.520]  This will equip law enforcement with the ability to arrest citizens before they commit a crime.
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:41.920]  So it'll take into various factors like your criminal records or your affiliations or the
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:42.920]  number of past arrests.
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:47.560]  But it will also use things like social media to develop a citizen ranking on locals and
[03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:48.560]  identify future threats.
[03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:54.360]  Look, understand this, just as the RICO statutes were initially created to go after organized
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:18:01.360]  crime figures and to confiscate their assets before their trial so they would not be able
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:03.280]  to defend themselves with highest-priced lawyers.
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:05.240]  That was a whole idea behind RICO statute.
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:10.640]  But what they did was, it was a pre-conviction punishment so that they could get a conviction
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:11.640]  against you.
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:13.240]  Where did we see this go?
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:17.000]  RICO statute eventually began being used against, it wasn't very long before they started
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.640]  using it against abortion protesters or other people.
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:24.000]  It's being put out that they would like to use RICO statutes against people who don't
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.520]  agree with man-made global warming.
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:30.160]  You have to understand that once they start this out, they're going to put it against
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:34.920]  people who are true criminals, but they're going to bring this out to the entire population.
[03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:40.920]  The fastest growing area of the intelligence surveillance community is geospatial intelligence.
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:43.880]  We talked about this with Jade Helm last year, where they talk about mastering the
[03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:44.880]  human domain.
[03:18:44.880 --> 03:18:49.320]  You understand that is about human domain analytics, exactly what they're talking about
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:50.320]  here.
[03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:55.800]  And when you go back and you look at geospatial intelligence, where they map you geographically
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:19:01.640]  onto the map, but they also map your political beliefs, your religious affiliations, who
[03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:05.240]  your friends are, things that are completely innocuous.
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:06.240]  They map everybody.
[03:19:06.240 --> 03:19:10.680]  And you have to understand that what they are doing with this and where they're going
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:15.160]  in the long run is to shut down political enemies, not just going after violent criminals
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:16.720]  or terrorists.
[03:19:16.720 --> 03:19:18.240]  That is where this is headed.
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:20.120]  They want activity-based intelligence.
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:24.760]  The metadata that Hayden and these other people are lying to you about, that is the
[03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:27.160]  most important data they get.
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:29.640]  The metadata is the most important data.
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:33.160]  And they say, we're not recording your conversations well, as William Bennett has pointed out, that's
[03:19:33.160 --> 03:19:34.440]  a lie.
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:38.400]  But the most important data that they're getting is the metadata, because with that, they can
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:40.960]  build a complete profile of you.
[03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:44.000]  And we have another story that's on the Drudge Report, how a company has already built a
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:47.800]  profile on every single adult American.
[03:19:47.800 --> 03:19:51.320]  This is the kind of surveillance state that we need to shut down.
[03:19:51.320 --> 03:19:52.320]  Stay with us.
[03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:53.320]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:53.320 --> 03:20:00.320]  We'll be right back with Cole Fusion at the bottom of the hour.
[03:20:53.320 --> 03:21:04.040]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow.
[03:21:04.040 --> 03:21:06.840]  And like all of you out there, I had problems sleeping.
[03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:07.840]  Pillows would go flat.
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:09.320]  I would flip flop all night long.
[03:21:09.320 --> 03:21:12.960]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even
[03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:14.320]  though I slept eight hours.
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:17.880]  When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to
[03:21:17.880 --> 03:21:22.520]  give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:26.560]  My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:30.440]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:31.440]  we get.
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:34.120]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.

[03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:41.200]  nothing to lose.

[03:21:59.480 --> 03:22:03.160]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:06.680]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[03:22:06.680 --> 03:22:13.200]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[03:23:10.440 --> 03:23:15.520]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks for an 8-pack?
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:20.600]  When you can shave with Harry's high quality German engineered blades for half the price.
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:24.480]  And because Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades, they'll send you

[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:49.080]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.

[03:23:58.200 --> 03:24:14.240]  Code 1151.
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:15.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:19.240]  I'm David Knight and in the next segment we're going to be talking to someone about the state
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:22.640]  of the art in cold fusion.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:26.720]  And we're going to, that's a very disruptive technology, you know when we look at technology
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:32.640]  and how it has the chance to, the opportunity to completely change our world as we know
[03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:33.640]  it.
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:37.520]  That's why we talk so much about things like self-driving cars, where the government's
[03:24:37.520 --> 03:24:41.560]  going to take over control of all private transportation.
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:44.840]  They're going to track and tax everything you do, they're going to control your movements
[03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:45.840]  with that.
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:50.440]  But this could possibly be a freeing technology, but it certainly would be a disruptive technology.
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:55.200]  It's going to change the control that our government exerts through the petrodollar,
[03:24:55.200 --> 03:25:01.040]  it's going to change scarcity of energy, and it could have a lot of effect on wars.
[03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:05.480]  Of course, the people who have a lot to lose are the people who start our wars, and when
[03:25:05.480 --> 03:25:09.800]  they see things start to change in a disruptive way they don't like, they have other ways
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:10.800]  of disrupting us.
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:12.720]  So we're going to talk to him in the next segment.
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.880]  Before we get on with some breaking news here, I want to remind you that we have extended
[03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:17.880]  these specials.
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:23.840]  We still have some stock, but it's going to end very shortly because we have to save
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:26.800]  these items for the people who are on auto ship.
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:31.760]  And these are some of the sales that we had in our mega special that we had a 24-hour,
[03:25:31.760 --> 03:25:34.620]  actually a 28-hour special last week.
[03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:42.000]  We have still have 40% off brain force, 30% off vitamin mineral fusion, and 30% off DNA
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  force.
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  Those specials are still up.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.560]  They will be taken down this weekend because we are running out of stock, and those are
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:52.000]  huge savings, especially the dollar figure that you save off of DNA force.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:57.600]  30% off that is huge, and everything at the store is still free shipping.
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:03.480]  So we have store-wide free shipping plus 40% off brain force, 30% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:09.360]  That's the broad-based energy drink, tastes great, gets your minerals as well as vitamins
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:14.000]  in a great tasting format, and 30% off DNA force.
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:19.400]  You know, one of the things I was looking at, of course, here is people just keep this controversy
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:20.840]  with con going.
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:27.360]  And as some people have pointed out, didn't Hillary Clinton disrespect the Gold Star families
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:30.760]  when she lied to them and the public about Benghazi?
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:33.160]  Perhaps she caused the death of those people.
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:34.280]  That's what we're very concerned about.
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:40.120]  But look at the other aspect of this, this Sharia Khan guy, okay, this guy who is really
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:45.360]  not an expert on the Constitution by any means, but he is an expert on Sharia law.
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:46.920]  He's written a lot of commentaries on it.
[03:26:46.920 --> 03:26:50.920]  He finally analyzes all the details of Sharia law.
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:54.200]  Look at what this looks like in practice, okay?
[03:26:54.200 --> 03:26:56.480]  There's a situation in Turkey.
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:00.560]  This is reported by CNN, a gay refugee living in Turkey has been found brutally murdered,
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:06.360]  his body so mutilated, his friends could only identify him by his pants, okay?
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:11.840]  And a picture that they have on here is ISIS throwing gay men off the building, okay?
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:17.760]  And she has this guy speak to essentially introduce her, one of the few speakers that
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:20.360]  was speaking just before she spoke.
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:25.920]  Ask yourself, okay, what is the message that Hillary Clinton was sending to us, okay?
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:29.600]  She wants to put this guy out so badly because she's playing identity politics and she wants
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:35.800]  to attack Donald Trump ad hominem by misrepresenting what he wants to do with immigration.
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:40.400]  Not a blanket ban of Muslims, but determining the kind of people that we want to let into
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:44.560]  this country as well, vetting them, knowing something about these people, where they're
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:46.640]  from, what their background is.
[03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:52.160]  I mean, quite frankly, if I was president, I was looking at somebody like Kazeera Khan,
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:56.800]  who had advocated Sharia law, I would say no, he's not gonna become a citizen of the United
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:27:57.800]  States.
[03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:01.160]  I would not have let him in, quite frankly, and let me tell you why.
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:05.520]  They say these people, here's a gay guy, and this is just one aspect to Sharia law, of
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:06.520]  course.
[03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:11.560]  There are two things in Sharia law for which you can get this kind of hatred, violence,
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:12.560]  and death penalty.
[03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:14.400]  Okay, they say, we identified him from his pants.
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:20.760]  They had cut him so violently, so violent, that two knives had broken inside of him.
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:22.280]  Then they beheaded him.
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:27.480]  His upper body was beyond recognition, said his friend, who CNN is not naming for safety
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:28.840]  reasons.
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:34.520]  That is the Sharia law that Kazeera Khan advocates in practice.
[03:28:34.520 --> 03:28:40.880]  So she not only, she threw her gay supporters under the bus, quite frankly, by having this
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:41.880]  guy out there.
[03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:46.360]  She's trying to throw all of us under the bus by trying to bring in as many of these
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:50.240]  people as they can without vetting anybody.
[03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:52.720]  They're Muslims who are not maniacs.
[03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:57.560]  But we'd want to make sure we don't let the maniacs in to the asylum here, okay?
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:28:59.280]  Turn this into Arkham Asylum.
[03:28:59.280 --> 03:29:03.960]  She put that out there, and basically, look at this insanity, okay?
[03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:09.080]  A man who stood up to the Munich shooters is now facing prosecution in Germany because
[03:29:09.080 --> 03:29:13.120]  he insulted the guy who had just shot nine people.
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:15.440]  How's that for insanity, okay?
[03:29:15.440 --> 03:29:19.800]  How's that for political correctness run to the nth degree?
[03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:21.320]  Do you understand that?
[03:29:21.320 --> 03:29:25.800]  Do you understand that is essentially what the Democrat National Convention was doing?
[03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:31.360]  They put a guy up there who is advocating a system of law that results in what I just
[03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:32.360]  read to you, okay?
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:34.000]  And it's not just gays, they do it too.
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:35.160]  They do it to Christians.
[03:29:35.160 --> 03:29:36.160]  They do it to Muslim converts.
[03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:37.920]  They do it to people who commit adultery.
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:42.600]  They have a long laundry list of people they hate and get violent with.
[03:29:42.600 --> 03:29:47.920]  So she puts this guy up there, but they go to the mat for political correctness, just
[03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:51.800]  like they want to jail this guy, prosecute this guy for insulting the shooter.
[03:29:51.800 --> 03:29:52.800]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:52.800 --> 03:30:20.240]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:26.360]  His son, Captain Kahn, voluntarily joined the military and fought radical Islamic terrorism
[03:30:26.360 --> 03:30:27.360]  and died.
[03:30:27.360 --> 03:30:31.160]  The same kind of people that Mr. Kahn wants to bring into this country.
[03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:33.120]  What do you stand for, Dakota Meyer?
[03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:37.440]  I do respect the things you've done, but this, this tweet is ridiculous.
[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:43.080]  And the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald
[03:30:43.080 --> 03:30:46.320]  Trump is completely and totally disgusting.
[03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:48.840]  All of the military is watching this right now.
[03:30:48.840 --> 03:30:50.040]  Our eyes are open.
[03:30:50.040 --> 03:30:51.040]  What are you going to do?
[03:30:51.040 --> 03:30:53.160]  Are you going to do the right thing and take that down?
[03:30:53.160 --> 03:30:57.600]  Are you going to sit there and actually help out the most corrupt person ever?
[03:30:57.600 --> 03:31:01.640]  Hillary for prison, Joe Biggs, infowars.com, and I'm pissed off.
[03:31:01.640 --> 03:31:03.560]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us.
[03:31:03.560 --> 03:31:04.960]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:31:04.960 --> 03:31:06.680]  Why is this so good?
[03:31:06.680 --> 03:31:11.280]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:31:11.280 --> 03:31:16.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:17.000]  my system.
[03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:23.040]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[03:31:23.040 --> 03:31:28.800]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[03:31:28.800 --> 03:31:31.440]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:32.440]  These are all parasites.
[03:31:32.440 --> 03:31:35.160]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:35.160 --> 03:31:36.400]  You have the neem in there.
[03:31:36.400 --> 03:31:39.480]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:39.480 --> 03:31:42.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:42.800 --> 03:31:43.800]  All right.
[03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:45.800]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:45.800 --> 03:31:47.080]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:31:47.080 --> 03:31:48.080]  Living defense, infowarslife.com.
[03:31:48.080 --> 03:31:49.080]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:31:49.080 --> 03:31:52.760]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:31:52.760 --> 03:31:56.040]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[03:31:56.040 --> 03:31:58.240]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[03:31:58.240 --> 03:32:01.480]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:32:01.480 --> 03:32:07.400]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:32:07.400 --> 03:32:11.200]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:32:11.200 --> 03:32:14.640]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[03:32:14.640 --> 03:32:16.840]  it's very, very important.
[03:32:16.840 --> 03:32:23.480]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:32:23.480 --> 03:32:25.640]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:27.800]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:32:27.800 --> 03:32:32.160]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:32.160 --> 03:32:35.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:36.680]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:32:36.680 --> 03:32:39.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:39.560 --> 03:32:42.760]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:43.800]  It's in powder form.
[03:32:43.800 --> 03:32:46.520]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:32:46.520 --> 03:32:47.520]  I take this.
[03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:52.040]  This is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the product we make.
[03:32:52.040 --> 03:32:53.040]  We fight the global.
[03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:54.040]  We fight the new world order.
[03:32:54.040 --> 03:33:15.560]  We cure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:33:15.560 --> 03:33:20.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:27.200]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's
[03:33:27.200 --> 03:33:28.200]  Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.200 --> 03:33:31.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.200 --> 03:33:32.200]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:39.600]  We're going to be talking to a gentleman with Brillo-N energy.
[03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:40.600]  This is Robert George.
[03:33:40.600 --> 03:33:42.640]  This is a company that is in Berkeley, California.
[03:33:42.640 --> 03:33:47.040]  We're going to talk about what's been commonly known as cold fusion, but is also known as
[03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:50.080]  low-energy nuclear reactions.
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:54.160]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to play again these clips that we just got from Hillary
[03:33:54.160 --> 03:33:56.680]  Clinton, one of them where she comes out.
[03:33:56.680 --> 03:34:00.080]  Of course, everything that she does is very focus group tested.
[03:34:00.080 --> 03:34:03.880]  It's all put out on the teleprompter, but she had a couple of major gaps today that
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:06.880]  actually kind of funny about taxes and her husband.
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:08.200]  Let's play those two clips real quickly.
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:15.400]  Of course, I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking
[03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:16.400]  about.
[03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:23.000]  We're going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we are going to raise taxes
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:24.000]  on the middle class.
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  Let's raise taxes on the middle class.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:32.200]  It's kind of interesting, but one of the most interesting things that she said this
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:37.160]  week when confronted about this information, she gets her Nixon on.
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:42.960]  We've got Obama essentially getting on his Mina-Arkansas connections.
[03:34:42.960 --> 03:34:49.520]  We look at this plane loaded with pallets of cash from a Swiss bank delivering this.
[03:34:49.520 --> 03:34:50.520]  They asked her about that.
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:51.520]  She said, well, that's old news.
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:57.240]  Well, the fact that they had paid $400 million was old news, but the way that it was done
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:00.320]  and the circumstances under which it was done and the fact that we've now had one of the
[03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:05.920]  hostages say, hey, we had to wait for about 20 hours before the plane with the cash arrived.
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:09.560]  They didn't say that the plane had cash, but they said, if that plane doesn't get here,
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:11.360]  you're not leaving.
[03:35:11.360 --> 03:35:17.000]  So all of that harkens back to essentially a ransom situation.
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:20.040]  Harkens back really going back to the Iran-Contra situation.
[03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:23.160]  That's why history is so important, isn't it?
[03:35:23.160 --> 03:35:26.480]  We've seen this kind of situation going on for quite some time.
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:30.200]  Ken Starr didn't really want to get involved in what was going on in Mina-Arkansas with
[03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:35.560]  the Clintons because there are also hints of what was going on with Reagan and Bush
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:37.080]  with Iran-Contra.
[03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:41.560]  As we look at history, they use the same techniques, they have the same MOs.
[03:35:41.560 --> 03:35:43.440]  It repeats itself.
[03:35:43.440 --> 03:35:46.960]  But the other thing that we try to cover in these broadcasts is what's happening with
[03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:47.960]  technology.
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:54.360]  And that's why we have Mr. Robert George from Brillo & Energy talking to us because it's
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:35:57.080]  technology that is also disrupting our lives.
[03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:02.720]  We see a familiar pattern with history, but that pattern can be broken in a very disruptive
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:05.800]  way when we have certain types of technology coming in.
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:10.400]  And just to give you an idea of what's going on, he sent us a Defense Intelligence Agency
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:17.440]  analysis, an unclassified analysis a couple of years ago of where LENR is, Low Energy
[03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:18.600]  Nuclear Reactions.
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:24.600]  And what they said was, this is the DIA, they said it can produce nuclear origin energy
[03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:25.800]  at room temperatures.
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:31.240]  And this disruptive technology could revolutionize energy production and storage since nuclear
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:37.080]  reactions release millions of times more energy per unit mass than any other known chemical
[03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:38.080]  fuel, for example.
[03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:40.120]  And they give this in their closing argument.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:46.040]  They say, nuclear fusion releases 10 million times more energy per unit mass than does
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:50.800]  liquid transportation fuel, in other words, gasoline or jet fuel or something like that.
[03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:54.440]  And they say, because this is the US government, the military looking at this, since the US
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:37:01.040]  military is the largest user of liquid fuel for transportation, LENR power sources could
[03:37:01.040 --> 03:37:05.920]  produce the greatest transformation of the battlefield for US forces since the transition
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:09.040]  from horsepower to gasoline power.
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:13.480]  So this is an incredibly transforming technology, if it comes true.
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:18.440]  I want to talk to Mr. George about the history of this, because it's something we've talked
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:19.680]  about for quite some time.
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:23.000]  Thank you for joining us, Robert George.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  Thank you for having me.
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  Let's talk a little bit about the history here, because a lot of people have heard about
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:31.480]  the coal fusion, and I guess we could say it's kind of become the Rodney Dangerfield
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:32.480]  of physics.
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:35.360]  It gets no respect, OK?
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:39.320]  Because when it first came out in 1989, you had this chemical reaction.
[03:37:39.320 --> 03:37:41.040]  They didn't know what was happening with it.
[03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:42.880]  There was some unexplained effects.
[03:37:42.880 --> 03:37:46.280]  So the big issue was, was it chemical or was it nuclear?
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:50.480]  They had no theory to explain it, so they basically have been having this argument for
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:51.480]  quite some time.
[03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:56.160]  Give us a little bit of the history of this, so people understand how this has developed
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:00.400]  over the last 30-some-odd years and where we are today.
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:01.920]  Absolutely.
[03:38:01.920 --> 03:38:08.160]  When Ponson Fleischmann first introduced it in 1989, the Department of Energy was about
[03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:15.800]  to release $800 million for fusion energy research, and they decided to hold it up because
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:20.200]  coal fusion, which was a misnomer at the time, was introduced.
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:24.840]  And they said, well, you need to investigate this before we release the money to find out
[03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:27.040]  if it's legitimate.
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:35.920]  And the ones they asked to evaluate it were MIT and Caltech and Texas A&M to verify or
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:38.520]  invalidate the technology.
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:39.520]  And they all...
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:43.280]  Because these people were hot fusion advocates, so they had different technologies, competing
[03:38:43.280 --> 03:38:47.200]  technologies that they wanted to go out and get the money for.
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:48.200]  They did.
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:53.440]  They were all hot fusion physicists that were waiting for their budgets to be approved.
[03:38:53.440 --> 03:39:00.480]  And MIT was one of the universities that discredited it.
[03:39:00.480 --> 03:39:05.320]  They got caught later for downshifting the data because they did see excess heat.
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:06.320]  And it was...
[03:39:06.320 --> 03:39:11.480]  There was a lawsuit resulting in their falsification of the information and they lost, but they
[03:39:11.480 --> 03:39:13.480]  don't bring that to the fore.
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:19.360]  So when we're talking about hot fusion versus coal fusion and going back again 30-some-odd
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:23.280]  years ago, we're talking about fusion with coal fusion.
[03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:28.960]  Fusion occurring at room temperature versus massive amounts of energy having to be put
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:32.760]  in with hot fusion, which has not worked yet because they haven't been able to get something
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:36.680]  that has a net increase in production of energy.
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:40.160]  They basically can't recoup what they have to put in it to get it hot.
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:45.560]  So you're talking about a situation where fusion is occurring at room temperature is
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:50.080]  what people are looking at, or now they're calling it a low-energy nuclear reaction.
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:54.920]  What has happened in the intervening years that show that it's not just excess heat,
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:39:59.560]  but there's other things that have come out that let them give a hint that there's really
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:01.080]  fusion going on here?
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:05.640]  Well, since 1989, there have been scientists all over the world that have been testing
[03:40:05.640 --> 03:40:09.160]  and working on this phenomenon.
[03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:16.480]  The most recent ones, the NASA, the Spar Wars group down in San Diego, they got 30 times
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:20.480]  excess heat out of their unit.
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:24.400]  Energetics technology that came out of Israel and is now at the University of Missouri,
[03:40:24.400 --> 03:40:29.000]  they also were verified at getting 30 times excess heat.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:32.320]  Most of the people that were discrediting the field were saying, well, it's a hybrid
[03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:35.240]  chemical reaction.
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:40.640]  The proof was lacking to verify that this was actually a nuclear reaction.
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:45.480]  We've taken samples out of our boiler and sent it down to Los Alamos and had a scientist
[03:40:45.480 --> 03:40:50.040]  down there verify that it actually is a nuclear reaction.
[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:56.600]  Unlike the uranium nuclear reactions, there are no hazardous byproducts.
[03:40:56.600 --> 03:41:03.160]  The byproducts of exciting hydrogen, which is the fuel, is basically heat and helium.
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:08.560]  We've had Silicon Valley scientists from some of the major companies here in the valley,
[03:41:08.560 --> 03:41:12.640]  as well as the people from the Naval Research Lab in Washington come out with their radiation
[03:41:12.640 --> 03:41:19.520]  detectors to verify if there's any harmful radiation coming from our system.
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:24.000]  What you're looking at is essentially, you're looking at the transmutation of hydrogen with
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:26.040]  an end product of helium.
[03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:31.880]  Because you have that process where it goes from deuterium to tritium, that only happens
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:34.560]  if it's a nuclear reaction that's going on there.
[03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:39.400]  Then that tritium quickly decays into a helium byproduct, which is not a dangerous thing
[03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  going on there.
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:43.800]  You can see two things, they can see nuclear activities going on, they can see that there's
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:48.640]  a transmutation of elements, which shows that there is something going on there that is
[03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:49.640]  nuclear.
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:50.640]  Is that right?
[03:41:50.640 --> 03:41:52.400]  That's absolutely correct.
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:58.080]  The interesting thing is that the tritium is basically part of the fuel cycle.
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:01.560]  If you're generating excess heat, then you don't build up the amount of tritium in the
[03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:02.560]  system.
[03:42:02.560 --> 03:42:06.360]  In fact, that's how we met the scientists down in Los Alamos.
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:12.080]  They had looked at our website and looked at our PowerPoint and our patents, and basically
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:15.280]  were trying to replicate it, and they were getting tritium, but they weren't getting
[03:42:15.280 --> 03:42:16.280]  excess heat.
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:19.040]  They asked what they were doing wrong.
[03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:24.720]  Our chief scientist and the inventor and founder, Robert Gadas, basically went through
[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:29.280]  the process they were using and showed him how to get excess heat out of the process.
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:33.240]  Now, we're talking about the excess heat, and of course, that's a key thing for power
[03:42:33.240 --> 03:42:34.240]  generation.
[03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:40.400]  We look at a nuclear power plant, and as Einstein said, or one of the nuclear physicists said,
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:42.440]  that's a heck of a way to boil water.
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:44.400]  That's the way you generate power.
[03:42:44.400 --> 03:42:50.320]  You create, you burn some kind of a fossil fuel, or you burn wood, or you create a nuclear
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:54.240]  reaction, and then that creates heat that then creates steam and drives turbines and
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:55.240]  so forth and so on.
[03:42:55.240 --> 03:42:57.760]  That's the way you generate power.
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:43:01.200]  When we're looking at creation of heat, that's a very important thing.
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:07.520]  You're talking about a piece of equipment that has a 30 times increase in heat.
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:10.640]  It seems to me, whether or not that is fusion or not, that would be something somebody would
[03:43:10.640 --> 03:43:14.840]  want to continue with as a technology and develop that.
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:19.680]  To me, it doesn't really matter whether it's chemical or whether it is fusion or nuclear
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:20.680]  reaction.
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:25.480]  I would still want to try to enhance that and make that work.
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:32.480]  Well, since the university has discredited it since 89, it's been a political suicide
[03:43:32.480 --> 03:43:37.800]  or academic suicide to even work on it in universities.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:42.920]  Most in the last three years, we've tried to get the national labs to do material analysis
[03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:49.920]  for us and isotopic analysis on our cores just to verify what the systems are actually
[03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:51.440]  occurring in there.
[03:43:51.440 --> 03:43:53.200]  We're willing to pay them for it.
[03:43:53.200 --> 03:43:57.720]  Their response has been, this is too controversial, we can't work on it.
[03:43:57.720 --> 03:43:58.720]  That's amazing.
[03:43:58.720 --> 03:44:01.800]  But this is not something that we haven't seen in other fields as well.
[03:44:01.800 --> 03:44:05.840]  You have vested interests, whether it's in drugs or whether it's in particular types
[03:44:05.840 --> 03:44:08.240]  of food or whether it's in energy.
[03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:11.640]  You have the vested interests that are there and they don't want to run the studies to
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:18.560]  show that some alternative would be cheaper or economical, more environmentally friendly.
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:24.640]  They essentially shut that down and not only do they not fund it, but they demonize it,
[03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:28.720]  they ridicule it, they do everything they can to censor it.
[03:44:28.720 --> 03:44:32.280]  That's essentially what we're seeing here with low energy nuclear reactions, isn't it?
[03:44:32.280 --> 03:44:38.960]  Yes, this could actually shift us off a lot of the petroleum usage from cars to airplanes
[03:44:38.960 --> 03:44:40.440]  to diesel trucks and buses.
[03:44:40.440 --> 03:44:42.360]  This could be very dramatic.
[03:44:42.360 --> 03:44:46.800]  We have two products currently, one that would be suitable for home heating, which operates
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:53.720]  at about 150 degrees C or domestic hot water, and then we have another one that's a gas
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:58.880]  phase system that operates at 600 degrees C that's suitable for generating electricity
[03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:02.520]  and could repower coal-powered power plants.
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:06.360]  And so those are the systems, that's where you are right now in terms of your state of
[03:45:06.360 --> 03:45:07.360]  the art.
[03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:10.720]  So you've got essentially something that could replace a water heater as well as something
[03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:13.760]  else that could generate electricity.
[03:45:13.760 --> 03:45:15.920]  What are the inputs to your systems?
[03:45:15.920 --> 03:45:21.480]  Basically, the thing that's been missing from the field all these years is a control system.
[03:45:21.480 --> 03:45:24.720]  There have been scientists all over the world that are getting this excess heat, as I mentioned
[03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:27.640]  earlier, the Spout Wars people, the NASA people.
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:32.840]  The problem has been being able to start the reaction when you want it to and be able to
[03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:35.640]  start it, stop it when you need to.
[03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:41.080]  And Robert Goddus is an electrical engineer, a multi-discipline engineer, and developed
[03:45:41.080 --> 03:45:46.640]  a control system, we call it Q-pulse, that actually, for the home heating system, for
[03:45:46.640 --> 03:45:50.600]  example, when you turn up your thermostat, you want the heat to come on immediately.
[03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:53.120]  And so our reaction starts immediately.
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:56.520]  And when you turn off the Q-pulse, it immediately stops.
[03:45:56.520 --> 03:46:02.080]  So there's no chance of the system running away, and if it runs away, it's just hot water,
[03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:03.960]  so it doesn't really matter.
[03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:07.800]  So is this something we're likely to see sometime in the near future?
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:12.320]  I'm thinking of a Mr. Fusion machine, like we saw in the DeLorean and Back to the Future.
[03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:19.160]  Are we going to see this in a nice containerized thing, or are you still trying to get financial
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:23.880]  backing to do this and trying to fight the censorship and the prejudice in the scientific
[03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:26.920]  community against this to get this developed?
[03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:27.920]  All of the above.
[03:46:27.920 --> 03:46:33.080]  We've raised about $13 million over the last 10 years to develop the systems.
[03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:38.520]  We have a system operating under scientists down at SRI International because of the controversy.
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:43.520]  In the field, we wanted independent scientists verifying our results in our system, hands
[03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:47.440]  off from us, and that's been going very well.
[03:46:47.440 --> 03:46:52.760]  And as a result of our work, although we've had very little interest in the United States,
[03:46:52.760 --> 03:46:59.080]  the Defense Authorization Act has just recently added LENR to their bill.
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:04.320]  But we've licensed a South Korean firm, a manufacturer, a multi-million dollar license
[03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:07.480]  to start manufacturing and distributing it in South Korea.
[03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:10.440]  We have a license in Canada as well.
[03:47:10.440 --> 03:47:14.520]  But there's been very little interest or support in the United States, and this is where we
[03:47:14.520 --> 03:47:15.520]  need it the most.
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:19.000]  Quite frankly, I think a lot of that is due to politics.
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:25.560]  We look at how deeply embedded the oil business is in terms of the banking business.
[03:47:25.560 --> 03:47:29.640]  We've got the petrodollar that was created as they took us off the gold standard.
[03:47:29.640 --> 03:47:36.200]  They created a fiat currency with cooperation of Saudi Arabia, and it's having the ability
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:43.360]  to print that money without anything behind it and then use that as the medium of exchange
[03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:49.240]  for all the oil that has really been the bedrock of our financial system here in America as
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:50.240]  a petrodollar.
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:54.000]  So there has to be a tremendous amount of political pressure not to do that.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:59.120]  And yet, on the other hand, this is such a disruptive technology, and every other country
[03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:00.560]  essentially is working with this.
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:05.920]  We've got this document that you gave me that is six years old from the Defense Intelligence
[03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:06.920]  Agency.
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:11.640]  They point out how it's Japan and Italy are pretty far along in research, but of course
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:18.520]  China, Russia, India, all these countries, France as well, they all have their own research
[03:48:18.520 --> 03:48:19.520]  project.
[03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:24.400]  In that sense, you have to move forward with doing the research or you get left behind.
[03:48:24.400 --> 03:48:29.360]  Yes, we've been very fortunate to have angel investors that have come in and are supporting
[03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:31.840]  the company.
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:41.400]  The technology is disruptive, as you said, and the carbon-based industry is so well entrenched
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:46.000]  that it's difficult for them to look at this kind of technology as something that's going
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.840]  to be useful and necessary.
[03:48:48.840 --> 03:48:54.920]  Most people confuse what we're doing with the hydrogen and water as using it as a fuel,
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:49:01.480]  as a combustible fuel, but hydrogen is a nuclear fuel, has so much higher energy density.
[03:49:01.480 --> 03:49:08.080]  As an example, if you take the volume of water contained in the area of a number three pencil
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:14.960]  eraser and just take the hydrogen out of that volume of water, it's equivalent to two 38-gallon
[03:49:14.960 --> 03:49:16.640]  barrels of gasoline.
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:19.920]  That's the energy density that we're talking about.
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:23.800]  So the boiler that we have developed for the home heating system, which is a two-liter
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:29.920]  vessel, has one liter of water in it with electrolyte, and that amount of water is capable
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:33.400]  of heating your home for 10 or 15 years.
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:35.720]  Wow, that is amazing.
[03:49:35.720 --> 03:49:40.040]  And of course, that's an idea of just how disruptive this is.
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:46.840]  That gores a lot of people's cash cows when you do something like that, and it would be
[03:49:46.840 --> 03:49:47.840]  a very free technology.
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:52.360]  And we seem to have a history in this country of technologies that free us, technologies
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:58.320]  that are clean, being shut down, and that's the amazing thing about this.
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:49:59.600]  It really is.
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:02.960]  And this will be the first time you could have a home heating system that you could actually
[03:50:02.960 --> 03:50:07.640]  calculate your return on investment because all you'll need is electricity to stimulate
[03:50:07.640 --> 03:50:08.640]  the reaction.
[03:50:08.640 --> 03:50:12.080]  Let me get some idea about how far away you are with this.
[03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:19.240]  Now, this is something that you have a working model that you've got here.
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:22.280]  You're looking for investors to try to market this.
[03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:24.280]  Is that what the issue is here?
[03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:27.320]  You've already got some set products.
[03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:33.040]  You've got the, what was it called, the wet boiler as well as a hydrogen hot tube.
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:35.120]  Those are the two products that you had just described earlier.
[03:50:35.120 --> 03:50:37.480]  I mean, are those ready to go to market?
[03:50:37.480 --> 03:50:39.640]  And we'll take your answer when you come back.
[03:50:39.640 --> 03:50:40.640]  We've got to go to a break.
[03:50:40.640 --> 03:50:41.640]  And we're going to be right back.
[03:50:41.640 --> 03:50:43.280]  We're talking to Robert George.
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:48.220]  He's with Brillo N Energy Corporation, and it's a company that is looking at low energy
[03:50:48.220 --> 03:50:50.040]  nuclear reactions.
[03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:53.640]  And they have a couple of systems here, as he pointed out, just a little bit of water
[03:50:53.640 --> 03:50:56.280]  power your house for years, okay?
[03:50:56.280 --> 03:50:58.680]  This is amazingly disruptive technology.
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:02.480]  If we don't do it in America, somebody else will, but there's a lot of political resistance.
[03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:07.560]  It's a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price.
[03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:10.240]  You are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:11.240]  Here's why.
[03:51:11.240 --> 03:51:15.080]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:16.080]  So please listen.
[03:51:16.080 --> 03:51:19.680]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:51:19.680 --> 03:51:24.320]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and
[03:51:24.320 --> 03:51:26.160]  produce electricity from the sun.
[03:51:26.160 --> 03:51:30.960]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:33.360]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:36.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:40.600]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[03:51:40.600 --> 03:51:45.120]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[03:51:45.120 --> 03:51:47.200]  price for infill-wars listeners.
[03:51:47.200 --> 03:51:48.880]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:51:48.880 --> 03:51:49.880]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:51:49.880 --> 03:51:50.880]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:51:50.880 --> 03:51:56.160]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:51:56.160 --> 03:51:57.160]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:51:57.160 --> 03:52:01.360]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:52:01.360 --> 03:52:05.360]  Do you ever feel like you're being watched, like someone or some company is tracking your
[03:52:05.360 --> 03:52:06.360]  every move online?
[03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:07.360]  I know I do.
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:12.000]  That's why I trust Private Internet Access VPN to keep me safe when I'm online.
[03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:15.880]  I use it to encrypt my traffic and use an anonymous IP address.
[03:52:15.880 --> 03:52:20.120]  Private Internet Access keeps your internet traffic safe from unwanted eyes so you can
[03:52:20.120 --> 03:52:21.560]  finally feel safe.
[03:52:21.560 --> 03:52:24.920]  Forty dollars a year for peace of mind is a no-brainer.

[03:53:59.720 --> 03:54:00.720]  Effective.
[03:54:00.720 --> 03:54:05.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:05.720 --> 03:54:18.320]  Dave and I were talking to a gentleman with Brello N Energy Corporation about his company's
[03:54:18.320 --> 03:54:22.960]  efforts to create cold fusion, as it's been known in the past, but as they're referring
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:25.200]  to it today, low energy nuclear reactions.
[03:54:25.200 --> 03:54:28.560]  Before we get back to him, I just want to remind you that our specials that we've had
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:34.280]  since the 28-hour marathon sale that we had last week, we've had three specials that we've
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:38.640]  extended through this week, those are going to be ending this weekend because we're going
[03:54:38.640 --> 03:54:39.920]  to be running out of stock.
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:40.920]  It's been very successful.
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:43.240]  We really appreciate your support on this.
[03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:51.080]  It's vital for us as well as a way that we can fund our operation without being dependent
[03:54:51.080 --> 03:54:56.360]  on big companies who would shut us down with the types of things we talk about.
[03:54:56.360 --> 03:54:59.520]  I mean, we're talking about a very disruptive technology here.
[03:54:59.520 --> 03:55:04.640]  We talk about very disruptive politics here, and that's why it's important for us to self-fund
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:09.480]  our operations, why we appreciate your support, and that's why we offer these kinds of sales
[03:55:09.480 --> 03:55:10.480]  and appreciation.
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:16.120]  And so we've extended this 40% off on brain force, 30% off on vitamin mineral fusion,
[03:55:16.120 --> 03:55:18.680]  and 30% off DNA force.
[03:55:18.680 --> 03:55:23.080]  That is our very expensive, difficult to produce formulation that has BiopQQ.
[03:55:23.080 --> 03:55:24.080]  You can look that up.
[03:55:24.080 --> 03:55:29.440]  There's 175 clinical studies that talk about how effective BiopQQ is.
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:32.040]  You can look at the reviews for all these products as well as everything that we sell
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:36.880]  at infowarstore.com, see what other people say that their experiences have been with
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:37.880]  that.
[03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:43.360]  And of course, because DNA force is so difficult to produce, so expensive to produce, that
[03:55:43.360 --> 03:55:46.680]  30% savings is a huge discount.
[03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:51.160]  So take advantage of that now as well as a 30% off vitamin mineral fusion drink mix
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:53.880]  and the 40% off brain force.
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:55:58.960]  And we have store-wide free shipping that we have extended as well as a thank you to
[03:55:58.960 --> 03:56:03.400]  you to help you take advantage of this to provide for your health, your family's health,
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:04.960]  and to fund our operation.
[03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:06.680]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:56:06.680 --> 03:56:08.680]  You'll find that all at infowarstore.com.
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:13.760]  And I want to go back to Mr. Robert George with Brilowin Energy.
[03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:18.640]  You know, Mr. George, when I'm looking at things like the issues that we've been seeing
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:21.920]  with Tesla, they just had their corporate sales come out.
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:24.520]  They have been in operation for 13 years.
[03:56:24.520 --> 03:56:27.480]  They have lost money every quarter except one.
[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:29.240]  That's not really a good record.
[03:56:29.240 --> 03:56:33.760]  And yet their stock has multiplied by a factor of 12.
[03:56:33.760 --> 03:56:34.760]  They keep passing this on.
[03:56:34.760 --> 03:56:37.880]  They're under investigation by the SEC at the current time.
[03:56:37.880 --> 03:56:42.880]  But nevertheless, I see these large corporations like Tesla, like Uber, because Uber is going
[03:56:42.880 --> 03:56:47.880]  to be part of the disruptive technologies that are going to hand over control of our
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:52.560]  transportation to the government where they can tax and track us.
[03:56:52.560 --> 03:56:57.480]  It'll also make it difficult for us to afford transportation.
[03:56:57.480 --> 03:57:01.760]  So when we look at things that line up with the political agenda of the establishment,
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:07.440]  we see these people kind of get everything the way is cleared for them.
[03:57:07.440 --> 03:57:08.440]  Wall Street helps them.
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:11.760]  The government helps them to take down obstacles.
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:16.000]  And yet when we look at something like this that is very disruptive, as you were saying
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:20.640]  in the last segment, what was it, some water that's about the size of a pencil combined
[03:57:20.640 --> 03:57:24.760]  with your device would power your home's energy needs for about 10 or 15 years?
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:30.400]  That's an amazingly transformative and freeing technology.
[03:57:30.400 --> 03:57:35.320]  But it's difficult for you to get this out into the marketplace because Wall Street has
[03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:39.200]  some vested interests in the existing energy infrastructures, don't they?
[03:57:39.200 --> 03:57:43.680]  Absolutely. When we took it to Wall Street, they looked at the upside potential of this
[03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:46.440]  kind of technology and said, it's worth trillions.
[03:57:46.440 --> 03:57:49.800]  You're only trying to raise $15 to $20 million.
[03:57:49.800 --> 03:57:50.800]  It makes no sense.
[03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:51.800]  We can't do that.
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:53.800]  Got to go big.
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:54.800]  Yeah.
[03:57:54.800 --> 03:57:56.800]  Well, that's certainly what we've seen with Uber and Tesla.
[03:57:56.800 --> 03:58:01.120]  You got to be out there and kind of brash, I guess, to get their attention.
[03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:03.360]  But you also have to be politically connected.
[03:58:03.360 --> 03:58:07.600]  Maybe you should do some crowdsourcing or take this on Shark Tank or something like that.
[03:58:07.600 --> 03:58:12.680]  I certainly wish you luck with this and thank you so much for talking to us about it.
[03:58:12.680 --> 03:58:16.680]  We hope that this is going to be something that is going to free us with technology because
[03:58:16.680 --> 03:58:20.720]  too often we see technology being used to suppress our freedoms.
[03:58:20.720 --> 03:58:24.600]  This is something that would have a very freeing effect, I believe.
[03:58:24.600 --> 03:58:26.800]  That's it for today's broadcast.
[03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:48.960]  Join us tonight at 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern for the Infowars Nightly News.
