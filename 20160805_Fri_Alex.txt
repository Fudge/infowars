[00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:03.114]  It's happened.
[00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:11.466]  The Zika virus is now beginning to infect many areas of the entire planet via the globalist tool known as the Rio Olympics.
[00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.088]  That's all coming up in the special report.
[00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:16.452]  And then, Donald Trump has responded to the false claim he's dropping out.
[00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:26.137]  We're going to be breaking that down on the other side of the break and a lot more on this Friday, August 5th, 2016, Global Transmission.
[00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:33.261]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and InfoWars.com is undoubtedly the very front line when it comes to fighting for human liberty worldwide.
[00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:39.824]  Just four days to go before the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics.
[00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:45.129]  An Olympics that is already appearing to be a perfect storm for a major terrorist event.
[00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.356]  On Sunday evening, a robot was sent into the Maracana Stadium to detect a suspicious toolbox.
[00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:54.677]  An explosion was heard soon after the robot went in.
[00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:56.358]  No injuries were reported.
[00:00:56.358 --> 00:01:02.720]  Maracana Stadium will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympic Games.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.061]  Was this a test?
[00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:08.823]  Why did a toolbox have an explosive in it four days before the opening ceremonies?
[00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:12.164]  The globalist's fingerprints are all over the entire debacle.
[00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:26.314]  The International Atomic Energy Agency provided high-tech radiation monitors in order to detect a dirty bomb, while the United Nations claims ISIS has a high probability of dropping a dirty bomb on the Olympics due to the weak security.
[00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:35.840]  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization downplayed the threat of the Zika virus in order to bring more unsuspecting Olympians and foreigners to the potential hell pit.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.804]  Sidney Levy, CEO of the Rio 2016 Committee, has been on a media blitz
[00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:46.129]  Reassuring the world that there is no threat of the Zika virus that is exploding in Rio.
[00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:48.411]  The winter just started in Rio.
[00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:50.193]  It's a proved fact.
[00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:55.678]  Every year we measure that, and in the winter months, there's no mosquitoes whatsoever.
[00:01:55.678 --> 00:02:01.143]  However, Dr. Amir Adaran, writing for the Harvard Public Health Review, says otherwise.
[00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:06.325]  Dr. Adoran wrote, Brazil's Zika problem is inconveniently not ending.
[00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:12.248]  The outbreak that began in the country's northeast has reached Rio de Janeiro where it is flourishing.
[00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:23.233]  Clinical studies are also mounting that Zika infection is associated not just with the pediatric microcephaly and brain damage, but also adult conditions such as Guillain-Barre syndrome,
[00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:29.677]  And acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which are debilitating and sometimes fatal.
[00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:39.564]  Simply put, Zika infection is more dangerous and Brazil's outbreak more extensive than scientists reckoned a short time ago, which leads to a bitter truth.
[00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:47.149]  The 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved or both, as a precautionary concession.
[00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.972]  Dr. Adorno goes on to mention five reasons the games must be postponed.
[00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:59.435]  First, Rio de Janeiro's suspected Zika cases are the highest of any state in Brazil, 26,000.
[00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:05.477]  And its Zika incidence rate is the fourth worst, 157 per 100,000.
[00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:10.799]  And contrary to Mr. Levy, Rio has never experienced a winter with Zika before.
[00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:18.102]  In Rio de Janeiro, dengue cases in the first quarter of 2016 are a shocking six-fold higher than a year ago.
[00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:29.029]  With the startling baseline of Aedes-Borne disease so much higher this year than last, it is far from guaranteed that the coming winter's ebb will make a safe environment for the games.
[00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:40.316]  Second, although Zika virus was discovered nearly 70 years ago, the viral strain that recently entered Brazil is clearly new, different, and vastly more dangerous than old Zika.
[00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:44.018]  Third, while Brazil's Zika inevitably will spread globally,
[00:03:44.178 --> 00:03:48.799]  Given enough time, viruses always do, it helps nobody to speed that up.
[00:03:48.799 --> 00:04:05.604]  In particular, it cannot possibly help when an estimated 500,000 foreign tourists flock into Rio for the Games, potentially becoming infected and returning to their homes where both local AIDS mosquitoes and sexual transmission can establish new outbreaks.
[00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:15.068]  When, not if, the games speed up Zika's spread, the already urgent job of inventing new technologies to stop it becomes harder.
[00:04:15.068 --> 00:04:25.532]  By spreading the virus faster and farther, the games steal away the very thing, time, that scientists and public health professionals need to build such defenses.
[00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:29.314]  Fifth, proceeding with the games violates what the Olympics stands for.
[00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:38.942]  The International Olympic Committee writes that Olympism seeks to create social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.
[00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:43.606]  But how socially responsible or ethical is it to spread disease?
[00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:55.076]  The globalists behind this are willing to create a worldwide epidemic as an act of controlled folly that will begin incubating in just four days on your local idiot box.
[00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:56.717]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:02.002]  All of it perfectly timed to spread Zika.
[00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:07.988]  An article up at the Washington Post, wearing Don't Tread On Me insignia could be punishable racial harassment.
[00:05:07.988 --> 00:05:14.674]  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as FAG, among its other functions, decides hostile work environment.
[00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:17.337]  Harassment claims brought against federal agencies.
[00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:24.721]  On January 8, 2014, a complainant filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race.
[00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:35.567]  In the fall of 2013, a co-worker repeatedly wore a cap to work with insignia of the Gadsden flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the phrase, don't tread on me.
[00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:44.712]  Complainant stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:52.503]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden flag originated in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context.
[00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:53.204]  Boom!
[00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:53.925]  Facts!
[00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:54.566]  Boom!
[00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:55.667]  Liberals down!
[00:05:55.667 --> 00:06:00.194]  This has been Joe Biggs, serving you some information at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:00.594]  Enjoy!
[00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:06.169]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.635]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:24.684]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:32.928]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:36.789]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:47.014]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:53.697]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:06:54.077 --> 00:06:55.518]  That means it's clean.
[00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:56.698]  That means it's pure.
[00:06:56.698 --> 00:06:59.599]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.880]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.941]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:05.162]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:06.763]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:07:06.763 --> 00:07:09.864]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:10.944]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:11.905]  I'd been working all day.
[00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.406]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:15.826]  I get in here at 830.
[00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:17.727]  I was kind of run down.
[00:07:17.727 --> 00:07:19.428]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.529]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.370]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.431]  I popped two of them.
[00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:26.692]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:28.493]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:07:28.493 --> 00:07:30.154]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:31.495]  People really love it.
[00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:32.095]  Read about it.
[00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:35.917]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:07:35.917 --> 00:07:41.180]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.423]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:51.566]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:57.470]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:18.120]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.765]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:41.422]  My friends, we are live on this Friday, the fifth day of August 2016 worldwide transmission.
[00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:42.843]  We got three months and change.
[00:08:42.843 --> 00:08:51.411]  90-something days from the 2016 major general election.
[00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.893]  And so much stands in the balance we're talking about.
[00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:58.701]  Upwards of three, four, maybe even five Supreme Court justices.
[00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:06.867]  We're talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership that the bipartisan Republicans and Democrats say they're going to foist upon us, even though we're not allowed to read it.
[00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:08.108]  And so much more.
[00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:12.832]  Obama has been acting outside of law, opening up our borders.
[00:09:12.832 --> 00:09:16.515]  Hillary admits she's coming after our guns.
[00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:23.480]  She's also come out in a new speech and said she does plan to raise taxes on the middle class.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.021]  It's incredible.
[00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:28.001]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:37.088]  And then we've got Khan going on international Islamic television saying, Allah is tripping up Mr. Trump.
[00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:51.500]  Well, only if Allah is really the devil, because the establishment globalist system that is in the news today, legalizing human animal splices in the US, it's already been going on.
[00:09:52.708 --> 00:10:05.354]  The very group selling baby parts, they're the ones that don't like Mr. Trump, so how could any supposed Muslim claim that they're following God's commandments, the Ten Commandments?
[00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:09.576]  No Muslims say they follow that and support all this.
[00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:18.921]  Obama's daughter has been videotaped and photographed twerking, shaking her butt in a sexually suggestive way.
[00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:25.929]  Simulating the act of sex.
[00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:30.972]  And he's come out and said, listen, women aren't supposed to be all reserved.
[00:10:30.972 --> 00:10:33.713]  They shouldn't have to be demure.
[00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:36.335]  Let women be open and free and libertine, laissez-faire.
[00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:40.047]  Well, I say women have the right to do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt anybody.
[00:10:40.047 --> 00:10:41.347]  I agree with Obama.
[00:10:41.347 --> 00:10:50.210]  The problem is, is that he promotes the most hardcore forms of Islamic Sharia law that the Wahhabis push and gets massive amounts of money from them.
[00:10:50.210 --> 00:11:02.514]  That's what's so hypocritical about all this and throwing thousands of homosexuals off roofs just in the liberation of Egypt that our media promoted as a wonderful thing.
[00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:05.815]  The Muslim Brotherhood liberating it from the freedoms it had previously.
[00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:09.977]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:12.238]  Homeland Security is announcing domestic spy drones.
[00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.019]  They've always been doing it the last decade.
[00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:16.100]  The media would say we were conspiracy theorists.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.181]  But that's being announced today.
[00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:21.343]  That's some of the headlines up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:23.244]  Some of the stories up on Infowars.com.
[00:11:23.244 --> 00:11:28.146]  Harry Reid wants CIA to give Trump fake intelligence briefings.
[00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.847]  What, kind of like you give the American people?
[00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:32.494]  Because, you know, Trump can't be trusted.
[00:11:32.494 --> 00:11:34.575]  He's not a globalist selling the country out.
[00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:42.699]  These globalists that have sold us out to the Communist Chinese, Reid's even worse than Hillary, they're the custodians of the country.
[00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:44.179]  They can be trusted.
[00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:45.300]  They're the good people.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.181]  But let me get to the main issue.
[00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:53.504]  And I shot a special report that's going to be up the next hour at InfoWars.com, right before I went live on air today.
[00:11:54.383 --> 00:12:13.146]  And that's the fact that there is a giant hoax that's been going for 48 hours, that Donald Trump is going to drop out of the race, that there's been an intervention by the Republican Party and by Reince Priebus and everybody else meeting with Trump, and that they're trying to get him to step down.
[00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:17.047]  Now it's the Republican Party and Democratic Party at the highest levels putting this out.
[00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:21.608]  Then the Republicans come out and say he is the nominee, he will be the nominee, to act like they're not part of it.
[00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:31.049]  They couldn't steal the nomination from the American people, like they did Sanders, on the Democratic side, so they're trying to create the illusion that he's not in the race.
[00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:32.369]  Where did I hear that before?
[00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.650]  Ben Carson.
[00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:42.092]  Again, 5.30, 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the heavy voting starting, he's in second place in voting, feels good, gets on a plane to go to the next state.
[00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:46.131]  While he's in the air for two and a half hours, where was he flying?
[00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.312]  It was Florida.
[00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:52.076]  While he's in the air for two and a half hours, they announced, oh we talked to him, he did step down.
[00:12:52.076 --> 00:12:55.218]  And he said he endorses Cruz, the tweets were saying.
[00:12:55.218 --> 00:13:02.043]  And oh, then a bunch of people flipped for Cruz, and Cruz got second place.
[00:13:02.043 --> 00:13:06.247]  Cruz later had to admit that his campaign head did indeed do that, and he had to step down.
[00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:18.439]  Now, fast forward to June 18th of this year, Politico, the New York Times, they all ran with it as a beta test.
[00:13:18.439 --> 00:13:22.502]  And they all announced in different news articles, Trump is stepping down.
[00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:25.825]  Trump is dropping out due to not being able to raise money.
[00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:28.648]  He only raised $60 million so far in the months before.
[00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.600]  And then you read deeper in the articles, they had to get a response from Trump.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.042]  He says, this story is a total fabrication from you and Politico as usual.
[00:13:38.042 --> 00:13:41.143]  The New York billionaire sent an email sent by his campaign manager.
[00:13:41.143 --> 00:13:42.604]  I will never leave the race.
[00:13:42.604 --> 00:13:45.506]  Nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:49.208]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal anyway.
[00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:52.509]  Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?
[00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:54.770]  Now what's funny is, this was the 16th.
[00:13:56.391 --> 00:14:04.685]  A little less than a month later, in fact almost a month later of the day, the Hillary emails come out on the eve of the RNC on the 15th, a month after this.
[00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:06.107]  29 days after this.
[00:14:11.092 --> 00:14:26.284]  And it's her directing Politico, Associated Press, ABC, NBC, MSNBC on what to say and what to do and how to attack Trump and how to attack Sanders and how to send their people dressed like Sanders supporters to attack Trump people so those two sides would fight with each other.
[00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:35.285]  Positioning herself in the general election to inoculate psychologically Sanders supporters to hate Trump people, which is not happening.
[00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:36.926]  In mass, they're going to Trump.
[00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:42.329]  He was 10 points ahead in major polls that were skewed, probably 15, 20 points ahead.
[00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:48.332]  So now they start sampling 15% more Democrats in all the major polls are now doing this.
[00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:53.652]  Reuters and others led the way to then give her a lead.
[00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:54.692]  I mean, wow!
[00:14:54.692 --> 00:15:13.778]  Now to create the perception those polls are real, they announce he's sliding, losing support, they have a big string of rhino Republicans and neocons, all the usual suspects, the Rockefeller Republicans, from John McCain to Crystal, just everybody, coming out against Trump.
[00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.653]  They have Genrich come out and say, oh yeah, there is interventions, he is in trouble.
[00:15:18.653 --> 00:15:30.842]  The trusted little buddy, who you notice Trump didn't pick as his VP, even though he's offered $300 million by Adelson, the casino owner, at the end, and that's been confirmed.
[00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:33.984]  So, now they're running the Cheyenne hoax.
[00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:39.728]  And Trump came out Wednesday night, a few hours into this, and said, we've never been more unified, everything's great.
[00:15:39.728 --> 00:15:43.691]  He didn't want to add fuel to it, he didn't want to give it power, and say, of course I'm not dropping out.
[00:15:44.656 --> 00:15:48.619]  Well, now he needs to.
[00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:50.621]  And that's what I've said.
[00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:52.842]  On air and off air.
[00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:55.885]  I know some of his advisors are like, oh that makes us look weak.
[00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:57.846]  Look, they're putting that out everywhere.
[00:15:57.846 --> 00:15:59.868]  You have to say, how dare you come out
[00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:06.604]  And claim I'm dropping out when in many polls and in swing states I'm 10 points ahead, like Florida.
[00:16:06.604 --> 00:16:15.808]  How dare you, with these fake Reuters polls and others, sample 15% more Democrats to skew it and give her a 10 point lead, when I really have a 5 point, even in those skewed polls.
[00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:22.871]  And how dare you do what you did to Ben Carson and come out and announce I'm dropping out to create the illusion that all you've got is Hillary.
[00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:25.285]  How dare you?
[00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:31.830]  I want an apology from all these different mainstream media outlets and the Democrat and Republican Party pulling this latest scam.
[00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.033]  No wonder I think you're going to try to rig the general election.
[00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:37.515]  You tried to rig the primary against me.
[00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:40.017]  Says that?
[00:16:40.017 --> 00:16:40.878]  They're in deep trouble.
[00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:59.989]  Now some thinking is, let them run this hoax, let them get even more extreme and claim that his wife's a prostitute and he's a racist and he's dropping out and he's bankrupt and all the rest of this and he's a Russian spy and just let it percolate and have Trump still standing there and come out later and talk about it.
[00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:06.853]  And again, there's some thinking that this is the establishment destroying itself right now and that there's going to be a backlash to it.
[00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:09.055]  And I tend to think that that is the case, but still,
[00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:13.497]  I would counter it right up front, not wait for it to basically percolate.
[00:17:13.497 --> 00:17:24.962]  Because it's meant, and here's the key, he raised $60 million, spent another $60 something of his own, that's $120 plus million, up until last month.
[00:17:24.962 --> 00:17:31.445]  After that RNC event and that incredible speech and his incredible family and the other speakers, he raised $97 million in the last three weeks.
[00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:45.529]  And they went into complete panic mode because he'd be able to raise billions in the next seven, eight weeks.
[00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:47.989]  He's proven that he can go outside the system and do it.
[00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:48.789]  He's incredible.
[00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:49.749]  What a maverick.
[00:17:49.749 --> 00:17:55.490]  And so that's why they are in conniption fit deception mode right now.
[00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.671]  So people keep saying, where's Donald Trump's statement?
[00:17:57.671 --> 00:18:02.432]  When they first floated it, believe me Politico is the heart of the system now with this info.
[00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:04.452]  When they first floated this, he said,
[00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:09.506]  This story is a total fabrication from you and Politico as usual.
[00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:12.326]  The Newark billionaire sent an email sent by the campaign manager.
[00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:14.067]  I will never leave the race.
[00:18:14.067 --> 00:18:16.527]  Nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:18.707]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal.
[00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:21.888]  Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?
[00:18:21.888 --> 00:18:29.569]  And of course we got the emails one month later on the eve of the RNC that indeed this was the case.
[00:18:29.569 --> 00:18:31.830]  So there is Trump's response.
[00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.630]  Back to the future.
[00:18:34.022 --> 00:18:36.164]  And they're going to continue to push this.
[00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:38.226]  They're going to continue to put out outrageous stuff.
[00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:44.611]  Remember they put out that he raped a 16-year-old girl in Houston and it was all a made-up name and a made-up person?
[00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.633]  We told you here first it was made up.
[00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:50.957]  Two days before the media had to put in the back of the paper, okay, that was a fake name, a fake lawsuit.
[00:18:52.116 --> 00:19:05.628]  I could go down and file a fake lawsuit, pro se, at the Travis County Courthouse in Austin, Texas, by Easter Bunny Jones, and claim that Donald Trump raped me while riding a purple rhinoceros.
[00:19:05.628 --> 00:19:08.931]  Now, it's totally not true, but it doesn't matter.
[00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:14.976]  The mainstream media would probably go with it, if I made it sound more realistic, and I said my name was, say, you know, Will Smith.
[00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:19.643]  And you know, Donald Trump did something to me.
[00:19:19.643 --> 00:19:21.964]  They would run with it, because this is what they're doing.
[00:19:21.964 --> 00:19:23.765]  And I've never seen anything like it.
[00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:24.765]  It's incredible.
[00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:29.767]  And it shows how desperate these globalist criminals are, that have hijacked their nation, that they're doing this.
[00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:36.190]  When we return, remember about a week and a half ago, I got up here on air.
[00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:38.030]  Well, it was less than that.
[00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.211]  It was Saturday.
[00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:44.316]  And I put out the emergency message to Trump about how they tried to steal it from him, but he had a landslide so they couldn't stop him.
[00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:45.737]  They did steal it from Sanders.
[00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:47.759]  And now they've got all these illegals voting.
[00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:49.761]  And now they're allowing him to register to vote.
[00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:51.343]  And he needs to make a big issue out of that.
[00:19:51.343 --> 00:19:52.424]  And of course he did.
[00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.986]  Because he already sees what I see.
[00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:56.728]  And they had a conniption fed over that.
[00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:59.251]  But let me tell you, he knows what he's doing.
[00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:00.232]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:20:02.498 --> 00:20:04.160]  Is the recession really over?
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.961]  Is a bigger one on the way?
[00:20:05.961 --> 00:20:08.844]  Will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace?
[00:20:08.844 --> 00:20:11.207]  Or will it all fall apart?
[00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:13.749]  Our modern world is unpredictable and unstable.
[00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:15.130]  Are you ready for what comes next?
[00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.952]  What if the worst happens?
[00:20:16.952 --> 00:20:18.874]  Will your family have enough food?
[00:20:18.874 --> 00:20:22.618]  Willing to gamble that nothing bad will ever happen to you?

[00:23:00.677 --> 00:23:01.798]  Think about this.
[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:14.371]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:23:14.371 --> 00:23:18.395]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:52.024]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:23:52.024 --> 00:23:52.905]  For the love of clean water.
[00:24:06.004 --> 00:24:06.606]  I think.
[00:24:27.895 --> 00:24:36.099]  Alright, we are obviously going to be putting out more special reports documenting the fact that there has been organized crime against this country.
[00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:41.082]  There are federal and state election laws that say one person, one vote.
[00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:56.390]  There's the Civil Rights Act and so many other serious laws in play that it is on average a very serious felony to steal someone's vote or imply their voting but then to misdirect them or to not accept that vote.
[00:24:57.916 --> 00:25:05.600]  And I don't need the constitutional lawyers to know that, but we're actually going to be interviewing them and putting reports together and showing this to everybody.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:19.166]  Delegates on horseback used to be pledged that they would ride in and they would vote for who they had pledged.
[00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:20.487]  That's the way the system works.
[00:25:21.676 --> 00:25:27.159]  In a modern sense, they have changed the rules to claim that they can disregard the popular vote.
[00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:31.701]  But that wasn't until 1972 for the Democrats, 1976 for the Republicans.
[00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:38.744]  And I know for an audience, you already know this, I know I've hammered this, but the general public still doesn't understand this.
[00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:46.628]  And they still don't understand what happened in 10 major states that he won by landslides.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:53.344]  In other states, they were engaged in election fraud against Sanders and stole it from him as well.
[00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:59.849]  Because you'd have exit polls showing 10-15% more for Sanders, but Hillary still won.
[00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:01.830]  That's unprecedented.
[00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.333]  How Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination on a day nobody voted.
[00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:10.837]  And then zero hedge links to the Associated Press, the New York Daily News, and others.
[00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:21.993]  Where they met the night before at the Rich Donors House with the AP and others, and then they decided how she would win and what numbers to put out the next day.
[00:26:21.993 --> 00:26:23.975]  And some decided to be Bernie people!
[00:26:23.975 --> 00:26:27.057]  So, you know, there'd be percentages, isn't that cute?
[00:26:27.057 --> 00:26:30.400]  Like a little tea party, musical chairs.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:38.227]  So Obama comes out, in fact I'm going to play that clip first, in a press conference yesterday, and says, you know what?
[00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.371]  Trump's wrong that we have rigged elections.
[00:26:41.371 --> 00:26:41.871]  That's funny.
[00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:42.711]  That doesn't happen.
[00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:44.252]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:26:44.252 --> 00:26:50.274]  Local governments and local media and local communities, because he knows full well how it works.
[00:26:50.274 --> 00:26:53.535]  It was called Voter News Services until the mid-90s over lawsuits.
[00:26:53.535 --> 00:27:00.037]  It was owned by the Associated Press, which itself has been controlled by the CIA since the 40s, late 40s.
[00:27:02.546 --> 00:27:13.033]  And they will take the different conglomerates, and then they will announce who wins, and they've been caught stealing elections over and over and over again in key swing states.
[00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:16.956]  Remember 1996, what happened in Arizona?
[00:27:16.956 --> 00:27:26.222]  The exit polls all showed Buchanan with massive triple digit, and by triple digit I mean not 10, not 20, but 30 plus percentage points,
[00:27:29.437 --> 00:27:31.878]  So, this is what we're dealing with.
[00:27:31.878 --> 00:27:36.098]  And I have been sitting here watching it for 25 years from the grassroots level.
[00:27:36.098 --> 00:27:41.179]  25 years ago, I was at the election center downtown in Austin, Texas, watching election fraud.
[00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:44.240]  Experiencing it with my own eyeballs.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.441]  With Pat Buchanan getting 70-80% of the vote in the Republican primary, and on the nightly news, he didn't even get 10%.
[00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:55.562]  I remember staying up till midnight.
[00:27:55.562 --> 00:27:57.423]  And there it was, Buchanan with nothing.
[00:27:58.394 --> 00:28:03.407]  I was there at the main center looking at getting the sheets ready, getting them all stacked up to go on the computer.
[00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:05.642]  Pat Buchanan bubbled in at the top.
[00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:07.123]  Pat Buchanan bubbled in.
[00:28:07.123 --> 00:28:10.625]  You couldn't find people other than Pat Buchanan, hardly.
[00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.587]  Then I talked to everybody else and said, have you seen Pat Buchanan?
[00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:13.727]  They're like, yeah.
[00:28:13.727 --> 00:28:17.990]  You stick it in the computer, it goes on a computer tape, and by the time it came out, it was something else.
[00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.733]  And then he wants to get up here and act like, this is crazy, this is bizarre, this is weird.
[00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:25.876]  Here is the president being forced to respond.
[00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:28.737]  See, this is how Trump is changing the narrative.
[00:28:28.737 --> 00:28:30.719]  And it's how Infowars is changing the narrative.
[00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:32.220]  We're not just going to lie down, Obama.
[00:28:33.217 --> 00:28:35.358]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:28:35.358 --> 00:28:36.358]  What does that mean?
[00:28:36.358 --> 00:28:39.440]  Of course Obamacare is rigged.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.061]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[00:28:43.061 --> 00:28:44.402]  That's right, AP does.
[00:28:44.402 --> 00:28:53.285]  States and cities and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.
[00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:54.806]  And they don't even get a name now.
[00:28:54.806 --> 00:29:02.789]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated,
[00:29:04.487 --> 00:29:20.060]  Across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.801]  That's ridiculous.
[00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:23.903]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:23.903 --> 00:29:25.445]  They do not like the Texan, do they?
[00:29:27.662 --> 00:29:30.304]  I wonder who that's a message to.
[00:29:30.304 --> 00:29:31.906]  Oh boy.
[00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:32.627]  Here's another one.
[00:29:32.627 --> 00:29:34.668]  Why the AP called it for Clinton?
[00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:35.529]  Politico.
[00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:37.931]  The night before.
[00:29:37.931 --> 00:29:39.433]  Oh, but there's no election fraud.
[00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:41.935]  Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination.
[00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:43.016]  AP.
[00:29:43.016 --> 00:29:46.219]  See, we don't need any votes the day before.
[00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:49.042]  The AP announces the winner.
[00:29:49.042 --> 00:29:50.103]  Okay, that's how it works.
[00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:52.798]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.798 --> 00:29:54.099]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.099 --> 00:30:02.166]  You notice now the President has to respond to InfoWars.
[00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:04.407]  Yesterday, Dakota Meyer, a U.S.
[00:30:04.407 --> 00:30:09.391]  Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, decided to open his mouth and tweak this out.
[00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:13.154]  If real Donald Trump wants to be Commander-in-Chief, he needs to act like one.
[00:30:13.154 --> 00:30:16.637]  And that can't start until he apologizes to the cons.
[00:30:16.637 --> 00:30:19.019]  And we all know that the cons are a con job.
[00:30:19.019 --> 00:30:20.020]  They support the fact
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.323]  That his son, Captain Khan, voluntarily joined the military and fought radical Islamic terrorism and died.
[00:30:27.323 --> 00:30:31.284]  The same kind of people that Mr. Khan wants to bring into this country.
[00:30:31.284 --> 00:30:33.565]  What do you stand for, Dakota Meyer?
[00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:37.946]  I do respect the things you've done, but this, this tweet is ridiculous.
[00:30:37.946 --> 00:30:46.029]  And the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald Trump is completely and totally disgusting.
[00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:49.071]  All of the military is watching this right now.
[00:30:49.071 --> 00:30:50.192]  Our eyes are open.
[00:30:50.192 --> 00:30:51.193]  What are you going to do?
[00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:53.254]  Are you going to do the right thing and take that down?
[00:30:53.254 --> 00:30:57.777]  Or are you going to sit there and actually help out the most corrupt person ever?
[00:30:57.777 --> 00:31:01.540]  Hillary for Prison, Joe Biggs, Infowars.com, and I'm pissed off.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:10.247]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:11.068]  Here's why.
[00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:15.212]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:31:15.212 --> 00:31:16.133]  So please listen.
[00:31:16.133 --> 00:31:19.856]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:31:19.856 --> 00:31:24.300]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:24.520]  I think?
[00:31:43.447 --> 00:31:47.433]  Of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners.

[00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:20.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:25.446]  Big responsibility here at the InfoWar.
[00:33:25.446 --> 00:33:28.247]  But El Presidente's been forced to respond.
[00:33:28.247 --> 00:33:29.728]  Inveiled.
[00:33:29.728 --> 00:33:30.209]  Grimaces.
[00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:47.988]  We're here to wage war on corruption, to crash the lies and disinformation, to rally patriots against the technocracy, not just here in the United States or North America, but worldwide.
[00:33:47.988 --> 00:33:54.850]  And humans promoting commerce and free open societies and ideas.
[00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:01.052]  True liberals, true progressives, true renaissance promoters.
[00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:01.532]  In the end,
[00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:05.760]  We'll defeat the globalists and all their minions.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.421]  Ignorance and dependency is the ocean in which they swim.
[00:34:09.421 --> 00:34:10.821]  Enlightenment.
[00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:12.142]  Empowerment.
[00:34:12.142 --> 00:34:16.863]  And the stars is the sea in which we live.
[00:34:16.863 --> 00:34:19.644]  Their system is destined to fall.
[00:34:19.644 --> 00:34:23.925]  Humanity is destined with God's good graces to rise.
[00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:29.226]  But we must take that destiny and birthright in our hands.
[00:34:29.226 --> 00:34:31.287]  Now, let's go back to this clip in case you missed it.
[00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:34.914]  From a press conference with Obama.
[00:34:34.914 --> 00:34:39.736]  And of course, it came out six years ago that I'm on the White House enemies list with Matt Drudge.
[00:34:39.736 --> 00:34:43.197]  And I have gotten to experience being on the enemies list.
[00:34:43.197 --> 00:34:49.819]  And I can tell you from being at the RNC and other events, the globalists that were there, like Charlie Rose and others, are scared of us.
[00:34:49.819 --> 00:34:51.940]  And not scared of us because they think we're going to punch them in the nose.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.661]  Scared of us because they know we're aware of their operations.
[00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:57.201]  And so, here's the good news.
[00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:01.363]  We have InfoWars, last Saturday,
[00:35:02.611 --> 00:35:08.932]  I put out a special report, my emergency message to Donald Trump about election fraud, challenging him to go public and expose election fraud.
[00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:10.452]  Monday he started doing it word for word.
[00:35:10.452 --> 00:35:12.773]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:35:12.773 --> 00:35:20.274]  And not because he's getting his ideas from me, but he concurs with my analysis.
[00:35:20.274 --> 00:35:22.454]  And so do his other supporters.
[00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.955]  It's just common sense.
[00:35:24.955 --> 00:35:31.956]  Now, expanding, expanding on that.
[00:35:35.439 --> 00:35:40.341]  Now Obama is being asked about it in press conferences and is having to make a joke about it.
[00:35:40.341 --> 00:35:43.383]  So we're elevating the awareness, the consciousness of election fraud.
[00:35:43.383 --> 00:35:46.144]  I'm going to read to you from the Associated Press.
[00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:50.306]  How Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination on a day nobody voted.
[00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.927]  Politico.
[00:35:51.927 --> 00:35:54.648]  Why the AP called it for Clinton.
[00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:55.388]  AP.
[00:35:55.388 --> 00:35:59.130]  Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination.
[00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:04.913]  Hillary and the superdelegates met the night before at a rich patron's home.
[00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:24.535]  A super-packed home, and they decided that they were going to go for Hillary before they even had the election the next day, and then magically they had already apportioned the delegates that were going to go for Bernie and those that would go for Hillary, so that the public would think they were still actually voting.
[00:36:24.535 --> 00:36:31.860]  And in case anybody thought they were going to get uppity and actually have the delegates and superdelegates go with the popular vote, they had to have a meeting the night before to explain it.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.882]  See, they have to normalize it and act like it's no big deal.
[00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:40.400]  It's a psychological warfare technique.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.162]  Here's a New York Daily News article.
[00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:46.565]  Superdelegates will decide who wins the Democratic nomination.
[00:36:46.565 --> 00:37:03.599]  So I want to remind folks that when Obama's running around acting like this is kooky to say don't try to steal the general election, they certified that in the 2008 election in Ohio and other states there was total, complete fraud at the top.
[00:37:04.821 --> 00:37:18.151]  But let's go back to what Trump said a month before the emails got released that Hillary is basically running Politico, the Associated Press, ABC News, MSNBC, CNN, all of them, telling them what to do.
[00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:20.092]  That's already been known.
[00:37:20.092 --> 00:37:23.755]  They brag, they give them the questions beforehand and are given what to say.
[00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:27.157]  But now we have the emails with them directing it and telling them what to do.
[00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:29.339]  And so they had this headline, would Donald Trump
[00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.123]  Really drop out for 150 million.
[00:37:33.123 --> 00:37:36.406]  Remember they put that hoax out.
[00:37:36.406 --> 00:37:42.992]  And then the New York Times and Politico and others ask, oh, and then they have former insiders say, oh, of course he would.
[00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:58.266]  That's why he's lost hundreds of millions in businesses and lost revenue and boycotts and losing two different TV shows and everything else that made hundreds of millions of dollars because he's a principled man that spent 60 something million of his own money.
[00:37:59.048 --> 00:37:59.608]  No.
[00:37:59.608 --> 00:38:03.251]  They're putting all this out now because he raised $97 million in three weeks.
[00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:06.614]  They are totally flipping out.
[00:38:06.614 --> 00:38:09.296]  More than he raised in a year and a half before that in three weeks.
[00:38:09.296 --> 00:38:11.637]  But let's hear what he had to say.
[00:38:11.637 --> 00:38:18.562]  This story is a total fabrication from you and Politico, as usual.
[00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.803]  I will never leave the race.
[00:38:19.803 --> 00:38:23.466]  Nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[00:38:23.466 --> 00:38:26.068]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal anyway.
[00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:27.109]  Could Obama and the Clintons
[00:38:28.663 --> 00:38:30.323]  Get you to write this garbage?
[00:38:30.323 --> 00:38:33.224]  We should do a story just how Trump was right.
[00:38:33.224 --> 00:38:36.165]  In all these emails he would send to media saying, did the Clintons tell you to write this?
[00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:40.926]  I bet the Clintons told you to write this, because it turns out they did!
[00:38:40.926 --> 00:38:52.328]  And now the Sanders people have had their elections stolen from them, and we're here beating the drums saying, we're going to point this out to them so they landslide, cross over, and that's what's starting to happen, and vote for Trump.
[00:38:52.328 --> 00:38:55.189]  And so instead they have all these different polls, I showed you yesterday,
[00:38:56.528 --> 00:39:12.057]  From Reuters and others, where they will sample 659 Democrats to 450 Republicans, and then, my gosh, Hillary's winning when you sample more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:39:12.057 --> 00:39:13.958]  Wow, that's crazy.
[00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:22.143]  That'd be like if I had scales and I put 65 pounds on one and 45 pounds on the other, the 65 pound side would be on the ground.
[00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:24.533]  What?
[00:39:24.533 --> 00:39:24.954]  Really?
[00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:27.015]  You mean if I put my finger on the scale?
[00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:28.815]  You mean Hillary wins?
[00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:30.656]  And they run around, oh, she's winning, she's winning!
[00:39:30.656 --> 00:39:31.537]  Trump's dropping out!
[00:39:31.537 --> 00:39:32.537]  Trump's dropping out!
[00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:33.898]  His wife's a prostitute!
[00:39:33.898 --> 00:39:34.838]  Oh, he's racist!
[00:39:34.838 --> 00:39:36.359]  He's mean to people in Scotland!
[00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:42.821]  By the way, I've investigated the whole Scotland story, and I've got some Scottish background in me.
[00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:45.243]  Great, hard-working, tough, smart people.
[00:39:45.243 --> 00:39:47.844]  Malahind57.
[00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:52.946]  But you know any Scot will tell you they're the biggest tightwads and the worst to deal with in business to anybody probably out there on Earth.
[00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:57.892]  I mean, any Scot will tell you.
[00:39:57.892 --> 00:40:07.180]  And then once you start getting a business deal with them, they're going to try to get the upper hand on you every time.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.341]  So, that's what we're talking about here.
[00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:12.324]  It's like with Scots, they say, hey, you want to drink some beer?
[00:40:12.324 --> 00:40:13.845]  Are you buying?
[00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:15.046]  And of course, Trump gets that.
[00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:17.848]  His mom is Scottish and from Scotland.
[00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:20.090]  It's genetic.
[00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.653]  Trump is predisposed to try to get a better deal over somebody.
[00:40:23.653 --> 00:40:24.273]  That's what he does.
[00:40:25.236 --> 00:40:27.997]  But he doesn't want to screw over the country or the American people.
[00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:30.497]  And he doesn't like seeing the globalists screwing us over.
[00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:34.538]  And that's why they're so scared of him, folks.
[00:40:34.538 --> 00:40:38.479]  But it turned out when he was buying that golf course, people at first had said they'd be part of it.
[00:40:38.479 --> 00:40:44.500]  Then they started trying to get out of it or demand more from him, and he ran over them.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.401]  Now, I'm not defending the way eminent domain was handled in every case.
[00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:51.042]  But the point is, at least they weren't just taking land to give it to globalists.
[00:40:52.042 --> 00:40:54.846]  To give it to some Chinese, you know, uranium mine or something.
[00:40:54.846 --> 00:40:58.331]  He was building a hotel, building a golf course for people in that area.
[00:40:58.331 --> 00:40:59.532]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:01.094]  Is he a communist Chinese agent?
[00:41:01.094 --> 00:41:01.535]  No.
[00:41:01.535 --> 00:41:03.838]  Did he give weapons to Al-Qaeda and ISIS?
[00:41:03.838 --> 00:41:04.699]  No.
[00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:06.962]  Is he trying to shut down the free speech and take our Second Amendment?
[00:41:06.962 --> 00:41:07.083]  No.
[00:41:09.295 --> 00:41:13.138]  And the big news is we now have Obama having to respond to this.
[00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:16.240]  This is so good because there's going to be exit poll watchers.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.781]  There's going to be coverage.
[00:41:17.781 --> 00:41:25.786]  In other elections, when exit polls and local precincts are saying one thing, but then they'll announce a state.
[00:41:25.786 --> 00:41:28.588]  All of a sudden on Fox, CNN, you name it.
[00:41:28.588 --> 00:41:30.089]  Oh, the numbers are in.
[00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:31.170]  They're projecting.
[00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:35.633]  The Associated Press is projecting.
[00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:37.414]  Or state officials are projecting a
[00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:44.182]  Barack Obama win, 2012.
[00:41:44.182 --> 00:41:48.424]  And then you go burrow into those areas, and you look and it doesn't match up.
[00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:50.686]  But by then, DUN DUN DUN DUN!
[00:41:50.686 --> 00:41:52.087]  Yes, Obama re-elected!
[00:41:52.087 --> 00:41:57.530]  8 million more people vote, but Mitt Romney gets less votes.
[00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:04.355]  You really believe Mitt Romney was less popular than John McCain?
[00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:04.995]  Think about that.
[00:42:04.995 --> 00:42:09.438]  So let's go ahead and go into that Breyer patch.
[00:42:12.346 --> 00:42:13.266]  There's another headline.
[00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:14.747]  Perfect in a Democratic primary.
[00:42:14.747 --> 00:42:17.688]  Anonymous superdelegates declare winner through the media.
[00:42:17.688 --> 00:42:21.329]  Through the Associated Press.
[00:42:21.329 --> 00:42:26.430]  That was on June 7th.
[00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.790]  You understand?
[00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.211]  You get up in the morning, you hear Hillary's won before you even vote.
[00:42:31.211 --> 00:42:35.453]  And then Obama wants to sit there when he clearly stole the 2012 election.
[00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:39.714]  And by the way, Trump tweeted and wrote letters the day after saying this is clearly fraud.
[00:42:41.018 --> 00:42:46.303]  There's no way there were 8 million more votes in the general election and then Mitt Romney got less.
[00:42:46.303 --> 00:42:48.686]  They stole it from him.
[00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:51.889]  And Trump isn't going to lie down and take it, and neither are we.
[00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:55.853]  And that's why Hillary's campaign head calls it dangerous what Trump's saying.
[00:42:55.853 --> 00:42:57.515]  No, what you're doing is dangerous!
[00:42:59.378 --> 00:43:04.764]  Opening the borders up, bringing in tens of millions more illegals, people with diseases, you name it.
[00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:07.888]  Not even testing them for their own health, for heaven's sakes.
[00:43:07.888 --> 00:43:20.582]  Telling us we're racist because we don't like you operating outside the law and the Supreme Court rules you're breaking the law months ago and you accelerate bringing the illegals in from all over the world and say you'll do whatever you want.
[00:43:22.606 --> 00:43:29.653]  Oh, but you would never screw us over like the foreign insurance companies did with Obamacare written with the Republican establishment.
[00:43:29.653 --> 00:43:30.553]  That's why they hate Trump.
[00:43:30.553 --> 00:43:31.574]  He wants to repeal it.
[00:43:31.574 --> 00:43:34.877]  It's a screwjob made in hell.
[00:43:34.877 --> 00:43:36.379]  The economy is tanking.
[00:43:36.379 --> 00:43:42.685]  It's meant to take 30-something million people out of full-time employment and bring them into part-time.
[00:43:42.685 --> 00:43:46.809]  I told the story, and I'm going to play the clip.
[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:52.872]  Three, four years ago, I was going to Barton Springs during the spring and summer and fall almost every day.
[00:43:52.872 --> 00:43:54.513]  I don't ever get a chance to go there now.
[00:43:54.513 --> 00:43:57.434]  I'm so busy.
[00:43:57.434 --> 00:44:01.616]  Well, I learned just nutraceuticals is the way to lose weight instead of doing two-mile swims and not losing weight.
[00:44:01.616 --> 00:44:09.620]  But long story short, I remember the place is huge.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.941]  It's one of the biggest freshwater pools in the country or the world, really.
[00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.977]  They took them all from 40 hours down to like 20 hours and cut their pay.
[00:44:33.402 --> 00:44:56.313]  Because of Obamacare, and I'm not exaggerating, I had 20 of them or more come up to me in the next month and say, we apologize, we had no idea, we heard you on air, because the show's so popular here in Austin, saying it was going to put us to part-time, and the city told us it wouldn't, but then they did it.
[00:44:56.313 --> 00:45:00.695]  I didn't get any pleasure out of them going from being mad at me,
[00:45:04.352 --> 00:45:10.674]  Oh, there's that right-wing jerk to, oh my gosh, you're right, we apologize, what do we do?
[00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.355]  Your whole world's fake, okay?
[00:45:12.355 --> 00:45:13.235]  I'm not a right-winger.
[00:45:13.235 --> 00:45:14.016]  There's no such thing.
[00:45:14.016 --> 00:45:15.176]  It's a false paradigm.
[00:45:15.176 --> 00:45:17.677]  There's a real right and a real left within a controlled system.
[00:45:17.677 --> 00:45:21.278]  But outside of it, there's, are you for libertarian freedom?
[00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:23.259]  Or are you for command and control?
[00:45:23.259 --> 00:45:24.880]  And then it's, where do you want to be on that spectrum?
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.543]  That was the history of the world for the last 160 years, and they concocted this whole liberal-conservative paradigm to further dumb everything down.
[00:45:36.783 --> 00:45:45.511]  But let's go to the President, implying, oh, especially out of Texas, obviously a message at yours truly.
[00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:46.992]  I mean, they know where the message came from.
[00:45:46.992 --> 00:45:49.414]  The White House-run Media Matters, you know, freaked out over it.
[00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:52.317]  Dozens of newspapers we know have said, oh, God, Trump is quoting Jones.
[00:45:52.317 --> 00:45:53.157]  Exactly.
[00:45:53.157 --> 00:45:54.599]  And, you know, I think they've already figured that out.
[00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:58.262]  So, yes, that is what's happening.
[00:45:58.262 --> 00:46:00.304]  For me, it's not a power trip.
[00:46:00.304 --> 00:46:01.705]  It is a great responsibility.
[00:46:08.379 --> 00:46:13.143]  Because we're dealing with serious criminals here.
[00:46:13.143 --> 00:46:18.928]  I mean, they will obviously plan to come after me even more, especially if Hillary's victorious, or if Hillary loses.
[00:46:18.928 --> 00:46:20.089]  She'll even be more vindictive.
[00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:32.340]  I've talked to some experts in international security services, and they say undoubtedly they'd be worried, actually, if she loses.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.261]  Not if she wins, but
[00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:43.622]  I've just got to do this, and InfoWars in 21 years on air is a testament to where you can go and what you can do, even though we're this unnamed enemy.
[00:46:43.622 --> 00:46:57.117]  We would put out reports about the carbon taxes, and now they want to shut down power plants to bankrupt states, and then we get picked up by drudge and go viral, and then they would have the White House come out and say, that guy in Texas is a conspiracy theorist, we don't want carbon taxes.
[00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:02.135]  Well, everybody knows they do, so I'm the guy in Texas who's the conspiracy terrorist.
[00:47:02.135 --> 00:47:04.857]  No, I'm the guy in Texas that knows what I'm talking about.
[00:47:04.857 --> 00:47:13.385]  I'm the guy in Texas that actually doesn't go out and party all night, or go out and watch movies, or go out and play golf all day, and I'm not saying you're bad if you do, if you're a successful person.
[00:47:13.385 --> 00:47:17.469]  The point is, most people do the minimum amount of work they can, not me.
[00:47:17.469 --> 00:47:18.830]  I'm obsessed with this.
[00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:19.992]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:47:19.992 --> 00:47:21.773]  I've proven I do.
[00:47:21.773 --> 00:47:23.175]  And they're even more horrified
[00:47:24.534 --> 00:47:26.636]  That Donald Trump listens to me and others.
[00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:29.099]  Well, we're the opposition to the New World Order.
[00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:30.800]  We've done the research.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.285]  We're not just here making up something we want to believe.
[00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:40.990]  We're immersed in the data, immersed in the facts.
[00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:45.275]  And now it's up to the listeners of this broadcast to get the word out that this is a hoax that he's dropping out.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.842]  And there's going to be more hoaxes because we asked him to get involved.
[00:47:48.842 --> 00:47:55.986]  We asked him to go up against these criminals and now we're seeing the full power of the disinformation media used against Trump and his family.
[00:47:57.352 --> 00:48:01.794]  So I want to hear people admiring Trump and thanking Trump and appreciating what he's doing.
[00:48:01.794 --> 00:48:04.036]  Because we're getting to hear about the private Federal Reserve.
[00:48:04.036 --> 00:48:05.436]  We're getting to hear about rigged elections.
[00:48:05.436 --> 00:48:09.518]  We're getting to hear about one-sided trade deals and Hillary being a communist Chinese spy.
[00:48:09.518 --> 00:48:15.602]  We're getting to hear about all of how the mainstream media is involved in deception and how they're coming to an end.
[00:48:15.602 --> 00:48:21.765]  Donald Trump has absolutely paid off in spades, in triplicate, on everything he said he'd do.
[00:48:23.024 --> 00:48:28.128]  If Donald Trump was a 10-year savings bond, he would be paying back 10,000%.
[00:48:28.128 --> 00:48:39.657]  He's an absolute godsend.
[00:48:39.657 --> 00:48:40.838]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.403]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Obama responding to Trump and InfoWars.
[00:48:46.403 --> 00:48:49.645]  Particularly, you know that came out of Texas.
[00:48:49.645 --> 00:48:51.727]  Oh, the right-wingers down there.
[00:48:51.727 --> 00:48:52.647]  Oh, yes.
[00:48:52.647 --> 00:49:00.213]  The evil people that exposed the 2000 election as a fraud to Al Gore.
[00:49:00.213 --> 00:49:03.315]  I don't like Al Gore, but the fact is he did win.
[00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:04.916]  They did engage in manipulation.
[00:49:06.087 --> 00:49:08.568]  But we're seeing even bigger fraud now by the other side.
[00:49:08.568 --> 00:49:12.330]  And the Republican establishment that stole that election is now trying to block Trump.
[00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.850]  Everyone must vote for Trump.
[00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.691]  Here's the clip.
[00:49:14.691 --> 00:49:16.932]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:49:16.932 --> 00:49:20.053]  What does that mean?
[00:49:20.053 --> 00:49:21.054]  What does it mean?
[00:49:21.054 --> 00:49:24.555]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[00:49:24.555 --> 00:49:26.056]  That's right, the AP does.
[00:49:26.056 --> 00:49:30.098]  States and cities and communities all across the country
[00:49:31.055 --> 00:49:35.359]  They're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.
[00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:47.149]  And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[00:49:48.948 --> 00:50:01.734]  Including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:02.454]  That's ridiculous.
[00:50:02.454 --> 00:50:03.555]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:03.555 --> 00:50:06.936]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:50:06.936 --> 00:50:09.137]  You see how he spins all this?
[00:50:09.137 --> 00:50:12.659]  First he makes a nod to InfoWars, then we're putting conspiracy theories out.
[00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:17.461]  Then he acts like we're saying there's going to be fraud in Texas because I'm in Texas.
[00:50:19.523 --> 00:50:22.105]  I'm talking to the whole country and the whole world.
[00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:25.688]  So he makes it all geographic, and again, puts disinfo out.
[00:50:25.688 --> 00:50:27.649]  He's very highly trained.
[00:50:27.649 --> 00:50:28.650]  Like the devil.
[00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.913]  At every level, just to spew disinformation to confuse people.
[00:50:32.913 --> 00:50:33.974]  Like, hey, that's a Republican state.
[00:50:33.974 --> 00:50:35.995]  Who's claiming there's going to be election fraud there?
[00:50:35.995 --> 00:50:37.637]  Well, they are eyeing on stealing in Texas.
[00:50:38.812 --> 00:50:41.793]  Because they know Trump's got such a landslide in Florida he's gonna get it.
[00:50:41.793 --> 00:50:43.934]  He might even win battleground states like Pennsylvania.
[00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:46.374]  He's got Ohio, unless there's total fraud.
[00:50:46.374 --> 00:50:51.136]  And the word is that they're thinking about having the Cruz people and others go in and claim that's how Trump lost.
[00:50:51.136 --> 00:50:56.457]  Of course it would have been a theft, but they just want the plausible deniability for the sheeple out there.
[00:50:56.457 --> 00:50:59.498]  Then you'll get your Hillary Clinton as mentally ill as she is.
[00:51:02.222 --> 00:51:04.183]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[00:51:04.183 --> 00:51:07.944]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.

[00:53:09.997 --> 00:53:11.338]  So should your wife.
[00:53:11.338 --> 00:53:12.859]  Things aren't getting better.
[00:53:12.859 --> 00:53:14.200]  They're getting worse.

[00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:00.485]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:54:15.803 --> 00:54:26.809]  By the way, I haven't even gotten into the 400 million dollars on an airplane illegally flown to the Iranians that Obama had lied about previously.
[00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:28.790]  So the media turns it into, um...
[00:54:31.863 --> 00:54:36.626]  Trump getting confused by the news showing supposed footage of the plane when it wasn't footage.
[00:54:36.626 --> 00:54:38.007]  That's the media getting that wrong.
[00:54:38.007 --> 00:54:40.529]  But see, oh, Trump has a crooked toenail.
[00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:44.612]  He reported on it a little bit wrong about what video he saw.
[00:54:44.612 --> 00:54:45.473]  So that's what matters.
[00:54:45.473 --> 00:54:47.594]  Not Obama engaging in the crime.
[00:54:47.594 --> 00:54:51.817]  And I was just watching Hillary during a press conference or more of a press statement.
[00:54:51.817 --> 00:54:53.058]  They're totally rigged.
[00:54:53.058 --> 00:54:55.660]  And she looks like hell warmed over.
[00:54:56.621 --> 00:54:59.945]  She looks worse than she's ever looked.
[00:54:59.945 --> 00:55:04.431]  So I think time is basically running out for her, but I was talking to Don Salazar.
[00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:06.734]  Why do you think Obama is making comments about Texas?
[00:55:07.483 --> 00:55:15.246]  Well, that's because the media is all fully aware of the fact that when they talk about what we're doing, they say, oh, the conspiracy theory out of Texas.
[00:55:15.246 --> 00:55:18.248]  That's how they, that's the agreed-upon language.
[00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:20.809]  Because we're so dangerous, they dare not say our name.
[00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:23.490]  The conspiracy theory out of Texas.
[00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.491]  That Hillary had superdelegates till the election?
[00:55:25.491 --> 00:55:26.651]  That's not a fact.
[00:55:26.651 --> 00:55:28.432]  That we've had major election fraud in this country?
[00:55:28.432 --> 00:55:30.233]  A major fact.
[00:55:30.233 --> 00:55:31.814]  And see, they don't know how to deal with it.
[00:55:31.814 --> 00:55:34.555]  We had mainstream media at the DNC and RNC just marveling.
[00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:42.242]  At our readership and our traffic and the fact that it just keeps coming true what we say.
[00:55:42.242 --> 00:55:47.625]  Because, see, our narrative is actually truth-based.
[00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:49.486]  We don't get talking points from on top.
[00:55:49.486 --> 00:55:52.847]  We create the talking points off of reality.
[00:55:52.847 --> 00:55:56.349]  Does that mean we're 100% right?
[00:55:56.349 --> 00:56:00.692]  No, we're about 97% right.
[00:56:00.692 --> 00:56:02.993]  But people say, is it the right stratagem to come out and say,
[00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:06.021]  They've stolen elections before.
[00:56:06.021 --> 00:56:07.181]  Hillary stole the nomination.
[00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:08.362]  Let's stand up against her.
[00:56:08.362 --> 00:56:12.162]  And I say it's the right thing to do to defend our election system.
[00:56:12.162 --> 00:56:13.683]  So stand up and speak out against it.
[00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:24.985]  See, as soon as we stop playing along with the fantasy land, as soon as we quit trying to change the whole fraudulent system and just admit it's a fraud, it begins to fall.
[00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:26.325]  And that's what they're scared about.
[00:56:26.325 --> 00:56:28.666]  They understand what we're doing.
[00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:29.906]  We're outside their spectrum.
[00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.383]  Now, briefly, we are Losers Supported.
[00:56:34.383 --> 00:56:36.344]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:56:36.344 --> 00:56:38.966]  We've been spending a lot of money right now.

[00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:01.913]  We're good to go.
[00:57:18.564 --> 00:57:28.071]  Brain Force or DNA Force, those items are never out of stock because we hold them back for you whether you want it on 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, a year.

[00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:56.580]  Infowarshstore.com
[00:57:58.587 --> 00:57:59.688]  is the big blanket site.
[00:57:59.688 --> 00:58:02.611]  Infowarslife.com is the sub-page.
[00:58:02.611 --> 00:58:07.756]  And it is your purchases that fund this one-of-a-kind gem of an operation.
[00:58:07.756 --> 00:58:17.305]  The crew, everybody we've got here, what they're doing in the face of the programming, in the face of the brainwashing, putting out a counter-narrative so patriots worldwide know they're not alone.
[00:58:17.305 --> 00:58:21.409]  That we are the sleeping majority of humanity that is awakening.
[00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:22.710]  And that great things are happening.
[00:58:23.677 --> 00:58:25.498]  Now, we're going to have open phones in the next hour.
[00:58:25.498 --> 00:58:29.481]  I've got a bunch of special reports we haven't aired that are extremely powerful.
[00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:33.824]  We've got big jihad news, big economy news, and so much more.
[00:58:33.824 --> 00:58:34.604]  Election 2016.
[00:58:34.604 --> 00:58:36.265]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:36.265 --> 00:58:37.967]  Three hours left.
[00:58:37.967 --> 00:58:39.428]  I'll be hosting for two more hours.
[00:58:39.428 --> 00:58:42.690]  The David Knights coming in.
[00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:46.572]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.572 --> 00:58:48.093]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.043 --> 00:59:00.308]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:01.528]  A 360 win.
[00:59:01.528 --> 00:59:08.092]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:59:08.092 --> 00:59:15.616]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:21.098]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:59:21.098 --> 00:59:27.201]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:34.984]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:59:34.984 --> 00:59:41.867]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:59:41.867 --> 00:59:43.008]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:59:43.168 --> 00:59:45.591]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:47.574]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:59:47.574 --> 00:59:54.464]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:59:54.464 --> 00:59:57.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.636 --> 01:00:19.260]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:24.248]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:16.148]  Mr. President, repeatedly now Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system.
[01:01:16.148 --> 01:01:20.371]  Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way?
[01:01:20.371 --> 01:01:26.475]  And are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the election?
[01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:31.178]  And if he does win, given that you've just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American people?
[01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:38.795]  Well, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision.
[01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:39.976]  I have one vote.
[01:01:39.976 --> 01:01:41.097]  I have the same vote you do.
[01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:49.044]  I have the same vote that all the voters who are eligible all across the country have.
[01:01:49.044 --> 01:01:54.509]  I've offered my opinion, but ultimately it's the American people's decision to make collectively.
[01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:56.051]  And if somebody wins the election,
[01:01:57.159 --> 01:02:11.488]  And they are president, then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything I can to help them succeed.
[01:02:11.488 --> 01:02:18.553]  It is... I don't even really know where to start on answering this question.
[01:02:18.553 --> 01:02:20.794]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[01:02:20.794 --> 01:02:24.877]  What does that mean?
[01:02:24.877 --> 01:02:26.178]  The federal government doesn't run
[01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:29.867]  The election process.
[01:02:29.867 --> 01:02:39.170]  States and cities and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.
[01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:50.954]  And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[01:02:52.754 --> 01:03:05.544]  Including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[01:03:05.544 --> 01:03:06.264]  That's ridiculous.
[01:03:06.264 --> 01:03:07.365]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:03:07.365 --> 01:03:10.567]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[01:03:10.567 --> 01:03:14.950]  Now, we do take seriously, as we always do, our responsibilities to
[01:03:16.011 --> 01:03:19.973]  Monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process.
[01:03:19.973 --> 01:03:34.320]  If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:44.985]  If we see jurisdictions that are violating federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing
[01:03:46.565 --> 01:03:58.949]  Rants for disabled voters, or are discriminating in some fashion, or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that.
[01:03:58.949 --> 01:04:03.071]  But this will be an election like every other election.
[01:04:03.071 --> 01:04:12.674]  And, you know, I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a
[01:04:13.923 --> 01:04:16.764]  In a schoolyard or a sandbox.
[01:04:16.764 --> 01:04:21.266]  Sometimes folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated.
[01:04:21.266 --> 01:04:26.509]  But I've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over.
[01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:27.429]  Okay.
[01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:32.612]  Again, I thought you might just want to hear some of the garbage from Obama's own mouth.
[01:04:32.612 --> 01:04:37.334]  They tried to steal the delegates and said that votes didn't count.
[01:04:37.334 --> 01:04:39.175]  And they did steal it from Sanders.
[01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:41.756]  So she is an illegitimate nominee, Obama.
[01:04:43.536 --> 01:04:45.238]  He stole the nomination.
[01:04:45.238 --> 01:04:50.883]  It'd be like if she got into the championship boxing match, but it turned out the other guy had taken a dive or whatever.
[01:04:50.883 --> 01:04:53.185]  It's a fraudulent system.
[01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:55.047]  Election fraud's part of history.
[01:04:55.047 --> 01:04:56.509]  It's part of our history.
[01:04:56.509 --> 01:05:00.573]  And he should challenge it beforehand to let folks know we're watching!
[01:05:02.233 --> 01:05:07.077]  Harry Reid wants CIA to give Trump fake intelligence briefings.
[01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:21.629]  The Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said he would rather see the CIA and other intelligence agencies give GOP nominee Donald Trump fake briefings than to make sure he's informed before potentially becoming president.
[01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:30.156]  Reid suggested that it would be risky to divulge classified information pertaining to national security to Trump, so it should just be fake.
[01:05:30.156 --> 01:05:36.280]  Even more incredulous is the fact that Reid is the one accusing Trump of being, quote, dangerous.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.784]  Trump is due to receive intelligence briefings in the coming weeks, as is Clinton.
[01:05:40.964 --> 01:05:48.373]  It is standard procedure for both candidates to have limited updates so they're somewhat prepared to take office when the time comes.

[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.322]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting.

[01:06:01.886 --> 01:06:03.947]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:06:03.947 --> 01:06:05.147]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:06:05.147 --> 01:06:06.747]  Rob Due joins us.
[01:06:06.747 --> 01:06:09.868]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:06:09.868 --> 01:06:10.969]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:06:10.969 --> 01:06:11.909]  I've been working all day.
[01:06:11.909 --> 01:06:14.390]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:15.810]  I get in here at 830.
[01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:17.710]  I was kind of run down.
[01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:19.431]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:06:19.651 --> 01:06:21.532]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:06:21.532 --> 01:06:23.353]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:06:23.353 --> 01:06:24.414]  I popped two of them.
[01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.695]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:28.496]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:06:28.496 --> 01:06:30.157]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:06:30.157 --> 01:06:31.478]  People really love it.
[01:06:31.478 --> 01:06:32.078]  Read about it.
[01:06:32.078 --> 01:06:35.920]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.203]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:06:41.383 --> 01:06:45.428]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:06:45.428 --> 01:06:51.575]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:57.482]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:01.867 --> 01:07:05.851]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:05.851 --> 01:07:12.156]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:12.156 --> 01:07:19.442]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:19.442 --> 01:07:28.230]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:34.715]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:39.539]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:39.539 --> 01:07:43.142]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.023]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:46.684]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:47.865]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:47.865 --> 01:07:50.187]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:07:56.451 --> 01:08:03.453]  InfoWarsLife Secret 12.
[01:08:03.453 --> 01:08:06.474]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:08:06.474 --> 01:08:11.635]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:17.696]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:08:17.696 --> 01:08:20.757]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:08:20.757 --> 01:08:23.978]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:37.933]  Last Saturday, I came up here at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and met with one of my camera people, editors, Rob Jacobson.
[01:08:37.933 --> 01:08:43.275]  And I shot a special report that went up a few hours later and was watched several million times on Facebook.
[01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:50.219]  Listened to by millions of people here on the radio and seen by hundreds of thousands on other platforms like YouTube.
[01:08:50.219 --> 01:09:06.214]  And all I did was lay out the fact that they tried to steal the election from Trump, showed them admitting it, showed Republicans saying your vote doesn't count, showed the Democrats stealing it from Sanders saying your vote doesn't count, and I pointed out that she was an illegitimate nominee and that she would then try to steal it from Trump.
[01:09:06.214 --> 01:09:09.037]  Because at that time he was 10 points ahead in major polls.
[01:09:10.475 --> 01:09:17.560]  And I said it was important to come out with it before they artificially lowered him in the polls.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.601]  Trump came out a day and a half later.
[01:09:19.601 --> 01:09:21.042]  It's become a big national issue.
[01:09:21.042 --> 01:09:26.726]  Obama responded last night, specifically said, you know, that conspiracy theory, it comes out of Texas.
[01:09:26.726 --> 01:09:31.569]  Because, you know, don't mention InfoWars.
[01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:33.310]  As if everybody doesn't know who you're talking about.
[01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:36.292]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:40.055]  I love how animated he gets when he talks about the Texan.
[01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:44.156]  Because they cannot stand the fact that they don't control the narrative.
[01:09:44.156 --> 01:09:58.145]  It's like when they ordered Robert Gibbs as press secretary to get up on TV for three years and say, there is no drone program, there is no assassination program, when it was admitted and public years before.
[01:09:58.145 --> 01:10:05.050]  Vladimir Putin has come out and talked about the superdelegates on CNN, foreign CNN panels.
[01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:10.234]  They have CNN International with Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg globalist.
[01:10:11.027 --> 01:10:14.609]  And just laughs at him and says, you know, your superdelegates decide things.
[01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:15.629]  This is ridiculous.
[01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:16.610]  He should know.
[01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:22.912]  Under the old Soviet Union, you had a central committee that was handing down power since 1917.
[01:10:22.912 --> 01:10:24.433]  No elections.
[01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:29.295]  And then they would choose who could run for president.
[01:10:29.295 --> 01:10:31.256]  But then, of course, everybody knew who was going to win.
[01:10:31.256 --> 01:10:32.657]  It was whoever was favored.
[01:10:32.657 --> 01:10:34.277]  Joe Stalin or whoever.
[01:10:34.277 --> 01:10:36.358]  You go to China, it's even worse.
[01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:37.479]  They have a central committee.
[01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:45.800]  That then lets the Politburo vote on who the president is.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.282]  Couple hundred people.
[01:10:48.282 --> 01:10:53.064]  And you look at who runs things in China, it's the generals, it's the communists, it's the people in the party.
[01:10:53.064 --> 01:10:54.685]  They own the factories.
[01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.926]  There's thousands of billionaires over there.
[01:10:56.926 --> 01:10:58.667]  It's crazy.
[01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:01.868]  But they're communists.
[01:11:01.868 --> 01:11:03.869]  They're slave masters is what they are.
[01:11:03.869 --> 01:11:07.391]  So Obama's trying to act like it's crazy that we'd raise this.
[01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:08.892]  See, here's the deal.
[01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:19.593]  If we play along with fraud like Mitt Romney, or like John McCain, or others, or even Al Gore, who had the election stolen from him, as much as I hate him, it's a fact.
[01:11:19.593 --> 01:11:22.093]  It's fact!
[01:11:22.093 --> 01:11:24.374]  If we go along with it, they get away with it.
[01:11:24.374 --> 01:11:30.075]  But if we don't go along with it, it will bring down this corrupt, illegitimate system.
[01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:39.057]  If they would have allowed Trump to have his superdelegates taken, if those superdelegates put in by the party would have been allowed to block the regular votes of the delegates,
[01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:51.395]  You'd have a precedent for a new open imperium of the Republican and Democratic parties ruling the nation and sharing power openly and ending the popular vote as we know it.
[01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:56.258]  That was such an incredible attempt and they succeeded on the Democrat side.
[01:11:58.374 --> 01:12:10.083]  Now the Republican insiders are still trying to sabotage Trump after, saying, oh, he's going to drop out any day, oh, he can't raise money, precisely because he raised a record $97 million in three weeks.
[01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:16.948]  He raised $60 million in the year before that, plus a year and a half before that.
[01:12:16.948 --> 01:12:18.509]  He matched it with his own $60 million.
[01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:23.521]  So he had $120 million in a year and a half.
[01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:27.264]  He raised $97 million.
[01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:28.585]  It's incredible.
[01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:31.367]  But suddenly, in the last two days, he's raised almost nothing.
[01:12:31.367 --> 01:12:33.589]  It's like the spigot was turned off.
[01:12:33.589 --> 01:12:37.152]  And Roger Stone was in California a few days ago when this was happening.
[01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:39.013]  And the donors were saying, I'm not going to give.
[01:12:39.013 --> 01:12:39.714]  He's going to drop out.
[01:12:42.188 --> 01:12:43.329]  It worked on them.
[01:12:43.329 --> 01:12:43.589]  See?
[01:12:43.589 --> 01:12:46.390]  This is war, people.
[01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:47.811]  And we know how they operate.
[01:12:47.811 --> 01:12:49.092]  We've done the studying.
[01:12:49.092 --> 01:12:50.332]  We're not special.
[01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:59.197]  The average man who's watched baseball for 20 years and knows everything about it, if he put that into, say, stock market research, he'd be incredibly wealthy with small investments.
[01:12:59.197 --> 01:13:05.700]  If you put political knowledge, if you study oil painting, you're going to become successful.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.941]  We've studied how things really work.
[01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:09.422]  We've read the hundreds of books.
[01:13:09.422 --> 01:13:10.903]  We've interviewed the thousands of guests.
[01:13:12.386 --> 01:13:15.449]  We know the program.
[01:13:15.449 --> 01:13:20.774]  When I explain this to people, it's so you understand, we're not up here winging this broadcast.
[01:13:20.774 --> 01:13:24.858]  I'm not up here just hoping I know how things work.
[01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:26.740]  Oh, I know how the shadow government works.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.702]  I know how the intelligence agencies work.
[01:13:28.702 --> 01:13:30.644]  I know how the whole military system works.
[01:13:30.644 --> 01:13:32.966]  I know how the special interests are controlling the nation.
[01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:34.208]  I know what their goals are.
[01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.289]  Because here's the issue.
[01:13:36.482 --> 01:13:52.009]  The New World Order is so arrogant and thought they had this so sewn up that the last 50 years they've written hundreds of books, hundreds and thousands of white papers admitting the whole stinking plan.
[01:13:52.009 --> 01:13:54.190]  And I have read most of them.
[01:13:54.190 --> 01:14:03.014]  I'll be honest, the last decade or so I've been so busy covering news and research and family, I rarely go get, you know, oh my gosh, Brzezinski has a new book out admitting world government and the plan to exterminate people.
[01:14:04.363 --> 01:14:05.664]  I actually went and bought the book and read it.
[01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:08.486]  The last one, like two, three years ago.
[01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:10.547]  I mean, I remember memoirs came out like a decade ago.
[01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:15.771]  David Rockefeller inventing world government and the plan to bring in planetary rule and in-nation states.
[01:14:15.771 --> 01:14:23.616]  And if you believe he's doing that, he says guilty as charged.
[01:14:23.616 --> 01:14:24.917]  Tragedy and hope.
[01:14:24.917 --> 01:14:26.118]  Between Two Ages.
[01:14:26.118 --> 01:14:27.439]  The Technotronic Era.
[01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:32.062]  The Anglo-American Establishment.
[01:14:32.062 --> 01:14:32.823]  Ecoscience.
[01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:40.517]  Then you go read a book like None Dare Call a Conspiracy, written by the father of the guy that runs Politico.
[01:14:40.517 --> 01:14:46.141]  Talk about turning your back on your father.
[01:14:46.141 --> 01:14:47.262]  And he writes it.
[01:14:47.262 --> 01:14:48.464]  It's all their own statements.
[01:14:48.464 --> 01:14:50.746]  That's why the book's totally true.
[01:14:50.746 --> 01:14:54.088]  You want to read a 200-page book or less, you'll understand everything.
[01:14:54.088 --> 01:14:57.171]  I read that thing when I was like 10 or 11 years old.
[01:14:57.171 --> 01:15:01.955]  And I'm sitting here, watching their whole plan unfold, and I've got their playbook.
[01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:03.196]  And anyone could have their playbook.
[01:15:03.991 --> 01:15:06.511]  You just have to go actually read what they said they do.
[01:15:06.511 --> 01:15:09.492]  And then you sit back and you're like, whoa, they're really doing it.
[01:15:09.492 --> 01:15:12.192]  And then you go, next step, forced sterilization.
[01:15:12.192 --> 01:15:13.853]  Next step, forced labor.
[01:15:13.853 --> 01:15:16.173]  Next step, national compulsory service.
[01:15:16.173 --> 01:15:18.474]  Next step, reducing the language.
[01:15:18.474 --> 01:15:20.754]  Next step, creating a one world religion.
[01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:27.175]  Next step, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:28.675]  And then you realize you don't have a choice.
[01:15:28.675 --> 01:15:30.376]  We've got to stand up against this.
[01:15:30.376 --> 01:15:31.456]  The toll free number to join us.
[01:15:32.378 --> 01:15:40.923]  On this subject or any other you want to discuss is 800-259-9231.
[01:15:40.923 --> 01:15:41.203]  800-259-9231.
[01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.323]  First time callers.
[01:15:42.323 --> 01:15:43.664]  800-259-9231.
[01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:52.088]  William Benny's going to pop in for 30 minutes, former technical leader of the National Security Agency, to elaborate on his statement that they've got all of Hillary's emails.
[01:15:52.088 --> 01:15:53.069]  That's been big national news.
[01:15:53.069 --> 01:15:55.870]  We're going to have an in-depth discussion of it coming up in T-minus 45 minutes.
[01:15:58.527 --> 01:16:01.910]  But let's get to these clips for the new audience that may have tuned in in the second hour.
[01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:02.891]  Plus one of these I haven't played.
[01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:07.114]  It's of Putin saying what I just talked about.
[01:16:07.114 --> 01:16:13.880]  Here's Trump, one of three times he said this week that the whole election has been rigged.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.161]  He's afraid they're gonna try to rig this one.
[01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:17.083]  Here it is.
[01:16:17.083 --> 01:16:23.789]  We got almost 14 million votes.
[01:16:23.789 --> 01:16:24.609]  Think of that.
[01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:25.831]  More than anybody
[01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:35.314]  In the history of Republican primaries, that includes some great people like Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the Second World War, right?
[01:16:35.314 --> 01:16:37.795]  He did win the Second World War.
[01:16:37.795 --> 01:16:40.056]  Got elected because he won the Second World War.
[01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:41.096]  I got more votes than him.
[01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.237]  That's good, right?
[01:16:43.237 --> 01:16:46.259]  And remember this, I had 17 people.
[01:16:46.259 --> 01:16:47.999]  I didn't, I wasn't running against two people.
[01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:48.520]  I had 17 people.
[01:16:50.097 --> 01:16:55.861]  Hillary Clinton, I got a similar number to Hillary Clinton, and she had Bernie, and she had a hard time putting Bernie away.
[01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:59.865]  And Bernie, poor Bernie, he looks so upset.
[01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:01.286]  You know what?
[01:17:01.286 --> 01:17:03.167]  He made a mistake.
[01:17:03.167 --> 01:17:04.448]  He shouldn't have made a deal.
[01:17:04.448 --> 01:17:06.570]  Sometimes, he lost, he lost.
[01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.891]  First of all, it's rigged.
[01:17:07.891 --> 01:17:10.413]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[01:17:11.243 --> 01:17:13.725]  Because I think my side was rigged.
[01:17:13.725 --> 01:17:21.030]  If I didn't win by massive landslides, I mean, think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78%.
[01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:24.893]  That's with other people in the race.
[01:17:24.893 --> 01:17:25.854]  All right.
[01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:32.079]  And then he's elaborated since then on other shows like Hannity that, hey, they've got illegals voting 10 times each.
[01:17:32.079 --> 01:17:34.941]  This is all confirmed.
[01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:39.584]  Now, let's hear from Obama again briefly, where he makes a big joke out of this and says, by the way, it's coming out of Texas.
[01:17:39.584 --> 01:17:39.905]  Here it is.
[01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:43.859]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.560]  What does that mean?
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.981]  What does it mean?
[01:17:47.981 --> 01:17:51.302]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[01:17:51.302 --> 01:17:53.003]  The Associated Press does.
[01:17:53.003 --> 01:18:02.326]  States and cities and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.
[01:18:02.326 --> 01:18:11.410]  And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated,
[01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:28.677]  Across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[01:18:28.677 --> 01:18:29.418]  That's ridiculous.
[01:18:29.418 --> 01:18:30.498]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.280]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[01:18:32.816 --> 01:18:37.959]  Oh yeah, no one takes it seriously that there's election fraud going on in the world.
[01:18:37.959 --> 01:18:47.905]  Now here's Vladimir Putin a few months ago on a big CNN panel with Fareed Zarqari, there's a bunch of other TV networks there, talking about election fraud here in the United States.
[01:18:49.398 --> 01:18:54.701]  See, America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[01:18:54.701 --> 01:18:59.884]  But what, you actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:01.144]  This is the truth.
[01:19:01.144 --> 01:19:04.726]  Look, twice in the U.S.
[01:19:04.726 --> 01:19:14.591]  history, president was chosen not by the majority voters, but by the superdelegates.
[01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:15.712]  Is that democratic?
[01:19:19.564 --> 01:19:22.486]  And when we try to discuss this with our U.S.
[01:19:22.486 --> 01:19:32.092]  colleagues, and we do not criticize, but merely have a discussion, they say, mind your own business, this is how we do it.
[01:19:32.092 --> 01:19:35.115]  Well then, why are you interfering in our business?
[01:19:35.115 --> 01:19:36.656]  Don't meddle in our business.
[01:19:36.656 --> 01:19:38.697]  Sort out your own issues first.
[01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:43.240]  But I repeat again, it is in fact not our business what's going on in U.S.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:43.681]  elections.
[01:19:45.024 --> 01:19:52.029]  In fact, there are reports even of prosecuting attorneys not allowing international observers into U.S.
[01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:53.791]  polling stations.
[01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:56.773]  And they threaten with jail time.
[01:19:56.773 --> 01:19:58.674]  But that's their problem to sort out.
[01:19:58.674 --> 01:20:00.136]  That's how they do it.
[01:20:00.136 --> 01:20:02.397]  They like it that way.
[01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:06.240]  America is a great superpower.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.702]  Perhaps the only superpower of present time.
[01:20:08.702 --> 01:20:10.623]  All right, that's good.
[01:20:10.623 --> 01:20:13.986]  So the whole world knows about the famous election fraud here.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.922]  And Obama wants you to sit there and make a big joke out of it.
[01:20:18.922 --> 01:20:20.323]  And then he knows how people think.
[01:20:20.323 --> 01:20:23.165]  It's like when somebody says, hey, they're trying to bankrupt coal.
[01:20:23.165 --> 01:20:24.766]  And somebody will say to me, well, I don't own any coal stock.
[01:20:24.766 --> 01:20:25.506]  Why do I care?
[01:20:25.506 --> 01:20:27.848]  Because your electricity is going to skyrocket.
[01:20:27.848 --> 01:20:29.969]  It's going to hurt the general economy.
[01:20:29.969 --> 01:20:33.511]  So he says, besides, that guy's down in Texas saying this.
[01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:34.852]  I mean, Republicans run that state.
[01:20:34.852 --> 01:20:36.473]  What are you worried about election fraud?
[01:20:36.473 --> 01:20:38.715]  As if it's not the whole country we're worried about.
[01:20:38.715 --> 01:20:40.115]  They always play these games.
[01:20:40.115 --> 01:20:42.477]  I'm telling you, Obama is scientifically trained.
[01:20:45.282 --> 01:20:49.123]  This is so incredibly important.
[01:20:49.123 --> 01:20:50.364]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:20:50.364 --> 01:20:53.405]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:20:53.405 --> 01:21:03.268]  They've got Democratic Party operatives I'm going to get to running around claiming Trump wants to have a civil emergency if he doesn't win the election.
[01:21:03.268 --> 01:21:10.790]  But meanwhile, that's what Obama and others have been prepping and getting ready for and trying to foment the cop-killing activity and the civil war.
[01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:12.771]  I mean, it's clear who the bad guys are here.
[01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:16.893]  And it's clear who's trying to stop this and trying to countermand it.
[01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:22.215]  I mean, that's why I'm desperately for all the problems we have in government and all the corruption in America.
[01:21:22.215 --> 01:21:24.557]  God knows we're slouching towards Gomorrah.
[01:21:24.557 --> 01:21:29.679]  I've reached out to police and military because they're going to be asked to carry out this evil.
[01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:32.180]  And I've tried to say, look at who runs you.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:32.921]  They're the globalists.
[01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:33.941]  They're the bad guys.
[01:21:33.941 --> 01:21:36.243]  It was in two mainstream news articles yesterday.
[01:21:36.243 --> 01:21:38.123]  In fact, you guys pulled from the stack.
[01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:39.024]  I'm sorry I didn't cover it.
[01:21:40.014 --> 01:21:51.218]  That okay, the UN really is going to run the local police review boards and have federal oversight, and if they recommend the Justice Department comes in, they're going to come after the police.
[01:21:51.218 --> 01:21:53.818]  A, that's incredible.
[01:21:53.818 --> 01:21:55.019]  The Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:21:55.019 --> 01:22:03.461]  But B, we've gotten to the point where I see it, and they expand it, and I don't even respond to it.
[01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:05.522]  That shows I'm being conditioned.
[01:22:05.522 --> 01:22:07.903]  I'm losing.
[01:22:07.903 --> 01:22:08.523]  I'm being broken.
[01:22:10.854 --> 01:22:16.815]  And I'm going to be conscious of that, and I'm going to get upset, and I'm going to do something about it.
[01:22:16.815 --> 01:22:23.136]  I mean, I'll tell you, I have had so much energy lately, I have been bouncing off the walls, because this is history.
[01:22:23.136 --> 01:22:35.419]  And then to have the responsibility to know that we really do have millions and millions of new viewers and listeners that are coming through every day, and that people now are listening, and that world leaders are listening, and that we're having an effect,
[01:22:36.614 --> 01:22:44.199]  If folks just duplicate our system of research, it's game over for the New World Order.
[01:22:44.199 --> 01:22:52.884]  See, I'm the opposite of talk show hosts who are like, hey, that's my material, or hey, give me attention for that, or cover what I'm doing, or I don't want you to go on that show.
[01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:56.166]  I'm about beating the New World Order.
[01:22:56.166 --> 01:23:01.629]  I'm about trying to educate people to understand what's going on.
[01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:04.851]  The globalists want to keep you in the dark and keep you stupid because they're parasites.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.768]  But it is an epic time to be alive, and it's very, very stressful.
[01:23:15.998 --> 01:23:17.659]  To have this kind of responsibility.
[01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:20.261]  But I'm here to tell you, you have that responsibility as well.
[01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:40.737]  I have taken this responsibility on and I pray to God every day that if it's God's will that I be given the information, the oratory skill, and the will, and the managerial skills, and the interpersonal skills to be able to hold this together and create a system to try to actively resist the globalists and to try to educate the public in the belief that if the public is ever given
[01:23:41.789 --> 01:23:50.673]  basic information on how the system works and where it's taking them they're going to say no to it in mass and that is happening.
[01:23:50.673 --> 01:24:08.781]  But the New World Order is extremely predatory and it's very good at getting us in a whole false left-right debate with their false left and their false right minions who battle over control over the system but who are all cogs and servants and officers of that system.
[01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:32.119]  And I'm only reaching out and saying to people that are in the system, whether they're journalists, or police, or doctors, or corporate officers, or COG-type people, you know this program leads us towards deindustrialization, a post-industrial world, a planetary world government, a total tyranny.
[01:24:32.119 --> 01:24:37.461]  And do you want to be a manager in that horrible system, and do you want that bad
[01:24:42.816 --> 01:24:45.557]  Spiritual behavior on you.
[01:24:45.557 --> 01:24:49.178]  Plus, most of you know you're going to get ground up by this down the road anyways.
[01:24:49.178 --> 01:24:52.760]  It's for your own selfish interest to not go with this.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.560]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.521]  I don't know how anybody could sign on to this world government.
[01:24:56.521 --> 01:25:06.425]  I mean, this thing isn't taking us to Star Trek and Life Extension and happiness and, you know, the New World Order is taking out radical Islam and, you know, bringing freedom to those countries.
[01:25:06.425 --> 01:25:09.006]  No, they're putting radical Islam in to suppress people.
[01:25:11.667 --> 01:25:13.628]  The world government is out to get us.
[01:25:13.628 --> 01:25:16.210]  It's evil!
[01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:21.233]  How could you not want to throw yourself against it?
[01:25:21.233 --> 01:25:26.097]  Every fiber of my being is just, oh my gosh, this is really evil.
[01:25:26.097 --> 01:25:28.878]  How do I figure out how to stop it?
[01:25:28.878 --> 01:25:31.060]  And I tell you, I should be very, very excited.
[01:25:33.496 --> 01:25:58.406]  And I have been at certain levels to know that InfoWars is broken through, not just here, but globally, and that our information, accurate information, most of it the enemy's own statements, has now penetrated and has now hit an absorption rate in power structures, especially security services worldwide, and it's causing a decompartmentalization that's causing mass awakening.
[01:26:00.379 --> 01:26:17.424]  And I'm very proud of the fact that InfoWars has been able to, at least at some level, find the lever, find the right domino, to start the chain reaction of the life force, the survival instinct, the Renaissance spirit, to start rising again.
[01:26:17.424 --> 01:26:22.686]  The life force, the innovation.
[01:26:22.686 --> 01:26:28.688]  And the enemy can feel that spirit rising as well, and the enemy's rising to meet it, and it is just an incredible time to be alive.
[01:26:30.916 --> 01:26:36.480]  I'm going to come back, play a brief special report dealing with election fraud and why Donald Trump's right.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:44.106]  It's really Donald Trump's statement on where he stands on dropping out of the race and that whole hoax.
[01:26:44.106 --> 01:26:49.970]  And then we will go to your phone calls, Richard and Ryan and Chris and Morrison and Brian and others.
[01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:53.693]  Briefly, let me just plug now so I don't have to do it when I come back.
[01:26:53.693 --> 01:26:54.834]  We got great products.
[01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:55.575]  They're the very best.
[01:26:56.656 --> 01:26:58.217]  Supplements we could come up with.
[01:26:58.217 --> 01:27:06.000]  Some of them are famous private labels from some of the biggest organic producers in the country, and then we just discount it five to ten percent.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:06.561]  Okay?
[01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:11.943]  Stuff like Child-Ease or the Oregano, things like that.
[01:27:11.943 --> 01:27:16.986]  But DNA Force is its own proprietary super nutraceutical.
[01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:20.347]  Leading competitors, again, can be $400, $500 for what you're getting in this.
[01:27:20.347 --> 01:27:22.048]  It's $94 right now.
[01:27:22.048 --> 01:27:25.290]  One ingredient is like $40 or more, the BioPQQ.
[01:27:27.202 --> 01:27:32.224]  People sell synthetic Bio-PQQ for like 50 bucks a bottle and it's a lower dose than what we put in this.
[01:27:32.224 --> 01:27:36.726]  That's why at $94.47 it is the best deal you'll ever find.
[01:27:36.726 --> 01:27:38.887]  Now we've got other products like Colloidal Silver for $19.95.
[01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:40.548]  That's a great deal.
[01:27:40.548 --> 01:27:41.988]  We've got other products as low as $9.95.
[01:27:41.988 --> 01:27:46.450]  We've got Brain Force for $17.76 but it's about to sell out.
[01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:47.691]  Only $29.95.
[01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:49.031]  Great way to experience that.
[01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:50.632]  Super Male, Super Female Vitality.
[01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:53.113]  Lung Cleanse.
[01:27:53.113 --> 01:27:54.674]  We have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:27:56.809 --> 01:27:57.129]  30% off.
[01:27:57.129 --> 01:28:02.473]  And of course, I should just say up front, it's free shipping on everything and infowarestore.com right now.
[01:28:02.473 --> 01:28:10.259]  Free shipping storewide, but also free shipping on things like Rainforce, that's 40% off.
[01:28:10.259 --> 01:28:18.405]  You sign up for AutoShip, you can get the next one at that same price and get 10% off on your order as well in the next order.
[01:28:18.405 --> 01:28:21.187]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:28:21.187 --> 01:28:23.849]  Whether it's Secret 12, True Vitamin B12, Methylcobalamin,
[01:28:24.608 --> 01:28:33.813]  Or whether it's winter sun, incredible concentrated vitamin organic D3, whether it's the joint formula, the bone formula, those are together discounted.
[01:28:33.813 --> 01:28:36.414]  Whether it's knockout, $19.95.
[01:28:36.414 --> 01:28:40.876]  They have the same dose of melatonin, usually $19.95, sometimes a little bit lower.
[01:28:40.876 --> 01:28:44.318]  This has, what is it, eight or nine other ingredients like L-tryptophan.
[01:28:46.215 --> 01:28:51.080]  And, uh, valerian root and everything else in there to help, give you natural help, the deep sleep.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:51.700]  Here it is.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:55.984]  You get something that's the same price for the same melatonin.
[01:28:55.984 --> 01:28:59.568]  It'd be a good deal in 1995 for a bottle of melatonin like this.
[01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:00.489]  But it's the same dose.
[01:29:00.489 --> 01:29:03.151]  It's just filler in the other melatonins you see.
[01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:04.913]  It's a big capsule and it's the same dose.
[01:29:04.913 --> 01:29:06.294]  It's a bunch of filler.
[01:29:06.294 --> 01:29:06.694]  Not ours.
[01:29:06.694 --> 01:29:07.275]  It's melatonin.
[01:29:11.727 --> 01:29:14.908]  We're not selling fillers here, because I won't want that myself.
[01:29:14.908 --> 01:29:17.830]  I want stuff I would use, that I do use.
[01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:18.590]  You understand how that works?
[01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:22.351]  See, I'm not, I don't think I get ahead screwing you over.
[01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:26.273]  I get ahead offering you a really good deal, so you keep coming back over and over again.
[01:29:27.358 --> 01:29:32.239]  Now, separately in business, though, I do do things with people where I hammer them to get the lowest price.
[01:29:32.239 --> 01:29:33.340]  But that's free market.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.060]  That's innovation.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.420]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:44.723]  But we need to bring in a lot of capital here to be able to have the reporters, hire new reporters, get more crew, more writers, more researchers, and to be able to move forward against the New World Order.
[01:29:44.723 --> 01:29:50.485]  So, no, when you buy stuff at InfoWarsTore.com, you are involved in buying war bonds against the New World Order.
[01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.645]  It's an absolute patriotic duty.
[01:29:51.645 --> 01:29:53.125]  And I want to thank you all.
[01:29:55.993 --> 01:29:56.854]  We're good to go.
[01:30:17.697 --> 01:30:24.841]  On January 8, 2014, a complainant filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race.
[01:30:24.841 --> 01:30:34.247]  In the fall of 2013, a co-worker repeatedly wore a cap to work with insignia of the Gadsden flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the face.
[01:30:34.247 --> 01:30:35.668]  Don't tread on me!
[01:30:35.668 --> 01:30:44.834]  Complainants stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[01:30:45.094 --> 01:30:52.600]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden flag originated in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.301]  Boom!
[01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:54.021]  Facts!
[01:30:54.021 --> 01:30:54.682]  Boom!
[01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:55.783]  Liberals down!
[01:30:55.783 --> 01:31:00.306]  This has been Joe Big, serving you some information at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:00.306 --> 01:31:00.687]  Enjoy!
[01:31:02.514 --> 01:31:03.955]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:31:03.955 --> 01:31:05.275]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:31:05.275 --> 01:31:06.475]  Why is this so good?
[01:31:06.475 --> 01:31:11.757]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:31:11.757 --> 01:31:25.300]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.661]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:31:27.461 --> 01:31:29.102]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:31:29.102 --> 01:31:31.664]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:31:31.664 --> 01:31:32.985]  These are all parasites.
[01:31:32.985 --> 01:31:34.085]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:31:34.085 --> 01:31:35.406]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:31:35.406 --> 01:31:39.929]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:31:39.929 --> 01:31:43.071]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:31:43.191 --> 01:31:46.232]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:31:46.232 --> 01:31:47.292]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:49.233]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:49.233 --> 01:31:50.253]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.538]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:32:03.538 --> 01:32:05.019]  You can't survive without it.
[01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.219]  But where do you get it?

[01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:20.522]  Big Brother.
[01:33:20.522 --> 01:33:22.303]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:22.303 --> 01:33:24.224]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:25.885]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:25.885 --> 01:33:27.546]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.546 --> 01:33:34.290]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:35.150]  Take me to the center!
[01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:39.773]  Take me through the centuries to supersonic years!
[01:33:42.298 --> 01:33:51.284]  You know there's this new thing I saw where this black congressman put out an ad and said everyone is welcome to apply but straight white males.
[01:33:51.284 --> 01:34:05.954]  That's on Infowars.com and then I read where all over the place this is the new movement is for blacks and others to self-segregate and then to be allowed to discriminate and then the feds and the EEOC don't block it.
[01:34:05.954 --> 01:34:07.715]  I mean this is really getting crazy.
[01:34:10.265 --> 01:34:14.707]  Hillary refuses to meet white reporters in first press conference in 2016.
[01:34:14.707 --> 01:34:23.170]  Clinton hasn't held a press conference since December of 2015, nine months ago, eight and a half months ago.
[01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:32.674]  And then there's a whole stack of news I've got here with similar stuff going on.
[01:34:32.674 --> 01:34:34.275]  It's just crazy.
[01:34:34.275 --> 01:34:38.517]  And again, it's invoking classical racist behavior.
[01:34:40.882 --> 01:34:49.624]  But on the side of minorities, but it's directed by the weirdo Democratic Party that always ran race-based politics in this country before.
[01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:52.965]  And you can really see the sophisticated double-cross they've engaged in.
[01:34:52.965 --> 01:34:55.685]  And of course, the people engaging in race behavior aren't going to go anywhere with it.
[01:34:55.685 --> 01:34:57.426]  It's not going to help them.
[01:34:57.426 --> 01:35:00.126]  It's just going to create more and more balkanization in this country.
[01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:04.467]  It's so incredibly cold-blooded.
[01:35:04.467 --> 01:35:07.168]  Here's some of the articles that are up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:09.085 --> 01:35:09.685]  U.N.
[01:35:09.685 --> 01:35:13.767]  backs secret Obama takeover of police.
[01:35:13.767 --> 01:35:14.307]  But it's not.
[01:35:14.307 --> 01:35:19.308]  Breitbart reports it's called Strong Cities Initiative six months ago and it says the U.N.
[01:35:19.308 --> 01:35:23.990]  will oversee the police departments.
[01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:25.170]  And they've got the U.N.
[01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:26.791]  going after Arpaio and the U.N.
[01:35:26.791 --> 01:35:33.393]  investigating the Texas governor because, oh, they dare arrest illegals.
[01:35:33.393 --> 01:35:36.194]  That's just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:36.194 --> 01:35:37.214]  Again, William Binney, former
[01:35:38.613 --> 01:35:41.235]  Leader of the NSA, he actually ran the NSA spying.
[01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:45.499]  He wasn't the political leader of it, but the technical director.
[01:35:45.499 --> 01:35:55.467]  He came out last week and said, or earlier this week, and said on WABC, Aaron Klein's program, that, hey listen, they already got all Hillary's emails to the NSA.
[01:35:55.467 --> 01:35:56.168]  They save all of it.
[01:35:57.762 --> 01:36:01.905]  So he's gonna be talking about that in more detail, but I'm gonna go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:36:01.905 --> 01:36:06.648]  First, Richard in Maryland, and then Ryan, Chris, Morris, and Ryan, and others.
[01:36:06.648 --> 01:36:15.034]  But the big issue here is this video just went live at InfoWars.com, and everybody needs to see it.
[01:36:15.034 --> 01:36:23.380]  Everybody needs to understand it, because they're saying Trump hasn't responded to the two days of them claiming he's dropped out.
[01:36:24.795 --> 01:36:29.288]  And the truth is, he did respond two nights ago saying the campaign's never been more unified.
[01:36:31.832 --> 01:36:35.635]  And he responded earlier, when they were saying it, that it was preposterous and ridiculous.
[01:36:35.635 --> 01:36:40.718]  But I do think we need to see a strong reaction from him to talk about why they're doing it.
[01:36:40.718 --> 01:36:46.222]  Just like saying Ben Carson dropped out and tied into the fake Reuters polls, sampling 15% more Hillary.
[01:36:46.222 --> 01:36:53.027]  So folks, understand, they're rigging everything, and he's absolutely on target to say he thinks they're going to try to rig the general election.
[01:36:53.027 --> 01:36:59.852]  And you talk about it beforehand, so there's sunshine and light on it, so that they can't steal it as easily.
[01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:04.035]  Here's that special report.
[01:37:04.035 --> 01:37:06.116]  In the history of U.S.
[01:37:06.116 --> 01:37:14.603]  politics, we have never seen more dirty tricks in an election season than we're now seeing in 2015-2016.
[01:37:14.603 --> 01:37:25.872]  We witnessed Bernie Sanders win more than 10 states, including California and New Hampshire, and defeat Hillary soundly, and the superdelegates simply stepped in and said, the popular vote doesn't count.
[01:37:26.787 --> 01:37:35.311]  The Republican party tried it with Donald Trump, but he wanted such landslides and didn't stand down and didn't go along with it.
[01:37:35.311 --> 01:37:38.712]  He didn't accept the theft of our electoral system in this country.
[01:37:38.712 --> 01:37:40.353]  And so he became the nominee.
[01:37:40.353 --> 01:37:50.938]  Now the very same Republican establishment with the Democrats has been putting out for two days, the lying rumor that Donald Trump is going to drop out and that Donald Trump is in all this trouble.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:56.082]  I've talked to the inside sources and my instincts were right about why this is happening.
[01:37:56.082 --> 01:38:03.227]  He raised $97 million in just a month and scared the hell out of them.
[01:38:03.227 --> 01:38:05.488]  Almost all of it grassroots donations.
[01:38:05.488 --> 01:38:06.889]  This is so historical.
[01:38:06.889 --> 01:38:12.152]  So they're putting out that he's dropping out just like in Iowa when Ben Carson was going to be.
[01:38:13.695 --> 01:38:21.743]  The establishment Republican Ted Cruz, as soon as Carson's plane took off that afternoon, they went on TV and said, Carson says he's quitting.
[01:38:21.743 --> 01:38:23.084]  Vote for Ted Cruz now.
[01:38:23.084 --> 01:38:24.966]  And Ted Cruz came in second in Iowa.
[01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:27.448]  This is a much bigger scandal than that.
[01:38:27.448 --> 01:38:30.571]  And so I want to play a clip here of Trump.
[01:38:31.536 --> 01:38:37.181]  Two nights ago, in Daytona, Florida, saying our campaign's never been better, we're doing great.
[01:38:37.181 --> 01:38:45.489]  Because he thought he didn't have to respond that hard to a pure lie, because he'd already responded to it in the past, in June.
[01:38:45.489 --> 01:38:48.752]  So I just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well.
[01:38:48.752 --> 01:38:49.773]  It's never been
[01:38:50.453 --> 01:38:51.994]  So well united.
[01:38:51.994 --> 01:38:54.334]  We started on June 16th.
[01:38:54.334 --> 01:39:01.257]  I would say right now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been since we began.
[01:39:01.257 --> 01:39:03.117]  We're doing incredibly well.
[01:39:03.117 --> 01:39:04.998]  We're leading in the state of Florida.
[01:39:04.998 --> 01:39:08.239]  You saw the poll.
[01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:10.620]  We're leading in Ohio.
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:13.561]  You have Bernie Sanders people are going to be voting for Trump.
[01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:14.461]  Something just came in.
[01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:15.902]  They like Trump.
[01:39:15.902 --> 01:39:17.182]  They like Trump.
[01:39:17.182 --> 01:39:19.543]  But more important than his statement two nights ago,
[01:39:20.672 --> 01:39:29.965]  Is this Politico article that we'll show you some closeups of back in June of this year on the 18th.
[01:39:29.965 --> 01:39:32.768]  Would Donald Trump really drop out for $150 million?
[01:39:32.768 --> 01:39:35.893]  And they admit they just pulled it out of the air.
[01:39:35.893 --> 01:39:36.754]  They just made it up.
[01:39:37.674 --> 01:39:45.217]  As if he would do that for money when he's lost hundreds of millions of dollars in boycotts and all the rest of it in TV deals he's lost.
[01:39:45.217 --> 01:39:49.319]  Deep in the article, they let Trump respond via email.
[01:39:49.319 --> 01:39:53.340]  This story is a total fabrication from UN Politico as usual.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:56.441]  The New York billionaire sent an email sent by his campaign manager.
[01:39:56.441 --> 01:39:58.062]  I will never leave the race.
[01:39:58.722 --> 01:40:01.243]  Quote, I will never leave the race.
[01:40:01.243 --> 01:40:03.583]  I will never leave the race.
[01:40:03.583 --> 01:40:06.244]  Nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race.
[01:40:06.244 --> 01:40:08.564]  And if they did, it would be totally illegal.
[01:40:08.564 --> 01:40:12.345]  Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?
[01:40:12.345 --> 01:40:13.285]  Donald Trump.
[01:40:13.285 --> 01:40:16.606]  So they're now all over the news, two days into this.
[01:40:16.606 --> 01:40:18.226]  This, this, this huge rollout.
[01:40:18.226 --> 01:40:19.406]  Number one story everywhere.
[01:40:19.406 --> 01:40:20.647]  Donald Trump's dropping out.
[01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:21.527]  Will he drop out?
[01:40:21.527 --> 01:40:23.087]  The Republicans are making him drop out.
[01:40:23.087 --> 01:40:24.347]  His sons don't like him.
[01:40:24.347 --> 01:40:25.828]  His campaign managers don't like him.
[01:40:25.828 --> 01:40:26.728]  He's crazy.
[01:40:26.728 --> 01:40:27.348]  It's all made up.
[01:40:28.601 --> 01:40:32.223]  Meanwhile, Hillary's stumbling around like she's having seizures in public.
[01:40:32.223 --> 01:40:33.504]  Reportedly has brain damage.
[01:40:33.504 --> 01:40:34.985]  That's even been in mainstream news.
[01:40:34.985 --> 01:40:39.548]  Uma Abedin admits that she doesn't know who she is part of the time and gets totally confused.
[01:40:39.548 --> 01:40:48.554]  She's caught in the new WikiLeaks, actually directing the media to go after Donald Trump and other people, just like Trump predicted just a few weeks before.
[01:40:49.594 --> 01:40:50.475]  This is amazing.
[01:40:50.475 --> 01:40:52.456]  They know the new WikiLeaks is coming out.
[01:40:52.456 --> 01:41:02.564]  Our sources have confirmed it's the Benghazi Info with her directing weapons and ordering generals to stand down and to ship weapons to Al Qaeda, also known as ISIS.
[01:41:02.564 --> 01:41:03.784]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:41:03.784 --> 01:41:10.469]  That's why they want to create the illusion that he's a candidate you can't have and that he's dropped out of the race like Ben Carson.
[01:41:10.469 --> 01:41:11.430]  This is a hoax.
[01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:12.171]  This is a fraud.
[01:41:12.171 --> 01:41:16.254]  So, you'll be hearing from Donald Trump, guaranteed, responding to this very, very soon.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:22.625]  He's already responded to it multiple times, just like the whole made up KKK garbage and David Duke.
[01:41:22.625 --> 01:41:29.872]  But I am responding here with his own words and his own statements, and I will be standing up for everyone that wants to restore this republic, not just Donald Trump.
[01:41:29.872 --> 01:41:31.213]  Because it's bigger than Donald Trump.
[01:41:31.213 --> 01:41:36.038]  It's about our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the right of voting in this country.
[01:41:36.038 --> 01:41:38.700]  The fact that the entire power structure is lined up against him.
[01:41:39.381 --> 01:41:49.189]  The Democratic leadership, the Republican leadership, offshore banks, the Pope, the Communist Chinese president, the Mexican president, the Saudi Arabians, is the reason we've got to support Trump.
[01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:53.312]  We've got to have a landslide to counter their fraud and their election fraud.
[01:41:53.312 --> 01:41:58.136]  Trump knows there's been massive election fraud so far, but he was able to defeat it with a landslide in the primaries.
[01:41:58.136 --> 01:41:59.998]  Then Obama comes out and acts like it's crazy.
[01:41:59.998 --> 01:42:07.263]  He says that there could ever be any election fraud in America when there are thousands of documented cases just in the last hundred years.
[01:42:08.085 --> 01:42:12.966]  So now you've seen Donald Trump's response to the lie that he has dropped out.
[01:42:16.755 --> 01:42:17.695]  There's that report.
[01:42:17.695 --> 01:42:21.657]  My only problem is I had just worked out and just showered and I was still sweating.
[01:42:21.657 --> 01:42:25.038]  I sweat for like 30 minutes after I work out really hard, especially in the summer.
[01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:30.080]  So it's almost better than I'm like sweating and all upset because that's how real all this is.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.721]  That's how teleprompter free all this is.
[01:42:32.721 --> 01:42:34.962]  Donald J. Trump responds to dropout rumors.
[01:42:34.962 --> 01:42:41.184]  And I put that out so there's something defending him, something, and I used his quote and his statement because
[01:42:42.739 --> 01:42:46.062]  Again, I've talked to folks in the campaign, you name it, and they go, no, it's ridiculous.
[01:42:46.062 --> 01:42:48.285]  But, you know, he's sick of responding.
[01:42:48.285 --> 01:42:52.409]  It's like if they ask him if he supports David Duke, he said like 50 times he doesn't.
[01:42:52.409 --> 01:42:54.050]  But I guess he just keeps saying, yes, I deny.
[01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.691]  Yes, I deny.
[01:42:54.691 --> 01:42:58.835]  Yes, I deny, you know, that I agree with him.
[01:42:58.835 --> 01:43:01.578]  But again, this is how they turn all this around.
[01:43:01.578 --> 01:43:03.440]  Look at DrugsReport.com, and I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:22.396]  Iran shows off ransom cash, expensive price to free hostages, plane waited until money arrived, win-lose deal that hurts USA, paper, now Tehran, how Tehran will spend the windfall.
[01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:25.116]  And first they lied and said there was no plane, there was no money.
[01:43:25.116 --> 01:43:32.519]  Then they got caught on an unmarked plane, so they're saying, oh it's for something else, for money we owed them from decades ago.
[01:43:32.519 --> 01:43:33.099]  More lies.
[01:43:34.414 --> 01:43:39.919]  And then right next to it we have Khan, Allah is tripping up Trump.
[01:43:39.919 --> 01:43:45.905]  It's just everywhere because in Islamic countries it's not about producing, it's about politically taking over.
[01:43:45.905 --> 01:43:48.307]  So the average American isn't politically involved, the Muslims are.
[01:43:48.307 --> 01:43:50.970]  And we are just overtaken.
[01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:51.911]  Overrun completely.
[01:43:51.911 --> 01:43:52.752]  We're a joke.
[01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:59.264]  I mean, you know, they tell us, don't say this guy's Ali that killed people, say his name's David and we do it.
[01:43:59.264 --> 01:44:03.527]  They covered up the latest London murder, stabbing, screaming Allah Akbar, now it's come out of course.
[01:44:03.527 --> 01:44:05.288]  He was a jihadi.
[01:44:05.288 --> 01:44:08.529]  ISIS, you know, praised him.
[01:44:08.529 --> 01:44:18.876]  But this is what they do, this is how they treat us, because it's a collection of criminals in our government, allied with any other muscle they can bring in, and Islam works absolutely wonderfully.
[01:44:18.876 --> 01:44:19.236]  They love it.
[01:44:20.083 --> 01:44:26.067]  Meanwhile, Harry Reid, this is on Infowars.com, wants CIA to give Trump fake intelligence briefings.
[01:44:26.067 --> 01:44:31.971]  Because this guy sold out the Communist Chinese even worse than Hillary, and that's hard to be worse than Hillary, but he's right up there.
[01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:38.536]  But, oh, Trump, you can't trust him to have these briefings, yes.
[01:44:38.536 --> 01:44:40.638]  In comments not widely reported this week, Democratic Senator
[01:44:41.883 --> 01:44:55.616]  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he would rather see CIA and other intelligence agencies give GOP nominee Trump fake briefings, that's illegal by the way, that make sure he's informed before potentially becoming president.
[01:44:55.616 --> 01:44:59.040]  Yeah, that way he'd put out this info and then you could say that it was his fault?
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.166]  In fact, let's just play a clip of him saying it, then I'm going to go to Richard.
[01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:05.406]  Go ahead.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.582]  It's obvious that he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:45:09.582 --> 01:45:13.264]  It's obvious he can't control his mind or his tongue.
[01:45:13.264 --> 01:45:24.931]  And what I've suggested, if now, because he's the nominee for the party, and he gets, he's entitled to briefings from the CIA, for example, I told, I said publicly, give him fake briefings.
[01:45:24.931 --> 01:45:25.912]  Pretend you're briefing him.
[01:45:25.912 --> 01:45:28.073]  Don't tell him anything that you don't want to get out.
[01:45:28.073 --> 01:45:30.295]  That's how I feel about it.
[01:45:30.295 --> 01:45:33.096]  I think that the man is a loose cannon.
[01:45:33.096 --> 01:45:35.218]  I think he's done so much to hurt our country.
[01:45:37.652 --> 01:45:40.754]  These are the people that let all the foreign governments penetrate the servers.
[01:45:40.754 --> 01:45:44.076]  These are the people that let Hillary have all these foreign governments on her illegal server.
[01:45:44.076 --> 01:45:45.578]  These are the people that armed ISIS.
[01:45:45.578 --> 01:45:49.460]  These are the people that have devalued our currency and put us under all this debt.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.501]  Donald Trump's done none of it.
[01:45:50.501 --> 01:45:53.923]  I love the corrupt stinking establishment.
[01:45:53.923 --> 01:46:02.790]  And how he gave the communist government billions and billions in taxpayer-paid solar panel farms in the US.
[01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:05.652]  They won't even give the stimulus money to US companies.
[01:46:06.815 --> 01:46:07.376]  Yes, Alex.
[01:46:07.376 --> 01:46:11.539]  I'd like to address my comments to all the veterans out there.
[01:46:11.539 --> 01:46:14.381]  I'm a 27-year veteran, retired Army Sergeant.
[01:46:14.381 --> 01:46:18.645]  I feel that voting for Hillary Clinton would be a, would be, um, excuse me,
[01:46:35.675 --> 01:46:53.898]  I feel that voting for Hillary Clinton would be committing treason against the oath I took to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:46:53.898 --> 01:46:59.239]  I consider Hillary Clinton a domestic enemy, and I would never vote for her.
[01:46:59.239 --> 01:47:00.479]  Hurrah!
[01:47:00.479 --> 01:47:01.039]  Absolutely.
[01:47:01.039 --> 01:47:04.500]  Sir, it sounds like you... Are you on oxygen right now?
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:04.860]  No, sir.
[01:47:06.476 --> 01:47:08.398]  Trump all the way, sir.
[01:47:29.844 --> 01:47:30.284]  God bless you.
[01:47:30.284 --> 01:47:31.525]  I appreciate your call, Richard.
[01:47:31.525 --> 01:47:34.067]  Thanks for holding to talk about that.
[01:47:34.067 --> 01:47:35.949]  Look, there's going to be a landslide for Trump.
[01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.690]  They just may try to steal it.
[01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:40.252]  They're already fixing the polls, folks.
[01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:43.614]  OK, that's that's so clear.
[01:47:43.614 --> 01:47:47.257]  We've never seen such rigging, and he's right to say no to it.
[01:47:47.257 --> 01:47:48.518]  We may beat it because of that.
[01:47:48.518 --> 01:47:50.139]  It's our only hope.
[01:47:50.139 --> 01:47:54.002]  Let's go to Morrison on the phone from Missouri.
[01:47:54.002 --> 01:47:56.024]  Go ahead, Morrison.
[01:47:56.024 --> 01:47:56.824]  I love you, Alex.
[01:47:56.824 --> 01:47:57.425]  How are you doing?
[01:47:57.425 --> 01:47:58.926]  Good, brother.
[01:47:58.926 --> 01:47:59.086]  Good.
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:08.602]  Hey, I just wanted to call in, there was a guy that called in last week and I thought he had a great idea.
[01:48:08.602 --> 01:48:15.304]  Ron Paul, the blimp, if you remember back in 2007, he had that blimp, who was Ron Paul?
[01:48:15.304 --> 01:48:17.065]  Google Ron Paul?
[01:48:17.065 --> 01:48:20.346]  I thought that was one of the most effective political ads that I've ever seen.
[01:48:20.346 --> 01:48:23.987]  And I know that you said that you would like to get into blimps, they're very expensive,
[01:48:25.362 --> 01:48:27.544]  You're working on the money to come up with that?
[01:48:27.544 --> 01:48:31.847]  Well, there's only a couple companies that have them, and they're big multinationals.
[01:48:31.847 --> 01:48:37.811]  And when we called one company that does it, they were the same one with the aircraft, they said no once they learned it was Hillary for prison.
[01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:42.334]  So that's the type of censorship that goes on and the control out there.
[01:48:42.334 --> 01:48:47.698]  But I think Trump has punched through overall with his message and doesn't need a blimp.
[01:48:47.698 --> 01:48:49.440]  I do think messages with aircraft
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.083]  Yeah, the guy that called in last week, I thought he had a brilliant idea.
[01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:58.327]  He said, why not come up with a Hillary for Prison bumper sticker?
[01:48:58.327 --> 01:49:01.409]  And I know that every time that I place an order, Alex, I've got dozens of them.
[01:49:17.051 --> 01:49:20.434]  Every time I place an order, you throw in two or three bumper stickers.
[01:49:20.434 --> 01:49:21.074]  Yes.
[01:49:21.074 --> 01:49:23.096]  I got them well-deployed on my cars.
[01:49:23.096 --> 01:49:24.817]  I hand them out to friends.
[01:49:24.817 --> 01:49:31.802]  If they ask me where I got my Hillary Clinton prison t-shirt, I give them a bumper sticker with Infowars.com.
[01:49:31.802 --> 01:49:45.653]  I know several people that have gone and bought them, but you can sell those for a buck apiece or buy a shirt, get a couple free bumper stickers, yard signs, hats, you know, those embroidered patches that people could sew on their jackets.
[01:49:46.704 --> 01:49:47.105]  I'm sure.
[01:49:47.105 --> 01:49:50.569]  And then have that money go towards blimps or something?
[01:49:50.569 --> 01:49:56.637]  Yeah, but yeah, towards blimps or more of the banners flying.
[01:49:56.637 --> 01:49:57.659]  Sure, I'll tell you this.
[01:49:57.659 --> 01:50:00.562]  I mean, look, just the bumper stickers, just the airplanes in a few cities.
[01:50:00.562 --> 01:50:03.386]  I think it's been six cities so far is the money we had that came in.
[01:50:04.568 --> 01:50:06.130]  Shook up the mainstream.
[01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:07.872]  Because people are responding to it.
[01:50:07.872 --> 01:50:09.954]  People know they're being lied to.
[01:50:09.954 --> 01:50:13.078]  People are looking for ways to come together.
[01:50:13.078 --> 01:50:16.241]  And so, there are a lot of rich listeners out there.
[01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:18.344]  And they should take action and put out the blimps.
[01:50:18.344 --> 01:50:19.505]  They should put up the billboards.
[01:50:19.505 --> 01:50:21.507]  I mean, it's all of us doing this together.
[01:50:22.268 --> 01:50:24.008]  Sticking our necks out is going to save us.
[01:50:24.008 --> 01:50:27.929]  It's by not sticking our necks out that we're all going to get our heads politically chopped off.
[01:50:27.929 --> 01:50:29.770]  We've got to hang together or hang separate.
[01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.730]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:31.710]  God bless you, Morrison.
[01:50:31.710 --> 01:50:39.792]  We're going to go to break and talk to James in Hawaii, Chris in North Carolina, Ryan in New York, Adam in Arizona, and others.
[01:50:39.792 --> 01:50:40.772]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:50:44.918 --> 01:50:52.566]  Look, if I had the hundreds of thousands of dollars, because that's what a basic multi-city campaign does, I'd put a giant blimp up there.
[01:50:52.566 --> 01:51:00.855]  The problem is, you go to the multinationals that have like the Goodyear blimp and stuff, and they just say, sorry, we're not going to let you do that because we love Hillary.
[01:51:02.324 --> 01:51:07.108]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:07.108 --> 01:51:12.992]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:12.992 --> 01:51:19.497]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:51:19.497 --> 01:51:23.540]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:53:01.352 --> 01:53:09.517]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:53:09.517 --> 01:53:10.318]  Here's why.
[01:53:10.318 --> 01:53:14.460]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.381]  So please listen.
[01:53:15.381 --> 01:53:19.063]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:53:19.063 --> 01:53:25.427]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:53:25.427 --> 01:53:29.510]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:32.692]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:53:32.692 --> 01:53:35.034]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:53:35.034 --> 01:53:39.858]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:53:39.858 --> 01:53:46.583]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:53:46.583 --> 01:53:48.304]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:53:48.304 --> 01:53:50.005]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:50.005 --> 01:53:51.727]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:53:51.727 --> 01:53:55.590]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:57.151]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:57.151 --> 01:53:58.492]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:54:15.465 --> 01:54:18.828]  We're going to Hawaii.
[01:54:18.828 --> 01:54:25.154]  We're going to North Carolina here in just a moment.
[01:54:25.154 --> 01:54:28.577]  Please don't forget
[01:54:41.015 --> 01:54:43.197]  I'm going to have to end the free shipping Sunday.
[01:54:43.197 --> 01:54:47.880]  So by next Monday, the free shipping store-wide is going to be over at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:51.723]  And we do have three of our best-selling nutraceuticals that are 40% off, 30% off, and 30% off.
[01:54:51.723 --> 01:54:54.906]  And you get an additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:54:54.906 --> 01:55:00.791]  So that's potentially 50% off on things like Brain Force, 30% off on DNA Force.
[01:55:00.791 --> 01:55:03.573]  All right, going back to your calls, I just want you to know that
[01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:20.624]  Daria, who works here, speaks fluent Russian, and she's helped put out some of these super viral videos where you actually don't see the words of what Putin's saying under him, but you actually, in the closed captioning, you get to hear it in English.
[01:55:20.624 --> 01:55:25.268]  And she does a great translation, a very accurate translation from what I've heard from other Russian speakers.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.900]  We're also Americans.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:35.282]  And so I've got the full speech coming up where Putin warns of World War III and says, don't you know we're in great danger?
[01:55:35.282 --> 01:55:39.203]  Because I was watching the full speech this weekend and had forgotten to play the full thing.
[01:55:39.203 --> 01:55:39.823]  It was my fault.
[01:55:39.823 --> 01:55:42.703]  She'd done the full translation when I was up there working this weekend.
[01:55:42.703 --> 01:55:45.524]  I noticed that and she pointed it out later in the week.
[01:55:45.524 --> 01:55:49.465]  And then we have some other very, very important clips we're going to play after William Benny leaves us.
[01:55:49.465 --> 01:55:54.126]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Brian in the beautiful state of Hawaii.
[01:55:54.126 --> 01:55:54.606]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:55:56.124 --> 01:55:58.866]  Hi, thanks for fighting the good fight, you and your team.
[01:55:58.866 --> 01:56:02.387]  And I just have a brief statement.
[01:56:02.387 --> 01:56:11.412]  I think James Comey probably laid out, just like Terry Mason, step by step by step, why she should have been convicted.
[01:56:11.412 --> 01:56:13.133]  And I think he did it on purpose.
[01:56:13.133 --> 01:56:14.054]  That's my opinion.
[01:56:14.054 --> 01:56:15.875]  I've talked to a lot of patriots around the country.
[01:56:16.525 --> 01:56:21.550]  I think that he thought she would be tied up in court system until well after the election.
[01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:23.352]  I just wondered what your opinion was on that.
[01:56:23.352 --> 01:56:31.379]  Yeah, I got mad at him the first day, but I've been told by patriots that I know in government that, look, Comey really, believe me, knows what's going on.
[01:56:31.379 --> 01:56:35.723]  And the word is that they were threatening to bring down the whole Justice Department and that he was basically
[01:56:36.838 --> 01:56:46.704]  Threatened with a bunch of blackmail to go after agents, not him, reportedly he's clean, but that they would basically bring down the entire FBI.
[01:56:46.704 --> 01:56:57.970]  And so that's why he pretty much angrily went out there and listed everything of how horrible she was, but then said, I can't get prosecutors to do it because the word we got from the White House sources is they are blackmailing him.
[01:56:58.710 --> 01:57:02.491]  And I mean, they're threatening to go after people for stuff they didn't do, too.
[01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:04.652]  So this is a war in the government, folks.
[01:57:04.652 --> 01:57:05.853]  This is a very serious time.
[01:57:05.853 --> 01:57:11.015]  So what your gut tells you, Brian, is dead on.
[01:57:11.015 --> 01:57:11.515]  Exactly.
[01:57:11.515 --> 01:57:15.436]  I think he wanted the American people to be the prosecution.
[01:57:15.436 --> 01:57:19.118]  And secondly, I love your show today about the corruption.
[01:57:19.118 --> 01:57:25.400]  And I have a way I think we can probably at least monitor the polling agent
[01:57:26.076 --> 01:57:28.657]  And the people that... I have a website.
[01:57:28.657 --> 01:57:29.997]  I won't say it on air if you want it.
[01:57:29.997 --> 01:57:30.937]  You can keep me on air.
[01:57:30.937 --> 01:57:31.377]  I don't care.
[01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:32.597]  I mean, we don't censor people.
[01:57:32.597 --> 01:57:34.958]  Just say the name of the website.
[01:57:34.958 --> 01:57:38.539]  Okay, it's ExitPollArmy.com.
[01:57:38.539 --> 01:57:40.319]  ExitPollArmy.com.
[01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:42.119]  And what I want to do is sign up.
[01:57:42.119 --> 01:57:44.540]  Exit polls are generally open about 12 hours.
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:51.842]  Teams of three patriots that want to go and register to be exit pollers at their polling stations.
[01:57:51.842 --> 01:57:53.722]  And then if it's
[01:57:54.435 --> 01:58:00.167]  So backward that she has 70% of the vote because it's fraud and we have the opposite.
[01:58:00.703 --> 01:58:04.484]  We at least can hand the Trump camp and the American people some evidence.
[01:58:04.484 --> 01:58:05.804]  And that's what Trump's doing.
[01:58:05.804 --> 01:58:12.106]  I mean, I've told Trump, and I've said it in reports, look, please, sir, start organizing a defense, start organizing a fight.
[01:58:12.106 --> 01:58:13.446]  And he's doing it.
[01:58:13.446 --> 01:58:14.286]  So this is the fighter.
[01:58:14.286 --> 01:58:16.387]  This is total presidential material.
[01:58:16.387 --> 01:58:19.467]  We haven't had something like this in over 100 years.
[01:58:19.467 --> 01:58:21.068]  I mean, this is something else.
[01:58:21.068 --> 01:58:25.389]  You know, they liken him to Teddy Roosevelt or Andrew Jackson.
[01:58:26.329 --> 01:58:29.531]  In big psychological pieces attacking him in the Washington Post.
[01:58:29.531 --> 01:58:29.991]  And you know what?
[01:58:29.991 --> 01:58:31.352]  That is who he's like.
[01:58:31.352 --> 01:58:32.472]  And that's why they can't stand him.
[01:58:32.472 --> 01:58:34.133]  I mean, look.
[01:58:34.133 --> 01:58:39.916]  They liken him to kind of a mountain man because for all the glitz and all the glamour, that's what Donald Trump is.
[01:58:39.916 --> 01:58:41.717]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:41.717 --> 01:58:43.838]  But by the way, there's nothing smarter than a mountain man.
[01:58:43.838 --> 01:58:48.600]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.806 --> 01:58:52.626]  Hey, everyone!
[01:58:52.626 --> 01:58:58.748]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:58.748 --> 01:59:00.828]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:59:00.828 --> 01:59:11.111]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:17.092]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:17.572 --> 01:59:38.329]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:59:38.329 --> 01:59:40.291]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:59:40.291 --> 01:59:40.691]  Head over to
[01:59:40.891 --> 01:59:43.134]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:19.764]  There's a company that's put the profile of every American adult for face recognition scanners in drones!
[02:00:19.764 --> 02:00:35.497]  I remember about 18 years ago there was a prospectus put out to the Pentagon for drones that would fly around with a face scan database that could even like look for criminals or also be weaponized and kill people.
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:44.146]  And so we wrote articles about it at InfoWars.com and they had national news stories saying we were insane and it wasn't true.
[02:00:44.146 --> 02:00:53.613]  DrugsReport.com today and it's mainstream news saying exactly that.
[02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:55.794]  The San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:00:55.794 --> 02:01:01.138]  Drones that fly around for homeland security and face scan you and that are weaponized, you name it.
[02:01:01.138 --> 02:01:01.739]  I mean it's just
[02:01:03.959 --> 02:01:04.940]  It's crazy.
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:07.841]  I remember they tested out a hit piece on us about seven years ago.
[02:01:07.841 --> 02:01:21.890]  Now, later on, they were trying to keep Drudge from linking to us, because every time Drudge would link to us, they were so scared of this information, because it's so accurate getting out, that they wanted to scare Drudge away from linking to it.
[02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:25.933]  But, of course, it just made Drudge link to us more, because Drudge was doing his own research and knew we were doing real stuff.
[02:01:25.933 --> 02:01:28.675]  I mean, it's just great to see the enemy fail.
[02:01:29.451 --> 02:01:36.453]  But it's kind of scary to know there's Drudge and Infowars and then a few other outlets that are challenging the whole narrative successfully.
[02:01:36.453 --> 02:01:39.634]  It's just, I want to see other folks pop up that get the full picture.
[02:01:39.634 --> 02:01:40.555]  And it's starting to happen.
[02:01:40.555 --> 02:01:42.375]  That's very, very exciting.
[02:01:42.375 --> 02:01:44.056]  Because I want to make myself obsolete, man.
[02:01:44.056 --> 02:01:48.878]  I don't like not being able to sleep at night because of the responsibility.
[02:01:48.878 --> 02:01:52.059]  This is not fun, folks.
[02:01:52.059 --> 02:01:54.559]  Let's talk to Chris in North Carolina.
[02:01:54.559 --> 02:01:57.360]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.401]  Hey Alex, love what you do.
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:12.763]  Well, first I have a point, and it's about Ben Shapiro and Mark Levine, those types, who I term the enemy pundits within the Republican Party.
[02:02:12.763 --> 02:02:15.804]  And here's the theme that I've noticed on their social media.
[02:02:15.804 --> 02:02:24.207]  They continuously discuss how crooked Hillary Clinton is, and they continuously retweet articles about how bad Donald Trump is.
[02:02:24.207 --> 02:02:25.107]  They never mention
[02:02:25.963 --> 02:02:31.550]  Yeah, well let me tell you what's going on, okay?
[02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:35.494]  I mean, do you want to hear the absolute inside baseball of what's happening?
[02:02:35.494 --> 02:02:35.935]  Yes.
[02:02:35.935 --> 02:02:38.137]  I mean, I have all the answers.
[02:02:38.137 --> 02:02:40.760]  I'm not bragging, I just really do.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.805]  Obviously, I know a lot of the top Clear Channel people, because I've never been on Clear Channel, but I've been offered jobs there.
[02:02:45.765 --> 02:02:50.648]  They put me on XM just because they were patriots, some of the high level but not the top people.
[02:02:50.648 --> 02:03:03.856]  Clear Channel got partially bought out by Goldman Sachs subgroup and they now are calling their local hosts nationwide and they're telling people you won't have your contract renewed if you don't stop pushing Trump.
[02:03:03.856 --> 02:03:07.999]  Now Limbaugh is so powerful he still got a new contract this week despite that.
[02:03:07.999 --> 02:03:10.000]  Sean Hannity's been threatened at Fox.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.142]  He's been threatened in the radio to stop it.
[02:03:12.142 --> 02:03:13.823]  And Mark Levin and all these other people
[02:03:14.403 --> 02:03:16.325]  But if Trump wins, they're basically throwing their career away.
[02:03:16.325 --> 02:03:17.385]  They're going to be the next Dick Morrison.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:44.920]  Well, it's beyond that.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:54.644]  This is about contracts and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others in a big multinational investment group have taken over Sirius XM and part of Clear Channel.
[02:03:54.644 --> 02:03:58.785]  The Clear Channel is quasi-bankrupt.
[02:03:58.785 --> 02:03:59.605]  I mean, they've taken it over.
[02:03:59.605 --> 02:04:02.626]  I mean, they're taking all the Patriots off local radio.
[02:04:02.626 --> 02:04:04.347]  I mean, I've had the local Patriots.
[02:04:04.347 --> 02:04:06.067]  Some of the people I know have top ratings.
[02:04:06.067 --> 02:04:07.008]  They've been on the air 20 years.
[02:04:07.992 --> 02:04:10.815]  And they said, yeah, I was in a meeting, they're going to take you off.
[02:04:10.815 --> 02:04:15.740]  You know, you got ratings and everything, but because they're going to put this quasi-fake conservative show on.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.522]  I go, yeah, watch, you're going to be next.
[02:04:17.522 --> 02:04:18.503]  Two months later, it was them.
[02:04:18.503 --> 02:04:20.465]  They called and said, yeah, I was in the meeting.
[02:04:20.465 --> 02:04:23.528]  I basically could have shut up and backed off and I would have had my contract renewed.
[02:04:25.017 --> 02:04:27.899]  I mean, this is going on all over the country, brother.
[02:04:27.899 --> 02:04:28.920]  They are taking over.
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.501]  Remember who came here last year?
[02:04:31.501 --> 02:04:32.702]  Matt Drudge.
[02:04:32.702 --> 02:04:34.903]  He said they're coming out to the free speech next year.
[02:04:34.903 --> 02:04:36.024]  And they're doing it.
[02:04:36.024 --> 02:04:41.047]  They just had a coup with Roger Ailes being taken out at Fox News.
[02:04:41.047 --> 02:04:41.888]  So, absolutely.
[02:04:41.888 --> 02:04:42.789]  But no, no, no.
[02:04:42.789 --> 02:04:43.589]  Listen.
[02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:48.272]  That's why you gotta really commend people like Michael Savage.
[02:04:48.272 --> 02:04:51.074]  Michael Savage had heat put on him to shut up and he didn't do it.
[02:04:52.305 --> 02:04:55.386]  And Michael Savage tells the truth no matter what anybody does.
[02:04:55.386 --> 02:04:58.866]  And so do I. So, there's not many people that'll do it.
[02:04:58.866 --> 02:05:01.947]  We will.
[02:05:01.947 --> 02:05:04.187]  Yesterday, Dakota Meyer, a U.S.
[02:05:04.187 --> 02:05:09.168]  Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, decided to open his mouth and tweak this out.
[02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:12.929]  If real Donald Trump wants to be Commander-in-Chief, he needs to act like one.
[02:05:12.929 --> 02:05:16.409]  And that can't start until he apologizes to the cons.
[02:05:16.409 --> 02:05:18.650]  And we all know that the cons are a con job.
[02:05:19.650 --> 02:05:27.111]  The fact that his son, Captain Khan, voluntarily joined the military and fought radical Islamic terrorism and died.
[02:05:27.111 --> 02:05:31.052]  The same kind of people that Mr. Khan wants to bring into this country.
[02:05:31.052 --> 02:05:33.353]  What do you stand for, Dakota Meyer?
[02:05:33.353 --> 02:05:37.733]  I do respect the things you've done, but this, this tweet, is ridiculous.
[02:05:37.733 --> 02:05:45.955]  And the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald Trump is completely and totally disgusting.
[02:05:46.255 --> 02:05:48.858]  All of the military is watching this right now.
[02:05:48.858 --> 02:05:49.980]  Our eyes are open.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:50.981]  What are you gonna do?
[02:05:50.981 --> 02:05:53.063]  Are you gonna do the right thing and take that down?
[02:05:53.063 --> 02:05:57.568]  Or are you gonna sit there and actually help out the most corrupt person ever?
[02:05:57.568 --> 02:06:01.753]  Hillary for Prison, Joe Biggs, InfoWars.com, and I'm pissed off.
[02:06:01.753 --> 02:06:04.997]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:06:04.997 --> 02:06:06.678]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com
[02:06:07.279 --> 02:06:14.306]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:06:14.306 --> 02:06:19.630]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:06:19.630 --> 02:06:28.619]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:06:29.039 --> 02:06:37.902]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:06:37.902 --> 02:06:45.005]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[02:06:45.005 --> 02:06:50.987]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[02:06:51.367 --> 02:06:58.569]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:06:58.569 --> 02:06:58.969]  Here's why.
[02:07:10.552 --> 02:07:14.713]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:07:14.713 --> 02:07:15.633]  So please listen.
[02:07:15.633 --> 02:07:19.334]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:19.334 --> 02:07:25.716]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:07:25.716 --> 02:07:29.817]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:07:30.077 --> 02:07:32.998]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:07:32.998 --> 02:07:35.358]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:07:35.358 --> 02:07:40.199]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[02:07:40.199 --> 02:07:46.941]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:07:46.941 --> 02:07:48.681]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:07:48.681 --> 02:07:50.362]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:52.102]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:07:52.102 --> 02:07:55.963]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:07:55.963 --> 02:07:57.524]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:57.524 --> 02:07:58.884]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:08:12.423 --> 02:08:14.404]  He never gives up.
[02:08:14.404 --> 02:08:20.466]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:08:20.466 --> 02:08:33.330]  I'll tell you what's shattered is Hillary Clinton's dreams to be El Presidente.
[02:08:33.330 --> 02:08:40.212]  If WikiLeaks head Julian Assange makes good on his claim that he's going to release information,
[02:08:42.117 --> 02:08:48.220]  Very, very soon that will cause Hillary to be indicted for sure.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.302]  He's normally pretty conservative about what he says.
[02:08:52.302 --> 02:09:10.032]  Now, we had him on about a week and a half ago, and then a few days after, William Binney, former leader of the National Security Agency, the guy that actually ran it, not the political head, but the civilian general that actually ran it, famous codebreaker, he went on Aaron Klein's show on WABC in New York with WorldNetDaily.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:19.807]  And Breitbart also picked it up and broke down the fact NSA whistleblower agency has all of Clinton's deleted emails.
[02:09:19.807 --> 02:09:30.156]  And he's got some of the Snowden leaks here that have been made public that we're going to be going over today for radio listeners and TV viewers.
[02:09:30.156 --> 02:09:39.564]  Radio listeners will want to go to Infowars.com forward slash show if you want to be able to see this presentation, not just listen to it.
[02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:42.812]  But William Binney joins us.
[02:09:42.812 --> 02:09:45.716]  There's a new film coming out in a few months, A Good American.org.
[02:09:45.716 --> 02:09:47.719]  We have the trailer of that we're going to be playing.
[02:09:47.719 --> 02:09:49.461]  ExposedFacts.org as well.
[02:09:49.461 --> 02:09:53.948]  He is the former technical leader of the intelligence with the NSA before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001.
[02:09:55.655 --> 02:09:57.856]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex.
[02:10:24.525 --> 02:10:31.230]  Wow, well, I wish I would have asked the big question, but I'd like you to get back into it and flesh it out for us today, as you've agreed to do.
[02:10:31.230 --> 02:10:40.917]  Proving for us, explaining to us exactly why you know, as the guy that designed most of it, that indeed they do have all of Hillary's deleted 33,000 emails.
[02:10:40.917 --> 02:10:44.900]  William Binney.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:51.165]  It's not really that they've hacked into the server, or the DNC server, or Hillary's server.
[02:10:52.052 --> 02:11:00.957]  They've got over, in the United States, in the Fairview program, they have over a hundred taps on the fiber network in the United States.
[02:11:00.957 --> 02:11:11.922]  And they're doing just like Mark Klein exposed the one facility, one of the hundred, in the San Francisco facility where they have NERIS devices taking everything off the line.
[02:11:11.922 --> 02:11:13.003]  So that's what's going on.
[02:11:13.003 --> 02:11:19.706]  So to explain, they put gates in front of it and then copy it and scoop it all up before it ever gets where it's going.
[02:11:20.393 --> 02:11:20.873]  That's right.
[02:11:20.873 --> 02:11:21.814]  That's exactly right.
[02:11:21.814 --> 02:11:31.281]  As it passes down the line from all the service providers or all the telephone companies, they capture that as it's passing down the fiber network.
[02:11:31.281 --> 02:11:33.983]  And the telecommunications companies are helping them do that.
[02:11:33.983 --> 02:11:37.706]  The ones that run the fibers, they allow them to come in and tap the thing.
[02:11:37.706 --> 02:11:42.270]  That's what Mark Klein exposed in the AT&T facility in San Francisco.
[02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:45.532]  But that's only one of the almost 100 that they have.
[02:11:45.532 --> 02:11:49.075]  And it captures gigabits, tens of gigabits of data.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.301]  So at each site.
[02:11:52.301 --> 02:11:56.402]  So that means that's how they acquire the data.
[02:11:56.402 --> 02:12:02.263]  And then they're storing it in places like the Bluffdale facility that they had to build because they were collecting so much.
[02:12:02.263 --> 02:12:06.404]  And now they're building another facility on Fort Meade that's almost three times that size.
[02:12:06.404 --> 02:12:08.965]  It's 2.8 million square feet.
[02:12:08.965 --> 02:12:13.426]  So that's planning for the future because they're continuing to collect so much data on everybody.
[02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:35.694]  And then it goes into the databases inside NSA, and some of the material with the PRISM program and the NSA programs are all shown in that, how PRISM data goes into it, but it's also all other data, like off the Upstream program, which are the fiber taps, all that data goes into the same programs internally in NSA.
[02:12:35.694 --> 02:12:42.778]  And that graphs the data and indexes it so that people like the FBI and the CIA can go directly into those databases
[02:12:43.317 --> 02:12:45.439]  And pull information out.
[02:12:45.439 --> 02:12:50.543]  So they've captured not just the data on Hillary, but on everybody else, too.
[02:12:50.543 --> 02:12:56.148]  That's why I was calling this originally J. Edgar Hoover on super steroids.
[02:12:56.148 --> 02:13:01.572]  Because this gives them the ability to blackmail anybody.
[02:13:01.572 --> 02:13:11.600]  William Binney is our guest, former leader of the NSA, the guy that actually ran it, one of the top codebreakers in history, according to even the NSA's fact pages.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:12.081]  Mr. Binney,
[02:13:13.612 --> 02:13:21.239]  Specifically on Hillary, folks are saying, and you pointed out, hey, they've got copies of it, they grabbed it.
[02:13:21.239 --> 02:13:25.903]  Obviously, other intelligence agencies have been closely watching her, other governments were.
[02:13:25.903 --> 02:13:35.912]  Is there any estimation or guesstimation on how many agencies here, or also foreign governments, corporations, you name it, would have been targeting her and scooping up the Secretary of State's data?
[02:13:38.596 --> 02:13:48.944]  Uh, well, I mean, for governments, I mean, uh, every government in the world would try to acquire data on her, uh, to the extent that they were able to do it.
[02:13:48.944 --> 02:14:01.593]  Uh, I would think certainly the, uh, most of the European countries, the Israel, Russia, China, uh, I'm sure... And we lost William Benny.
[02:14:01.593 --> 02:14:03.495]  That happens a lot when he's on with us.
[02:14:03.495 --> 02:14:04.976]  He says it happens a lot on other shows.
[02:14:04.976 --> 02:14:05.957]  When he's doing shows!
[02:14:07.222 --> 02:14:10.443]  That dinner he's been on there to visit us.
[02:14:10.443 --> 02:14:16.446]  It's like a James Bond movie when you're sitting there going in to have dinner with William Binney with your family and you notice there's guys following you in.
[02:14:16.446 --> 02:14:17.246]  Mr. Binney, you're back.
[02:14:17.246 --> 02:14:18.486]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:18.486 --> 02:14:20.047]  Please continue.
[02:14:20.047 --> 02:14:27.550]  Well, I was just saying that virtually every advanced country in the world is probably looking at her and trying to get information on her.
[02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:33.472]  So I would think that probably on the order of 50 to 100 countries would be trying to tap into her data.
[02:14:34.525 --> 02:14:41.751]  And obviously, as the Secretary of State, and somebody who's been involved in intelligence since she was in college, we now know they were CIA, her and Bill, she knows this.
[02:14:41.751 --> 02:14:43.613]  So why would she have a separate server?
[02:14:43.613 --> 02:14:45.054]  Why would she do something like this?
[02:14:45.054 --> 02:14:47.516]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:14:47.516 --> 02:14:56.965]  Well, if you're the type of person that likes to keep everything away from everybody and not have anybody know what you're doing, that's the kind of thing you do.
[02:14:56.965 --> 02:15:00.688]  And if you're naive enough to think that you can do that in private,
[02:15:01.392 --> 02:15:04.233]  Uh, then you still do, then that's the kind of thing you do.
[02:15:04.233 --> 02:15:12.977]  So I don't think she is, uh, technically as it, you know, indoctrinated or understands the technology that much.
[02:15:12.977 --> 02:15:23.401]  And I think she wants to, she, from where I sit, I just say, I thought she wanted to keep everything away from anybody, even in violation of the Records Act for the government.
[02:15:24.423 --> 02:15:36.194]  Sure, and her former, Obama's former head of the Environmental Protection Agency had to step down when she got caught with a gnome to plume and another server and a whole other parallel system she was using.
[02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:48.085]  Expanding on this, Mr. Benny, I've always thought a lot of people that are being charged with murder or other crimes, if they could use the NSA data to prove that they were indeed somewhere else
[02:15:48.826 --> 02:16:01.271]  When the government claimed they were another place, do you think we're going to start seeing court challenges more and more where people are going to demand NSA data for defenses in trial?
[02:16:01.271 --> 02:16:02.151]  It certainly should.
[02:16:02.151 --> 02:16:15.357]  I mean, even Senator Feinstein went back in 2013 when they were trying to unfund the NSA efforts shortly after the initial Snowden releases.
[02:16:15.357 --> 02:16:18.438]  Senator Feinstein went on the floor of the Senate and said this is
[02:16:19.316 --> 02:16:27.463]  Speaking about the domestic spying program, she said, this is such a valuable program, we use it to put hundreds of people in jail every year.
[02:16:27.463 --> 02:16:34.409]  Well, I mean, how many thousands of people went to jail based on the NSA material, but was never told it was from NSA?
[02:16:34.409 --> 02:16:34.809]  Why?
[02:16:34.809 --> 02:16:36.771]  Because it's not admissible in the court of law.
[02:16:37.577 --> 02:16:45.184]  So what they did was they did a parallel construction with the FBI or the federal agents did.
[02:16:45.184 --> 02:16:54.092]  They did a parallel construction to find data on them that would basically replicate the data from NSA and then substitute that in a court of law.
[02:16:54.092 --> 02:16:56.133]  That's perjury, okay?
[02:16:56.133 --> 02:17:02.039]  That's also denying the defendant the right to discover, challenge discovery.
[02:17:02.039 --> 02:17:05.622]  And so all of those cases should be thrown out of court because of what they did.
[02:17:06.351 --> 02:17:11.139]  And certainly, any future case could say there may be something in there.
[02:17:11.139 --> 02:17:17.109]  They could do a FOIA or a discovery type of request to find information about them to show that.
[02:17:17.109 --> 02:17:18.011]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:17:18.999 --> 02:17:33.294]  What is your knowledge of this new parallel system where Homeland Security, but also private corporations, but also local governments, are in some cases, even in small jurisdictions, buying up to 300 Stingrays.
[02:17:33.294 --> 02:17:38.879]  For those who don't know, obviously you know Mr. Benny, are small cell phone tower arrays that basically steal the data.
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:42.883]  Similar to Google cars that have been caught doing it worldwide.
[02:17:42.883 --> 02:17:52.911]  I mean, it seems to be not just government, but like a gold rush, an orgy of data theft by Fortune 100 tech companies, by local governments.
[02:17:52.911 --> 02:17:56.734]  I mean, this just sounds like Pandora's box has been opened.
[02:17:56.734 --> 02:18:02.799]  What is your view on what they're using all of these systems for?
[02:18:02.799 --> 02:18:07.263]  Well, I know in the case of the government, they have a program called Treasure Map.
[02:18:08.317 --> 02:18:14.440]  And part of the idea of the Treasure Map was to map every device on the network every minute of every day.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:25.005]  That means phones, you know, your computers, servers, landline phones, satellite phones, everything.
[02:18:25.005 --> 02:18:28.627]  So that they want to know where everyone in the world is every minute of every day.
[02:18:28.627 --> 02:18:34.390]  And that's certainly, the program's called Treasure Map One Word.
[02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:36.731]  And if you, if your audience would like to
[02:18:37.236 --> 02:18:37.716]  Google it.
[02:18:37.716 --> 02:18:43.400]  All I have to do is Google NSA Space Treasure Map and they'll get to read all about it.
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:50.384]  And it is using various things like traceroute and things like that to map the communications of everybody on the planet.
[02:18:50.384 --> 02:18:53.026]  And of course we can thank Mr. Snowden for this.
[02:18:53.026 --> 02:18:55.307]  We might spend a minute on that, Mr. Benning.
[02:18:55.307 --> 02:18:59.410]  Yes, that's exactly where this data came from, yes.
[02:18:59.410 --> 02:19:02.912]  I mean, otherwise we would not know.
[02:19:02.912 --> 02:19:04.353]  What do you make of Mr. Snowden?
[02:19:04.353 --> 02:19:05.314]  I think he's a hero.
[02:19:07.425 --> 02:19:17.730]  I say he did an absolutely public service for mostly everybody in the world.
[02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:25.454]  The problem is that when you see what should happen to him, well he stole government property so he should be indicted for stealing government property.
[02:19:25.454 --> 02:19:30.996]  But all these people who have violated the law put him in a position to make a decision about that.
[02:19:30.996 --> 02:19:34.678]  And that's coming out in his movie too, that's coming up in Snowden.
[02:19:35.205 --> 02:19:38.750]  It'll show you the dilemma he was in and the kind of things that he had to discuss.
[02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:49.086]  Well that's right, let's give him six months for stealing some data and then let's give the people that engage in mass architecture to overthrow the republic, let's charge them with treason.
[02:19:50.023 --> 02:19:50.684]  Right, exactly.
[02:19:50.684 --> 02:19:51.885]  That's exactly my view of it.
[02:19:51.885 --> 02:19:54.687]  It is treason against the founding principles of this country.
[02:19:54.687 --> 02:19:55.888]  Damn right.
[02:19:55.888 --> 02:19:58.690]  They are subverting the Constitution, scrapping it.
[02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:00.191]  There's a method to do that.
[02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:11.940]  If you want to change the Constitution, you put an amendment into the floor of the Congress, get them to pass it, then circulate it around the states for ratification, and if 75% of the states ratify it, you're in business.
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:12.401]  You changed it.
[02:20:12.401 --> 02:20:13.462]  And let's expand on that.
[02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:27.077]  As you pointed out, for less than $20 million, and I want you to recap this, sir, William Binning, former head of the NSA, joining as former head of technical, former leaders, as they called it, the guy that actually ran it, not the politico that ran around like Hayden.
[02:20:27.077 --> 02:20:28.439]  You look at this and...
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:32.982]  Clearly, we're totally infiltrated by all sorts of foreign governments.
[02:20:32.982 --> 02:20:36.124]  Hillary's selling uranium to the Russians, giving them weapons secrets.
[02:20:36.124 --> 02:20:39.385]  But that's okay, because, you know, she's got a political sign-off.
[02:20:39.385 --> 02:20:43.207]  Meanwhile, they're saying Trump's a Russian agent because he doesn't want to have war with them.
[02:20:43.207 --> 02:20:45.128]  You've got all these special interests in here.
[02:20:45.128 --> 02:20:47.570]  We're totally penetrated by the Communist Chinese.
[02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:49.611]  They tell Hollywood what movies they can put out.
[02:20:50.291 --> 02:21:05.820]  There's so much data being grabbed that all these foreign interests are able to get into these data caches now, and we're being penetrated, as you talked about years ago, but is now admitted by the amount of data we have, that all these spy grids actually is distributing all the data to allow it to be stolen.
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:10.663]  Clearly the people doing this are the ones threatening our national security.
[02:21:10.663 --> 02:21:12.504]  Yes.
[02:21:12.504 --> 02:21:17.867]  And for example, one of the points I made on Fox News when I was on there the other day,
[02:21:20.598 --> 02:21:28.602]  This attack that was used against the DNC server, for example, was a well-known attack previously used by Russian hackers.
[02:21:28.602 --> 02:21:43.048]  Well, if it's a well-known attack, that means many people know about it, and most of the services that you purchase to protect your networks should already have software to combat it and protect you against it, but they didn't.
[02:21:43.772 --> 02:21:48.013]  So, and part of the background is that NSA has two parts, the defense and offense.
[02:21:48.013 --> 02:21:51.474]  The offense likes to look into things to read what everybody's doing.
[02:21:51.474 --> 02:21:55.575]  The defense is supposed to protect us, right, from people looking in.
[02:21:55.575 --> 02:22:04.497]  Well, the problem is that if the offense finds a weakness in the system that allows them to look in, they won't tell the defense because they'll fix it.
[02:22:04.497 --> 02:22:08.018]  And if they fix it, the window for the offense will close.
[02:22:08.018 --> 02:22:13.219]  See, so they have a vested interest in keeping that window open so they can see into what people are saying and doing.
[02:22:14.281 --> 02:22:19.063]  Uh, whereas the defense, uh, being, uh, not aware of the weakness doesn't fix it.
[02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:21.885]  So that leaves everybody out here, all of us.
[02:22:21.885 --> 02:22:23.726]  That's how OPM got hacked.
[02:22:23.726 --> 02:22:30.469]  And all of them, all these hacks are coming in, uh, because they're all, um, defenseless against this stuff.
[02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:34.411]  So the point is by doing that, everybody's exposed and vulnerable.
[02:22:38.908 --> 02:22:42.932]  Where do you see the situation going?
[02:22:42.932 --> 02:22:46.957]  Obviously, the Russians aren't the only technically competent country.
[02:22:46.957 --> 02:22:51.462]  I think you mentioned there's at least 50 or more nations that are very competent, maybe 100.
[02:22:51.462 --> 02:22:53.684]  I mean, just to always blame the Russians.
[02:22:53.684 --> 02:23:00.591]  The Russians castly took credit for exposing the UN hack where they were hiding the decline of temperature and the push of carbon tax.
[02:23:01.292 --> 02:23:04.874]  So I say if the Russians are exposing fraud by the UN, more power to them.
[02:23:04.874 --> 02:23:09.576]  I hope hackers expose Russian fraud and, you know, vice versa, Japanese fraud, American fraud.
[02:23:09.576 --> 02:23:13.737]  I mean, if it's fraud, changing the subject from the hacker away from the fraud.
[02:23:13.737 --> 02:23:22.021]  It's like saying, well, Hillary sent people to attack Trump rallies dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters.
[02:23:22.021 --> 02:23:23.661]  But maybe the Russians did it.
[02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.002]  Look, I don't care.
[02:23:25.002 --> 02:23:25.882]  It's about the information.
[02:23:25.882 --> 02:23:29.164]  But separately, talking to a lot of sources, I wanted to ask you this.
[02:23:30.106 --> 02:23:35.913]  There's overwhelming evidence that we've got good people as contractors, not just Snowden, and good people in the military.
[02:23:35.913 --> 02:23:49.669]  I mean, if 90% of the military that I talk to, Mr. Benny, is awake to what's happening, and against this whole police state, and against Hillary Clinton, and if almost all the police I talk to, and federal agents, you name it, from Secret Service to FBI,
[02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:51.611]  are mainly libertarians.
[02:23:51.611 --> 02:23:53.171]  They're, you know, they're bipartisan.
[02:23:53.171 --> 02:23:54.952]  They're not Republican or Democrat.
[02:23:54.952 --> 02:23:57.334]  They're upset about the state of the country.
[02:23:57.334 --> 02:24:05.878]  Then it's not fair to just always attribute it to the Russians when I think there's a lot of evidence pointing towards corporate leaks, government leaks here domestically.
[02:24:05.878 --> 02:24:10.120]  Can you speak to the providence of these leaks and where you think they're coming from?
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:12.181]  And could they be coming from the U.S.
[02:24:12.181 --> 02:24:13.582]  intelligence community or an ally?
[02:24:16.036 --> 02:24:28.281]  Yes, and one of the things that really concerns me is there's a lot of people in here who don't think very well of the Russians and would like to use them to start a second Cold War.
[02:24:28.281 --> 02:24:35.865]  Because, especially in the military-industrial complex, because that means trillions of dollars of business over time.
[02:24:35.865 --> 02:24:42.348]  I mean, there's an awful lot of money they have an opportunity to gain if they can start a second Cold War.
[02:24:43.991 --> 02:24:48.434]  So I think you need to be, you know, you need to be skeptical of our military-industrial complex.
[02:24:48.434 --> 02:24:54.219]  That's what President Eisenhower warned us about in 1961, when he was leaving office.
[02:24:54.219 --> 02:24:56.180]  He warned us about this.
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:25:00.883]  And these are the kinds of things that motivate them, is the opportunity to make more money.
[02:25:00.883 --> 02:25:06.568]  And if they can keep these perpetual wars going, that's the thing that helps them make money.
[02:25:06.568 --> 02:25:12.372]  So, you know, I just see that the commercial companies are so embedded and vested interests
[02:25:13.868 --> 02:25:14.291]  That they have a...
[02:25:16.738 --> 02:25:20.360]  They have a motive to direct things a certain way.
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:26.283]  Well, Mr. Benny, former leader of the NSA, isn't that the trillion-pound elephant in the room?
[02:25:26.283 --> 02:25:40.831]  That we think about Russians or Chinese, and sure, they're doing stuff, we need to watch them, but what about multinational corporations that are bigger than most governments, that just drift around, they're doing stuff for the Russians, the Chinese, us, South Africans, the UK?
[02:25:40.831 --> 02:25:44.493]  I mean, that's who should be watched, and no one's even looking at them.
[02:25:46.107 --> 02:25:49.719]  Yeah, that's right, and they're all set up to fleece everybody of every penny they can get.
[02:25:52.165 --> 02:25:53.586]  And destroy our sovereignty.
[02:25:53.586 --> 02:25:54.447]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:54.447 --> 02:25:56.328]  Start a war with the Russians to sell more weapons.
[02:25:56.328 --> 02:25:58.089]  They'll be nowhere to spend the damn money.
[02:25:58.089 --> 02:26:07.796]  In fact, since you mentioned that, one of the top Russian scholars in the United States, I mean, it's undisputed, Stephen Cohen shuts down CNN hosts.
[02:26:07.796 --> 02:26:11.598]  And again, this guy heads up the entire, you know, department at a major university.
[02:26:11.598 --> 02:26:14.520]  Here he is on CNN talking about this new Cold War.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:17.442]  And this guy's not even a Trump supporter, but he's telling it like it is.
[02:26:17.442 --> 02:26:17.943]  Here's that clip.
[02:26:18.797 --> 02:26:23.158]  Professor Cohen, does Vladimir Putin indeed have a dog in our U.S.
[02:26:23.158 --> 02:26:24.858]  fight?
[02:26:24.858 --> 02:26:41.642]  Vladimir Putin wants to end the new Cold War, and so do I. Let me say I have no ties to the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign, but if I were to write your headline for you today, I tried on the way down here, I couldn't fit it on the front page, but it would go like this.
[02:26:41.642 --> 02:26:44.583]  We're in a new and more dangerous Cold War with Russia.
[02:26:45.350 --> 02:26:54.200]  We're approaching a Cuban missile crisis nuclear confrontation with Russia, both along Russia's borders and possibly over Syria.
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:27:01.889]  There is absolutely no discussion, no debate about this in the American media, including, forgive me, on CNN.
[02:27:01.889 --> 02:27:04.652]  Then along comes, unexpectedly, Donald Trump.
[02:27:05.252 --> 02:27:28.540]  Who says something that suggests he wants to end the new Cold War, cooperate with Russia in various places, what we used to call detente, and now, astonishingly, the media is full of what only can be called Neil McCarthy-eyed charges that he's a Russian agent, that he's a Manchurian candidate, that he's Putin's client.
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.782]  So the real danger is what's being done to our own political process.
[02:27:32.782 --> 02:27:33.542]  This is the moment.
[02:27:34.002 --> 02:27:37.104]  When there should be, in a presidential year, a debate.
[02:27:37.104 --> 02:27:40.426]  Because Mrs. Clinton's position on Russia seems to be very different.
[02:27:40.426 --> 02:27:42.647]  Hasn't been a long time.
[02:27:42.647 --> 02:27:43.988]  Trump speaks elliptically.
[02:27:43.988 --> 02:27:46.509]  You gotta piece together what he says.
[02:27:46.509 --> 02:27:49.611]  But he seems to want a new American policy toward Russia.
[02:27:49.611 --> 02:27:54.674]  And considering the danger, I think we, as American citizens, deserve that debate.
[02:27:54.674 --> 02:27:57.395]  And not what will be given in the media today.
[02:27:57.395 --> 02:27:59.777]  Including on the front page of the New York Times.
[02:27:59.777 --> 02:28:01.838]  I end by saying that these
[02:28:02.819 --> 02:28:07.625]  Reckless branding of Trump as a Russian agent.
[02:28:07.625 --> 02:28:12.791]  Most of it is coming from the Clinton campaign, and they really need to stop.
[02:28:12.791 --> 02:28:19.080]  All right, that's a liberal by the way, and he's Princeton, NYU, I mean, there you go William Benning.
[02:28:20.877 --> 02:28:23.499]  Yeah, I pretty much agree with all of what he was saying there.
[02:28:23.499 --> 02:28:26.442]  I mean, the whole idea... And by the way, you're a guy credited.
[02:28:26.442 --> 02:28:27.563]  You don't want to brag.
[02:28:27.563 --> 02:28:28.724]  You broke the Russian codes.
[02:28:28.724 --> 02:28:29.484]  You helped defeat them.
[02:28:29.484 --> 02:28:31.206]  And they gave you secret medals.
[02:28:31.206 --> 02:28:33.748]  I know you don't want to talk about this, but I mean, you fought the Russians.
[02:28:33.748 --> 02:28:36.270]  You're not some Russian spy.
[02:28:36.270 --> 02:28:45.238]  No, in fact, but if you looked at the situation of what's happening, so actually we started and initiated certain things that made them react the way they did.
[02:28:45.734 --> 02:28:52.837]  I mean, we actually had a bloodless coup that we initiated or assisted in the Ukraine.
[02:28:52.837 --> 02:28:59.659]  And then we tried to move NATO into the Ukraine when we had a verbal agreement with the Russians before that that we wouldn't do that.
[02:28:59.659 --> 02:29:04.581]  And we broke the Paris-Troika deal to let, you know, as long as they didn't expand back, we wouldn't expand.
[02:29:04.581 --> 02:29:05.241]  Exactly.
[02:29:05.241 --> 02:29:06.622]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:29:06.622 --> 02:29:12.644]  And so what that meant was we were treating them like a threat, and so they started acting like one.
[02:29:13.615 --> 02:29:14.658]  But let's not be confused.
[02:29:14.658 --> 02:29:18.890]  Yeah, when you move nuclear cruise missiles up to somebody's border, they start getting upset.
[02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:20.595]  Yeah, and let's not be confused.
[02:29:20.595 --> 02:29:21.978]  They didn't start this, we did.
[02:29:24.784 --> 02:29:28.025]  Samantha Powers and a bunch of weirdo women who've never been in the military started it.
[02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:35.787]  And it's not that I'm against women, but it really is, it smells of Armageddon when you got a bunch of weird women and liberals hopping around messing with the Russians.
[02:29:35.787 --> 02:29:39.889]  It's just, I mean, Napoleon got his ass kicked, so did Hitler, and they were warriors.
[02:29:39.889 --> 02:29:41.829]  You people are a joke.
[02:29:41.829 --> 02:29:48.031]  Do 10 more minutes of William Benning, then I've got an in-depth report with Putin basically saying we're moving towards nuclear war.
[02:29:48.031 --> 02:29:49.331]  A new clip's coming up.
[02:29:49.331 --> 02:29:50.812]  William Benning's our guest.
[02:29:50.812 --> 02:29:51.292]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.292 --> 02:29:52.652]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.652 --> 02:29:54.173]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.173 --> 02:30:02.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:07.124]  Harry Reid wants CIA to give Trump fake intelligence briefings.
[02:30:07.124 --> 02:30:21.677]  The Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said he would rather see the CIA and other intelligence agencies give GOP nominee Donald Trump fake briefings than to make sure he's informed before potentially becoming president.
[02:30:21.897 --> 02:30:30.204]  Reid suggested that it would be risky to divulge classified information pertaining to national security to Trump, so it should just be faked.
[02:30:30.204 --> 02:30:36.329]  Even more incredulous is the fact that Reid is the one accusing Trump of being, quote, dangerous.
[02:30:36.329 --> 02:30:41.033]  Trump is due to receive intelligence briefings in the coming weeks, as is Clinton.
[02:30:41.033 --> 02:30:48.139]  It is standard procedure for both candidates to have limited updates so they're somewhat prepared to take office when the time comes.
[02:30:48.419 --> 02:30:53.410]  Article by Steve Watson on InfoWars.com, linked on the DrudgeReport.com.

[02:31:01.892 --> 02:31:08.396]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:31:08.396 --> 02:31:21.365]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:31:21.365 --> 02:31:25.048]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:31:25.048 --> 02:31:31.672]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family
[02:31:32.012 --> 02:31:44.875]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:31:44.875 --> 02:31:46.715]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:31:46.715 --> 02:31:53.096]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:33:48.569 --> 02:33:51.330]  Sometimes in the second row.
[02:33:51.330 --> 02:33:57.073]  I like sports as much as the next person.
[02:33:57.073 --> 02:34:08.898]  But when it comes to defending our Second Amendment, our First Amendment, our sovereignty, when it comes to having the President not be able to just open the borders up and ignore the Supreme Court, that's the real fight.
[02:34:08.898 --> 02:34:09.578]  That's the good fight.
[02:34:09.578 --> 02:34:11.459]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:34:12.737 --> 02:34:29.060]  And my heroes are inventors, they're trailblazers, they're honorable people, they're folks that tell the truth like William Benny, who could have gone and worked for private industry and made 20 times the money he was making as the equivalent of a one-star general running the NSA.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:31.840]  And he doesn't want to be talked about or praised, but the guy is a hero.
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:41.002]  I mean, he went to Congress for years, briefed them about the criminal activity going on, he resigned, and then they SWAT teamed him in his house for intimidation purposes.
[02:34:41.002 --> 02:34:41.762]  He didn't back off.
[02:34:43.035 --> 02:34:49.704]  The point is that there are a lot of people out there putting their whole lives on the line just so we have basic freedoms.
[02:34:49.704 --> 02:34:51.326]  This spying does not keep us safe.
[02:34:51.326 --> 02:34:52.167]  This spying does not.
[02:35:03.629 --> 02:35:04.629]  Protect the public interest.
[02:35:04.629 --> 02:35:15.113]  It's used by special interests to rob us and to make hundreds of billions of dollars while they selectively enforce laws and while they take over our civilization.
[02:35:15.113 --> 02:35:19.434]  agoodamerican.org is the website for the film coming out in September.
[02:35:19.434 --> 02:35:22.055]  I want to play the trailer for A Good American.
[02:35:22.055 --> 02:35:22.835]  It's a documentary.
[02:35:22.835 --> 02:35:27.177]  We also have the Snowden film coming out, of course, with Oliver Stone.
[02:35:27.177 --> 02:35:29.037]  But here is the trailer for that.
[02:35:29.037 --> 02:35:30.618]  We're going to go back to William Binney, former
[02:35:31.098 --> 02:35:36.800]  Technical leader for intelligence for the NSA.
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:45.903]  Recapping now for you once again an explosion underground in the garage section of the World Trade Center in New York City.
[02:35:45.903 --> 02:35:52.365]  The first attack on the Trade Center in 93 was the first thing that woke everybody up in terms of the threat of terrorism.
[02:35:52.365 --> 02:35:55.086]  We said this is not a one-time event.
[02:35:55.086 --> 02:35:58.047]  There is a larger movement here and they're planning on doing more.
[02:35:59.545 --> 02:36:11.493]  The terrorists were burying themselves inside the ballooning communications network and the internet and the phones and so we had to figure out who was communicating with whom and who were the terrorists and that was the whole idea of the ThinThread program.
[02:36:12.908 --> 02:36:18.033]  Of all the analysts, Bill was by far the most astute.
[02:36:18.033 --> 02:36:22.837]  He was the person in the agency who knew the most about metadata.
[02:36:22.837 --> 02:36:30.845]  It was pretty clear that we were building the most powerful analysis tool that had been developed in history to monitor basically the entire world.
[02:36:32.279 --> 02:36:38.284]  This little research organization had the keys to NSA's future.
[02:36:38.284 --> 02:36:40.825]  We let it run 24 to 36 hours.
[02:36:40.825 --> 02:36:44.488]  We discovered critical intelligence that had never been discovered by NSA.
[02:36:44.488 --> 02:36:45.669]  NSA's response?
[02:36:45.669 --> 02:36:47.270]  Completely shut the program down.
[02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:52.154]  Does anybody even recognize what they have?
[02:36:52.154 --> 02:36:52.814]  Oh my God!
[02:36:52.814 --> 02:36:55.616]  The whole tower collapsed.
[02:36:55.616 --> 02:36:56.157]  It is gone.
[02:36:58.134 --> 02:36:59.615]  We would have caught the people.
[02:36:59.615 --> 02:37:02.056]  9-11 would have been avoided.
[02:37:02.056 --> 02:37:04.277]  They're taking data on every U.S.
[02:37:04.277 --> 02:37:05.557]  citizen in the country.
[02:37:05.557 --> 02:37:07.478]  That's not compatible with a democracy.
[02:37:07.478 --> 02:37:10.179]  That's like testosterone on super steroids.
[02:37:10.179 --> 02:37:11.380]  What's wrong with this picture?
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:14.101]  9-11 is a gift to NSA.
[02:37:14.101 --> 02:37:16.582]  We're going to get all the money we need and then some.
[02:37:16.582 --> 02:37:17.703]  It wasn't about making money.
[02:37:17.703 --> 02:37:20.024]  It was about protecting the country and the free world.
[02:37:20.024 --> 02:37:25.246]  Let's find where the skeletons are, capture it all, and then bury the report as deep as possible.
[02:37:25.246 --> 02:37:26.907]  The FBI decided to raid four people.
[02:37:27.367 --> 02:37:29.389]  Fabricated evidence to get a warrant.
[02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:33.031]  They were after all material that was related to ThinThread.
[02:37:33.031 --> 02:37:37.855]  It was the largest failure in NSA history.
[02:37:37.855 --> 02:37:41.518]  A Good American comes out in September.
[02:37:41.518 --> 02:37:44.320]  agoodamerican.org and I've studied this in depth.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.403]  We'll get William Betty's final comments on this, but here's the bottom line.
[02:37:48.403 --> 02:37:51.326]  You spend chicken feed by targeted
[02:37:52.827 --> 02:37:59.830]  Profiling, where you target, you get total results and shut basically every criminal down.
[02:37:59.830 --> 02:38:02.051]  Every terrorist down.
[02:38:02.051 --> 02:38:03.391]  Every organized terrorist down.
[02:38:03.391 --> 02:38:05.572]  Every premeditated murder one.
[02:38:05.572 --> 02:38:07.553]  You can stop it.
[02:38:07.553 --> 02:38:09.654]  But, they don't want that.
[02:38:10.677 --> 02:38:16.079]  Because the globalists are busy backing many of the jihadis, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:24.803]  No, instead they spy on all of us, using the outside jihadi threat as a pretext, and then all it is, is political targeted garbage.
[02:38:24.803 --> 02:38:35.427]  William Binney is the former national leader of the National Security Agency, exposefacts.org, where he writes some of his articles, agoodamerican.org is
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:40.303]  Aside from the film, it's won more than 20 major No.
[02:38:40.303 --> 02:38:42.586]  1 film awards at film festivals.
[02:38:42.586 --> 02:38:46.189]  But just like we promoted Dinesh D'Souza's film, I have no financial link to it.
[02:38:46.189 --> 02:38:48.472]  It just exposes how evil Hillary is.
[02:38:48.472 --> 02:38:51.575]  Everyone when this film comes out in theaters needs to see it.
[02:38:51.575 --> 02:38:54.297]  Because I've talked to people that have seen the film, I haven't seen it yet.
[02:38:54.297 --> 02:38:56.900]  They say it's staggeringly powerful.
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.683]  So Mr. Benny, I want to salute you for your courage, and again,
[02:39:00.183 --> 02:39:02.985]  In the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[02:39:02.985 --> 02:39:08.248]  In time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot, to quote Mark Twain.
[02:39:08.248 --> 02:39:11.510]  But I mean, I know you're just a guy trying to defend the country.
[02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:16.412]  You're like a sheepdog, but we really appreciate everything you've done.
[02:39:16.412 --> 02:39:18.314]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:39:18.314 --> 02:39:25.798]  I just feel that I'm doing what a citizen and someone who's signed up to protect and defend the Constitution should do.
[02:39:26.761 --> 02:39:32.743]  I mean, that's really the duty of a citizen of a democracy of this country.
[02:39:32.743 --> 02:39:38.306]  Any way we are to protect and defend the Constitution, that's what our leaders in Washington are not doing.
[02:39:38.306 --> 02:39:42.907]  They're scrapping it in secret, and they're lying to us about it.
[02:39:42.907 --> 02:39:54.332]  Now, you're a humble man, but I want you to spend five minutes, because we reach millions an hour, and I want to take this clip and put it into rotation on the show so 28 million people the next week see it.
[02:39:55.307 --> 02:39:56.427]  Five minutes.
[02:39:56.427 --> 02:39:59.748]  What are the keys for folks to know, to understand?
[02:39:59.748 --> 02:40:01.528]  What do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[02:40:01.528 --> 02:40:04.209]  Mr. Benny?
[02:40:04.209 --> 02:40:10.430]  Well, I think the main thing I wanted to impart to everybody is that the government is not telling us the truth.
[02:40:10.430 --> 02:40:16.891]  They've been lying from the beginning, saying that you had to trade privacy for security, and that's been a lie from the beginning.
[02:40:16.891 --> 02:40:20.892]  There was always an alternative approach that we were working on back in the 1990s.
[02:40:22.799 --> 02:40:28.804]  And it was running and by 2000 and they killed it because it didn't cost enough money.
[02:40:28.804 --> 02:40:39.093]  Their motive is more about money and building an empire rather than protecting people and doing the functions that they're supposed to to protect the nation and and people's lives.
[02:40:39.093 --> 02:40:41.175]  So they're there and they're continuing.
[02:40:41.175 --> 02:40:47.761]  There's so many people in the Congress and and leadership especially and in some of the courts, the FISA court for sure.
[02:40:48.554 --> 02:40:58.422]  And, of course, the administration, including the Department of Justice, NSA, FBI, and CIA, as well as the White House, all of them are involved in this.
[02:40:58.422 --> 02:41:04.567]  They're all covering up for each other and ensuring that nobody gets exposed because if one of them is, they all are.
[02:41:04.567 --> 02:41:06.709]  So they're trying to protect themselves in that way.
[02:41:06.709 --> 02:41:14.375]  And the basic point is, if they did something right, they could save lives, and they're not doing that.
[02:41:14.375 --> 02:41:15.616]  So they're basically trading.
[02:41:16.092 --> 02:41:23.795]  The security of everyone in the country and the free world, and in fact the world, for money.
[02:41:23.795 --> 02:41:30.617]  I view their vision statement as, keep the problem going so the money keeps flowing.
[02:41:30.617 --> 02:41:38.520]  And that seems to be exactly what they've been doing, not just in the terrorist area, but also in the cyber security area.
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:42.021]  And now they're trying to start, in my view, another Cold War.
[02:41:42.551 --> 02:41:47.318]  So they can make more money fear-mongering everybody into fleecing them out of money.
[02:41:47.318 --> 02:41:56.530]  That's really the bottom line of what they've been doing and they've been doing that basically for the last 20 years at least.
[02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:57.832]  And Mr. Benny, clearly...
[02:41:58.948 --> 02:42:06.994]  I was against just random wars with Muslim countries, but they're overthrowing moderates, putting radicals in, and then bringing radicals in.
[02:42:06.994 --> 02:42:15.560]  So they attack, and then when they attack, they can declare civil emergencies in Germany and France, and take nationalist rights away to criticize their open borders.
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:18.742]  I mean, it's so transparent the Hegelian dialect they're using.
[02:42:19.704 --> 02:42:20.725]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:42:20.725 --> 02:42:30.553]  And the whole point is, if you destabilize things, it'll only get worse, and then you can use that as a way of fear-mongering people into being submissive and doing what they're told.
[02:42:30.553 --> 02:42:38.179]  That's fundamentally what our government's been doing, and we've been spreading this concept around the world, metastasizing it like a malignancy does, you know?
[02:42:38.179 --> 02:42:44.324]  Around the world, the British have joined us, and the Germans, and others around the world have also joined.
[02:42:44.324 --> 02:42:47.907]  And even the Russians now are starting to have their own program like this.
[02:42:49.069 --> 02:42:59.878]  We're infecting the entire world, not just democracies, but also semi-totalitarian states also, to adopt the kinds of things that we've been initiating.
[02:42:59.878 --> 02:43:03.620]  America leading the world into 1984.
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.403]  William Benny, in closing, specifically on Hillary.
[02:43:07.475 --> 02:43:14.477]  I know you're non-partisan, but a woman that would have a secret server, lie about it, be caught, get away with it, all the foreign interests.
[02:43:14.477 --> 02:43:16.298]  I'm so concerned about blackmail.
[02:43:16.298 --> 02:43:18.899]  Think of what we don't know.
[02:43:18.899 --> 02:43:25.021]  You know, just any other data on the issue of the fact that the NSA has her emails?
[02:43:25.021 --> 02:43:36.745]  Well, I think the NSA certainly has a motive to not want to deal with her, very simply because she exposed what is called gamma material in NSA.
[02:43:37.948 --> 02:43:42.751]  And that's basically the most sensitive data that they work with.
[02:43:42.751 --> 02:43:47.013]  It's very compartmented and very restricted knowledge.
[02:43:47.013 --> 02:44:03.222]  And they had several officials of NSA talking openly to reporters from the Observer for their article back in March of this year, talking about this Gamma material lifted directly out of Gamma reporting, whole paragraphs, and plugged into her emails.
[02:44:03.891 --> 02:44:11.818]  Well, these emails are passed around to people who aren't cleared and managed by people who aren't cleared and put on servers that aren't secure.
[02:44:11.818 --> 02:44:18.064]  And so this basically compromised the fact that we were reading certain systems.
[02:44:18.064 --> 02:44:23.949]  The last GAMA program that I remember being compromised was by Jack Anderson in 1971.
[02:44:25.658 --> 02:44:28.159]  He starts talking about technical capacity, he cuts out.
[02:44:50.461 --> 02:44:56.924]  So much of an implication in terms of the ability for NSA to proceed and work on and actually have and produce intelligence.
[02:44:56.924 --> 02:45:00.366]  I mean, you can't have leaders who do that kind of thing.
[02:45:00.366 --> 02:45:01.386]  I mean, you just can't.
[02:45:01.386 --> 02:45:05.969]  I mean, they'll cripple your entire intelligence program.
[02:45:05.969 --> 02:45:16.114]  Well, I know you can't get into classification, but the way you describe it is you had a very inexpensive program that targeted terrorists, targeted groups that were calling for violence, and we just lost them.
[02:45:17.057 --> 02:45:20.719]  So, it just happens, William Binney talks about his phone works great.
[02:45:20.719 --> 02:45:23.841]  Anywhere else he goes on shows, it's just hammered hell.
[02:45:23.841 --> 02:45:25.142]  Getting back on, I want to finish this.
[02:45:25.142 --> 02:45:27.363]  They cannot stand this coming out.
[02:45:27.363 --> 02:45:30.285]  Let me just tell you, my phones, can you imagine?
[02:45:30.285 --> 02:45:35.769]  Talking about gamma material or world leader material or change material or leader material.
[02:45:35.769 --> 02:45:39.811]  Can you imagine when I'm on the phone with you-know-who?
[02:45:39.811 --> 02:45:40.832]  When I'm on the phone with other people?
[02:45:42.367 --> 02:45:46.150]  I mean, it's just like I'm talking to an audience of 500 people.
[02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:47.991]  I don't have computers recording what I say.
[02:45:47.991 --> 02:45:49.252]  I mean, I do.
[02:45:49.252 --> 02:45:51.373]  I got people listening.
[02:45:51.373 --> 02:45:56.056]  I've even had the bastards over the years sometimes pop in with all smart-ass comments and things.
[02:45:56.056 --> 02:46:07.143]  And so imagine you're like sitting here with your phone and there's private agencies and foreign governments and corporate groups and agencies all tuning in.
[02:46:07.143 --> 02:46:07.764]  Don't you people have
[02:46:08.895 --> 02:46:11.116]  Mr. Benny, we've been having a lot of problems with your line today.
[02:46:11.116 --> 02:46:13.197]  I know you've gone through some censorship.
[02:46:13.197 --> 02:46:14.537]  Just, I appreciate your time, sir.
[02:46:14.537 --> 02:46:15.958]  Thank you for everything.
[02:46:15.958 --> 02:46:18.338]  You were trying to finish up a point you were making.
[02:46:18.338 --> 02:46:27.441]  Yeah, I was just saying that you can't really afford to have leadership that compromises the ability and sources and means and methods for intelligence production.
[02:46:27.441 --> 02:46:32.063]  If you do, you simply have no intelligence system.
[02:46:32.063 --> 02:46:37.385]  Well, I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you create a giant panopticonic system where everybody's spying on everybody and
[02:46:38.618 --> 02:46:43.743]  Then it seems like you've created a Swiss cheese system that gives you the opposite of security.
[02:46:43.743 --> 02:46:47.867]  Yes, in fact, it also makes everybody dysfunctional.
[02:46:47.867 --> 02:46:50.049]  They can't trust one another, so they can't work together.
[02:46:50.049 --> 02:46:51.591]  So, you know, it's another catch-22.
[02:46:54.924 --> 02:46:56.865]  Another attack on humanity.
[02:46:56.865 --> 02:47:00.966]  William Benny, the film, I can't wait to see it, A Good American.org.
[02:47:00.966 --> 02:47:02.047]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:47:02.047 --> 02:47:03.547]  Again, because you got cut off earlier.
[02:47:03.547 --> 02:47:04.228]  Any other points?
[02:47:04.228 --> 02:47:07.769]  You're just bottom line saying, look, the NSA has Hillary's emails.
[02:47:07.769 --> 02:47:10.450]  Well, why don't we just call for a lawsuit or something?
[02:47:10.450 --> 02:47:11.730]  I mean, these are public emails.
[02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:12.911]  The FBI wants them.
[02:47:12.911 --> 02:47:14.732]  Can't we just call for the FBI?
[02:47:14.732 --> 02:47:18.173]  Should we call for the FBI to ask the NSA to release them?
[02:47:18.173 --> 02:47:20.314]  You see, the FBI doesn't have to ask them.
[02:47:20.314 --> 02:47:22.334]  They already have access to them.
[02:47:22.334 --> 02:47:23.335]  Oh, talk about that, please.
[02:47:24.178 --> 02:47:29.625]  Yeah, well that's the direct access that they have into the NSA database.
[02:47:29.625 --> 02:47:31.847]  And there's no oversight of that at all.
[02:47:31.847 --> 02:47:43.421]  That's how Feinstein's would say they used it to put hundreds of people in jail because the FBI and the DEA and others, law enforcement, were going in there pulling that data out, using it to direct their people to arrest people.
[02:47:45.598 --> 02:47:52.442]  I mean, that's been one of the violations of the Constitution and of the entire legal structure.
[02:47:52.442 --> 02:48:00.326]  So it's not just the DEA that has access to the FBI?
[02:48:00.326 --> 02:48:02.347]  Oh, it's more than that.
[02:48:02.347 --> 02:48:14.573]  Here, the DEA specifically has a special unit, the Special Operations Division, the SOD, and it composed members of the DHS, the CIA, FBI, NSA, of course.
[02:48:15.373 --> 02:48:18.595]  And IRS.
[02:48:18.595 --> 02:48:21.976]  So all of those people have direct access.
[02:48:21.976 --> 02:48:23.717]  The IRS?
[02:48:23.717 --> 02:48:29.040]  I mean, Nixon got impeached basically over having a list of 120 people he might audit.
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:32.841]  The IRS is in the illegal NSA database?
[02:48:32.841 --> 02:48:34.022]  Yes.
[02:48:34.022 --> 02:48:34.622]  Wow.
[02:48:34.622 --> 02:48:39.365]  They're supposedly looking for money laundering and financial fraud.
[02:48:39.365 --> 02:48:42.086]  That is, people avoiding tax.
[02:48:42.995 --> 02:48:43.155]  Sure.
[02:48:43.155 --> 02:48:44.977]  But whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment?
[02:49:03.576 --> 02:49:16.563]  Like, for example, I also say, and I think that they used this data against Elliot Spitzer because he was going after the Wall Street bankers for defrauding people and the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis.
[02:49:16.563 --> 02:49:23.187]  No, I've got to say that there's few things I disagree with some of my guests on, but some of them are kind of anti-Elliot Spitzer.
[02:49:23.187 --> 02:49:25.008]  And I'm just like, Elliot Spitzer did a good thing.
[02:49:25.008 --> 02:49:27.149]  And who cares that he was seeing a hooker?
[02:49:27.149 --> 02:49:29.650]  I mean, that's right.
[02:49:29.650 --> 02:49:32.572]  It's so clear that the FBI was targeting him and everything he was doing.
[02:49:33.325 --> 02:49:35.846]  Yeah, and what was their probable cause?
[02:49:35.846 --> 02:49:38.366]  The only thing I could think of was he's going after the bankers.
[02:49:38.366 --> 02:49:39.207]  We have to protect them.
[02:49:39.207 --> 02:49:41.067]  That's probable cause.
[02:49:41.067 --> 02:49:43.968]  So you think parallel construction was going on there?
[02:49:43.968 --> 02:49:45.268]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:45.268 --> 02:49:46.168]  All right.
[02:49:46.168 --> 02:49:47.989]  Well, Mr. Benny, thank you so much.
[02:49:47.989 --> 02:49:50.269]  This is the most incredible interview we've ever done.
[02:49:50.269 --> 02:49:51.770]  We've got a minute until break.
[02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:54.270]  Anything else you'd like to put out?
[02:49:54.270 --> 02:50:00.472]  No, except that this entire process of spying, unless we start standing up and saying, look, you've got to stop this stuff.
[02:50:00.959 --> 02:50:04.422]  I mean, we're going to lose whatever we think we have as a democracy.
[02:50:04.422 --> 02:50:11.688]  Right now, they've married the secret agencies, the secret intelligence agencies, with the police and we've got a secret police.
[02:50:11.688 --> 02:50:16.652]  So, you know, it's heading down this very slippery path to a very bad outcome.
[02:50:16.652 --> 02:50:18.814]  You're talking about the Threat Fusion Centers?
[02:50:18.814 --> 02:50:19.354]  Yes.
[02:50:19.354 --> 02:50:27.741]  Well, and also all the police organizations that are involved in interrogating all this data that NSA has collected and using it against people.
[02:50:28.837 --> 02:50:29.558]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:50:29.558 --> 02:50:33.923]  Whoever you give this god-like power, it's going to become corrupting.
[02:50:33.923 --> 02:50:36.365]  I mean, come on folks, we shouldn't turn this loose.
[02:50:36.365 --> 02:50:36.806]  It's bad.
[02:50:36.806 --> 02:50:37.807]  We should get rid of it.
[02:50:37.807 --> 02:50:38.608]  We should curtail it.
[02:50:38.608 --> 02:50:46.116]  We should go back to a system, like you said, that's targeted outside or targeted against people that show some evidence of being involved in something.
[02:50:46.116 --> 02:50:47.718]  Bill Binning, let me say bye to you in the break.
[02:50:47.718 --> 02:50:48.298]  You're a hero.
[02:50:49.119 --> 02:50:51.481]  And we should put out baseball cards with you on it.
[02:50:51.481 --> 02:50:52.322]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:50:52.322 --> 02:50:52.662]  Thank you.
[02:50:52.662 --> 02:50:54.184]  The film coming out of Good American.
[02:50:54.184 --> 02:50:55.285]  Coming out in September.
[02:50:55.285 --> 02:50:56.666]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:50:56.666 --> 02:50:58.728]  We'll be back with some more clips, more calls.
[02:50:58.728 --> 02:50:59.188]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.188 --> 02:50:59.709]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.031 --> 02:51:07.973]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.
[02:51:07.973 --> 02:51:10.954]  The sort of shave that cuts clean, without the burn.
[02:51:10.954 --> 02:51:21.118]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost $32 for an 8-pack, when you can shave with Harry's high-quality German-engineered blades for half the price?
[02:51:21.858 --> 02:51:34.729]  And because Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades, they'll send you their most popular set, complete with a razor, one of their world-famous blades, shaving cream, and post-shave balm for free, if you cover shipping.
[02:51:34.729 --> 02:51:39.714]  A total value of $20 at no cost to you, with code 1151 at checkout.
[02:51:39.714 --> 02:51:41.736]  Their way of saying thank you for trying them.
[02:51:42.376 --> 02:51:47.202]  How is Harry's able to save you all this money and still give you the best shave you'll ever enjoy?
[02:51:47.202 --> 02:51:50.245]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.
[02:51:50.245 --> 02:51:51.246]  That's how.
[02:51:51.246 --> 02:51:57.734]  Go to harrys.com now and enter code 1151 at checkout to claim your free trial set and Poché balm.
[02:51:57.734 --> 02:51:59.416]  That's harrys.com.
[02:51:59.416 --> 02:51:59.656]  Code 1151.
[02:52:01.738 --> 02:52:09.882]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:52:09.882 --> 02:52:10.702]  Here's why.
[02:52:10.702 --> 02:52:14.844]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:52:14.844 --> 02:52:15.764]  So please listen.
[02:52:15.764 --> 02:52:19.166]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:52:19.446 --> 02:52:25.789]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:52:25.789 --> 02:52:33.073]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:52:33.073 --> 02:52:35.414]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:52:35.414 --> 02:52:42.758]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[02:52:42.878 --> 02:52:44.660]  Today, I became a bio-photon woman.
[02:52:44.660 --> 02:52:46.561]  I put a tablespoon of the Andreas Bio-Photon
[02:53:11.155 --> 02:53:11.675]  3 p.m.
[02:53:11.675 --> 02:53:17.079]  Normally I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today I felt energy and very clear.
[02:53:17.079 --> 02:53:19.481]  My friend at the farmer's market asked what I was on.
[02:53:19.481 --> 02:53:23.924]  She said my eyes looked bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[02:53:23.924 --> 02:53:29.428]  I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant.
[02:53:29.428 --> 02:53:31.149]  She said, I want some.
[02:53:31.149 --> 02:53:37.394]  A second One World Way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful abundant energy.
[02:53:37.954 --> 02:53:41.196]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt.
[02:53:41.196 --> 02:53:46.839]  The combination of One World Way and Five Seed Oil produced a significant health event in my life.
[02:53:46.839 --> 02:53:51.282]  The time that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus and I'm 64.
[02:53:51.282 --> 02:53:55.244]  Five Seed Oil and One World Way for your fantastic health.
[02:53:55.244 --> 02:53:56.465]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com
[02:54:02.054 --> 02:54:13.139]  If humans set up our system about preying on fellow humans, we're gonna fall.
[02:54:30.669 --> 02:54:39.398]  That we base it on re-association and not being jealous of people that are better than us or smarter than us.
[02:54:39.398 --> 02:54:43.441]  We're going to go to the stars.
[02:54:43.441 --> 02:54:48.346]  But there is a race consciousness to the species and everything it's been through.
[02:54:48.346 --> 02:54:50.348]  And I'm not going to piss on that.
[02:54:50.348 --> 02:54:52.150]  That's what I'm committed to.
[02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:53.992]  And by the way, that's where all the strength is.
[02:54:56.169 --> 02:54:59.853]  Everything is there, so you fools that don't join this are idiots.
[02:54:59.853 --> 02:55:02.796]  You're not experiencing anything that God has in store.
[02:55:02.796 --> 02:55:05.579]  Let's go to the special report, then back to your phone calls.
[02:55:05.579 --> 02:55:05.920]  Here it is.
[02:55:07.503 --> 02:55:11.487]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[02:55:11.487 --> 02:55:24.738]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[02:55:24.738 --> 02:55:28.922]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[02:55:28.922 --> 02:55:29.683]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:55:30.223 --> 02:55:33.424]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:55:33.424 --> 02:55:37.386]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[02:55:37.386 --> 02:55:41.327]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[02:55:41.327 --> 02:55:45.528]  But what, you actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[02:55:45.528 --> 02:55:47.029]  If Hillary steals the nomination...
[02:55:47.569 --> 02:55:51.672]  And then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump.
[02:55:51.672 --> 02:55:54.174]  You have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:55:54.174 --> 02:56:03.080]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:03.981]  It has been rigged.
[02:56:03.981 --> 02:56:07.803]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:56:07.803 --> 02:56:09.584]  Contrary to popular belief.
[02:56:09.584 --> 02:56:11.246]  Then why bother holding the primaries?
[02:56:12.186 --> 02:56:13.548]  That's a very good question.
[02:56:13.548 --> 02:56:21.817]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly preferred Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously.
[02:56:21.817 --> 02:56:27.903]  And to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[02:56:27.903 --> 02:56:32.909]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:56:32.909 --> 02:56:33.930]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[02:56:34.170 --> 02:56:38.175]  And we're not gonna recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:56:38.175 --> 02:56:39.316]  And guess what there is?
[02:56:39.316 --> 02:56:41.439]  She stole the nomination!
[02:56:41.439 --> 02:56:43.702]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:56:43.702 --> 02:56:44.402]  What does that mean?
[02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:47.235]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[02:56:47.235 --> 02:56:48.176]  Today is the day!
[02:56:48.176 --> 02:56:51.978]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[02:56:51.978 --> 02:56:55.281]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[02:56:55.281 --> 02:56:58.182]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[02:56:58.182 --> 02:57:02.005]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:57:02.005 --> 02:57:12.692]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[02:57:14.486 --> 02:57:19.048]  Including in places like Texas.
[02:57:19.048 --> 02:57:19.788]  That's ridiculous.
[02:57:19.788 --> 02:57:20.849]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:57:20.849 --> 02:57:25.251]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[02:57:25.251 --> 02:57:27.412]  History matters.
[02:57:27.412 --> 02:57:34.615]  Science says for evil to take us over, there must be a response of good.
[02:57:34.615 --> 02:57:38.036]  But if good is sleepwalking, you'll never even know there was a fight.
[02:57:38.036 --> 02:57:40.377]  If you're awake, we will win.
[02:57:40.377 --> 02:57:40.898]  We always do.
[02:57:42.295 --> 02:57:52.699]  But I can tell you with the weapons that have been put on this planet by the devil himself, by the systems that have been set up, if we lose this fight, it's the beginning of the end.
[02:57:52.699 --> 02:58:07.043]  We're gonna go to break, come back and take a few phone calls, but I just hope people that are arrogant like Obama really look into eternity and realize that the God of this world's given them power for a reason.
[02:58:07.043 --> 02:58:11.305]  Because they're carrying out a plan of destruction.
[02:58:11.305 --> 02:58:11.765]  And Obama?
[02:58:13.919 --> 02:58:16.861]  You're not as evil as the controllers above you.
[02:58:16.861 --> 02:58:18.822]  You know deep in your heart.
[02:58:18.822 --> 02:58:21.224]  You're gonna lose your soul doing this.
[02:58:21.224 --> 02:58:23.185]  And there's still time for you to turn back.
[02:58:23.185 --> 02:58:25.947]  Hillary is turned over to it.
[02:58:25.947 --> 02:58:27.108]  She's committed the ultimate sin.
[02:58:27.108 --> 02:58:28.009]  She's gone.
[02:58:28.009 --> 02:58:29.410]  There's no one left.
[02:58:29.410 --> 02:58:31.271]  Obama?
[02:58:31.271 --> 02:58:32.652]  There may still be something left for you.
[02:58:33.914 --> 02:58:35.476]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[02:58:35.476 --> 02:58:38.000]  We're going to end this weekend with free shipping on all items.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.444]  InfoWareStore.com to help fund the operation.
[02:58:40.444 --> 02:58:42.667]  And big discounts like 40% off on Brain Force.
[02:58:42.667 --> 02:58:43.489]  Take advantage of that.
[02:58:43.489 --> 02:58:43.849]  Back in 70.
[02:58:43.849 --> 02:58:46.834]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.795 --> 02:58:53.856]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[02:58:53.856 --> 02:58:55.076]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:58:55.076 --> 02:58:56.676]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:58:56.676 --> 02:58:59.797]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:58:59.797 --> 02:59:00.898]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[02:59:00.898 --> 02:59:01.818]  I've been working all day.
[02:59:01.818 --> 02:59:04.319]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:59:04.319 --> 02:59:05.739]  I get in here at 830.
[02:59:05.739 --> 02:59:07.639]  I was kind of run down.
[02:59:07.639 --> 02:59:09.360]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:59:09.580 --> 02:59:11.461]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:59:11.461 --> 02:59:13.302]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:59:13.302 --> 02:59:14.342]  I popped two of them.
[02:59:14.342 --> 02:59:16.624]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:59:16.624 --> 02:59:18.425]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:59:18.425 --> 02:59:20.085]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:59:20.085 --> 02:59:21.406]  People really love it.
[02:59:21.406 --> 02:59:22.026]  Read about it.
[02:59:22.026 --> 02:59:25.848]  Find out why third-party nucleotidical sites give it such high praise.
[02:59:25.848 --> 02:59:31.131]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:59:31.271 --> 02:59:35.334]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[02:59:35.334 --> 02:59:41.499]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[02:59:41.499 --> 02:59:53.850]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:53.850 --> 02:59:57.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.092 --> 02:59:58.293]  I can't believe this anymore.
[02:59:58.293 --> 02:59:59.554]  This is getting too crazy.
[02:59:59.554 --> 03:00:00.275]  I'm sure not I'll play it.
[03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:08.604]  From the front lines.
[03:00:08.604 --> 03:00:14.830]  From the front lines of the information war.
[03:00:14.830 --> 03:00:16.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.211 --> 03:00:18.113]  From the epicenter of the resistance.
[03:00:18.113 --> 03:00:26.080]  Because we've spiritually chosen this fight.
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:27.001]  Because we see the enemy.
[03:00:29.391 --> 03:00:31.571]  Stories up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:00:31.571 --> 03:00:32.912]  It's incredible.
[03:00:32.912 --> 03:00:34.673]  We're getting the video right now.
[03:00:34.673 --> 03:00:36.653]  Hillary's having a total mental meltdown.
[03:00:36.653 --> 03:00:42.776]  It's so important that everybody basically hope and pray that she falls and her evil side be shown.
[03:00:42.776 --> 03:00:45.557]  Go to camera 3, I can show folks.
[03:00:45.557 --> 03:00:49.518]  Bizarre Hillary calls Trump her husband.
[03:00:49.518 --> 03:00:52.760]  Bill Clinton comes to her mind when Hillary says opponent.
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:55.601]  We've got the other clip we've got ready of Hillary
[03:00:56.767 --> 03:01:00.570]  Raised taxes on the middle class from KETV7.
[03:01:00.570 --> 03:01:05.635]  Let's play that clip first.
[03:01:05.635 --> 03:01:12.841]  Because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich.
[03:01:17.998 --> 03:01:20.760]  Well, we're not going there, my friends.
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:29.104]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[03:01:29.104 --> 03:01:31.826]  I should've been playing that all day.
[03:01:31.826 --> 03:01:33.747]  I want that playing every ten seconds.
[03:01:33.747 --> 03:01:35.748]  I hope Knight plays it five times coming up.
[03:01:35.748 --> 03:01:43.833]  That should be... Folks, this is how she bamboozles her viewers, her supporters, her listeners, her slaves.
[03:01:44.938 --> 03:01:49.940]  Trump wants to cut the corporate tax so that they're forced to bring the money back here.
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:59.863]  When they raised, major corporations lobbied to make foreign corporations move offshore so they could direct the investment to China, India, Mexico, and 100 plus other countries.
[03:01:59.863 --> 03:02:01.663]  Plus, like 160 plus.
[03:02:01.663 --> 03:02:03.064]  It's social engineering.
[03:02:03.064 --> 03:02:07.285]  Trump wants to lower it to the lowest so they'll move the damn jobs back here!
[03:02:10.532 --> 03:02:17.495]  She gets up there to these poor, poor people and goes, I'm not going to let that happen.
[03:02:17.495 --> 03:02:20.456]  She looks like the sea hag from Popeye.
[03:02:20.456 --> 03:02:21.516]  Holy Toledo.
[03:02:21.516 --> 03:02:24.497]  Have we been able to grab the next clip here yet?
[03:02:24.497 --> 03:02:25.178]  Let's play it.
[03:02:25.178 --> 03:02:26.818]  It just gets worse.
[03:02:26.818 --> 03:02:28.919]  Thank God is cursing her.
[03:02:28.919 --> 03:02:29.799]  Let her get into office.
[03:02:29.799 --> 03:02:30.780]  I'm telling you, she's going to die.
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:32.100]  I can feel it.
[03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:33.081]  God's going to strike her down.
[03:02:33.081 --> 03:02:33.821]  I'm serious.
[03:02:33.821 --> 03:02:34.421]  This is epic.
[03:02:34.421 --> 03:02:35.602]  The woman is a goddamn demon.
[03:02:35.602 --> 03:02:36.582]  Here it is.
[03:02:36.582 --> 03:02:39.023]  Of course, I hope you will compare
[03:02:40.017 --> 03:02:45.658]  What I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:02:45.658 --> 03:02:46.439]  Play that again.
[03:02:46.439 --> 03:02:47.899]  What a creepazoid.
[03:02:47.899 --> 03:02:49.499]  What a freak show.
[03:02:49.499 --> 03:02:53.700]  I would go to the other side of the street not to walk by her.
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:03:00.602]  Of course, I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:03:04.172 --> 03:03:06.114]  Man, I'm out of time.
[03:03:06.114 --> 03:03:07.015]  We got loaded phones.
[03:03:07.015 --> 03:03:07.455]  I apologize.
[03:03:07.455 --> 03:03:08.336]  I haven't gotten to you.
[03:03:08.336 --> 03:03:09.718]  David Knight may want to punch out all the calls.
[03:03:09.718 --> 03:03:13.161]  We want to take him wherever he wants to.
[03:03:13.161 --> 03:03:15.263]  We live in a very, very historic moment at this point.
[03:03:15.263 --> 03:03:17.966]  David's about to come in the studio and take over.
[03:03:17.966 --> 03:03:20.328]  But I'm just glad I'm not with these people.
[03:03:20.328 --> 03:03:22.590]  I mean, I should have been playing that all day long.
[03:03:22.590 --> 03:03:24.672]  We're going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[03:03:24.672 --> 03:03:25.914]  Obama already did!
[03:03:28.885 --> 03:03:30.986]  And they got rid of all these loopholes that weren't loopholes.
[03:03:30.986 --> 03:03:38.749]  It's like, if I build a new studio for $300,000, I have to pay tax on it like I own it.
[03:03:38.749 --> 03:03:39.469]  I don't own it.
[03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:43.731]  The dang is a giant bowling ball around my neck.
[03:03:43.731 --> 03:03:51.734]  You think having employees and having a building and having all this crap is a asset?
[03:03:51.734 --> 03:03:53.234]  I couldn't sell this stuff in here for $50,000.
[03:03:55.930 --> 03:03:57.291]  There is no market for it!
[03:03:57.291 --> 03:03:58.971]  There's no market to hire people!
[03:03:58.971 --> 03:04:02.873]  There's no market to actually build things in this country!
[03:04:02.873 --> 03:04:04.754]  But oh my gosh, I'm so rich!
[03:04:04.754 --> 03:04:05.774]  Look at all this money!
[03:04:05.774 --> 03:04:12.517]  Yeah, if I wanted a private jet, I could write the whole damn thing off, but not a building, not hiring people.
[03:04:12.517 --> 03:04:16.099]  They've got the whole thing set up to shut this economy down.
[03:04:17.492 --> 03:04:19.255]  That's why I say you've got to go against the system.
[03:04:19.255 --> 03:04:21.357]  You've got to buy tons of our products.
[03:04:21.357 --> 03:04:23.220]  The t-shirts, the books, the nutraceuticals.
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:24.962]  Free shipping ends this weekend.
[03:04:24.962 --> 03:04:26.184]  Ends on Sunday.
[03:04:26.184 --> 03:04:29.589]  Because then I can somehow swim upstream like a crazy salmon.
[03:04:30.543 --> 03:04:33.986]  Pass the Kodiak Bears and actually get the ball in the basket here.
[03:04:33.986 --> 03:04:35.447]  And I'm not complaining, we're kicking ass.
[03:04:35.447 --> 03:04:38.490]  It's just that, I can't imagine the average person trying to deal with this.
[03:04:38.490 --> 03:04:40.752]  I mean, it's designed to make you give up.
[03:04:40.752 --> 03:04:49.719]  It is designed, the inspectors and the harassers and the, and the, and then when they have this attitude, when they show up like you've done something wrong.
[03:04:49.719 --> 03:04:54.663]  I mean, it's just like, all I'm trying to do is just not have nuclear war.
[03:04:54.663 --> 03:04:56.064]  And it brings jihadis in.
[03:04:56.064 --> 03:04:57.846]  David Knight's coming up, stay with us.
[03:05:01.761 --> 03:05:07.766]  An article up at the Washington Post, wearing Don't Tread On Me insignia could be punishable racial harassment.
[03:05:07.766 --> 03:05:17.095]  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as FAG, among its other functions, decides hostile work environment harassment claims brought against federal agencies.
[03:05:17.375 --> 03:05:24.500]  On January 8, 2014, a complainant filed that the agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race.
[03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:35.347]  In the fall of 2013, a co-worker repeatedly wore a cap to work with insignia of the Gadsden flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake in the phrase, don't tread on me.
[03:05:35.347 --> 03:05:44.493]  Complainant stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a slave trader and owner of slaves.
[03:05:44.753 --> 03:05:52.261]  Although a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden flag originated in a revolutionary war in a non-racial context.
[03:05:52.261 --> 03:05:52.982]  Boom!
[03:05:52.982 --> 03:05:53.703]  Facts!
[03:05:53.703 --> 03:05:54.344]  Boom!
[03:05:54.344 --> 03:05:55.445]  Liberals down!
[03:05:55.445 --> 03:05:59.970]  This has been Joe Biggs, serving you some information at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.970 --> 03:06:00.371]  Enjoy!
[03:06:01.573 --> 03:06:03.454]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:06:03.454 --> 03:06:05.474]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:06:05.474 --> 03:06:08.376]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:06:08.376 --> 03:06:14.438]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:06:14.438 --> 03:06:23.641]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:06:23.641 --> 03:06:28.483]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:06:28.703 --> 03:06:31.166]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:06:31.166 --> 03:06:39.194]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:06:39.194 --> 03:06:40.155]  The general public doesn't.
[03:06:41.378 --> 03:06:44.739]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:06:44.739 --> 03:06:48.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:55.582]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:06:55.582 --> 03:06:59.683]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:07:01.824 --> 03:07:10.012]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:07:10.012 --> 03:07:10.833]  Here's why.
[03:07:10.833 --> 03:07:14.977]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:07:14.977 --> 03:07:15.898]  So please listen.
[03:07:15.898 --> 03:07:19.342]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:07:19.582 --> 03:07:25.967]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:07:25.967 --> 03:07:33.274]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:07:33.274 --> 03:07:35.615]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:07:35.615 --> 03:07:46.905]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[03:07:47.185 --> 03:07:48.927]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:07:48.927 --> 03:07:50.629]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:07:50.629 --> 03:07:52.350]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:07:52.350 --> 03:07:56.234]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:07:56.234 --> 03:07:57.795]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:07:57.795 --> 03:07:59.137]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:08:12.649 --> 03:08:17.331]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:38.908 --> 03:08:42.690]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, August 5th, 2016.
[03:08:42.690 --> 03:08:44.071]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:08:44.071 --> 03:08:45.492]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:45.492 --> 03:08:48.854]  We have a very interesting guest coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:48.854 --> 03:08:56.458]  We're going to be talking to a scientist from Berkeley, California about his company that is working on what used to be called cold fusion.
[03:08:56.458 --> 03:08:59.419]  Now they call it low energy nuclear reactions.
[03:08:59.419 --> 03:09:01.080]  And we're going to talk about that.
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:03.522]  The Defense Department has said this has potential to be a
[03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:07.631]  Hugely disruptive technology, and of course it does.
[03:09:07.631 --> 03:09:09.872]  It would change everything.
[03:09:09.872 --> 03:09:10.913]  Even politically.
[03:09:10.913 --> 03:09:18.857]  Understand that our currency is based around the petrodollar, so it's got massive political issues at stake as well.
[03:09:18.857 --> 03:09:21.439]  But it's important as we look at this, as we look at
[03:09:22.813 --> 03:09:24.294]  History as we look at technology.
[03:09:24.294 --> 03:09:29.198]  You know, I keep seeing the same M.O.s repeated over and over and over again.
[03:09:29.198 --> 03:09:32.140]  You know, Hillary's getting her Nixon on.
[03:09:32.140 --> 03:09:35.703]  She's got her own plumbers trying to cover her leaks, but they're not doing it.
[03:09:35.703 --> 03:09:40.026]  You've got people internally, I think, that are trying to expose what she's doing.
[03:09:40.026 --> 03:09:42.288]  We've had multiple people in Intelligence Center
[03:09:42.968 --> 03:09:45.770]  Very, very upset with what Hillary Clinton is doing.
[03:09:45.770 --> 03:09:58.538]  We had Judge Apolitano, as he pointed out earlier in the week, saying he's talked to a lot of people in the intelligence community that believe that what she has done has resulted in the direct deaths of agents that have been exposed.
[03:09:58.538 --> 03:10:01.140]  Alex was just talking to William Binney in the last hour.
[03:10:01.140 --> 03:10:02.901]  Amazing interview.
[03:10:02.901 --> 03:10:05.303]  If you haven't seen that interview, you need to watch that interview.
[03:10:06.249 --> 03:10:13.834]  One of the key takeaways that I think Mr. Binney had to say, and I gotta say I have so much respect for William Binney.
[03:10:13.834 --> 03:10:19.877]  This guy truly is a winter soldier, and by that I don't mean the Captain America stuff, the villain, okay?
[03:10:19.877 --> 03:10:23.620]  No, winter soldier in the sense that he's not a sunshine patriot.
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:26.502]  This is a guy who toughs it out in Valley Forge.
[03:10:26.502 --> 03:10:30.484]  He does the right thing, even when everything is against him.
[03:10:30.484 --> 03:10:34.426]  One of the things that he said, which I think is very true,
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:39.421]  This whole lie about privacy versus security.
[03:10:39.421 --> 03:10:42.642]  William Benny said this was a lie from the beginning.
[03:10:42.642 --> 03:10:43.863]  It has been.
[03:10:43.863 --> 03:10:54.386]  As I said before, you cannot be secure if you have no privacy, if you have no freedom, if you trade your liberty for the promise of security and safety.
[03:10:54.386 --> 03:10:57.927]  As our founder said, you'll get neither, you deserve neither.
[03:10:57.927 --> 03:11:00.088]  Slaves are never free.
[03:11:00.088 --> 03:11:02.149]  People who have no privacy are never free.
[03:11:02.938 --> 03:11:09.284]  People who trade their prosperity, their private property, for the promise of safety and security are never free.
[03:11:09.284 --> 03:11:10.525]  You just become a prisoner.
[03:11:10.525 --> 03:11:14.889]  You just become a serf, a slave, to the degree that you trade that out.
[03:11:14.889 --> 03:11:17.972]  And he said, look, they just want power over you.
[03:11:17.972 --> 03:11:19.573]  He said they're covering for each other.
[03:11:19.573 --> 03:11:21.495]  In other words, it's a criminal conspiracy.
[03:11:21.495 --> 03:11:22.216]  We've told you this.
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:24.740]  It's simply a criminal conspiracy.
[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:30.381]  In this quote from William Binney, I wrote these things down as he was talking, trading our security for money.
[03:11:30.381 --> 03:11:34.962]  He said, they keep the problems going so the money keeps flowing.
[03:11:34.962 --> 03:11:38.083]  That's the basis of the military-industrial complex.
[03:11:38.083 --> 03:11:41.303]  So I'm very anxious to see this movie when it comes out, A Good American.
[03:11:41.303 --> 03:11:44.344]  He was talking about that, but he was not talking to plug a movie that he's in.
[03:11:44.344 --> 03:11:48.064]  I'm sure knowing William Binney, he gets paid very little of anything.
[03:11:48.064 --> 03:11:50.365]  This is a documentary somebody is putting together.
[03:11:50.365 --> 03:11:50.905]  William Binney
[03:11:51.872 --> 03:11:56.493]  And these other NSA whistleblowers like Thomas Drake, they gave up everything.
[03:11:56.493 --> 03:11:58.753]  They didn't do this for money.
[03:11:58.753 --> 03:12:01.814]  They gave up everything to protect the Constitution.
[03:12:01.814 --> 03:12:04.494]  And so, this is a key interview.
[03:12:04.494 --> 03:12:06.635]  You need to see what he has to say.
[03:12:06.635 --> 03:12:13.816]  And I think it's interesting, this article that's on the Drudge Report today about the new Snowden movie that's coming out by Oliver Stone.
[03:12:13.816 --> 03:12:19.297]  I was very disappointed to see Judicial Watch take this position because I have a lot of respect for Judicial Watch.
[03:12:20.054 --> 03:12:23.578]  They have done a great job of exposing the crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:23.578 --> 03:12:35.190]  As a matter of fact, I don't know where it is right now, but there is a court case that Judicial Watch has put together to try to get Hillary to testify in a lawsuit.
[03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:36.251]  So it's a civil lawsuit.
[03:12:37.012 --> 03:12:41.634]  And it was happening just before the political conventions came up.
[03:12:41.634 --> 03:12:49.597]  There was supposed to be a ruling by a judge as to whether or not she would be compelled to testify in this civil lawsuit because it involved her.
[03:12:49.597 --> 03:12:57.881]  And remember, it was a civil lawsuit testimony that Bill Clinton testified in that caused him to commit perjury.
[03:12:57.881 --> 03:12:58.981]  That's why he was impeached.
[03:12:58.981 --> 03:13:01.582]  He wasn't impeached for his affairs, okay?
[03:13:01.582 --> 03:13:05.704]  He was impeached because he committed perjury as part of a civil lawsuit.
[03:13:06.204 --> 03:13:16.690]  So Judicial Watch has a civil lawsuit coming against Hillary Clinton for these email, for these security violations and other issues and we're still awaiting.
[03:13:16.690 --> 03:13:20.112]  I still have not seen whether or not the judge is going to compel her to testify.
[03:13:20.112 --> 03:13:21.473]  That would be incredibly important.
[03:13:21.473 --> 03:13:26.216]  So Judicial Watch does amazingly important information.
[03:13:26.216 --> 03:13:32.120]  They have revealed information about what happened with Benghazi and other things through regular channels.
[03:13:33.274 --> 03:13:38.856]  But they came out and said that they believe that Snowden is not a hero, but a traitor.
[03:13:38.856 --> 03:13:49.340]  And because he's a traitor, in their opinion, they think that this movie would be allowing the makers of the movie, Oliver Stone and others, to profit from treason.
[03:13:49.340 --> 03:13:52.841]  And that should be a reason that people come out after them.
[03:13:52.841 --> 03:13:54.882]  Let me say this, okay?
[03:13:54.882 --> 03:13:57.003]  The enemies knew what was going on.
[03:13:58.209 --> 03:14:07.692]  And what they were doing when they revealed this was they were telling the country that the government was violating the law.
[03:14:07.692 --> 03:14:13.413]  They're violating the law because they're compiling all this information in a massive way, as William Binney has pointed out.
[03:14:13.413 --> 03:14:26.097]  They had Trailblazer, which would go in and would allow them to get the information in an anonymous way and look for certain things, rather than doing dragnet surveillance, rather than collecting all this information on everyone.
[03:14:27.108 --> 03:14:35.012]  That's what he and other whistleblowers within the NSA had done, and then they saw that the NSA was not interested in doing it that way.
[03:14:35.012 --> 03:14:39.895]  They wanted to go into the police state mode, and that's when they became whistleblowers.
[03:14:39.895 --> 03:14:41.816]  They went through regular channels.
[03:14:41.816 --> 03:14:42.796]  They went to Congress.
[03:14:42.796 --> 03:14:44.417]  Congress yawned and did nothing.
[03:14:46.576 --> 03:14:51.623]  We had Thomas Drake who talked to a reporter in general about what was going on.
[03:14:51.623 --> 03:14:56.850]  When you reveal that criminal action is going on, you are a whistleblower.
[03:14:56.850 --> 03:15:04.019]  Now, their position is that because Al-Qaeda was alerted to the idea that the government was
[03:15:05.112 --> 03:15:10.134]  Using methods to intercept their communications that somehow cause lives to be lost.
[03:15:10.134 --> 03:15:14.877]  I don't think that is anywhere close to the same league as what Hillary Clinton does.
[03:15:14.877 --> 03:15:17.318]  She revealed detailed information.
[03:15:17.318 --> 03:15:21.420]  She got into the GAMMA program, the GAMMA compartment as William Binning was talking about.
[03:15:22.242 --> 03:15:24.083]  She gave specifics to people.
[03:15:24.083 --> 03:15:25.544]  They were talking about general things.
[03:15:25.544 --> 03:15:30.526]  They were showing slides that said, look, the NSA is laughing at you.
[03:15:30.526 --> 03:15:34.788]  They're saying, who would have thought in 1984, they had a series of three slides.
[03:15:34.788 --> 03:15:36.509]  Remember they had a picture of the 1984 iconic
[03:15:38.930 --> 03:15:42.352]  Uh, commercial that was promoting Apple Macintosh.
[03:15:42.352 --> 03:15:53.457]  And so they showed that picture and said, who would have thought in 1984, because that's when that came out and it was referenced in 1984, that this, the next slide, shows Steve Jobs holding up an iPhone, that this would become Big Brother.
[03:15:54.266 --> 03:15:59.908]  And then they show the third slide which shows people queued up to get it and that people would willingly pay for it.
[03:15:59.908 --> 03:16:13.553]  They are laughing at you because they are illegally doing dragnet surveillance on the American people through their devices and you're stupid enough to go out and pay for it yourself and get enthralled with this new technology.
[03:16:14.659 --> 03:16:17.280]  So that's what was revealed with Snowden.
[03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:19.221]  That's why he is a hero.
[03:16:19.221 --> 03:16:23.502]  And I think William Binney is absolutely right.
[03:16:23.502 --> 03:16:32.105]  The entire world owes a debt to him because this kind of corruption, this kind of secret police state that used to be combined to places like East Germany and the Stasi,
[03:16:32.785 --> 03:16:35.407]  Has now becoming globalized, okay?
[03:16:35.407 --> 03:16:38.569]  It's not just the American government, it's all governments are starting to do this.
[03:16:38.569 --> 03:16:49.417]  So it's a very key thing and it's a very different thing to tell people that your government is breaking law than it is to reveal details of conversations, to reveal names of people.
[03:16:49.417 --> 03:16:50.758]  That is a very different thing.
[03:16:50.758 --> 03:16:51.879]  Now where is this all headed?
[03:16:52.847 --> 03:16:55.387]  Look at this article that was up on the Drudge Report.
[03:16:55.387 --> 03:17:02.149]  Chicago police using pre-crime AI to arrest people before they commit a crime.
[03:17:02.149 --> 03:17:03.589]  Before they commit a crime.
[03:17:03.589 --> 03:17:04.969]  This is from Technocracy.
[03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:14.311]  They say people are arresting, police are arresting people for crimes they're not committed yet using a new computer algorithm that will predict future crime.
[03:17:14.311 --> 03:17:15.971]  It's called predictive policing.
[03:17:15.971 --> 03:17:17.992]  It's being used, of course, where else?
[03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:18.492]  Chicago.
[03:17:19.232 --> 03:17:21.634]  Where all the criminal stuff begins, okay?
[03:17:21.634 --> 03:17:25.098]  Strategic Subject List, the SSL.
[03:17:25.098 --> 03:17:28.081]  And the Chicago Special Order, S10-06.
[03:17:28.081 --> 03:17:29.982]  Okay?
[03:17:29.982 --> 03:17:35.468]  This will equip law enforcement with the ability to arrest citizens before they commit a crime.
[03:17:35.468 --> 03:17:40.172]  So it will take into various factors, like your criminal records or your affiliations.
[03:17:41.173 --> 03:17:42.954]  Or, the number of past arrests.
[03:17:42.954 --> 03:17:48.558]  But it will also use things like social media to develop a citizen ranking on locals and identify future threats.
[03:17:48.558 --> 03:17:49.899]  Look, understand this.
[03:17:49.899 --> 03:17:58.265]  Just as the RICO statutes were initially created to go after organized crime figures and to confiscate their assets,
[03:17:58.925 --> 03:18:03.228]  Before their trial, so they would not be able to defend themselves with highest priced lawyers.
[03:18:03.228 --> 03:18:05.170]  That was the whole idea behind RICO statute.
[03:18:05.170 --> 03:18:11.735]  But what they did was, it was a pre-conviction punishment, so that they could get a conviction against you.
[03:18:11.735 --> 03:18:13.076]  Where did we see this go?
[03:18:13.076 --> 03:18:19.621]  RICO statute eventually began being used against, it wasn't very long before they started using it against abortion protesters or other people.
[03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:20.002]  It's being
[03:18:20.642 --> 03:18:26.445]  Uh, put out that they would like to use RICO statutes against people who don't agree with man-made global warming.
[03:18:26.445 --> 03:18:33.968]  You have to understand that once they start this out, they're going to put it against, uh, people who are true criminals, but they're going to bring this out to the entire population.
[03:18:34.895 --> 03:18:40.859]  The fastest growing area of the intelligence surveillance community is geospatial intelligence.
[03:18:40.859 --> 03:18:44.481]  We talked about this with Jade Helm last year when they talked about mastering the human domain.
[03:18:44.481 --> 03:18:49.724]  You understand that is about human domain analytics, exactly what they're talking about here.
[03:18:49.724 --> 03:18:52.166]  And when you go back and you look at geospatial intelligence,
[03:18:52.526 --> 03:19:05.170]  Well, they map you onto the map, geographically onto the map, but they also map your political beliefs, your religious affiliations, who your friends are, things that are completely innocuous.
[03:19:05.170 --> 03:19:07.430]  They map everybody.
[03:19:07.430 --> 03:19:16.613]  And you have to understand what they are doing with this and where they're going in the long run is to shut down political enemies, not just going after violent criminals or terrorists.
[03:19:16.613 --> 03:19:18.153]  That is where this is headed.
[03:19:18.153 --> 03:19:20.054]  They want activity-based intelligence.
[03:19:20.054 --> 03:19:20.734]  The metadata
[03:19:21.587 --> 03:19:24.088]  That Hayden and these other people are lying to you about.
[03:19:24.088 --> 03:19:27.128]  That is the most important data they get.
[03:19:27.128 --> 03:19:29.549]  The metadata is the most important data.
[03:19:29.549 --> 03:19:34.350]  When they say, we're not recording your conversations, well, you know, as William Benny has pointed out, that's a lie.
[03:19:34.350 --> 03:19:40.871]  But the most important data that they're getting is the metadata, because with that, they can build a complete profile of you.
[03:19:40.871 --> 03:19:46.552]  And we have another story that's on the Drudge Report, how a company has already built a profile on every single adult American.
[03:19:47.634 --> 03:19:51.241]  This is the kind of surveillance state that we need to shut down.
[03:19:51.241 --> 03:19:52.785]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:19:52.785 --> 03:19:54.728]  And we're gonna have ColdFusion at the bottom of the hour.

[03:21:14.233 --> 03:21:22.278]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.

[03:24:05.598 --> 03:24:15.961]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[03:24:15.961 --> 03:24:22.503]  In the next segment we're going to be talking to someone about the state of the art in cold fusion.
[03:24:22.503 --> 03:24:24.824]  And we're going to, that's a very disruptive technology.
[03:24:24.824 --> 03:24:32.866]  You know, when we look at technology and how it has the chance to, the opportunity to completely change our world as we know it.
[03:24:32.866 --> 03:24:34.507]  That's why we talk so much about things like
[03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:41.450]  Self-driving cars, where the government's going to take over control of all private transportation.
[03:24:41.450 --> 03:24:43.531]  They're going to track and tax everything you do.
[03:24:43.531 --> 03:24:45.771]  They're going to control your movements with that.
[03:24:45.771 --> 03:24:50.672]  But this could possibly be a freeing technology, but it certainly would be a disruptive technology.
[03:24:50.672 --> 03:24:55.173]  It's going to change the control that our government exerts through the petrodollar.
[03:24:55.173 --> 03:24:57.674]  It's going to change scarcity of energy.
[03:24:58.274 --> 03:25:01.316]  And it could have a lot of effect on wars.
[03:25:01.316 --> 03:25:05.259]  Of course, the people who have a lot to lose are the people who start our wars.
[03:25:05.259 --> 03:25:10.582]  And when they see things start to change in a disruptive way they don't like, they have other ways of disrupting us.
[03:25:10.582 --> 03:25:12.524]  So we're going to talk to him in the next segment.
[03:25:12.524 --> 03:25:17.667]  Before we get on with some breaking news here, I want to remind you that we have extended the specials.
[03:25:17.667 --> 03:25:26.293]  We still have some stock, but it's going to end very shortly because we have to save these items for the people who are on auto-ship.
[03:25:26.693 --> 03:25:34.557]  And these are some of the sales that we had in our mega special that we had a 24 hour actually 28 hour special last week.
[03:25:34.557 --> 03:25:42.280]  We have still have 40% off brain force, 30% off vitamin mineral fusion, and 30% off DNA force.
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:43.301]  Those specials are still up.
[03:25:43.821 --> 03:25:47.204]  They will be taken down this weekend because we are running out of stock.
[03:25:47.204 --> 03:25:52.447]  And those are huge savings, especially the dollar figure that you save off of DNA Force.
[03:25:52.447 --> 03:25:53.908]  30% off that is huge.
[03:25:53.908 --> 03:25:57.551]  And everything at the store is still free shipping.
[03:25:57.551 --> 03:26:03.295]  So we have store-wide free shipping, plus 40% off Brain Force, 30% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:26:03.295 --> 03:26:05.456]  That's the broad-based energy drink.
[03:26:05.456 --> 03:26:05.997]  Tastes great.
[03:26:06.637 --> 03:26:12.363]  Get your minerals as well as vitamins in a great tasting format and 30% off DNA Force.
[03:26:12.363 --> 03:26:22.574]  You know one of the things I was looking at of course here is people just keep this controversy with Khan going and as some people pointed out
[03:26:24.059 --> 03:26:30.481]  Didn't Hillary Clinton disrespect the Gold Star families when she lied to them and the public about Benghazi?
[03:26:30.481 --> 03:26:33.042]  Perhaps she caused the death of those people.
[03:26:33.042 --> 03:26:34.543]  That's what we're very concerned about.
[03:26:34.543 --> 03:26:36.023]  But look at the other aspect of this.
[03:26:36.023 --> 03:26:38.524]  This Sharia Khan guy, okay?
[03:26:38.524 --> 03:26:44.586]  This guy who is really not an expert on the Constitution by any means, but he is an expert on Sharia law.
[03:26:45.266 --> 03:26:46.888]  He's written a lot of commentaries on it.
[03:26:46.888 --> 03:26:50.773]  He finally analyzes all the details of Sharia law.
[03:26:50.773 --> 03:26:54.057]  Look at what this looks like in practice, okay?
[03:26:54.057 --> 03:26:56.420]  There's a situation in Turkey.
[03:26:56.420 --> 03:26:57.721]  This is reported by CNN.
[03:26:57.721 --> 03:27:04.669]  A gay refugee living in Turkey has been found brutally murdered, his body so mutilated his friends could only identify him by his pants.
[03:27:05.689 --> 03:27:06.269]  Okay?
[03:27:06.269 --> 03:27:11.010]  And the picture that they have on here is ISIS throwing gay men off the building.
[03:27:11.010 --> 03:27:11.730]  Okay?
[03:27:11.730 --> 03:27:25.093]  When she has this guy speak to essentially introduce her, one of the few speakers that was speaking just before she spoke, ask yourself, okay, what is the message that Hillary Clinton was sending to us?
[03:27:25.093 --> 03:27:25.833]  Okay?
[03:27:25.833 --> 03:27:34.595]  She wants to put this guy out so badly because she's playing identity politics and she wants to attack Donald Trump ad hominem by misrepresenting what he wants to do with immigration.
[03:27:35.606 --> 03:27:46.690]  Not a blanket ban of Muslims, but determining the kind of people that we want to let into this country, as well vetting them, knowing something about these people, where they're from, what their background is.
[03:27:46.690 --> 03:27:57.854]  I mean, quite frankly, if I was president and I was looking at somebody like Khazir Khan, who had advocated Sharia law, I would say, no, he's not going to become a citizen of the United States.
[03:27:57.854 --> 03:28:00.195]  I would not have let him in, quite frankly, and let me tell you why.
[03:28:01.124 --> 03:28:05.705]  They say, these people, here's a gay guy, and this is just one aspect to Sharia law, of course.
[03:28:05.705 --> 03:28:12.587]  There's a lot of things in Sharia law for which you can get this kind of hatred, violence, and death penalty.
[03:28:12.587 --> 03:28:14.347]  Okay, they say, we identified him from his pants.
[03:28:14.347 --> 03:28:20.628]  They had cut him so violently, so violent, that two knives had broken inside of him.
[03:28:20.628 --> 03:28:22.209]  Then they beheaded him.
[03:28:22.209 --> 03:28:27.750]  His upper body was beyond recognition, said his friend, who CNN is not naming for safety reasons.
[03:28:28.632 --> 03:28:34.455]  That is the Sharia law that Khazir Khan advocates in practice.
[03:28:34.455 --> 03:28:41.759]  So, she not only, you know, she threw her gay supporters under the bus, quite frankly, by having this guy out there.
[03:28:41.759 --> 03:28:50.143]  She's trying to throw all of us under the bus by trying to bring in as many of these people as they can without vetting anybody.
[03:28:50.143 --> 03:28:51.624]  They're Muslims who are not maniacs.
[03:28:52.571 --> 03:28:57.453]  But we'd want to make sure we don't let the maniacs in to the asylum here, okay?
[03:28:57.453 --> 03:28:59.193]  Turn this into Arkham Asylum.
[03:28:59.193 --> 03:29:04.035]  She put that out there and basically... Look at this insanity, okay?
[03:29:04.035 --> 03:29:13.057]  A man who stood up to the Munich shooters is now facing prosecution in Germany because he insulted the guy who had just shot nine people.
[03:29:13.057 --> 03:29:14.058]  How's that for insanity?
[03:29:14.938 --> 03:29:15.358]  Okay?
[03:29:15.358 --> 03:29:19.701]  How's that for political correctness run to the nth degree?
[03:29:19.701 --> 03:29:21.242]  Do you understand that?
[03:29:21.242 --> 03:29:25.725]  Do you understand that is essentially what the Democrat National Convention was doing?
[03:29:25.725 --> 03:29:32.069]  They put a guy up there who is advocating a system of law that results in what I just read to you.
[03:29:32.069 --> 03:29:32.570]  Okay?
[03:29:32.570 --> 03:29:33.991]  And it's not just gays they do it to.
[03:29:33.991 --> 03:29:35.111]  They do it to Christians.
[03:29:35.111 --> 03:29:36.352]  They do it to Muslim converts.
[03:29:36.352 --> 03:29:37.853]  They do it to people who commit adultery.
[03:29:37.853 --> 03:29:41.576]  They have a long laundry list of people they hate and get violent with.
[03:29:42.536 --> 03:29:51.702]  So she puts this guy up there, but they go to the mat for political correctness, just like they want to jail this guy, prosecute this guy for insulting the shooter.
[03:29:51.702 --> 03:29:52.623]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:52.623 --> 03:29:55.144]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.144 --> 03:29:57.826]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.920 --> 03:30:04.163]  Yesterday, Dakota Meyer, a U.S.
[03:30:04.163 --> 03:30:09.129]  Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, decided to open his mouth and tweet this out.
[03:30:09.129 --> 03:30:12.913]  If real Donald Trump wants to be Commander-in-Chief, he needs to act like one.
[03:30:12.913 --> 03:30:16.397]  And that can't start until he apologizes to the cons.
[03:30:16.397 --> 03:30:18.780]  And we all know that the cons are a con job.
[03:30:18.780 --> 03:30:19.701]  They support the fact
[03:30:19.741 --> 03:30:27.085]  The fact that his son, Captain Khan, voluntarily joined the military and fought radical Islamic terrorism and died.
[03:30:27.085 --> 03:30:31.027]  The same kind of people that Mr. Khan wants to bring into this country.
[03:30:31.027 --> 03:30:33.348]  What do you stand for, Dakota Meyer?
[03:30:33.348 --> 03:30:37.731]  I do respect the things you've done, but this, this tweet, is ridiculous.
[03:30:37.731 --> 03:30:45.935]  And the fact that now Hillary Clinton is using it to politicize her campaign to smear Donald Trump is completely and totally disgusting.
[03:30:46.255 --> 03:30:48.837]  All of the military is watching this right now.
[03:30:48.837 --> 03:30:49.958]  Our eyes are open.
[03:30:49.958 --> 03:30:50.959]  What are you going to do?
[03:30:50.959 --> 03:30:53.020]  Are you going to do the right thing and take that down?
[03:30:53.020 --> 03:30:57.544]  Or are you going to sit there and actually help out the most corrupt person ever?
[03:30:57.544 --> 03:31:01.327]  Hillary for Prison, Joe Biggs, Infowars.com, and I'm pissed off.
[03:31:01.627 --> 03:31:02.147]  Not a group.
[03:31:02.147 --> 03:31:03.589]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:31:03.589 --> 03:31:04.910]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:06.130]  Why is this so good?
[03:31:06.130 --> 03:31:11.394]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:31:11.394 --> 03:31:24.945]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:31:24.945 --> 03:31:26.306]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:31:27.086 --> 03:31:28.728]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:31:28.728 --> 03:31:31.312]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:31:31.312 --> 03:31:32.614]  These are all parasites.
[03:31:32.614 --> 03:31:33.715]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:31:33.715 --> 03:31:35.057]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:35.057 --> 03:31:39.563]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:39.563 --> 03:31:42.707]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:42.827 --> 03:31:45.850]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:45.850 --> 03:31:46.931]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:31:46.931 --> 03:31:48.872]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:48.872 --> 03:31:49.893]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:31:49.893 --> 03:31:52.575]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:31:52.575 --> 03:31:55.858]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:55.858 --> 03:31:58.100]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:31:58.100 --> 03:32:00.062]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:32:01.365 --> 03:32:07.910]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:11.132]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:32:11.132 --> 03:32:16.737]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:32:16.737 --> 03:32:22.841]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:32:22.841 --> 03:32:26.124]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:26.124 --> 03:32:27.565]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[03:32:27.765 --> 03:32:32.086]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:32.086 --> 03:32:35.027]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:35.027 --> 03:32:36.688]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:32:36.688 --> 03:32:40.129]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:40.129 --> 03:32:42.729]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:32:42.729 --> 03:32:43.790]  It's in powder form.
[03:32:43.790 --> 03:32:46.671]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:32:46.671 --> 03:32:47.391]  I take this.
[03:32:47.391 --> 03:32:49.191]  This is the product that I take.
[03:32:49.191 --> 03:32:51.172]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:32:51.992 --> 03:32:52.773]  We fight the Globals.
[03:32:52.773 --> 03:32:53.934]  We fight the New World Order.

[03:33:16.568 --> 03:33:18.349]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:18.349 --> 03:33:20.290]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:20.290 --> 03:33:21.951]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:21.951 --> 03:33:23.612]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:23.612 --> 03:33:28.155]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.450 --> 03:33:34.532]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.532 --> 03:33:35.192]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:35.192 --> 03:33:39.498]  We're going to be talking to a gentleman with Brilloin Energy.
[03:33:39.498 --> 03:33:40.760]  This is Robert George.
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:42.642]  This is a company that is in Berkeley, California.
[03:33:42.642 --> 03:33:49.772]  We're going to talk about what's been commonly known as cold fusion, but is also known as low energy nuclear reactions.
[03:33:49.772 --> 03:33:50.974]  Before we do, real quickly,
[03:33:51.494 --> 03:33:56.596]  I want to play again these clips that we just got from Hillary Clinton, one of them where she comes out.
[03:33:56.596 --> 03:34:00.078]  Of course, everything that she does is very focus group tested.
[03:34:00.078 --> 03:34:06.781]  It's all put out on the teleprompter, but she had a couple of major gaffes today, actually kind of funny, about taxes and her husband.
[03:34:06.781 --> 03:34:08.762]  Let's play those two clips real quickly.
[03:34:08.762 --> 03:34:15.645]  Of course, I hope you will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:34:18.197 --> 03:34:24.442]  We're going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[03:34:24.442 --> 03:34:24.843]  Yay!
[03:34:24.843 --> 03:34:28.186]  Let's raise taxes on the middle class.
[03:34:28.186 --> 03:34:29.667]  Yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[03:34:29.667 --> 03:34:39.515]  But you know, one of the most interesting things that she said this week when confronted about this information, you know, when she gets her Nixon on, we've got Obama essentially getting on his
[03:34:40.851 --> 03:34:41.512]  I don't know.
[03:34:57.242 --> 03:35:05.869]  And the circumstances under which it was done, and the fact that we've now had one of the hostages say, hey, we had to wait for about 20 hours before the plane with the cash arrived.
[03:35:05.869 --> 03:35:10.192]  They didn't say the plane had cash, but they said if that plane doesn't get here, you're not leaving.
[03:35:10.192 --> 03:35:11.273]  Okay?
[03:35:11.273 --> 03:35:16.657]  So all of that harkens back to essentially a ransom situation.
[03:35:16.657 --> 03:35:20.280]  It harkens back, really, going back to the Iran-Contra situation.
[03:35:20.280 --> 03:35:22.081]  That's why history is so important, isn't it?
[03:35:22.810 --> 03:35:25.871]  You know, we've seen this kind of situation going on for quite some time.
[03:35:25.871 --> 03:35:36.834]  You know, Ken Starr didn't really want to get involved in what was going on in Mina, Arkansas with the Clintons, because there are also hints of what was going on with Reagan and Bush with Iran-Contra.
[03:35:36.834 --> 03:35:40.315]  So, as we look at history, they use the same techniques.
[03:35:40.315 --> 03:35:41.556]  They have the same M.O.s.
[03:35:41.556 --> 03:35:42.456]  It repeats itself.
[03:35:43.410 --> 03:35:47.633]  But the other thing that we try to cover in these broadcasts is what's happening with technology.
[03:35:47.633 --> 03:35:57.099]  And that's why we have Mr. Robert George from Berlowen Energy talking to us, because it's technology that is also disrupting our lives.
[03:35:57.099 --> 03:36:05.824]  We see a familiar pattern with history, but that pattern can be broken in a very disruptive way when we have certain types of technology coming in.
[03:36:05.824 --> 03:36:07.906]  And just to give you an idea of what's going on, he sent us
[03:36:08.366 --> 03:36:13.237]  A Defense Intelligence Agency analysis, an unclassified analysis a couple years ago.
[03:36:15.206 --> 03:36:37.279]  Of where LENR is, Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, and what they said was, this is the DIA, they said it can produce nuclear origin energy at room temperatures and this disruptive technology could revolutionize energy production and storage since nuclear reactions release millions of times more energy per unit mass than any other known chemical fuel.
[03:36:37.279 --> 03:36:40.421]  For example, and they give this in their closing argument, they say,
[03:36:41.281 --> 03:36:47.449]  Nuclear fusion releases 10 million times more energy per unit mass than does liquid transportation fuel.
[03:36:47.449 --> 03:36:50.733]  In other words, gasoline or jet fuel or something like that.
[03:36:50.733 --> 03:36:52.516]  And they say, because this is the U.S.
[03:36:52.516 --> 03:36:54.538]  government and the military looking at this, since the U.S.
[03:36:54.538 --> 03:36:58.483]  military is the largest user of liquid fuel for transportation,
[03:36:59.264 --> 03:37:00.405]  Thank you for having me.
[03:37:24.261 --> 03:37:33.065]  Let's talk a little bit about the history here, because a lot of people have heard about coal fusion, and I guess we could say it's kind of become the Rodney Dangerfield of physics.
[03:37:33.065 --> 03:37:35.066]  It gets no respect, okay?
[03:37:35.066 --> 03:37:39.289]  Because when it first came out in 1989, you had this chemical reaction.
[03:37:39.289 --> 03:37:41.009]  They didn't know what was happening with it.
[03:37:41.009 --> 03:37:42.830]  There was some unexplained effects.
[03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:46.152]  So the big issue was, was it chemical or was it nuclear?
[03:37:46.212 --> 03:37:51.136]  They had no theory to explain it, so they basically have been having this argument for quite some time.
[03:37:51.136 --> 03:38:00.722]  Give us a little bit of the history of this so people understand how this has developed over the last 30 some odd years and where we are today.
[03:38:00.722 --> 03:38:01.883]  Absolutely.
[03:38:01.883 --> 03:38:08.048]  When Pons and Fleischmann first introduced it in 89, the Department of Energy was about to release $800 million for fusion energy research.
[03:38:13.513 --> 03:38:20.077]  And they decided to hold it up because ColdFusion, which was a misnomer at the time, was introduced.
[03:38:20.077 --> 03:38:26.862]  And they said, well, you need to investigate this before we release the money to find out if it's legitimate.
[03:38:26.862 --> 03:38:37.349]  And the ones they asked to evaluate it were MIT and Caltech and Texas A&M to verify or invalidate the technology.
[03:38:38.089 --> 03:38:44.722]  Because these people were Hot Fusion advocates, so they had different technologies, competing technologies that they wanted to go out.
[03:38:45.715 --> 03:38:48.056]  They did.
[03:38:48.056 --> 03:38:53.820]  They were all hot fusion physicists that were waiting for their budgets to be approved.
[03:38:53.820 --> 03:39:00.464]  MIT was one of the universities that discredited it.
[03:39:00.464 --> 03:39:12.731]  They got caught later for downshifting the data because they did see excess heat and there was a lawsuit resulting in their falsification of the information and they lost, but they don't bring that to the fore.
[03:39:14.572 --> 03:39:22.958]  So when we're talking about hot fusion versus cold fusion, and going back again, you know, 30 some odd years ago, we're talking about fusion with cold fusion.
[03:39:22.958 --> 03:39:36.407]  Fusion occurring at room temperature versus massive amounts of energy having to be put in with hot fusion, which has not worked yet because they haven't been able to get something that has a net increase in production of energy.
[03:39:36.407 --> 03:39:39.709]  They basically can't recoup what they have to put in it to get it hot.
[03:39:40.129 --> 03:39:49.971]  So, you're talking about a situation where fusion is occurring at room temperature, is what people are looking at, or now they're calling it a low-energy nuclear reaction.
[03:39:49.971 --> 03:40:00.534]  What has happened in the intervening years that show that it's not just excess heat, but there's other things that have come out that let them give a hint that there's really fusion going on here?
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:09.142]  Well, since 1989 there have been scientists all over the world that have been testing and working on this phenomenon.
[03:40:09.142 --> 03:40:18.185]  The most recent ones, the NASA, the Spa Wars group down in San Diego, they got 30 times excess heat out of their unit.
[03:40:19.625 --> 03:40:19.945]  Thank you.
[03:40:42.825 --> 03:40:43.145]  I think so.
[03:41:02.959 --> 03:41:18.117]  And we've had Silicon Valley scientists from some of the major companies here in the Valley, as well as the people from the Naval Research Lab in Washington, come out with their radiation detectors to verify if there's any harmful radiation coming from our system.
[03:41:18.860 --> 03:41:25.542]  So what you're looking at is essentially, you're looking at the transmutation of hydrogen with an end product of helium.
[03:41:25.542 --> 03:41:40.505]  And so because you have that process where it goes from deuterium to tritium, that only happens if it's a nuclear reaction that's going on there, and then that tritium quickly decays into a helium byproduct, which is not a dangerous thing going on there, but they can see
[03:41:41.045 --> 03:41:41.485]  Two things.
[03:41:41.485 --> 03:41:43.166]  They can see nuclear activities going on.
[03:41:43.166 --> 03:41:49.350]  They can see that there's a transmutation of elements, which shows that there is something going on there that is nuclear.
[03:41:49.350 --> 03:41:50.431]  Is that right?
[03:41:50.431 --> 03:41:52.252]  That's absolutely correct.
[03:41:52.252 --> 03:41:57.495]  And the interesting thing is that the tritium is basically part of the fuel cycle.
[03:41:57.495 --> 03:42:02.758]  And if you're generating excess heat, then you don't build up the amount of tritium in the system.
[03:42:02.758 --> 03:42:06.320]  And in fact, that's how we met the scientists down in Los Alamos.
[03:42:06.320 --> 03:42:09.362]  They had looked at our website and looked at our PowerPoint.
[03:42:10.362 --> 03:42:11.023]  We're good to go.
[03:42:29.949 --> 03:42:33.792]  Now we're talking about the excess heat and of course that's a key thing for power generation.
[03:42:33.792 --> 03:42:42.619]  I mean most of, you know, we look at a nuclear power plant and as Einstein said, or one of the nuclear physicists said, that's a heck of a way to boil water.
[03:42:42.619 --> 03:42:44.440]  But I mean that's the way you generate power, right?
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:55.068]  You create, you burn some kind of a fossil fuel or you burn wood or you create a nuclear reaction and then that creates heat that then creates steam and drives turbines and so forth and so on.
[03:42:55.068 --> 03:42:55.829]  That's the way you generate
[03:42:56.489 --> 03:42:57.329]  Uh, power.
[03:42:57.329 --> 03:43:01.150]  So, when we're looking at, uh, creation of heat, that's a very important thing.
[03:43:01.150 --> 03:43:07.532]  You're talking about, uh, a, a piece of equipment that has a, uh, 30 times, uh, increase in heat.
[03:43:07.532 --> 03:43:14.834]  It seems to me whether or not that is fusion or not, that would be something somebody would want to, uh, continue with as a technology and develop that.
[03:43:14.834 --> 03:43:20.256]  To me, it doesn't really matter whether it's chemical or whether it is, uh, uh, fusion or nuclear reaction.
[03:43:20.256 --> 03:43:24.877]  Uh, I would still want to try to, uh, enhance that and, and, uh, make that work.
[03:43:26.212 --> 03:43:37.500]  Well, since the university's discredited it since 89, it's been political suicide or academic suicide to even work on it in universities.
[03:43:37.500 --> 03:43:51.389]  Most in the last three years, we've tried to get the national labs to do material analysis for us and isotopic analysis on our cores just to verify what the systems are actually occurring in there.
[03:43:51.389 --> 03:43:53.010]  We're willing to pay them for it.
[03:43:53.010 --> 03:43:55.331]  And their response has been this is too controversial.
[03:43:55.331 --> 03:43:56.152]  We can't work on it.
[03:43:57.594 --> 03:43:58.415]  That's amazing.
[03:43:58.415 --> 03:44:01.738]  But you know this is not something that we haven't seen in other fields as well.
[03:44:01.738 --> 03:44:08.186]  You have vested interests whether it's in drugs or whether it's in particular types of food or whether it's in energy.
[03:44:08.186 --> 03:44:13.352]  You have the vested interests that are there and they don't want to run the studies to show that some alternative
[03:44:13.932 --> 03:44:18.537]  Would be cheaper, more economical, more environmentally friendly.
[03:44:18.537 --> 03:44:20.900]  They essentially shut that down.
[03:44:20.900 --> 03:44:28.428]  And not only do they not fund it, but they demonize it, they ridicule it, they do everything they can to censor it.
[03:44:28.428 --> 03:44:31.732]  And that's essentially what we're seeing here with low-energy nuclear reactions, isn't it?
[03:44:32.794 --> 03:44:41.200]  Yes, this could actually shift us off a lot of the petroleum usage from cars to airplanes to diesel trucks and buses.
[03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:42.300]  This could be very dramatic.
[03:44:42.300 --> 03:44:43.861]  We have two products currently.
[03:44:43.861 --> 03:44:52.467]  One that would be suitable for home heating, which operates at about 80 degrees to 150 degrees C, or domestic hot water.
[03:44:52.467 --> 03:45:01.713]  And then we have another one that's a gas-phase system that operates at 600 degrees C that's suitable for generating electricity and could repower coal-powered power plants.
[03:45:02.458 --> 03:45:03.760]  And so those are the systems.
[03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:06.664]  That's where you are right now in terms of your state of the art.
[03:45:06.664 --> 03:45:13.434]  So you've got essentially something that could replace a water heater as well as something else that could generate electricity.
[03:45:13.434 --> 03:45:15.377]  And what are the inputs to your systems?
[03:45:16.867 --> 03:45:21.372]  Basically, the thing that's been missing from the field all these years is a control system.
[03:45:21.372 --> 03:45:27.639]  There have been scientists all over the world that are getting this excess heat, as I mentioned earlier, the Spa Wars people, the NASA people.
[03:45:27.639 --> 03:45:34.726]  The problem has been being able to start the reaction when you want it to and be able to stop it when you need to.
[03:45:37.028 --> 03:45:50.474]  Robert Gottes is an electrical engineer, a multi-discipline engineer, and developed a control system we call a Q-Pulse that actually, for the home heating system, for example, when you turn up your thermostat, you want the heat to come on immediately.
[03:45:50.474 --> 03:45:52.875]  And so our reaction starts immediately.
[03:45:52.875 --> 03:45:56.456]  And when you turn off the Q-Pulse, it immediately stops.
[03:45:56.456 --> 03:45:58.897]  So there's no chance of the system running away.
[03:45:58.897 --> 03:46:03.019]  And if it runs away, it's just hot water, so it doesn't really matter.
[03:46:03.874 --> 03:46:07.675]  So is this something we're likely to see sometime in the near future?
[03:46:07.675 --> 03:46:12.276]  I'm thinking of a Mr. Fusion machine like we saw in the DeLorean and Back to the Future era.
[03:46:12.276 --> 03:46:26.539]  Are we going to see this in a nice containerized thing or are you still trying to get financial backing to do this and trying to fight the censorship and the prejudice in the scientific community against this to get this developed?
[03:46:27.039 --> 03:46:27.919]  All of the above.
[03:46:27.919 --> 03:46:33.062]  We've raised about $13 million over the last 10 years to develop the systems.
[03:46:33.062 --> 03:46:39.126]  We have a system operating under scientists down at SRI International because of the controversy in the field.
[03:46:39.126 --> 03:46:47.390]  We wanted independent scientists verifying our results in our system, hands-off from us, and that's been going very well.
[03:46:47.390 --> 03:46:51.733]  And as a result of our work, although we've had very little interest in the United States,
[03:46:52.773 --> 03:46:59.596]  The Defense Authorization Act has just recently added LENR to their bill.
[03:46:59.596 --> 03:47:07.440]  We've licensed a South Korean firm, a manufacturer, a multi-million dollar license to start manufacturing and distributing it in South Korea.
[03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:10.361]  We have a license in Canada as well.
[03:47:10.361 --> 03:47:13.882]  But there's been very little interest or support in the United States.
[03:47:13.882 --> 03:47:15.143]  And this is where we need it the most.
[03:47:15.663 --> 03:47:18.786]  You know, quite frankly, I think a lot of that is due to politics.
[03:47:18.786 --> 03:47:25.312]  I mean, we look at how deeply embedded the oil business is in terms of the banking business.
[03:47:25.312 --> 03:47:29.617]  You know, we've got the petrodollar that was created as they took us off the gold standard.
[03:47:29.617 --> 03:47:32.700]  They created a fiat currency with the cooperation of Saudi Arabia.
[03:47:33.440 --> 03:47:50.005]  And it's having the ability to print that money without anything behind it and then use that as the medium of exchange for all the oil that has really been the bedrock of our financial system here in America as a petrodollar.
[03:47:50.005 --> 03:47:53.926]  So there has to be a tremendous amount of political pressure not to do that.
[03:47:53.926 --> 03:47:55.006]  And yet on the other hand,
[03:47:55.686 --> 03:48:00.467]  This is such a disruptive technology and every other country essentially is working with us.
[03:48:00.467 --> 03:48:07.088]  We've got this document that you gave me that is six years old from the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[03:48:07.088 --> 03:48:19.031]  They point out how it's Japan and Italy are pretty far along in research, but of course China, Russia, India, all these countries, France as well, they all have their own research projects.
[03:48:19.031 --> 03:48:24.132]  So in that sense, you have to move forward with doing the research or you get left behind.
[03:48:25.123 --> 03:48:30.491]  Yes, we've been very fortunate to have angel investors that have come in and are supporting the company.
[03:48:30.491 --> 03:48:37.400]  The technology is disruptive, as you said, and the carbon
[03:48:39.093 --> 03:48:48.720]  Based industry is so well entrenched that it's difficult for them to look at this kind of technology as something that's going to be useful and necessary.
[03:48:48.720 --> 03:48:56.465]  Most people confuse what we're doing with hydrogen and water as using it as a fuel, as a combustible fuel.
[03:48:56.465 --> 03:49:01.468]  But hydrogen as a nuclear fuel has so much higher energy density.
[03:49:01.468 --> 03:49:05.071]  As an example, if you take the volume of water contained in the
[03:49:06.852 --> 03:49:16.439]  It's equivalent to two 38-gallon barrels of gasoline.
[03:49:16.439 --> 03:49:18.821]  That's the energy density that we're talking about.
[03:49:18.821 --> 03:49:19.841]  Wow.
[03:49:19.841 --> 03:49:27.807]  So the boiler that we have developed for the home heating system, which is a two-liter vessel, has one liter of water in it with electrolyte.
[03:49:27.807 --> 03:49:31.750]  And that amount of water is capable of heating your home for 10 or 15 years.
[03:49:33.502 --> 03:49:35.463]  Wow, that is amazing.
[03:49:35.463 --> 03:49:39.724]  And of course, that's an idea of just how disruptive this is.
[03:49:39.724 --> 03:49:44.565]  That gores a lot of people's cash cows when you do something like that.
[03:49:44.565 --> 03:49:45.286]  It does.
[03:49:45.286 --> 03:49:56.569]  It would be a very freeing technology, and we seem to have a history in this country of technologies that free us, technologies that are clean being shut down, and that's the amazing thing about this.
[03:49:58.303 --> 03:49:59.405]  It really is.
[03:49:59.405 --> 03:50:05.353]  And this will be the first time you could have a home heating system that you could actually calculate your return on investment.
[03:50:05.353 --> 03:50:09.238]  Because all you'll need is electricity to stimulate the reaction.
[03:50:09.238 --> 03:50:12.062]  Let me get some idea about how far away you are with this.
[03:50:12.062 --> 03:50:13.484]  Now, is this something that...
[03:50:15.576 --> 03:50:19.158]  You know, you have a working model that you've got here.
[03:50:19.158 --> 03:50:22.040]  You're looking for investors to try to market this.
[03:50:22.040 --> 03:50:24.202]  Is that what the issue is here?
[03:50:24.202 --> 03:50:27.244]  You've already got some set products.
[03:50:27.244 --> 03:50:32.967]  You've got the, what was it called, the wet boiler, as well as a hydrogen hot tube.
[03:50:32.967 --> 03:50:35.109]  Those are the two products that you had just described earlier.
[03:50:35.109 --> 03:50:36.930]  I mean, are those ready to go to market?
[03:50:37.450 --> 03:50:39.591]  And we'll take your answer when you come back.
[03:50:39.591 --> 03:50:41.212]  We've got to go to a break, and we're going to be right back.
[03:50:41.212 --> 03:50:43.212]  We're talking to Robert George.
[03:50:43.212 --> 03:50:56.197]  He's with Brillouin Energy Corporation, and it's a company that is looking at low-energy nuclear reactions, and they have a couple of systems here, as he pointed out, just a little bit of water, power your house for years, okay?
[03:50:56.197 --> 03:50:58.678]  This is amazingly disruptive technology.
[03:50:58.678 --> 03:51:02.720]  If we don't do it in America, somebody else will, but there's a lot of political resistance.
[03:51:03.689 --> 03:51:07.492]  on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price.
[03:51:07.492 --> 03:51:10.094]  You are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:51:10.094 --> 03:51:10.915]  Here's why.
[03:51:10.915 --> 03:51:15.038]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:51:15.038 --> 03:51:15.979]  So please listen.
[03:51:15.979 --> 03:51:19.662]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:51:19.662 --> 03:51:26.027]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:51:26.027 --> 03:51:30.090]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[03:51:30.350 --> 03:51:33.271]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:51:33.271 --> 03:51:35.612]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:51:35.612 --> 03:51:40.435]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[03:51:40.435 --> 03:51:47.158]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[03:51:47.158 --> 03:51:48.898]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:51:48.898 --> 03:51:50.579]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:51:50.579 --> 03:51:52.300]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:51:52.300 --> 03:51:56.162]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:51:56.162 --> 03:51:57.722]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:51:57.722 --> 03:51:58.823]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:52:01.291 --> 03:52:03.252]  Do you ever feel like you're being watched?
[03:52:03.252 --> 03:52:06.532]  Like someone or some company is tracking your every move online?
[03:52:06.532 --> 03:52:07.353]  I know I do.
[03:52:07.353 --> 03:52:12.034]  That's why I trust Private Internet Access VPN to keep me safe when I'm online.
[03:52:12.034 --> 03:52:15.555]  I use it to encrypt my traffic and use an anonymous IP address.
[03:52:15.555 --> 03:52:21.797]  Private Internet Access keeps your internet traffic safe from unwanted eyes so you can finally feel safe.
[03:52:21.797 --> 03:52:24.737]  $40 a year for peace of mind is a no-brainer.

[03:53:59.399 --> 03:54:00.160]  Effective.
[03:54:10.340 --> 03:54:11.701]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:11.701 --> 03:54:25.069]  Dave and I were talking to a gentleman with Brillouin Energy Corporation about his company's efforts to create cold fusion, as it's been known in the past, but as they're referring to it today, low-energy nuclear reactions.
[03:54:25.069 --> 03:54:35.815]  Before we get back to him, I just want to remind you that our specials that we've had since the 28-hour marathon sale that we had last week, we've had three specials that we've extended through this week.
[03:54:36.235 --> 03:54:40.079]  Those are going to be ending this weekend because we're going to be running out of stock.
[03:54:40.079 --> 03:54:41.060]  It's been very successful.
[03:54:41.060 --> 03:54:43.222]  We really appreciate your support on this.
[03:54:43.222 --> 03:54:51.491]  It's vital for us as well as a way that we can fund our operation without being dependent on big
[03:54:53.047 --> 03:54:56.370]  Companies who would shut us down with the types of things we talk about.
[03:54:56.370 --> 03:54:59.452]  I mean, we're talking about a very disruptive technology here.
[03:54:59.452 --> 03:55:02.374]  We talk about very disruptive politics here.
[03:55:02.374 --> 03:55:07.158]  And that's why it's important for us to self fund our operations, why we appreciate your support.
[03:55:07.158 --> 03:55:10.341]  And it's why we offer these kinds of sales and appreciation.
[03:55:10.341 --> 03:55:16.826]  And so we've extended this 40% off on brain force, 30% off on vitamin mineral fusion and 30% off DNA force.
[03:55:18.587 --> 03:55:23.030]  That is our very expensive, difficult to produce formulation that has Bio-PQQ.
[03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:24.010]  You can look that up.
[03:55:24.010 --> 03:55:29.353]  There's 175 clinical studies that talk about how effective Bio-PQQ is.
[03:55:29.353 --> 03:55:33.596]  You can look at the reviews for all these products as well as everything that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:55:33.596 --> 03:55:37.098]  See what other people say that their experiences have been with that.
[03:55:38.098 --> 03:55:46.625]  And of course, because DNA Force is so difficult to produce, so expensive to produce, that 30% savings is a huge discount.
[03:55:46.625 --> 03:55:53.790]  So take advantage of that now, as well as the 30% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix and the 40% off Brain Force.
[03:55:53.790 --> 03:55:54.351]  And we have
[03:55:55.151 --> 03:56:04.835]  Storewide free shipping that we have extended as well as a thank you to you to help you take advantage of this to provide for your health, your family's health and to fund our operation.
[03:56:04.835 --> 03:56:06.615]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:56:06.615 --> 03:56:09.877]  You'll find that all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:09.877 --> 03:56:13.698]  I want to go back to Mr. Robert George with Brillowin Energy.
[03:56:13.698 --> 03:56:15.879]  You know, Mr. George, when I'm looking at things like
[03:56:17.105 --> 03:56:21.851]  The issues that we've been seeing with Tesla, they just had their corporate sales come out.
[03:56:21.851 --> 03:56:24.494]  They have been in operation for 13 years.
[03:56:24.494 --> 03:56:27.298]  They have lost money every quarter except one.
[03:56:27.298 --> 03:56:29.180]  That's not really a good record.
[03:56:29.180 --> 03:56:32.805]  And yet their stock has multiplied by a factor of 12.
[03:56:33.706 --> 03:56:34.727]  They keep passing this on.
[03:56:34.727 --> 03:56:52.539]  They're under investigation by the SEC at the current time, but nevertheless, I see these large corporations like Tesla, like Uber, because Uber is going to be part of the disruptive technologies that are going to hand over control of our transportation to the government where they can tax and track us.
[03:56:52.539 --> 03:56:57.462]  It'll also make it difficult for us to afford transportation.
[03:56:57.462 --> 03:57:01.265]  So when we look at things that line up with the political agenda of the establishment,
[03:57:01.705 --> 03:57:07.467]  We see these people kind of get everything that the way is cleared for them.
[03:57:07.467 --> 03:57:18.150]  Wall Street helps them, the government helps them to take down obstacles, and yet when we look at something like this that is very disruptive, as you were saying in the last segment, what was it?
[03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:24.592]  Some water that's about the size of a pencil combined with your device would power your home's energy needs for about 10 or 15 years.
[03:57:24.592 --> 03:57:25.732]  That's an amazingly
[03:57:26.452 --> 03:57:30.273]  Transformative and freeing technology.
[03:57:30.273 --> 03:57:39.635]  But it's difficult for you to get this out into the marketplace because Wall Street has some vested interests in the existing energy infrastructures, don't they?
[03:57:39.635 --> 03:57:40.135]  Absolutely.
[03:57:40.135 --> 03:57:46.336]  When we took it to Wall Street, they looked at the upside potential of this kind of technology and said it's worth trillions.
[03:57:46.336 --> 03:57:49.797]  You're only trying to raise 15 to 20 million dollars.
[03:57:49.797 --> 03:57:50.697]  It makes no sense.
[03:57:50.697 --> 03:57:51.377]  We can't do that.
[03:57:53.356 --> 03:57:54.156]  Let's go big.
[03:57:54.156 --> 03:57:56.538]  Yeah, well that's certainly what we've seen with Uber and Tesla.
[03:57:56.538 --> 03:58:01.101]  You gotta be out there and kind of brash, I guess, to get their attention.
[03:58:01.101 --> 03:58:03.222]  But you also have to be politically connected.
[03:58:03.222 --> 03:58:07.905]  Maybe you should do some crowdsourcing or take this on Shark Tank or something like that.
[03:58:07.905 --> 03:58:12.668]  I certainly wish you luck with this and thank you so much for talking to us about it.
[03:58:12.668 --> 03:58:20.893]  We hope that this is going to be something that is going to free us with technology because too often we see technology being used to suppress our freedoms.
[03:58:20.893 --> 03:58:22.874]  This is something that would have a very freeing
[03:58:23.274 --> 03:58:24.494]  Effect, I believe.
[03:58:24.494 --> 03:58:26.675]  That's it for today's broadcast.
[03:58:26.675 --> 03:58:28.815]  Join us tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:28.815 --> 03:58:40.818]  Eastern for the InfoWars Nightly News.
