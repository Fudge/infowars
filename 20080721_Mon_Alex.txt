[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:14.480 --> 00:37.440]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Monday the
[00:37.440 --> 00:47.360]  21st day of July 2008 we are going to be live here for the next four hours Dr. Jerome Corsi
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.240]  has a new book out on Barack Obama the left I have to say would not wake up to the evils
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.880]  of Bill Clinton because they were caught in the left right paradigm thing that the right was attacking
[01:00.880 --> 01:09.920]  their shining champion but the right then would not wake up to the fact that George Bush was an
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.680]  absolute traitor and puppet to this country and plus there was nothing conservative about him
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.440]  they are still very pigheaded most of them or large portion of them but the left I have to say
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.960]  is starting to sour towards Barack Obama now that doesn't mean it matters one way or the other
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.760]  whether it is John McCain or Barack Obama but the fact that people are waking up that both
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.520]  parties are bought and paid for means we are one step closer towards the solution and that is
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.200]  realizing that presidents and prime ministers and political conventions are nothing but
[01:43.200 --> 01:50.000]  spectacles to divert the public they are screens or walls so that the public never sees behind the
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.520]  curtain and our lives our treasure our future depends on discrediting the government and
[01:57.520 --> 02:02.000]  discrediting the globalists so that they will grind to a halt in their tracks because they need
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.160]  the public's acquiescence to their agenda for their global tyranny to come to fruition Dr. Corsi
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.760]  joining us in T-minus 58 minutes then we had them on a few weeks ago they're they're maiden voyage
[02:13.760 --> 02:19.600]  with us they'll be back today for two hours Pat Carmack and Bill Still Bill Still of course the
[02:19.600 --> 02:27.440]  maker Pat Carmack the narrator for the amazing film Money Masters and I tell you Bill Still is one
[02:27.440 --> 02:32.400]  of the leading experts on monetary reform the banking system just an amazing individual I'm
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.800]  extremely impressed with him they'll be joining us to talk about the economy for two hours today
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.680]  Dr. Corsi will spend about half an hour with us on Obama then we'll move on from that semi
[02:41.680 --> 02:47.440]  distraction though it is not a distraction if you use it as a study point of the puppetry
[02:47.440 --> 02:52.080]  the marionettes and then we'll talk about the economy with Dr. Corsi who's also an expert on
[02:52.080 --> 02:57.920]  the economy and very well versed on that so three hours on the economy today and I will
[02:57.920 --> 03:06.560]  try to have open phones for those hours as well with our guest okay the news that I have here in
[03:06.560 --> 03:14.880]  front of me today is all of great import and we will be going over that today Iran must choose
[03:14.880 --> 03:22.320]  between cooperation and confrontation the US says out of a French news agency that is just
[03:22.320 --> 03:31.120]  again insulting the American people's intelligence Iran tried to partly Iran tried to come to terms
[03:31.120 --> 03:36.960]  Iran groveled to the globalist in the UN and has nothing weaponized nothing that could produce an
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.840]  A-bomb even if they tried to build one now would take at least seven years that's the CIS on
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.360]  assessment but not what you hear on the news the news says they have nukes they have neutron weapons
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.200]  to knock out all the communications they have fleets of flying saucers blown by puff the magic
[03:53.200 --> 04:00.160]  dragon and it's just it's just completely insane rice warns Iran of punitive measures
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.440]  also out of AFP so we'll be going over that as they escalate things there have been some type
[04:05.440 --> 04:11.040]  of bombings in China they don't really have any real terrorism in that country the stinks to
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.200]  high heaven ahead of the olympic games that we're nearing as just some type of pretext to have

[09:26.080 --> 09:31.600]  taking everything that they heard us say in the past on the thousands of radio interviews i've
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.320]  done the scores of interviews on it's like 50 something on coast to coast i am over the last
[09:36.320 --> 09:42.880]  five years uh the scores of interviews i've done on allen combs syndicated show and on lars larson
[09:42.880 --> 09:47.920]  and just just hundreds of big shows i've done thousands of little shows and they heard me
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.000]  lay out how the bankers were going to implode the dollar and rape you they've heard my the expert
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.200]  guess we've had on cover it they heard us tell you how you how they'd slip in national guard
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.360]  and just announce oh they're not just going to fight terror they're going to fight gun crime
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.960]  that's now been announced in chicago just slipped into an mbc news report with the governor saying
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.200]  gun crimes so bad illegal guns are so bad we're going to use national guard
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.440]  and the reporter added helicopters everybody limits it to just the helicopters no
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.960]  it's going to be on the ground uh we've got these reports of you know hundreds of thousands of
[10:20.960 --> 10:26.320]  plastic coffins masked i did track back the company and did indeed even get photos of them
[10:26.320 --> 10:32.000]  delivering them on the backs of flatbacks it is outside of lana hundreds of thousands of plastic
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.720]  coffins and their lids uh we've got the globalist gearing up to attack iran there is probably no
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.040]  doubt now that they're going to attack iran unless we get the word out and expose what this is going
[10:43.040 --> 10:50.560]  to mean financially they've got propaganda polls out with 46 of americans uh saying that they want
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.280]  to hit iran i don't even believe that poll they have key little poll numbers they can call where
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.280]  they know where it responds they're going to get uh because you've got 70 plus percent against the
[10:59.280 --> 11:05.600]  iraq war how could you have 40 something percent for the war there is just so much happening and
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.360]  we don't this doesn't have to happen this doesn't have to happen the people that are destroying
[11:11.360 --> 11:19.040]  america are in control of our government and it isn't it isn't george bush that's doing it it isn't
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.640]  barack obama that's doing it and we need to come to grips with that because we put all of our heat
[11:24.640 --> 11:31.680]  all of our exposés into exposing george bush for seven and a half years and then it then he leaves
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.560]  and in comes barack obama or john mccain and the new order party just continues and i know you the
[11:36.560 --> 11:43.520]  listeners know that but the public has not figured that out yet completely i mean you've got scientific
[11:43.520 --> 11:49.280]  gallop and other polls that show nine percent multiple big national polls show nine percent
[11:49.280 --> 11:56.480]  approval rating for congress well then how can you have another poll showing 40 43 percent
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.240]  want to hit iran 46 don't let me correct that still that's close to half wanting to i mean i
[12:02.240 --> 12:10.400]  don't believe that or even if that's true we need to reach out to these people and say do you like
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.080]  paying four and a half dollars a gallon on average for gas do you like paying five and a half six
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.040]  dollars in some areas of the country some mountainous areas some remote areas i know it's five plus in
[12:21.040 --> 12:26.640]  california on average do you like this i mean do you know what this is going to mean i mean do you
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.520]  have any idea and please don't tell me oh poor israel there's all these articles poor israel
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.560]  they just can't defend themselves they've got slingshots and those iranians they have they have
[12:36.560 --> 12:42.560]  special bombs to knock out communications totally made up they've got nukes they they're going to
[12:42.560 --> 12:49.760]  destroy israel israel has hundreds and hundreds of high-tech nukes and high-tech weapons the israeli
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.240]  canessot four years ago one of the leaders threatened to nuke europe if they didn't pay
[12:56.240 --> 13:02.640]  holocaust reparations i mean ladies and gentlemen what you've got is a bunch of egomaniacs in the
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.920]  u.s england and israel not the people of england not the people of israel not the people of the
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.680]  u.s most of them are just like us don't know they're having a hole in the ground and the polls
[13:13.680 --> 13:19.280]  there 45 50 depending on which poll you look at her against uh you know going into iran
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.000]  it is real 70 something percent don't like being in iraq you know don't like the fact the u.s is
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.360]  there same thing in the u.s i mean why is this happening because we have tyrannical governments
[13:31.360 --> 13:39.200]  that are on complete and total power trips they say hey we've got to use the power we've got we've
[13:39.200 --> 13:45.360]  got thousands of nukes in the u.s thousands in england conservatively hundreds of high-tech nukes
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.040]  and missiles and cruise missiles and bombers and fighter bombers and submarines and missile cruisers
[13:51.040 --> 13:57.680]  in the gulf i mean israel is just super high-tech super high-tech aircraft and surveillance and
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.520]  everything else and they're just saying hey we can go ahead and and attack iran and when they
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.360]  defend themselves we'll call it terrorism and then we'll nuke them israel and the u.s are saying
[14:09.360 --> 14:15.680]  we will attack iran with conventional weapons hitting thousands of sites military bases
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.880]  water treatment power plants anything that could quote aid the military oh you could use a power
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.400]  plant that's powering you know tehran or any of their other big cities you could use that to run
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.800]  centrifuges that's a military target and the pentagon's released years ago what they're planning
[14:30.800 --> 14:38.480]  to do get thousands of targets killing tens of thousands of people using du bunker busters to
[14:38.480 --> 14:45.600]  spread uranium everywhere and watch their birth defects skyrocket and if iran defends itself in
[14:45.600 --> 14:56.640]  any way we are going to use nukes all over your country and iran lays there and takes it for five
[14:56.640 --> 15:04.320]  years as us special forces command four different now it's five different wahhabi is suny al-qaeda
[15:04.320 --> 15:13.680]  groups and i'm not getting into suny versus shia man there are now um suny people uh on on youtube
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.800]  and google video attacking me because i keep pointing out that they're using suny groups to
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.400]  attack iran that she i i'm i'm just reporting the facts here can you believe this show i'm attacked
[15:24.400 --> 15:34.400]  by liberals neocons people out of dubai people out of um afghanistan are attacking me in news
[15:34.400 --> 15:41.040]  publications i'm being attacked out of saudi arabia because that is another criminal group
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.120]  working with israel in the united states and i know it's shameful for use you wahhabi is you
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.000]  you claim your fight in the west all day you were created by british intelligence and because you'd
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.920]  go in and overthrow elected governments all over the middle east to put your wahhabi is former
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.360]  government in you were hired 90 plus years ago by the british you were hired by hitler again and
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.320]  you were hired by the british in the us of the world war two you were a shameful group of people
[16:06.320 --> 16:13.040]  i don't mean your suny brand of islam i i'm not a muslim i'm not waiting in on shiai
[16:13.840 --> 16:21.520]  you know versus suny i'm not involved in all that but just don't deny the white house admits
[16:21.520 --> 16:28.720]  and you admit you're attacking iran iran doesn't have shiites running around in saudi arabia blowing
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.920]  stuff up in fact i mean if you look at the military forces of the sunis are a bunch of clowns man
[16:35.920 --> 16:41.440]  they're they're filled with british and us and israeli intelligence and i look at the shiites
[16:41.440 --> 16:49.920]  every time and they're not i mean it was shiites that beat israel when they went into lebanon
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.920]  so let's just face it shiites are the ones that the new world order are after
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.840]  while the while the media tells you that that the real threat is the sunis is the wahhabi
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.920]  aspect of the sunis when you guys are literally from the womb of the new world order and i don't
[17:07.920 --> 17:15.440]  mean your brand of islam i mean the last 90 years your your leadership is british intelligence
[17:15.440 --> 17:22.080]  and now they've got their little satellite israel and the us god help us

[17:50.240 --> 17:56.000]  bomb scare like two weeks ago and now they got today brand new surveillance cameras all in who's

[18:15.840 --> 18:22.560]  here's the deal you can lexus nexus or google but the really good service obviously is lexus nexus
[18:22.560 --> 18:28.720]  i was just reminded by that by a caller last week and you can find where they did the government
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.800]  kept mailing anthrax to other offices but scaring their employees and it turned out remember that
[18:32.800 --> 18:38.560]  99 2000 hundreds of internet it was the feds quote testing security you know they've had the navy
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.720]  seals do attack drills on embassies and not tell people it's a you know it's a drill and people

[24:38.720 --> 24:44.320]  he blew his mind out in a car you better make a count of yourselves out there

[25:03.200 --> 25:04.240]  i'm taking a heart though
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.080]  um
[25:11.120 --> 25:12.720]  people are now starting to pay attention
[25:15.600 --> 25:18.880]  and you know why because the dollar is starting to implode domestically
[25:21.920 --> 25:23.440]  you ain't seen nothing yet
[25:26.720 --> 25:28.880]  you notice the mainstream media lied to you
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.600]  they pacified you while they got their assets protected
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.120]  and now they're coming in and buying up the entire infrastructure
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.320]  all that's going to be left is black ski mask enforcers and us the slaves
[25:46.320 --> 25:48.880]  that's the rearguard action and they're done looting
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.960]  let's go ahead and go back to your calls let's go ahead and talk to
[25:54.960 --> 26:02.560]  you is john i guess next or is it scott in arizona okay west in texas you're up next go ahead
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.920]  mr john's long time listener first time caller i just wanted to ask you what was your opinion on
[26:09.920 --> 26:16.880]  the turner diary i never read the turner diaries i read some excerpts online and
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.240]  you know it's from a white supremacist point of view uh and they're i guess about shooting
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.760]  and killing people i read some passages from hunter and what was dr william pierce who died
[26:29.760 --> 26:38.800]  a few years ago a cancer uh wrote that and um i mean really i can't fully comment on it because
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.080]  i haven't read the whole thing i'm i would imagine you've read it am i am i actually just bought
[26:44.080 --> 26:49.120]  it a gun show yesterday in north austin and i'm reading it i'm halfway through and i can drop it
[26:49.120 --> 26:55.600]  off at your office where i'm done oh no that's okay i have uh i'm i'm i mean i've read basically
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.560]  parts of it online and i know what it's about i mean it's about basically an armed revolt against
[27:00.560 --> 27:08.160]  the government is it not uh yes in as many words it's a little more philosophical it gets into the
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.640]  the um the quagmire of what it would cause if it actually came to that
[27:12.640 --> 27:21.440]  well you see i've got historical examples of tyranny and then rebellions and counter revolutions
[27:21.440 --> 27:27.840]  and i can basically just look at what will happen historically if that breaks down i i don't get a
[27:27.840 --> 27:34.160]  lot of my political analysis from from fiction i know the feds had their agent mcvay claimed
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.640]  that he was influenced by that book and they're very scared of it they are very scared of people
[27:38.640 --> 27:43.920]  fighting them physically back that's why they put in a military a military grid uh they're afraid of
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.040]  an armed revolt before they implode things once things are imploded in their grids in place
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.600]  they'll have they'll have their forces so scared they're ready to nerve gas whole cities
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.360]  and then that's their plan later uh but i'm not even advocating attacking early because attacking
[27:59.360 --> 28:06.880]  early uh will also feed into what they're doing we do not want to have armed conflict with the
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.520]  police in the military the globalists hate them inject them with cancer viruses and and delayed
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.000]  bio weapon release systems uh they write books about how they hate to test the military and the
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.520]  police we need to warn the military and police about what's going to happen they're like the
[28:21.520 --> 28:27.520]  general public complete morons and on average and they will laugh at us and giggle and snicker but
[28:27.520 --> 28:32.560]  then as they see everything coming true they will finally a lot of them wake up and join us
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.960]  and so i'm trying to have this collapse like the old soviet union instead of going into a mass
[28:39.520 --> 28:45.760]  extermination mode and mass graves and death and and and and the the the government retreating
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.880]  into hardened bunkers and then using biologicals and chemicals on us and nukes on us which they
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.360]  have said they'll do to last year's ministry of defense the british say that the u.s and england
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.760]  are preparing to use neutron bombs against their own populations i mean they understand where this
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.240]  is going they had to rob it they had to do it they had to try to take everything and fully
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.080]  rape the population and now they're beginning to realize that it's not going to go the way they
[29:08.080 --> 29:13.680]  wanted it to and so they'll just basically from the high ground and folks i'm not joking about
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.000]  all this you understand they're not going to give power up they're going to fully rape you and force
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.600]  you to fight back and then hell is going to be released now we may be able to short circuit
[29:23.600 --> 29:30.080]  their operations by just fully discrediting the best we can hope for is a soviet style collapse
[29:30.080 --> 29:35.200]  i i will repeat the best we can hope for is the country will just collapse like the soviet union
[29:35.200 --> 29:42.720]  did at least on paper uh anything else sir i know that was excellent all right thank you we'll be
[29:42.720 --> 29:58.160]  right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[30:11.120 --> 30:15.520]  are beginning to wake up it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow

[33:03.360 --> 33:21.200]  it has been said that we live in a dog eat dog world
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.560]  but people who have gone through true adversity
[33:30.560 --> 33:36.480]  don't give up occasionally in human history
[33:38.480 --> 33:45.120]  rarely but it's happened a few times say this is how humans act this is how people operate
[33:46.240 --> 33:47.840]  this is the cycles of
[33:50.880 --> 33:56.720]  ingenuity and steadfastness and and high mortals then leads to milk and honey and plenty
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.120]  and then decadence and then corruption and then wickedness sets in and then societies collapse
[34:03.600 --> 34:09.120]  there's been a few societies that were very scholarly and actually had elites that were
[34:09.120 --> 34:15.040]  virtuous and tried to spread knowledge to the general population and they said we must guard
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.960]  against tyranny we must guard against the unwarranted acquisition of power by the military
[34:20.960 --> 34:29.280]  industrial complex we must stand up against powerful groups of men who combine their their
[34:29.280 --> 34:32.400]  their fortunes together for empire and domination
[34:35.520 --> 34:39.840]  because these elites could care less about you and your family in fact most of the time they enjoy
[34:40.640 --> 34:46.720]  killing they enjoy slaughter they enjoy power they enjoy exercising the ultimate form of raw power
[34:46.720 --> 34:52.560]  they are the priest of power as george arwell wrote always pressing on the nerve of power
[34:53.280 --> 35:00.080]  and they have trained us to be these fat and happy know it all everything's fine life is just one
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.480]  big vacation there's no evil in america it's it's over across the ocean but you can't even find
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.080]  where those bogeymen they tell you about are on a map you don't really know any of the details
[35:10.080 --> 35:19.360]  it's just foggy it's some guy with a turban and a beard when the real enemy is the elite waging
[35:19.360 --> 35:26.320]  war on you and again i know the listeners understand this but the general public cannot
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.400]  grasp cannot understand how horrible it is i talk a lot about these because it's a smoking gun of
[35:32.400 --> 35:40.400]  many the imf world doc imf world bank documents in 2000 and to get released and it's the reason
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.200]  joseph stick let's quit and left the imf as her chief economist
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.480]  i was a chief economist world bank i know he advised both it doesn't matter the point is
[35:52.480 --> 35:57.120]  it was imf world bank documents with them colluding together the big private banks
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.480]  and it was how to go into argentina and other countries and it was a plan they've been doing
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.160]  for over 100 years this is taught in mainline history books they just don't tell you what's
[36:06.160 --> 36:13.040]  going on now how they would go in 100 years ago 150 200 years ago spain would go in after they
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.560]  turned loose of some of their possessions they learned why should we pay for the government
[36:16.560 --> 36:22.160]  why should we pay to keep our empire here we can just pay at the local thugs to be in control of
[36:22.160 --> 36:27.920]  the people but then over generations wealth would be developed in argentina with hardworking upright
[36:27.920 --> 36:33.760]  very smart people or wealth would be developed in brazil or wealth would be developed in mexico
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.440]  by the by the population by a certain sector and so the elite would come in and hire one of the other
[36:39.440 --> 36:46.960]  elites to have a military coup to overthrow a government might not have been a perfect government
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.000]  but it was better than what the elites were going to put in because they wanted vertical integration
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.680]  you'll hear that now in the corporate globalization that means an up-down system
[36:59.120 --> 37:00.720]  with the haves and the have nots
[37:02.960 --> 37:06.560]  and they would come in and then the last hundred years they learned how to give
[37:07.840 --> 37:13.200]  bank of england loans or other big imperial bank loans german imperial bank loans
[37:13.200 --> 37:19.200]  dutch imperial bank loans but they but it was a fraud the banks didn't want to have the countries
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.360]  being dependent they didn't want countries in the bahamas or the caribbean or africa to
[37:25.360 --> 37:28.960]  be independent they would come in and say here's the deal we're going to give you
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.520]  let's say this was a hundred years ago you look at the loan sizes 50 million
[37:33.520 --> 37:36.640]  hundred million dollars equivalent of 50 a hundred billion or more today
[37:36.640 --> 37:43.760]  and but here's the deal we want you to go spend the money with our british ishini
[37:43.760 --> 37:49.280]  a company or a handful of other companies we've got to build warehouses buildings to buy ships
[37:49.280 --> 37:54.240]  from us so that's one part of the scam but then here's the other part we don't want you to pay
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.200]  back the debt we want you to spend almost all the money and then not pay back any of the debt
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.640]  and you get to keep the debt and then before you implode the economy and leave and you allow
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.560]  us to put in a military coup you will set sail a month before and then you'll have your 10 million
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.200]  waiting for you in your swiss bank account or your luxenberg account or your british account
[38:15.200 --> 38:19.840]  or your us for spanish or portuguese account or montecarlo account
[38:21.680 --> 38:28.640]  and then they would leave and then they would leave behind a you know the military guard
[38:28.640 --> 38:32.960]  knowing how the scam worked they would then put in a new leader who was really part of the same
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.360]  group they would blame the guy that fled and the new guy would get up and say this is just
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.760]  horrible and terrible we've got to have emergency organization and i'm sorry the middle class we've
[38:41.760 --> 38:47.680]  developed you have to give your land over because we signed it over its forfeit and if you don't
[38:47.680 --> 38:50.880]  we're going to send the army in to take it from you and of course the army gets to luchin rape
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.120]  your wife while they're at it the local corrupt cops get to so they go along with it that's how
[38:55.120 --> 39:05.280]  you got latin america and the globalists are masters they know that
[39:07.440 --> 39:13.040]  the mexicans and the argentines and the brazilians and all of them are going to find out so they
[39:13.040 --> 39:16.800]  they know they're pretty sophisticated people they've been screwed a lot they're not like americans
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.280]  that are i mean you know the latin americans just love me even though i basilar reconquistas they
[39:21.280 --> 39:27.040]  respect me and love me all over i've just blocks of foreigners and illegal aliens running up to me
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.120]  because they know the truth ladies and gentlemen they just want somebody to tell them the truth
[39:31.120 --> 39:35.440]  they want somebody who doesn't lie they've lived through it and so they're very the globalists
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.080]  are sophisticated you don't think they blame the banks or the globalists no no no they blame
[39:40.080 --> 39:47.360]  gringo they blame the usa and what do they see in guatemala or mexico they see the marine corps
[39:47.360 --> 39:54.640]  they see smidley butler the marine corps general getting off the boat and they do see gringos coming
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.160]  down and grabbing their ports and taking over their mines and nationalizing them and then leaving
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.880]  after new puppets are put in and so to them yeah it was gringos that came and took their farms
[40:04.880 --> 40:09.920]  it was but it was just gringos getting paid a few dollars a week to come do that who got nothing
[40:09.920 --> 40:16.000]  and back home when the rockefellers wanted the gringo's mine or the gringo's ranch or the gringo's
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.560]  farm they'd send in pickered insecurity to slaughter gringos too gringos kill gringos
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.440]  and now the new world order comes down and hires latin american death squads and flies them over to
[40:27.440 --> 40:35.040]  iraq to kill other brown people it has nothing to do with color it has to do with money and power
[40:35.040 --> 40:41.280]  and so let me give you the newsflash they're now doing that here on the imf world bank plan
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.160]  talked about that and i've been telling you for more than a decade and i've been screaming for
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.440]  five years and now every day i'm talking about it because it's happening now folks and i want to give
[40:51.440 --> 40:59.280]  you a newsflash police and military and everybody else don't be like the the elites enforcers in
[40:59.280 --> 41:05.440]  mexico and argentina and other places but you know what you are going to be like them you're
[41:05.440 --> 41:10.240]  going to go along for your 20 pieces of silver and destroy the country and everything else and
[41:10.240 --> 41:15.360]  you'll be given an emotional psychological staff you'll be told you know that you had to do it and
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.400]  you'll be given propaganda reasons in the news in the media but don't you say you weren't told
[41:20.400 --> 41:23.520]  and don't you say you didn't know and somebody didn't tell you
[41:29.120 --> 41:31.360]  don't you say you weren't warned
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.040]  and you understand you make the decision to do the gun confiscation and the work brigades and
[41:39.040 --> 41:43.040]  all the things that are coming to this country they're certainly gearing up for it like it's
[41:43.040 --> 41:49.360]  about to happen i pray it doesn't happen every day but it it looks like it probably is sooner
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.120]  rather than later just remember you knew the truth and you decided to lie to yourself and it was this
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.280]  lying to yourself not just the police and military but the yuppies and the good old boys and the people
[41:59.280 --> 42:05.200]  who think they're part of the elite when they're not even lower middle class all of you just remember
[42:05.200 --> 42:11.120]  you were told just remember you were warned i said i take calls i just wanted to get that out there
[42:13.920 --> 42:17.440]  what's good for the goose is good for the gander what comes around goes around you
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.840]  report you so karma whatever you want to call it it's all over our message boards at prisonplanet.com
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.000]  and on the comment pages on the stories all these native americans are in there saying yeah
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.200]  you did it to us you did it to us you did it to us you did it to us you did it to us now what's
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.000]  going to happen to you but see it's more sophisticated than just that the natives would come to the
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.160]  gringos and say we want you to go team up with us to kill the other tribe
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.240]  and so the and so everybody was evil we're all humans we all act the same folks
[42:49.920 --> 42:52.880]  and there were a lot of wars that the whitey lost at first
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.000]  you see and then yeah by the 1880s when there was only a few tribes a few comanche and black
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.120]  foot left that were still wild and free yeah they were hunted down they were taken to camps
[43:07.200 --> 43:13.040]  concentration camps were invented by the british 200 years ago and perfected by the us cavalry
[43:13.600 --> 43:22.080]  130 years ago hitler wrote memos on it saying i want the way it's described in this civil war document
[43:22.080 --> 43:31.760]  from the united states and so that's who we are let's just be honest now i always say how great
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.960]  america is compared to everybody else we have been upstanding we've been incredible more patents
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.760]  more inventions the toughest the meanest the roughest the bravest the whole world marveled
[43:41.760 --> 43:47.440]  in americans because we were the motley crew we were the pirates and the poor people and the criminals
[43:47.440 --> 43:53.200]  and the and the explorers and and and and the tough stuff that came over here the toughest people
[43:53.200 --> 43:56.960]  from europe the toughest people from africa the toughest people from the middle east the toughest
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.800]  people from china the adventures the toughest people from latin america from mexico were willing
[44:02.800 --> 44:09.520]  to come to texas where indians were trying to kill you the mexicans came the spanish came and
[44:09.520 --> 44:15.120]  said help us gringoes you kill all the indians in tennessee you kill them in illinois you kill
[44:15.120 --> 44:20.720]  them in the dakotas we need you and then whitey came in and the angle saxons ran around with a
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.240]  slaughter fest fighting the indians five to one that's right about five to one at first and then
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.840]  santa anna said well the gringos have killed all the indians forming now i'm coming in to take
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.800]  it over see that's real history folks it's all evil the mexicans are evil the whites are evil
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.840]  the germans are evil the jews are evil it's all of us it's who we are ladies and gentlemen
[44:41.840 --> 44:49.920]  the elites of the germans the chinese the jews the british are evil they're cutthroat scum
[44:49.920 --> 44:56.160]  they're scum in mexico they're scum in america they're scum in canada they're scum in japan
[44:58.240 --> 45:04.320]  and it's time to realize that it's good people who team up together knowing the nature of the world
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.760]  to team up the good people who just want their little piece of land and want to live their life
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.360]  and who aren't greedy we have to always team up in history when things get bad and when the people
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.520]  who are greedy want to take what we've got and enslave us we got to team up and say you know what
[45:17.520 --> 45:24.720]  we're not going along with this you want the new order to stop real fast you just don't
[45:26.240 --> 45:30.000]  talk to government people and you're in they're your neighbor yeah of course the reverse of
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.680]  that is you you could talk to an entity program but i mean the thing is just really get aggressive
[45:33.680 --> 45:41.120]  with this information get in people's faces let them know it matters and again i'm not saying
[45:41.120 --> 45:47.600]  the germans as a people are evil i'm not saying the jews as a people are evil i'm not saying
[45:47.600 --> 45:53.680]  that the chinese as a people are evil i'm saying well look at the chinese fighting
[45:54.720 --> 45:59.520]  like tigers against their government with sticks and stones and baseball bats against
[45:59.520 --> 46:05.600]  troops with machine guns and they're winning in almost every city all over china every two days
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.000]  there's a riot where the police rape some girl or grab somebody for their organs i mean it's a
[46:10.000 --> 46:17.040]  very corrupt elite in china and the chinese people unarmed are winning china is is is is is on is
[46:17.040 --> 46:25.280]  teetering on revolution ladies and gentlemen the states were waging economic warfare against
[46:25.280 --> 46:31.440]  all the areas that aren't central trade or construction cities again it is the evil elites
[46:31.440 --> 46:37.760]  and all of us are evil at one way or another all of us are falling all of us do bad things we have
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.760]  to be in a daily struggle against but but by the being good doesn't mean you're a wimp no in fact

[55:31.360 --> 55:37.200]  zone to prepare you that cops are like nurses because remember you're wild cattle to be hunted
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.080]  down and now they're going to give them a little uh little knockout dart guns oh yeah like the running
[55:42.080 --> 55:49.680]  man get that animal meanwhile the officer takes his loving injection as well like mother's milk
[55:49.680 --> 55:54.560]  you know if you go to the intellectual evidence we can prove and the facts that uh they're putting
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.040]  cancer viruses in your shots and carrying out chemical and biological warfare against us all
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.480]  right now but in your gut do you trust the government in your gut do you want the shots
[56:05.120 --> 56:11.440]  and what does your gut tell you does it tell you that babel on is the vampire or does it tell you
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.240]  that it's good all right joe don robert steve helen i'm going to get to you but i wanted to bring
[56:16.240 --> 56:21.200]  bermas in for a minute or two because uh the one in guarding had a big hit piece that was like soft
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.880]  morrick going if you think 9 11 didn't say job you believe in pluto space aliens it actually said that
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.880]  that's why whenever i say pluto space aliens i mean that that's all they know how to say
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.200]  that that's all they always say pluto space aliens and he actually said pluto space aliens
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.520]  i know you see you believe you're the king of pluto so another big london guardian article
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.600]  coming out basically saying it isn't inside job this is a big deal this is the biggest paper in
[56:43.600 --> 56:51.680]  europe and england who knows what happened on 9 11 and uh it just goes into basically saying yeah
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.720]  government staged terror bermas this is a big deal to have mainstream news absolutely and he takes
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.720]  on those uh other pundits from within the guardian over the last couple weeks that have made fun of
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.200]  us and he says you know if you actually look at the evidence and throughout history conspiracies
[57:05.200 --> 57:10.560]  do indeed exist alex and he goes into their tactics on how uh they like to call us tin foil
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.680]  half brigade and it's all kings of pluto yeah soft morrick good name of rock man it would be a
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.520]  good name of a rock band but all this uh soft morrick attacking to try to bring uh less credibility
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.760]  to our position on the matter of 9 11 truth and then he goes through he's like well you know the
[57:25.760 --> 57:31.680]  cia did overthrow alayande and chili uh we have been involved in stage terror such as gladio and he
[57:31.680 --> 57:37.120]  goes over just a few separate examples and then he says a jack thonkin yeah yeah and he's just like
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.120]  you know these guys aren't even really looking into the facts and then he goes over their mindset
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.680]  because those guys always love to go into our mindset they try to say oh we have to believe
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.200]  this conspiracy because it's a religion yeah it somehow makes us feel better and uh as i know it
[57:51.200 --> 57:56.640]  makes me oh yeah it's i'd let you in fact one of their talking points all over is they're so scared
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.960]  of men in a cave they want to believe it's the government they find that soothing oh it's real
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.000]  soothing uh yeah i don't want to think it's ragtag guys in a cage which isn't you know that scary
[58:06.560 --> 58:10.400]  no i want to believe the things that runs my life and is controlling the vaccines and the
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.640]  water and the food are killers you know yeah that's what i mean it's the there's no logic there yeah
[58:14.640 --> 58:19.760]  and he goes over kind of like this super yuppie mentality of total denial and how it makes them
[58:19.760 --> 58:24.320]  i had guys calling into this k lbj this morning and then emailing him saying the dollar's not
[58:24.320 --> 58:30.560]  devalued well obviously they're not spending money then they just don't know no they're just

[1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:15.680]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:24.400]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones this is strike force
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:30.720]  delta on the front lines of the info war as the enemy forces continue to bombard the slave
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:36.000]  population are able to free more of the slaves now that they realize they have shackles on them
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.960]  and are in slave pits they're now beginning to see the enforcement grid around them even the
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:45.760]  mindless enforcers are beginning to unlock their brains but it'll probably be too late merma she
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:50.000]  were going to finish something up there out of the london guardian which is almost taken from
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:58.800]  the show about how the yuppies go around women is of the elite he basically goes over how their
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:03.840]  view of official version is comforting to them and why they go for it so let me read that he says
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:08.720]  the conspiratorial worldview does have its consolation but so does brookers which is the
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:13.840]  official does not have a consolation yeah i don't know about well he's kind of pleasable this isn't
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:19.120]  about psychology it's about facts well in the previous paragraph they talk about how booker
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.800]  thinks it's a religion and blah blah but then he goes there's a certain pleasure and drama in
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:27.440]  declaring that the world is driven by incompetence and error and that things are more or less as
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:32.080]  they seem you can preen yourself on how well adjusted you are how you haven't fallen for the
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:37.360]  stuff about lizards or the illuminati you have learned to live without magic you're saying
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:42.720]  i don't believe in 9 11 conspiracy theories but you are signaling that you are skeptical and rational
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:47.840]  and that you don't have personal hygiene issues there's a psycho psychological payoff for both
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:52.480]  the cock up and the conspiracy theory of history so he basically goes over how these people don't
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:56.560]  even look into the evidence they just want to believe that they're better than us because
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:02.880]  they think but it's an absolute fact the the the world bank and imf through the private banks is
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.800]  imploding our dollar by design i told you they were going to buy the car companies beer companies
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:11.200]  everything that's happening all the corporations are moving on shore and i told you they'd be
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:15.280]  having me now the national guard just quietly announces oh we're going to help get guns off
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:20.800]  the streets i mean look stop denying what's going on there isn't time to screw around anymore here
[1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:26.400]  you understand you degenerate yuppies and he even goes over the cia you understand we are trying to
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:30.720]  fight the new world order from coming through that thin membrane and ripen the hell out of you
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:36.400]  and probably physically you understand it's a dog eat dog survival of the fittest absolute jungle
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:42.400]  out there in the republic has been protecting you so you can be a slovenly little coward you understand
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:48.800]  that you idiot sorry go ahead no that's okay uh let's let's read what he has to say about the cia
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.560]  it might well be consoling to believe that the cia plots to overthrow of unhelpful form regimes but
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.400]  it is also true to insist that say the cia has nothing to do with the fall of the guatemal leader
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:06.640]  jacob arbanes in 1954 or the overthrow of chili salvatore aliandian 73 might feel terrifically
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:11.520]  sensible and sane we can't always be seeing the hidden hand of the cia and there's no
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:16.400]  call for the uh reductionism it is also you know wrong so in other words he admits they do it and
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:20.720]  gary hart comes right out and says our government will stage terror attacks iran if you don't follow
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:25.120]  orders don't think because 80 of the people are against attacking you that's what he said at the
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.040]  time in the letter and that's probably an accurate number compared to the false polls they've got out
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:33.040]  he said our government will stage attacks and get the support and then we go and interview him it's
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.920]  in it's it's in the new film truth rising and he says yes our government stages terror attacks
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:42.560]  that's what i said i mean but we don't need gary hart to tell us it's like three months ago
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:46.320]  the white house press secretary they're all asking her i played the clip is it true the
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:52.160]  dollars devalued the president needs to tell us we don't know we've been and we tell us and she's
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:56.880]  like i'm not allowed to tell you i'll be fired like we can't go look at a dollar euro dollar pound
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:05.920]  index we have to like mindless jellyfish go ask you the king cokehead uh porn star you know enjoying
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:12.000]  bush knows about it i mean what the what what is that uh it's the the willingness of the american
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.680]  people to want to be led down the wrong road and they just don't want to face reality that's right
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:20.480]  you're gonna get hurt real bad and my beloved country in the will too because you had to be a
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:25.840]  bunch of cowardly idiots now listen to me good scum and listen good or i'm talking to scum out

[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:45.280]  because i don't want to just talk about obama nation his new book which is very important
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:48.560]  we're gonna talk some about that and some of the great reporters they're putting out on him
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:53.760]  uh i want to get into his tape because he's you know an expert on it what's happening with
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.080]  the economy haven't had him on in about a month and also want to talk about some of the other
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:03.360]  things that the government's up to the national guard quietly announced last week with the governor
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:10.640]  was on mbc news in chicago that they're going to quote help fight guns gun crime the police are
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:15.360]  now running checkpoints with the national guard helicopters no one's covering that i don't want
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.840]  i'm sure he already knows about it but i want to talk about it obama of course as a chicago
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:25.920]  tribune reported we wrote stories about it world and daily did too said national security service
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:31.040]  now clinton proposed it set it up under secure core and they've already been training him so it's
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:35.520]  not like he's proposing something new he's just introducing it to the slaves and that is a million
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:42.160]  man at least that's what's been proposed in the documents uh teenagers with the m16s aiding the
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:49.120]  police and the feds and checkpoints as a domestic stasi you cannot make the stuff up this bad bush
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:55.200]  of course is hiring felons aggravated felons for the military both illegal and citizen uh it it is
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:01.200]  just all totally insane as dr course he broke months ago uh it was in canadian papers after he
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:07.600]  broke it uh us general bypass congress and signed a north com these foreign trips in the us i mean
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:14.320]  this is all happening we're living in total twilight zone and yes barack obama uh has shown us exactly
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:20.160]  who he is he's for warrenless wiretapping uh he's for attacking uh pakistan of all places
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:27.200]  and uh i have to give it to the left dr coursey they're actually waking up to obama pretty quick
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:32.720]  whereas people in the right can't wake up to george bush well alex is great to be back with you and
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:38.960]  you know you're right i just can't believe i mean obama here is shifting all over the place
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:46.080]  and on this latest public relations tour in the middle east i mean he's again all over the map
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:53.680]  i he wouldn't even be in iraq today as mccain points out if um because he hadn't supported the
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:01.120]  surge he'd have already pulled out of iraq and uh now he wants to go and extend extend into afghanistan
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.480]  and attack pakistan i mean i thought this was supposed to be the anti-war candidate you know
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:12.000]  where's the anti-war need you want to expand the war into pakistan that's i think one of the
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:19.920]  craziest things anybody could do at this point pakistan is only marginally an ally of the united
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:25.840]  states through mcsharaf they're going through economic turmoil they've got a wild western
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:31.760]  section that nobody controls and in our world that daily i reported extensively i even
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:37.040]  up i'll republish the you know video clips from the cell phone cameras at
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:43.840]  budos assassination showing the assassin right next to her car with a handgun was clear in the
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:48.320]  in the in the pictures we published and yet you know the moussar the moussaraf has not
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.480]  investigated the budo assassination nothing's happening there and now obama wants to go in
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:59.840]  and invade pakistan i mean that's a clear expansion of a war and doc our controlled media
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:06.240]  still says she hit her head on the car oh my god shows her being blasted exactly it's ridiculous
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:12.000]  the videos show clearly you know the assassin standing in the crowd the vehicle being blocked
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.880]  in its forward passage and the assassin who was you know well-dressed in a sports coat on
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:23.600]  it looked like he had a military pistol looked like a nine millimeter military pistol came right
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:30.400]  over by the side of the car and fired off three rounds at close range it was clear and yet that's
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:35.840]  not been picked up and carried around the world or investigated it's disgraceful and i think it
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:41.840]  just shows how you know if obama invades pakistan if that were his intent we could destabilize
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:47.840]  pakistan destabilize wait a minute the left loved it when when clinton was bombing with du all over
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:53.520]  serbian bringing in the wahhabis backed al-qaeda and i know it's something i could never understand
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:59.760]  because you know the entire clinton administration involvement in serbia was on behalf of the
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:05.920]  the muslims who were the primary troublemakers in the whole region and yet that was never
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:12.800]  covered even at the time but you know oh on my new book alex and i gotta say you know a your show
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:17.440]  handles covers books better than just about anybody i mean when i come on your show and

[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:58.240]  book is looking like and uh it's i think it's going to be i'm hoping it's going to make a major
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:02.720]  impact and what i will say about the book is that if obama does not answer what's in this book he's
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:09.520]  going to lose uh i know you can't talk about what's in the book but we know what's out there

[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:36.400]  day wrong okay yeah i'll be there well then i mean what's the first day you can talk about

[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:43.920]  have trey say yeah for the fifth right now for an hour okay well i'll work it out with him as
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.240]  soon as we're off the air okay good i mean i already know a lot of a lot of the stuff i'm just
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.080]  wondering i know you always research and document things i'm actually horrified to see what's in
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:15:00.400]  there but listen um the elite that is behind him's a big new brzezinski uh is the is the guy that
[1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:05.120]  created the mujahedin to get the russians to attack had them attack the russians to begin with
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:11.600]  he's a proponent of government sponsored terrorism and i'm not saying vote for mccain either i've
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:18.880]  never seen such a uh worst choice the only reason i'm probably in the final equation against uh obama
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.360]  is because i am afraid some nut may kill him and then we're gonna have race riots in this country
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:29.600]  that'll make the 60s burning down of every major city look like uh a game of uh poker well alex
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:34.400]  you know i've been writing hard against mccain certainly for the last four years i mean i've
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.920]  opposed his work with ted kennedy on this comprehensive immigration reform which i've
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:45.040]  always argued is just chamnesty it's just another way to get you know to allow millions of illegal
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:50.320]  aliens to stay in the united states i did not close the border uh the only thing i'll say about
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:55.840]  mccain is at least we can argue with mccain i mean as hard as it's gonna be we can fight with this
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:01.360]  guy uh the idea of getting a new idea in obama's head i think it's beyond it's not gonna happen
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:08.160]  even watching obama the last two days you know he's floundering on over there in the middle east
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:14.000]  his staff was trying to grab on to malachi's assertion that he was agreeing with obama's plan
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:20.160]  to withdraw us troops in 16 months that took one telephone call from the white house to malachi
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:25.120]  to say what do you guys think you're doing they backed off that message very quickly and then
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:30.640]  they would again make obama look foolish now obama is going to go into a germany and he's
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:36.800]  going to speak at this um column that is you know a monument that hitler had moved they hit the
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:42.480]  money you know the golden angel column in berlin which the monument that was created by the austrian
[1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:48.720]  for to celebrate prussian war uh victories going back into the 1890s hitler considered it the most
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:55.520]  military monument that uh germany had they moved it to be trained in the brandenburg gate and the
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:02.080]  right stag so it had a prominent place in his new germania design that you're saying all of that
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:08.560]  here's a message from obama it's a message i mean you know the and it's just somebody saying that
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:14.400]  obama staff didn't know what they're doing picking the you know golden angel column statue with a
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:19.520]  columns monument obama's got to know exactly either that or he's a complete idiot and i guess
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:25.200]  that's a possibility but you know he certainly some of his staff know what that monument represents
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:30.080]  but he off hitler was celebrating that monument he had to move from the right stag
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:34.320]  he had to move to this prominent place where it is right now in these gardens you know the end of
[1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:39.600]  these gardens is the brandenburg gate brandenburg gate is right next to that was the building the
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:46.880]  chanthory early chanthory building was where uh you know hitler was out the window on when he
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:52.480]  took over the chanthory and you know 1933 and they had the dr troops came through the storm
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:58.000]  troopers with the big candlelight perfect parade well doc uh done a drom course he knew about coming
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:04.400]  out abomination in just a week or two we know a few weeks ago they wouldn't let him speak where
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:08.080]  kennedy spoke they wouldn't let him speak another place so we know they were checking all the
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:11.920]  locations to see what their histories were he wouldn't speak at the nernberg area because
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:18.080]  heller obviously spoke there um i mean i think you can debate that all day what you can debate is
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:23.760]  that he wants a national intelligence core we've been writing about that in world met daily as
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:30.720]  you've been covering it this whole civilian core that obama wants created which is an idea goes
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:36.320]  that goes back to the clinton administration as you point out would create this huge its position
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:42.400]  is kind of a domestic peace corps but if you read what the group is supposed to do is kind of like
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:50.320]  a paramilitary group that appears to be you know of of youth police supporting our police force
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:54.960]  well did you read the secure core it was in the philadelphia daily news first in 2002
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:19:00.800]  where they train with m16s in court warrants service right and you know that combined with
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:05.920]  and we've been covering this in world net daily the you know the college in chicago which you've
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:11.680]  been covering have national guard entering in because the chicago police can't keep up with
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:17.680]  the violent crime in chicago i mean again this has got to be a negative for obama to run on i
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:23.760]  thought obama came from chicago you know the entire chicago being out you know whether chicago's out
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:31.040]  of control or not calling in national guard to help a police function crosses some very important
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:36.400]  line i mean this is you know posse cometotus forget about it well look i've got the numbers here
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:41.920]  murders are actually down three years running it is a high crime area because it's a victim
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:45.760]  disarmed the people are disarmed there but this is just getting rid of posse cometotus
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:51.040]  and in doc my whole thing is this it doesn't matter whether it's obama or mccain if they're
[1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:57.440]  all new world order controlled and i think it's important to point out just how bad each candidate
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:03.520]  is but obama really does have a lot of fascistic tendency syria terror storm a history of government
[1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:09.120]  sponsored terror loose change final cut in game blueprint for global enslavement the true story

[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:11.520]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:16.080]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:21.200]  system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:26.000]  spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.880]  run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with other
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:36.000]  central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:41.520]  expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:46.640]  a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:51.920]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:17.760]  it's alex jones and the gc n radio network all right here's the deal folks whatever topic you
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:24.160]  want to talk about iran and they're giving up for that strike the economy barack obama his
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:30.160]  globalist advisors i know we got people holding joe don robert steve helen everybody else that
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:33.920]  we're going to get to you a dr corsey coming up in the next segment he'll be back with us on the
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:39.760]  fifth or sixth of august to break all this exclusive barack obama stuff not rumors but what he can
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:48.000]  prove he's he's very scrupulous about doing that uh you know he makes sure that he does that we
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.840]  appreciate him being one of our contributors here and he's also going to be reporting for us
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:57.120]  from the rnc and the dnc i'm going to be at the dnc not the rnc so it'll be great to have him there
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  at the dnc and the rnc force because i won't be inside of either one of them i could probably
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:06.560]  get credentials but i don't feel like having a proctology exam by the secret service every time
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:13.840]  i go in um going back to dr corsey let's shift gears in the economy uh you're an expert on uh
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:18.320]  that without getting into your bio as we've done in the past or you can if you want uh give us your
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:23.360]  take on the deteriorating situation well uh uh well i'm starting a new newsletter on world net
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:28.480]  daily called red alert you can see it it's a subscription news newsletter i'm writing it every
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:34.800]  week as priced under ten dollars a month we want to keep it reasonable red alert dot w and d for
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.120]  worldnet daily dot com and i'm gonna start with the housing crisis because i've got an article on
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:47.680]  that today in red alert and alex it's much worse than people have any idea in terms of how bad it
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:55.440]  is now where it's going banks today own one million foreclosed properties which means that one out of
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:02.080]  every 500 households in the u.s is facing some kind of a foreclosure or notice the default
[1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:10.560]  those are staggering numbers one out of every 500 home or household is facing foreclosure or notice
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:19.120]  a default uh nationwide housing plummeted housing prices have gone down 20 percent in the last year
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:23.680]  and i'm advising people to take their home value when they thought it was at the highest
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:29.680]  at the peak of this bubble and to divide it in half as i think that there are markets in the
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:35.520]  united states that are going to adjust down as far as 50 percent come down 20 percent already
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:40.400]  that's a big you know that if your house was worth a million dollars realize you're probably
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:44.560]  living in a property that's not worth much more than a half a million dollars and that's
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:50.720]  at today's dollars which are inflated um also the reason i think the crisis is not yet
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:58.320]  anywhere near over is that credit swiss is reporting that by december this year 53
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:03.920]  percent of the subprime borrowers are going to have negative equity in their home subprime being
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:10.880]  the worst category but that percentage is going to grow so that by 2009 it's going to be 63 percent
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:16.240]  10 additional uh the subprime borrowers who have negative negative equity in their home
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:23.200]  now that's not going to stop until 80 or 90 percent of the subprime when borrowers have
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:29.280]  negative equity in their home that means that this crisis isn't going to bottom out until 2010
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:37.200]  or even 2012 and if that's the case uh the drop in home values is just beginning and that it's
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:43.040]  triggered now crises in every other market where people where people are losing confidence
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:48.560]  people are living on their credit cards now and jobs are shutting down all sorts of businesses
[1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:54.400]  are going into bankruptcy and the exodus of u.s companies offshore is accelerating and also
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:28:01.520]  so many of these banks now are holding these packaged mortgage security these collateralized
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:06.720]  mortgage securities and their asset portfolios that when they have to be marked to market
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:12.320]  which eventually they have to have to be done uh i'm saying that immediately in the next 12
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:20.240]  18 months you could have as 150 more banks like indy mac failing 150 and to stop it to
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:26.560]  probe you know to prolong the crisis as it were the fed as i think lent out of the discount window
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:33.120]  or the special auction about 500 billion about half a trillion dollars in credit and loans to
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:39.200]  these banks but that won't prop up their failed assets forever eventually somebody's gotta take
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:43.680]  the loss on these mortgage securities and when they do it's inevitable more banks are gonna fail
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:48.960]  well we know who that is it's the american people uh who got to pay taxes on the inflated currency
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:55.840]  uh and on all of and and and the value of all these foreign countries and companies and individuals
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:01.760]  dumping dollars which is helping drive commodities upward how long dr. coursey do you think till
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:07.520]  things really start getting bad well i think we're already seeing a crisis in banks that we've not
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:14.640]  seen since the 1930s i wrote in lake rate usa you know my last book i predicted then that we would
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:21.520]  have this dollar crisis the dollar would be deeply devalued the dollar even today is trading at about
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:28.560]  a dollar 58 to the euro at that level the dollar's lost half of its value under the bush administration
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:36.480]  half of its value gone uh and by the way other currencies are inflating that means we're blasting
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:41.520]  past them over right back with dr. coursey more on the economy your phone call straight ahead
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:48.640]  1 800 25 99 2 3 1 hey i'm nobody said reality was pretty but at least you know the truth the average

[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:52.240]  the father reaganomics on bob Chapman the list goes on and on they basically all say the same thing
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:58.720]  uh they're saying two to three years till total hyperinflation and road warrior type scenarios
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:03.680]  they're saying are possible we can just hope for a long horrible recession and kind of turning
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:09.920]  into a third world country that's the good side uh versus explosive implosion i wanted to get
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.960]  dr coursey he's been saying the next two years or so at least last time he was on a few months ago
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:21.120]  what is your prognosis now dr i'm still within the time frame of the next two years i think that
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:28.240]  it by 2010 we could have hyperinflation i mean we're close to it now we quit publishing m3 data
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:33.040]  which is the broadest measure of the money supply that's not good published now for years at least
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:38.880]  three years uh and we've been printing money in the fed like you know it's going out of style i mean
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:44.080]  we've there's half a trillion dollars that we pumped with credit through the discount window
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:50.720]  on these special auctions into the banking system that's all just made up loaned money uh the dollar
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:57.360]  is at 1.58 dollar 58 to the euro i think if we weren't supporting the dollar yet in terms of
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:02.480]  market manipulation through the fed which we're doing the dollar could easily be over a dollar
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:07.680]  60 to the euro and i'm predicting a dollar could go to you know with the next two years could be
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.400]  two dollars to the euro okay you just said supporting the dollar with one set of policies the white
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:19.120]  house has been propping it up but then with the other set of policies and i've seen this in their
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:24.560]  own publications they want a slow slide of the dollar well that's true as to not cause war on
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.800]  the streets panic okay so you agree with that go i agree with that through the repo agreement for
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.240]  the other market manipulations that are being done at the fed there's attempts to prop up the dollar
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:39.040]  but the major support we ought to be doing for the dollar which is raising interest rates at the fed
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:45.120]  yes is not being done as bad as voker was he did that and he did it he put rates up to double
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.800]  digit at the reagan administration and it was the medicine we needed to get inflation under control
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:56.320]  and the strength of the dollar it set up the expansion of the 1990s this is doing the exact
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:01.440]  opposite we're holding our fed is holding discount rates at two percent while the european central
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:05.760]  bank has interest rates at four point two five let's see let's see that makes people for the
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:11.360]  don't know by foreign securities not ours and go into foreign currency they go with you know the
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:16.720]  foreign currency markets are moving into the year let me ask you this let me ask you just a more
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:21.200]  of a not an academic question or more boots on the ground question just as an observation
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:27.920]  an intelligence observation i often the richest city in the in the us per capita you know before
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:33.920]  its size most the really rich billionaires that i either know or have connections to have left i
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:38.080]  mean left the country a couple years ago saying it's going to fully collapse that's why i was telling
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:43.440]  people one of the reasons i read about it too and you know dick cheney buying a house in dubai and
[1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:47.760]  black water moving outside the country and haliburton leaving and everybody's leaving
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:53.360]  anheuser busch being bought i mean what is that signal uh i was reading the top billionaires in
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:58.240]  israel have all moved out and completely pulled up stakes and gone to london what's going on well
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:04.080]  the only solution we have right now to the uh asset crisis going on but you know the banks
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:08.240]  having to borrow their assets from the federal reserve that this count window in the auction
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:13.920]  is new capital and the new capital is going to you know essentially we're at the stage where the
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:19.280]  usa is going to be up for sale that's the next phase of this crisis oh yeah the dollar is going
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:24.080]  to continue to depreciate we've had a devaluation under bush it just hasn't been announced
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:30.240]  our people are going to see dramatically increasing food prices i mean by the end of this year which
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:34.640]  is only you know a few months they're going to see dramatically increasing food price it's just
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:39.520]  now started i mean they could uh is it correct sir that normally and maybe talk about why
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:44.240]  why normally we see inflation hit the country that's had the inflation
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:49.840]  last you feel it outside first with that currency and then last but the abs overnight we see it
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:55.360]  climbing well it's also in part because the fed is you know the statistics have lied for so long
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:02.080]  they can't keep food and energy out of cornflation any longer because they've increased at these
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:07.680]  current rates for so long they have to now be considered part cornflation and then they exponentially
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.080]  with energy make every every other sector go on exactly right if we were measuring inflation the
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.800]  way we did in the 70s we probably have to admit to double digit inflation today what is it about
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:23.360]  13 it'd be about somewhere between 11 and 13 percent that we'd have to admit to uh and with
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:29.520]  energy prices going up as you point out that's got a spillover effect to every possible thing
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:35.120]  that impact food first that's where you're going to see it first and food prices are going to
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.360]  increase dramatic because that's a commodity and tied into energy so it's a double and they both
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:44.160]  in the production and the delivery you know energy to produce the food energy to deliver the food
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:50.720]  and for both reasons energy food prices and also throw in that we're now using 25 percent
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:56.480]  of our corn production for ethanol and that puts pressure on food prices worldwide i've written
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:01.680]  about that in world that daily even the world bank is now complaining that our ethanol let me ask
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:05.840]  you a financial question i was on a little radio stuff for two hours this morning the number one
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:10.080]  morning show and they were asking me what to do financially and i said look i only interview all
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:14.160]  the experts and have seen them be right over the years and i know a little bit about economics as
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:19.520]  i study it but it's simple they're devaluing the dollar the globalist debased our uh industrial
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:25.680]  capacity so this was the perfect setup to buy us up now we're in the you know receivership
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:33.360]  end or as you just put it uh a more safer sale usa for sale you know late great usa here i said i
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:37.840]  don't know what to tell you to do i mean obviously gold silver you know that's only going to go up
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:42.720]  as the dollar dies but at a certain point what about food housing i mean what do you do if you've
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:46.480]  got a six hundred thousand dollar house that you know is really only worth three hundred thousand
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:50.320]  and as you said it inflated numbers so more like a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand what you
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.200]  bought it for uh what do you do i mean let's take an average person let's say with a hundred
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:42:00.880]  thousand dollars in savings and a five hundred thousand dollar house with two suvs and one kid
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.120]  in college and one in high school and uh and they're getting their retirement i mean what does that
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:12.640]  person do or what does somebody like me do that has a company with a bunch of employees and almost
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:17.360]  all my money is just sitting there as capital run the company because i don't really run this company
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:21.920]  to make profits i run it to to get the message out what do i do is it safe in the banks i mean
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.480]  you see what i'm saying well the first thing people got to do is protect their primary residential
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.120]  real estate they got to make sure that they're not going to lose their homes you know that's why
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:36.320]  i say get a realistic handle on what your market value of your current home is even if you have
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:42.240]  to divide what you thought it was worth by half and make sure your mortgage is paid down to under
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:46.640]  that level okay explain to people because they can come sometimes and demand the note off or
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:50.720]  grab it they can demand the note there's a variety of things that could be done or you could hit a
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:56.320]  hard time when you're not as readily able to come up with the mortgage payment and you don't want
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:01.920]  to be in a situation ever where you're underwater where your mortgage is worth more than the retail
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:07.920]  value of your home okay well i'm already in that position okay and again i'm not out here running
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.960]  around shopping for big houses i just have a moderate house as somewhat of an investment
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:17.600]  and then uh you know austin's been a quote hot market for years do what you can to pay down the
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:22.560]  mortgage it's got to be a first strategy second strategy is get rid of your credit card debt
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:29.120]  you rip up your card cut your credit cards in half i'll pay them off i don't use credit cards
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:34.640]  except for a payment mechanism don't start living on your credit card people use credit cards so
[1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:38.960]  use this cash pay it back a hundred percent each month pay it back a hundred percent each month
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:43.360]  because otherwise you're going to get you know people who are paying credit using credit cards to
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:48.240]  pay credit cards like taking a drink in the morning to get sober it doesn't work and you've
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:53.360]  got to hang over you have to have a bloody merry you got an alcohol problem you're not getting sober
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:58.720]  absolutely you know and that's what people got to realize they can't live on credit anymore
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:04.240]  that's going to be that's bankruptcy but that's what the banks are doing is is they
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:08.880]  create all this out of fiat but then leave the country on this but this all works well that's
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:14.720]  why i say we're into a crisis like the depression because you know even when the savings and loans
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:19.520]  fail there's no job and they're going to run out of credit yes and the you know this is going to
[1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:24.080]  impact people's primary residential real estate when you've got a million people where the banks
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:30.080]  own their home and you got one out of every 500 home in the united states that's under foreclosure
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:35.360]  these are numbers that we haven't seen since the 1930s it the savings loan industry went away
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:41.840]  it collapsed 1600 savings and loans dr corcy held this crisis how bad because we should let industry
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:46.880]  and other jobs one or one one crop economy of debt based on the fiat currency how bad do you think
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:51.600]  it'll get well i think it's going to get it you know i think we're into many parts of the country
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:57.920]  are already in deep recession go to ohio go to michigan the jobs are gone the housing values
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:04.000]  are dropping precipitously i think you know the stages as this works out is first we put the u.s
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.560]  up a for sale then the next thing is the globalists are going to come back and say the only way you
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:13.920]  can solve this is if you have a regional currency like the amaro or if you have a north american
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:18.880]  market to compete with the european market having created the crisis the globalists will offer more
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:24.080]  globalism as a solution and so they're going to claim remonetize under a new continental unit
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:30.240]  exactly go to drop the dollar altogether and and like great u.s a predicted that we would
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:36.160]  have a dollar crisis just as we are having in order to get to that effect i've been i wrote
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:41.200]  the lake great u.s a was published a year ago in july this month and i've been working on it for
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:46.080]  two years before that constantly predicting go back and what i've written a world that day like
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:51.120]  constantly predicting we're coming into this dollar evaluation crisis where the banks were
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:56.000]  going to fall into this asset crisis i've been predicting the bursting of the home bubble
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.160]  since about 2005 now now this is designed by the globalist in in your research or or or they
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:06.800]  lost control well either you know they designed it or they're you know completely incompetent i
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:12.240]  don't think that's the case boker only perfect i'm sorry green span only produced bubbles
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:17.520]  when it when interest rates were artificially held low at two thousand two thousand three and two
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:25.440]  thousand four one percent the creation of this credit bubble was foreseeable i've been arguing
[1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:33.040]  since 2004 2005 i'm still arguing today that we need higher interest rates not because i want to
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:37.600]  slow down economic activity or i like the higher interest rates but it's the only responsible
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:43.280]  thing to do to see what's dangerous is the bankers hate that so what they'll do is they'll let us
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:49.200]  maybe put that in the day the market crashes and claim that did it well but in fact uh large to a
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:54.080]  large extent greenspan did when he was trying to raise interest rates immediately they came off of
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:47:00.080]  that as a crisis saying look we just you know first the bubble of the housing market and the economy
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:05.440]  is going into the tank i mean that was happening in 2007 now we've got interest rates back to
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:10.240]  two percent and it makes no sense at all today to have interest rates at two percent because that
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:16.160]  makes the dollar plunge which in the end decapitates us the fellow that owns this network uh took a
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:22.400]  trip down to south america down to argentina and he said they were hardly taking dollars and of
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:26.400]  course if you were down in argentina three years ago they'd be fighting for them i mean well when
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:31.280]  well go to europe go to europe and take the dollar to europe and see how little you get it said you
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.320]  know close to a dollar sixty all the world exchanges you know you're you're going to trade
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:41.600]  your dollars in at about a dollar eighty five to the euro dollar sixty five uh dollar sixty on
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:46.080]  the world currency markets isn't what you're going to pay by the time you get through changing your
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:50.880]  money let's see person in europe this is how willfully ignorant americans are they go i've seen
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:56.160]  them on blogs and things they go to europe and think man these europeans are really stupid and
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:03.440]  pathetic uh appear as eight dollars no folks it's that you're paying with a dollar uh what do you
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:08.640]  call that utter coursey when people just engage in mental gymnastics to deny what's happening well
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:13.120]  the reality is it's a hard one for people to accept is that we've they say the currency has
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:19.360]  lost half of its value in eight years of the bush administration that's dramatic i mean that's
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:24.720]  you know those are huge amounts of loss and it's kind of like the little green frog getting boiled
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:30.160]  in the pot of water with you know since we're being boiled in the water it does we don't realize
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:34.960]  we're being cooked to death if you drop the frog in the same boiling water it would jump out and
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:41.760]  survive but we've now gone through this gradual increasing of gasoline prices now two dollars
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  okay well three dollars we can handle okay now some point four fifty five dollars people are going
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:53.200]  to have to realize hey this is a key change this is dramatic the same way maybe not yet
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:58.240]  realized that the dollar at a dollar fifty eight to the euro but the dollar at one seventy five to
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:03.600]  the euro people are going to realize it so when people start going to the you know put paying
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:10.720]  eighty dollars to fill up a gas tank wait till you start going to the grocery store and you realize
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.200]  that two hundred dollars doesn't buy you very many maybe three bags of groceries and if not bought
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:20.800]  any filet mignon yeah yeah the exactly the denial is getting ready to in in fact uh i guess in a
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:25.920]  way it's kind of like the country has a fever it could be healthy to throw globalism off of us
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:31.440]  if we're able to tell the public in the time we've got that the new world order is behind this instead
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:36.160]  the central banks want to create a new bubble the green bubble and there's and they are even
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:41.040]  advertising this saying it's the new bubble the new exit point you know out of this crisis
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:48.720]  to buy carbon credits from the private bankers which is another insane idea predicated on the
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:54.480]  idea that you know carbon dioxide is not just chemical which is not plants love cotton but
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:59.600]  obviously doctor that's pure bull but but but you know my point is is that let's let's go with their
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:04.320]  bull okay carbon dioxide is a deadly poison it's going to kill you it kills plants and
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:08.880]  humans and it eats the pain off your car let's just go with the lie they've listed it globally
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:13.440]  as toxic waste let's just believe the law it's more of a scheme for global control well i was
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:18.720]  about to say even if you believe that all the studies show if the west cuts production it will
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:23.760]  simply force production of goods further the third world which have no controls and then increase
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:29.440]  the devil gas the whole plan here is to lower the value of standard of living in the united states
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:33.680]  where what we should be doing is protecting the standard of living in the united states and raising
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.000]  the rest of the world to our level no carbon dioxide is deadly poison doesn't matter of all
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.040]  the study show was 14 times higher during the Jurassic and makes plants grow and put off more
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:47.120]  oxygen and then mammals live longer in every other animal form doesn't matter all the study
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:52.640]  show or an oxygen-starved environment and need more of these life-giving gases you're wrong
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:58.560]  global taxes good and the dollar hasn't been devalued and there's no north american union

[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:32.480]  to protect american ideals but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook that they have sworn

[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:48.640]  talk about the the s uh 1959 senate bill is coming up august 2nd friend and it's the prevention
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:56.000]  of violent radicalization of the homeland terrorism this is this is the thought police uh
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:55:04.080]  bill right and uh if you go down to findings the third finding says the internet is aided
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:11.040]  in the facility in violent publicization i uh ideally based violence and homegrown terrorism
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:16.720]  processed united states access to broadband constant stream and terrorist related propaganda
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:21.280]  to the united states and during the hearings they show 9 11 truth groups and they're now claiming
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:25.200]  that we're can that we that that that i and others were trained as children in afghanistan
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:30.800]  i mean that they are totally desperate and it's just over the country is completely collapsing
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:35.520]  well of course do you want to comment on that i'm just saying you know and don't remember that
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:42.640]  obama changed his position and voted for phyton we obama voted for the extension of these you
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:47.680]  know we know bush isn't it they're gonna pass the baton presidents are titular heads they're gonna
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:51.920]  hit i want all the leftists understand you've been against all this under bush and that's good
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:57.360]  you better be against it under obama go ahead well the idea that the left thing so bomb is
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:04.000]  going to come in and uh before individual freedoms and reversing these laws if you know
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.760]  and every one of these laws being proposed are getting passed yeah they're smoking pcp
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.760]  if they believe that and you know exactly obama is going to be for them despite his
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.320]  rhetoric he's going to go with just like he turned around and voted for phyton i mean that to me was
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:22.480]  it a complete betrayal of his message and his base okay but how do we defeat this current bill i
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:28.000]  mean i think again you know the attention you're bringing to it on the radio call or bringing
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.080]  attention to it this is what we've got to do we've got to get people aware that a lot of
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:36.800]  these bills are eroding individual freedom i'll tell you what it does to have the government
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:40.720]  saying they want to regulate free speech on the web and the internet right the internet is the
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:46.880]  key key there because the you know i think the attacks in the next administration are going
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.160]  to come on talk radio one way or the other and on the internet yeah because these are the last two
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:56.160]  bastions where there's really free expression permitted and they're going to tell the left
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:00.160]  it's about stopping the right wing not the establishment right wing it's going to be about
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:06.320]  shutting down real dissent no matter what brand it is expression of any alternative views
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:10.080]  that are not already endorsed by the global elite well they're talking about you having to
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:15.120]  be certified to be a blogger and then they'll decide if you're allowed and certified what people
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:20.880]  don't understand is the free speech first amendment is predicated on it on permitting extreme views
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:26.320]  permitting all kinds of views you know it just doesn't permit no violence because then you've
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.560]  got your free speech to counter their bizarre precisely the whole idea in fact in fact they'll
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:36.080]  say dr. coursey isn't allowed to write articles saying well that's saying that obama's a communist
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:42.160]  go back to john stewart mill the whole idea is robust aggressive debate which means extreme
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.760]  views are permitted if not welcomed that's what free speech is all about and and the whole idea
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:52.880]  from bills on was that in the robust court of public opinion debating and arguing all these
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:57.680]  things out truth is more likely to emerge well we've had the fake right wing trying to restrict
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:02.240]  free speech but on the campuses the left is really restricting free speech and you know
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:08.720]  these bills are all aimed at limiting free speech limiting debate and only permitting
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:13.280]  the orthodox pre-approved ideas from getting through and i want to be clear i say we're on
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:16.960]  the left right paradigm but then i address it as left right from time to time i'm addressing

[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:45.920]  than steven hobert helen in florida you're on the air with dr. Jerome course he authored the
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:53.680]  lake rate usa and coming up on the fifth of august his new abomination book go ahead yes first of all
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:01:01.600]  dr. ron paul's message this week at 888-324-14 states that giving a teenager with a credit card
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:05.760]  unlimited that's what our government's operating on unlimited printing of the paper bills
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:10.800]  then there's something i really think process is dr. tupper thought no tupper saw he wrote
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:16.800]  miracle mainstream about 20 years ago and he showed that this one woman went to kmart and she
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:22.880]  brought by 80 dogs with a product refused to pay the state in contact because the constitution says
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:26.800]  they should accept no payment other than go with silvers here make me break the constitution
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:32.000]  he won now this is my walter midi dream uh you maybe could get her but he could spread this
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:37.520]  message in some particular weekend could be set up with everyone in the nation who's knowledgeable
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:43.680]  and has the courage to go into a walmart buy products they use to pay the tax because they're
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:48.480]  making a valid the constitution and i used to get a comment on that so let's let's take down like
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:54.400]  so far uh first of all i think you know i encourage people to look at ron paul i think ron paul has
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:00.320]  had a tremendous amount of positive impact and delivering the message of the bank crisis the
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:08.000]  debt crisis the mortgage crisis and i've i met ron paul during the uh iowa caucuses and he asked
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.400]  me for a signed copy of the lake rate usa i said to him you know dr paul you could have written
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:18.400]  this book and he said he'd do but he wanted to read it anyway and uh i agree with i'll
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:25.120]  get enormous about what he says i encourage people to do that also secondly on the uh credit card
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:32.000]  card to teenagers are expanding credit card we're we've got a debt level in this country which is
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:38.720]  beyond belief at all levels credit cards mortgages our corporations are running at a debt level
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:45.760]  we we have a debt capitalism structure that won't will not long sustain itself and where
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:51.120]  we're headed right now is a debt crisis our corporations are not going to be able to borrow
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:54.560]  you're not going to be able to get the same kind of home loan because in this crisis
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:58.800]  the banks are going to pull back despite liquidity being available they're not going to make
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:04.640]  loans we're going to do a very very tough time which is going to be appreciating values
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:10.640]  harder to get jobs higher energy costs of higher food prices i see that as a crisis
[2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:14.160]  which is going to deepen for the next two years and it's not going to go away quickly
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.520]  absolutely and and helen you've been holding me your phones really bad i'm gonna let you go call
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:23.760]  us back on the day when you have a better line i could barely understand the last part uh but i
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:28.160]  believe she was talking about civil disobedience and yes i don't want to get violent i see i don't
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:32.720]  hate the police and military if marshall law comes in i'm not looking with thrills towards
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:36.400]  having confrontations with them see i live in the real world right i know i know i'm not
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:40.800]  bulletproof and they're not bulletproof i've actually seen enough of my life to not like it
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:44.640]  well people who haven't experienced stuff like that think they want to experience it i lived
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:50.000]  through the the riots of the 1960s and was you know working studying reporting on the
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.280]  me when i was a kid a riot is something nobody needs to live through they're terrible and they're
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:00.240]  frightening because lawlessness breaks down the criminal element uses it and they're destructive
[2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:04.320]  you know what happens is people end up destroying property that's valuable to themselves the
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:11.200]  the tragedy of many of the riots were the damage done to the inner city areas including stores
[2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:16.560]  the african-american communities and you know the poor in general were using to live on and
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:20.560]  then it spreads into their own houses and then it's terrible there's nothing positive about
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:27.120]  civil disorder or riot but but if the globals are trying to put us in FEMA camps civil disobedience
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:33.680]  is key well the the the crisis we're entering into is going to be one of the i still say one of
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:39.200]  the deepest crises economically we've had since the 1930s well ron paul said that last week dr
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:42.560]  course he said this is going to be the biggest thing we've ever seen listen i can't wait to

[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:28.640]  phones here we're going to get your calls in the shower i know a lot of you've been holding a while
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:33.360]  but it's all the same issue we're discussing really all day here but but but how could we not
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:40.880]  not the foretold implosion of the dollar and the economy by design in a mass raping of the
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:45.840]  population and we've had all these amazing guests on i mean the tops of their fields
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:52.320]  and economic telling you that it is by design that the very pinnacle of economics and finance
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:57.360]  all telling you the globalist are doing this by design now this is a fraud we don't owe these
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:02.640]  debts these were fraudulently created out of fiat backed up by the credit name of the united
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:08.800]  states and today i want to talk about just how bad the depression may get when we can officially
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:13.280]  call it a depression with our guests who are both real experts on the new world order in the
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:19.520]  fellow reserve and filmmakers and take your phone calls but then in the next hour i want to get
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:26.480]  more into monetary reform and a little bit more on how that would actually work and because we
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:32.080]  can't just know that what the globalists are doing is wrong and predatory and designed mathematically
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:37.280]  to implode to where all assets go to them and they have a police state that they pay to enforce it
[2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:43.520]  total domination but we will get your calls early in the shower and get some of those out of the
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.600]  way for those that have been patiently holding and it can be on any issue because all issues
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:55.200]  feed in to the private central banks and what they are up to pat karmak one of the leading
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:10:01.840]  experts on central banking worked in power companies oil banking himself very successful
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:07.760]  he found out about all this decades ago in the mid 90s he financed the making of a film that came
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:16.880]  out a few years later the money masters and it is a three hour plus film 1995 on dvd at info wars
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:22.320]  dot com and i'm excited that when we're on with us a few weeks ago people ordered a whole bunch of
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:27.520]  them and that's good because here's the deal the public finally doesn't like the government before
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:32.880]  you'd have one party in power and they'd have a 55 percent approval rating in the party out of power
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.680]  would have a 44 45 percent and it would basically be that way and they'd fool us with one part of
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:43.200]  the other and these dog and pony shows and these conventions where you do have politicians fighting
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:48.560]  with each other over being being managers for the new world order but that's it it is a dog and pony
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:55.360]  show it is a carnival it is a it is an elaborate curtain to shade what's really going on behind
[2:10:55.360 --> 2:11:04.640]  the throne and now that's more expressed than ever i mean 60 70 80 90 years ago we had presidents
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:08.640]  that were independent to some capacity but still beholden to special interest but now the elites
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:13.760]  really are unified and a world of hurts coming down on us they've militarized the police built
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:19.280]  fema camps masked you know huge storage facilities of coffins all over the country now confirmed
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:24.720]  rocky mountain news reporting in a giant crematoriums for the citizenry the government's
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.520]  tested biological chemical weapons on us they're capable of doing it at any time they stage the
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:34.400]  terror attacks of 9 11 i mean we're in a world of hurt folks we're in a world of well something
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:41.120]  else but i'm not going to say it only by realizing just how diabolical they are and just how ruthless
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:48.560]  they are and really growing up do we have any chance if not i've had former top ci analyst on
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:55.440]  i i i have had uh again members of congress on i have had top white house historians on
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:01.920]  and then treasury department analyst on in the last week telling you that they have analyzed the
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:06.960]  attack pattern and it looks like this massive military buildup against the american people and
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:15.440]  the west is some type of malice or hitlerian or stalin asked purge hiring felons hiring criminals
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:19.920]  hiring youth brigades for the police and the feds and the military the national guard announcing
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:26.160]  they're going to help do gun confiscation in illinois uh i mean this is it this is it ladies and
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:32.160]  gentlemen and uh they are gearing up like they know that bad stuff's coming well we know what
[2:12:32.160 --> 2:12:37.840]  that is economic collapse they made it get us to rally around the flag stage some type of terror
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:43.760]  attack in the midst of the deepening crisis to then say oh well it fully plunged because of lc i
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:48.960]  ada i mean al qaeda hitting us and then get everybody to rally around them while we go into
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:55.360]  emergency a reorganization and a remonetization towards the amaro or some new horrible fiat
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:58.400]  system i think that's what they're going to do is a new fiat i don't agree it's going to be
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.440]  gold back that that's being pushed but i do agree it should be a fiat control of the population
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:06.800]  i don't i don't like the gold silver system though i am for you holding golden silver
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:12.000]  individually that's a good investment but i wanted to just set the the uh the table with that
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:17.760]  and then not start off with monetary up front with our guest uh but uh get both of their takes
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.960]  both pat karmac the maker of the film and the um in banking and oil and everything else and
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:28.560]  utilities and then of course bill still the great narrator who is also quite an expert on it though
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:33.760]  he doesn't suit his horn i want to get your take on all the announcements that are being made and
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:38.880]  and and the intensification i mean we knew this was all happening and coming but to still be seeing
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:43.920]  it happen and feel the approach of doom i mean all the stuff we're feeling right now is just a
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:51.360]  you know fluttering breeze compared to the whirlwind let's go ahead and go to pat karmac and bill
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:14:03.920]  still pat what's your take on what i just said okay we just had a phone problem there let's
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:08.320]  go to bill still bill are you there yeah i'm here okay good his phone just cut out we've
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:13.520]  done phone system issues um you just heard my whole take on the martial law the grid
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:19.280]  all this being set up what's your take on it uh you know i don't i don't follow that i really i
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:25.360]  try to focus strictly on monetary reform and how the problem originated to me that's a big enough
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:31.280]  problem uh the rest of it will uh other people will have to take care of you don't deal with
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:39.360]  what they're going to do after they've fully imploded the society no i don't because uh it's
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:46.640]  it's far too difficult to estimate what's going to happen at this point if you're looking strictly
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:54.560]  from a monetary perspective uh they they might be able to completely control it it might uh
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.840]  it might be out of their control as far as we're talking about from the united states perspective
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:07.440]  uh you know at some level internationally speaking perhaps this is in control perhaps not it's
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:12.800]  difficult to say there are far too many variables i couldn't begin to predict where this is going
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:19.920]  other than uh definitely towards hyperinflation uh where the government's sole purpose is to
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:26.640]  merely soften the blow as much as possible and lie about inflation that's that's what's going on
[2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:31.520]  and i agree with you but we can look at what the gunboat diplomacy has been what the banks have done
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:37.280]  in third world countries and other european nations so we know what they try to do uh let's go ahead
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:43.040]  and go to uh pat karmak the maker of the money masters uh before your phone cut out there i
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:48.720]  think you were hearing my question about how are they going to keep us from criminally prosecuting
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:54.720]  them if this all goes into depression by design and and is that why they need the police state
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:16:00.640]  to make sure they can carry out their crime and not get in trouble for it well um the way
[2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:06.000]  first off that they can avoid criminal prosecution is simply that it is the law of the land i mean
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:12.800]  much of what they're doing at least on in the economic field financial field you know is authorized
[2:16:12.800 --> 2:16:19.920]  by either the federal reserve act 1913 or various amendments to it for certain emergency
[2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:25.120]  legislation much of which was passed either in the great depression or in world war two
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:30.720]  so it gives them pretty uh broad powers to do just about anything they want the economy so the
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:37.760]  license is steel yeah that's correct and uh you'd have to you know to challenge it effectively
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:43.680]  it'd have to go to the supreme court and they'd have to overturn existing rulings so in terms of
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:50.960]  a you know criminal prosecution that would be obviously a huge barrier um in terms of um you
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:56.800]  know other kinds of uh means of dealing with it you're talking really about political activity
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:04.880]  for the most part and um there's various avenues that could take you know i we talked last time
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:08.640]  a little bit about the fact that in the great depression is when you had these political
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:14.640]  movements which were led by robert lafollette huy long and father coglamp which energized
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:19.040]  you know tens of millions of americans to demand reform and they did in fact get some
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:22.000]  that then world war two intervened and stopped the reform movement
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:27.360]  well you really do know your history most folks haven't even looked into all that uh
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:32.480]  well in the next hour and 40 something minutes we can talk about any issues you want i i do
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:37.440]  want to take a lot of calls for folks that are holding uh so they can ask questions uh just about
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:42.400]  you know the whole gamut of what's uh happening but asking you pat from all the businesses and
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:47.040]  things you've seen in finance how bad do you think this is going to get i was asking uh bill
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:51.360]  that and he was saying you know he didn't know but i mean obviously you don't have a crystal ball
[2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:58.400]  but i mean what is most likely to to happen um with what we see with the devalued dollar and
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:03.760]  the rest of it well some of the things are you know fairly easy to predict and others really
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:08.880]  aren't and a lot of it has to do with if this were purely an economic issue you could make
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:13.200]  fairly certain predictions about certain areas but it's not it's interwoven with politics
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:19.200]  it's interwoven with wars going on around the world and international politics so there's a
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:24.480]  lot of players and a lot of factors some of the things you can you know predict with a reasonable
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:30.560]  degree of certitude uh are that as long you know as long as the u.s government has a huge
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:38.000]  budget deficit you're going to see uh the dollar devalued uh more than it is now
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:42.640]  and of course it you know right now we're running in excess of 400 billion deficit a year
[2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:47.680]  and so you're going to see the dollar continue to devalue against the euro and the other
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:55.680]  major currencies because those nations are not running such high deficits that could change
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:02.400]  but in the short term it's not likely to do so so you know that's that's fairly safe bet there
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:09.280]  what will the impact be on in some other areas well we still have a large housing inventory so
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:15.840]  you're probably going to see obviously continued decline in the housing market that's probably
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:21.440]  not going to turn around anytime soon uh the inventory would have obviously have to be absorbed
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:26.960]  in it you know lately it's actually been growing and foreclosures and all are adding to that so
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:32.720]  your so you know those things uh have obviously snowball effects in other areas of the economy
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:39.040]  so you know things don't look good right now for the economy that's fairly clear when we get back
[2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:44.240]  i want to ask you if you see a soft landing uh in the cards from your perspective filmmaker pat
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:50.320]  karmack and bill still the narrator joining us the money masters is the film you see this three

[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:25.840]  We're going to talk about who owns the Federal Reserve what it is not just fractional reserve
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:30.720]  banking but other forms of that other forms of leveraging by these elites and the impact of
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:38.320]  this monetary system on the family and ways to soften the blow of that solutions with our guest
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:43.920]  the maker of the Moneymasters dvd the film Pat Carmack just the classic folks more important
[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:51.120]  today when they made it in what 1996 and then of course Bill still the narrator and uh long
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:54.160]  segment coming up we're going to get your calls out of the way first because you've been holding
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:58.480]  a while we've been talking about the same issue before our guests gone then we will continue
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:04.080]  with our guests but but for this segment what do you want to tackle first uh Bill and Pat um
[2:25:04.800 --> 2:25:09.200]  who the Federal Reserve is and and and the sorts of their power maybe how that power
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:15.120]  structure works for people i think maybe we need to go over the basics uh basically what our
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:21.520]  solution is it's uh a non-golden silver uh solution that we need to talk about what the
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:27.120]  root of the problem is which is the fractional reserve banking aspect of all this because if
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:33.040]  we even if we cured the Federal Reserve problem we would not uh we would not cure anything if we
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:38.080]  did not fix the fractional reserve problem okay we're going to do that i just don't want to get
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:42.000]  that broken up with calls and i have to go to those i was talking to pat there in the break he
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:47.680]  was saying getting into maybe uh some of the we already covered the history last time but but
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:54.240]  who owns the Federal Reserve uh pat and you jump in bill well the the national banks uh that are
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:26:02.560]  members of the uh um but they're they're members of the federal the national bank uh association
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:09.680]  and their their stockholders of the Federal Reserve banks in their regions so um there's
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:15.120]  five major banks that on the majority of stock in the Federal Reserve so they essentially control
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:26.560]  it and you're talking about you know city bank chase organ uh watch ovia bank of america and uh
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:32.080]  collectively they have over half of the deposits in the nation in their banks they employ over one
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:39.440]  million people directly working for their banks and uh they actually own the stock of the Federal
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:44.320]  Reserve banks it is not owned by the u.s. government and most of your listeners know that and that's
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:49.840]  closed stock too i can't go out and buy that no okay no it's just by law can only be held by the
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:58.000]  member banks and then those member banks appoint the two-thirds of the members of the local
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:04.240]  federal reserve boards uh so they have control of the federal reserve system it's certainly true
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:11.360]  that uh the uh chairman of federal reserve the members of the federal reserve board in washington
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:18.240]  are nominated by the president and confirmed by congress but they have 14 year terms and the
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:25.520]  president can only nominate two every uh can only nominate one every two years so he even a president
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:32.800]  that was resolved to reform the fed couldn't do so until the final year of an eight year of two
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:39.600]  terms eight years eight years altogether so it's it's almost impervious to any form of any of reform
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:43.280]  plus the power of the banks the presidents are generally creatures of it to begin with
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.720]  well it and it some of them probably are aware that they're you know they're beholden to the
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:52.880]  banks and they and they really can't attack it or their political base would rapidly be you know
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:58.160]  disappear under media assault and so forth that's probably true some of them may want to reform it
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:02.400]  but they just know it you know the practical matter it's really impossible for them to do so they
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:07.360]  have to be very heroic they have to be prepared prepared you know to go to war with the banks
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:14.400]  like andrew jackson did and um you know he he fortunately survived an assassin assassination
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:21.120]  attempt uh not so many uh presidents lately or probably that brave and also the fact is it would
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:25.520]  it was a lot easier for him to fight it than it would be now i mean they've been in trench now for
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:31.840]  approaching a hundred years so their media control and so forth is uh you know a much more
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:39.120]  pervasive and difficult and the public can't even find their hind in uh you know in broad daylight
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:44.000]  so you know it did yeah we're in pretty bad shape uh we're about to break but bill your
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:51.840]  any comments on the ownership of the fellow reserve um no i think pat covered it pretty well any
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:57.200]  other facets in a short segment that people need to know about the structure of the fellow reserve
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:03.520]  well just that there is no other solution other than the monetary reform act is presented in the
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:10.240]  the money master's video no amount of financial stimulation of the economy no amount of pumping
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:16.960]  money into our economy is going to work all such attempts are going to just fail and fail again
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:22.800]  we don't have the political will at this point yet to apply the correct solution which is what we
[2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:30.640]  propose and no other solution will work well i have to say this it is the best film out there

[2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:28.080]  for some stations that i know have just joined us or listeners a pat karmak of course has been a
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:35.360]  banker i've been involved in business been involved in oil been involved in utilities found out about
[2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:39.920]  the real monetary system decades ago there's now one of the leading experts on it and bill still of
[2:33:39.920 --> 2:33:44.560]  course i was a newspaper editor found out about all this when a listener when a reader sent him
[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:50.320]  some information and he researched it i started his journey so many of us started out on our journeys
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:55.920]  that way somebody challenged us with some information we think it's bull we look into it and we find
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:00.960]  out that it's not bull it's the real world i know we got some callers that are off topic and i'm
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:07.200]  going to get to you regardless but i know john george collin others um mike and others are for
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:10.720]  the guest so let's get some of those calls out of the way then we're going to get into whatever
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:16.080]  issues our guests want to discuss on monetary system what we're facing how it works and their
[2:34:16.080 --> 2:34:21.040]  solution which i think is the best i've seen out there bar none i and you know i don't just
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:27.040]  toot people's horns unless i really believe it uh and and and it looked good to me 12 years ago
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:32.480]  13 years ago when i first saw it now it that i know so much more and have interviewed so many
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:37.440]  experts uh it seems like the only way out now because the bankers are going to bankrupt us
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:42.320]  and then always offer another solution that gets you deeper into their control
[2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:46.720]  that's why we have to identify them that's why we have to fight them you can't just ignore this
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:50.000]  this affects you whether you mow lawns for a living or you're a rocket scientist
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:55.920]  um let's uh go ahead and talk to john and ohio you're on the guests with the uh folks from the
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:35:03.280]  money masters yes um uh and this uh comment is related but it also branches off into your previous
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:09.040]  guest i think um it would be interesting to have webster tarply on because i think he offers a
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:14.800]  genuinely populist uh genuine leftist he's on next week he's on next week well that's great
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:22.640]  because i think he has uh more than just the calls for austerity uh cutbacks on uh uh uh the the
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.200]  social spending uh which you know other the the uh safety net programs uh and this kind of uh well
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:33.680]  the bankers only offered that to get us under their control and domesticate us now they're
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:38.240]  taking it away from the hogs because it's time for slaughter right but i'm saying under these
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:43.120]  good conditions austerity and cutback would be the hard landing that we all want to avoid
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:49.440]  and i also wanted to point out that i believe that as we head into this uh a mad war at these
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:54.400]  neocons want to bring us into i think people like Jerome Corsi are really two-faced ponies
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:59.440]  because i've heard him recently and over the years constantly pushing all of the kind of ultra
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:04.880]  neocon uh scare mongering about terrorism that got us into the war into iraq and just about a
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:13.840]  month ago on the coast to coast uh he jointly with uh the host was talking about iran possibly
[2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:20.080]  getting a giving a terrorist uh nuclear bombs to plant here and now he's organizing actual
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:24.800]  some of these people that are he calls freedom fighters that you obviously that you obviously
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:31.200]  show are nothing but uh see i run terrorist al-qaeda type terrorist this man is connected i'm
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:35.760]  absolutely certain the secret agents of the government and he talks differently depending
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:41.840]  on who he's with and uh well we mean we bring on serious guests and we just want to get his info
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:46.000]  on obama we're obviously going to be exposing mccain it really makes no difference and i appreciate
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:52.800]  your call john uh what about what he just brought up pat and bill uh the the the the first part of
[2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:59.920]  his comment about uh i mean i guess that brings us to your solutions what yeah what the bankers
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.240]  are offering uh where does that lead us versus what you're saying well actually they don't
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:09.600]  offer a solution it's just more the same what we've got right now is you know we're our deficits
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:14.960]  running over 400 billion a year that's roughly the amount we pay on interest to the national debt
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:21.840]  and so this gentleman was talking about a soft landing and so on versus austerity and everybody
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:28.320]  cutting back and so forth well the problem is we're paying 400 billion a year to the bankers
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:34.080]  and what we have to do is to reform the system so we no longer do that real very put very simply
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:40.240]  we simply need to repeal the federal reserve act rather than borrowing the money the government needs
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:46.480]  to spend the government needs to create it itself principal objection to that is is it would cause
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:52.000]  hyperinflation that's certainly true so if another law has to pass at the same time
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:59.280]  that raises the reserve requirements in banks from 10 to 100 percent at the same time period
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:03.440]  that we're paying off the national debt and by the way people love to say you mean our government
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:08.640]  issues the money that's how it's supposed to work instead of having private banks essentially be
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.360]  the government now with their new fake carbon tax credit the central banks want us to buy
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:19.360]  our carbon credits from them literally taxing breathing right well if i could quote lincoln on
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:25.760]  that uh quote the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:31.280]  to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers the privilege of
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:37.120]  creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government but it is the
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:43.360]  government's greatest creative opportunity close quote abraham lincoln yeah but they've taken
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:49.120]  that engine of creativity and empowering people and turn it into an agent of feudalism and criminal
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:54.480]  consolidation of wealth i can go ahead pat well precisely because rather than the u.s. government
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:39:00.240]  having that power which is appropriate to the sovereign power they've by the federal reserve
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:04.880]  act they've they've got congress to delegate it to private banks it's the very banks we're talking
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:10.720]  about the ones that own the federal reserve so those banks make our money they create it and so
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:17.120]  wealth's being transferred to them at an extremely rapid rate and and to solve this this uh economic
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:22.480]  problem we have we simply have to repeal the federal reserve act or so reform it that that power
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:29.040]  is restored to the government and um that can be done it does not result in any economic
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:36.160]  um hardship in fact to the contrary uh rather than having a recession or a depression uh
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:41.760]  it would restore its economic stability really overnight because it's it's it's simply the
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:47.840]  the functioning the present system that's creating this problem we're in absolutely
[2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:54.880]  anything else on that subject bill well i can give a jefferson quote i wish it were possible to
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:40:00.160]  obtain a single amendment to our constitution taking from the federal government the power of
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:09.280]  borrowing absolutely let's take another monetary comment or question uh let's talk to mike and
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:17.840]  louisiana than kyle mike are on the air hello guys uh i apologize that this question is not
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:25.040]  uh particularly monetary it doesn't matter just go ahead when when the when the people
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:36.000]  uh try to uh to stand up against this tyranny uh i heard last week uh a caller called in
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:46.240]  about a website awrm.org i believe it was i don't have a computer but my understanding was that
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:56.000]  there is in place uh legislation or some kind of whatever to uh go after the uh citizen
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:08.960]  militias and bring them before tribunals and and such as that uh can you speak to that well one
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:13.040]  of the one of the things that's happened good lately is of course you're probably familiar with
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:19.600]  the supreme court ruling with respect to the owning firearms at home are you familiar with
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:26.320]  that that just happened holding the second amendment yes that also uh after katrina i think
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:34.800]  they passed uh legislation here in louisiana that they couldn't confiscate uh firearms uh during
[2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:42.640]  a national emergency my my question particularly is uh last week somebody called in and uh he said
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:48.480]  i think he said it was active duty or something well sir we just covered a bill earlier uh about
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.360]  the homegrown extremist act where they want to monitor and try to restrict free speech but
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:59.360]  the government is a pack of criminals they're illegitimate uh and uh so no i'm not aware of
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.800]  that so i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead and talk to kyle in iowa you're on the air
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:13.600]  hi um i wanted to uh make an observation if i could about uh hyperinflation and what that
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:18.960]  could uh mean for gold and just tell me if i'm wrong if i am but uh i've been studying hyperinflation
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:24.640]  and uh you know like in the weimar republic and uh hungry and so forth when you know prices were
[2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:30.080]  doubling like literally overnight um in a situation where you're already currently holding gold
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:37.040]  if your debt isn't dollars and say the dollars devalued to like a millionth of its original
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:42.640]  but or to what the value is now um or whatever couldn't you then in turn assuming you're able
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:47.840]  to hold on long enough actually pay your debt off for you know pennies on the dollar yeah don't get
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:53.760]  confused they're against a gold or silvered back currency because then it can be manipulated because
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.320]  the bad guys hold the majority of it i don't think our guests will get hear it from them in a minute
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:02.160]  i wouldn't imagine because i agree with them on other issues they seem very intelligent and informed
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:08.880]  we're not saying gold and silver is a bad investment or a bad hedge against inflation
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.080]  right i wasn't going there no okay good so what is your question
[2:43:12.640 --> 2:43:18.240]  well i uh the point is is uh i just i i guess i just want to get is my interpretation of this
[2:43:18.240 --> 2:43:24.320]  correct is that a possibility where you know uh say i bought gold at 650 an hour or 650
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:29.600]  an ounce which i did uh say if we do get new a situation like that um because the most i've
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:34.560]  heard you guys say is like five thousand dollars an ounce for gold now is that a well that's bloomberg
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:38.960]  bloomberg was saying that we're not i couldn't imagine it going to that i mean if that happens
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:44.400]  it means they're going to devalue the dollar to nothing uh but two thousands very easy right but
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:50.640]  i'm but i'm saying in a situation where we do have hyperinflation um even on uh on the scale of
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:56.320]  what the weimar republic had to where you know there were 12 marks of the dollar in 1918 to 1923
[2:43:56.320 --> 2:44:01.360]  is correct me if i'm wrong but wasn't not 4.2 trillion marks of the dollar well i know this
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:06.240]  jim bob way right now has 2 million percent inflation per year let me get a comment from
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:12.480]  bill or pat on that both of you well if i mean the caller is correct if if you're in debt and
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:18.800]  you have hyperinflation and you have some assets and other forms like gold silver land or some kind
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:24.320]  of commodity that's desirable then absolutely you're a beneficiary of hyperinflation at least in
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:28.400]  the short term because you can sell those assets and pay off your debt for in effect pennies on the
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:35.600]  dollar in fact one of the motives and one of the reasons uh that you know inflation is not purely
[2:44:35.600 --> 2:44:41.360]  a bad thing is because the united states is a heavy debtor nation right now so as the dollar
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:46.560]  devalues because we print more and more of it up uh you know we're in effect paying off foreign
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:52.560]  creditors or uh you know a lesser amount so there are there is a silver lining to it in a sense but
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:58.560]  our balance of trade isn't good so it's going to be a worldwide wrecking ball to economies that's right
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:03.600]  yeah long well china's not that's what up with that they're not going to put up with this much
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:07.840]  longer since somebody is going to cut the dollar loose and then they're all going to fall within a
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:14.320]  matter of months it's already starting to happen oh god and i you know i i think both pat and i
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:20.000]  agree with the caller that uh yeah commodities gold and silver are a great investment that's
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:24.480]  just a horrible thing to base a monetary system on yeah well i agree with you and people get
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:28.320]  confused by that i got emails and you're on a few weeks ago going i you i thought you said gold's
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:34.960]  good yes we're saying gold's good we're saying though it is it is too easy to manipulate as the
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.200]  currency or or having something based on that as the currency because the elite know it's valuable
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:45.440]  they've been hoarding the daylights out of it you know there's a there's an interesting
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:51.440]  editorial in the london times right after lincoln instituted greenback dollars which of course
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:57.680]  was a totally fiat currency but since he couldn't borrow money to pursue uh the civil war he had
[2:45:57.680 --> 2:46:02.960]  to essentially uh use the the old-fashioned way that the colonial america did that's just print
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:08.000]  fiat currency and it worked great but uh the bankers didn't like it this was their editorial
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:13.760]  in the london times shortly thereafter if this mischievous financial policy which has its origin
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:19.200]  in north america shall become endurated down to a fixture then the government will furnish its own
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:24.960]  money without cost it will pay off debt can be without debt it will have all the money necessary
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.400]  to carry on its commerce it will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:35.520]  the brains and wealth of all countries will go to north america that country must be destroyed
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:40.720]  or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe yeah that's a famous quote i mean they cannot
[2:46:40.720 --> 2:46:43.840]  allow you to be free ladies and gentlemen or our nation to be free
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:51.680]  you're absolutely right uh bill and in fact i've got a article here the global economy
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:56.640]  is the point of maximum danger london telegraph today they say it feels like the summer of
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:01.680]  1931 the world's two biggest financial institutions have had a heart attack the global currency system
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:07.200]  is breaking down the policy doctrines that got us into this mess or bankrupt no world
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:12.240]  leaders seems to be able to turn the problem let alone for just solution i mean when the
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:16.720]  mainstream media knew we were in this crisis a year ago two years ago they've just been
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:20.080]  forestalling the inevitable and i heard one of you earlier kind of imply that well they'll just
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:25.360]  give us a soft landing by doing this i don't see it as a soft landing i mean i know that
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:30.960]  they see that as their job to try to soften the blow as much as possible there is not going
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:37.280]  to be a soft landing make no mistake we are going down a rat hole world economic whirlwind
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:43.600]  that cannot be stopped the only thing that could stop it is uh the monetary reform act is is merely
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:49.120]  uh starting is having congress issue the money and uh bringing uh the fraction reserve system up
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:54.320]  to zero re in in 100 percent reserve but the elite won't the elite won't allow that because
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:48:01.520]  that would get rid of their power right they'll fight it and nail they will fight it that you
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:05.920]  all you have to do is read what happened during the time of jackson how they they deliberately
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:10.560]  crashed the american economy just to try to bring the political pressure on the president the president
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:16.240]  held firm and he beat them in fact they even tried to get the south to revolt that first time
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:21.600]  but luckily he was a southerner so he could threaten them and explain to them how they were
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:26.480]  being conned but they they were not as savvy in the south a few decades later
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:35.440]  well that's correct uh and of course that um the division of the united states was an absolute
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:42.640]  necessity uh because the country is getting too rich yeah britain didn't like that uh pat
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:49.040]  can you elaborate on um the best case scenario if we had good people at the helm what they would
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:57.600]  do now to extricate ourselves from this certain financial doom well again the the way the system
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:02.960]  set up at the moment uh under the federal reserve act and so forth there's no way out there'd have to
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:10.640]  be uh monetary reform legislation and you know the essence of it would have to be that the government
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:16.640]  creates the money rather than private banks so you're talking about it's just unavoidable
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:22.000]  as bill mentioned have to reform the federal reserve act and take this power back uh under
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:27.120]  the aegis of the government uh otherwise you know ultimately i mean what we're doing is what
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:31.760]  american individuals have done privately they've maxed out their credit cards and
[2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:38.080]  you know the american government uh by borrowing so much money uh in the midst of uh maintaining a
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:44.400]  war and so on has simply run us so far into debt borrowed so much money that you know the dollars
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:50.560]  collapsed so they would have to reverse those policies and at the present time i have not heard
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:56.560]  a single government representative propose anything that would cure the present problem
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:02.800]  that's not on the table anywhere so it shows like this that have to educate the american people to
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:08.160]  generate at least you know the kind of demand i mentioned that did arise in the thirties after
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:13.200]  all when people get poorer and poorer uh they've you know they they want to understand why and
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:16.960]  they begin educating themselves about it and then they when they understand what's going on
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:22.400]  then they want the right remedies and uh so we've got to make sure that the remedy is available for
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:29.840]  them as this implodes and not a false bankers remedy because they will propose a number of them

[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:05.040]  their federal reserve their bank of england was the government when it wasn't another behind the
[3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:10.960]  social engineering the stage wars the stage terror the behind it all their think tanks brag about it
[3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:17.440]  they're behind the cancer industry they're behind all the scams everything they're just a pack of
[3:00:17.440 --> 3:00:24.880]  hardcore ruthless bloody terrorists who are psychopaths see most psychopaths aren't like
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:29.360]  john wane gaze he dressed up like a clown or ted bunny running out and you know in a yellow
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:35.200]  vault wagon they go and they want to wear uniforms go study criminology they want to get power they
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:39.120]  want to become bankers they want to become senators they they want to become generals
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:45.920]  where they can these are controlled discipline psychopaths and they just a wonderland and then
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:50.320]  they've done the public down public's running around drooling literally having no idea what's
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:56.320]  going on if we are unable to warn the people about what's happening they're going to do their purges
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:01.200]  here you know you know we've got this light at the end of the tunnel that our guests are offering
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:06.880]  us and it's a great solution monetary reform act they're proposing and as well researched in reason
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:13.040]  and will work historically and the context of our current problems we face current challenges
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:17.040]  or you got the other lot of the tunnel that that is a freight train and a roll over you
[3:01:17.040 --> 3:01:21.280]  going 100 miles an hour and me you know where they bring in a police state to protect their
[3:01:21.280 --> 3:01:28.960]  criminal consolidation uh most countries are enslaved most countries turn into despotisms
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:35.120]  the elites would rather have a giant mass of third world slaves uh than you know have a free
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:41.120]  market good system that's based on just weights and measures um we're going to continue with Todd
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:46.720]  rick bronco and others but let's start getting into any areas that we've mentioned that that
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:51.840]  took because i talked to you off air pat and some you bill areas that both of you think are important
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:57.920]  i mean you talked about individual things families can do now to protect themselves uh pat uh you
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:03.840]  know what do you have to say uh you know bill not just your monetary reform act but but but but
[3:02:03.840 --> 3:02:11.920]  how do we help individuals now with what we're facing well to me you you've got to draw a sharp
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:20.000]  distinction between uh the fake solutions that are out there and the precise solution that we
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:27.200]  have developed we don't speak in generalities we know precisely what to do this can be instituted
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:32.320]  even in a matter of weeks we say the transition period would take a year but that's just not to
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:39.360]  alarm people in in fact you could institute it very very quickly and put the country instantly
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:45.200]  on a firm financial footing and put a stop to all this stuff you know i i just want to read one more
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:50.640]  link and quote uh with about five months from the end of his life when he saw how they're how the
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:57.040]  bankers were attempting to destroy his attempts at uh government issued money he put it this way i
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:02.720]  see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerved me and causes me to tremble for the safety
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:07.600]  of my country corporations have been enthroned and here are of corruption and high places will
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:12.720]  follow the money powers of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:19.120]  prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:24.720]  is destroyed because after all isn't that the essence of our of our political experiment
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:29.600]  here in america it's it's the essence of the constitution and yet it's never mentioned in
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:36.160]  the constitution it's the separation of powers concept what is that that spreads power both
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:42.320]  political and financial out very broadly among a bunch of people that makes the country the
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:48.720]  government of of this country very unwieldy very slow but that's a good thing it's also very very
[3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:55.280]  safe yet that's what democratizing is all about and that's what's being destroyed by money being
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:04:03.840]  aggregated into a few hands yeah you want that separation of power sorry uh go ahead pat well
[3:04:03.840 --> 3:04:08.880]  i think bill's really gotten to the essence of this the separation of powers was to do precisely
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:14.240]  that because you know we know lord acton's quote that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:20.080]  absolutely and so you know the founding fathers of the united states being quite well aware of
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:25.040]  that and having witnessed the negative effects of the concentration of power in england through
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:30.080]  the bank of england which they were well aware that was the vehicle for it uh they divided these
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:35.600]  powers you know there were senators in congressmen and three branches of government they split it
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:40.640]  all up so that it couldn't be aggregated well that was to buy in the hands of the avarice that
[3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:47.120]  was in the average man they understood that to to to actually use the corruption and wickedness
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:51.680]  fighting with each other to make the object where where the elites would always be fighting with
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:56.240]  each other and it would take so much time to get control that people would die off and so it was
[3:04:56.240 --> 3:05:02.000]  kind of a stopgap that's exactly correct and but but they didn't fully understand
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:07.520]  um money they simply didn't understand monetary monetary theory well so there's some you know
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:13.600]  some fatal flaws uh that weren't addressed you know uh as well as they could have been in the
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:18.560]  constitution and that weak point is precisely where the bankers have focused you know they
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:24.000]  originally used alexander alexander hamilton who was uh you know their agent in the united states
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:29.920]  he was from jamaica originally a lot of people don't know that and uh and back then you know we
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:35.120]  mentioned last i've been five of these struggles against these national banks central banks in
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:40.240]  the united states uh going back early in our history and the most recent one of course being
[3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:47.120]  against this cartel of banks called the federal reserve system uh which basically united the
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:53.920]  major banks into a cabal to you know control the economic uh power of the country but that's the
[3:05:53.920 --> 3:06:08.000]  way they got round the separation of powers bill yes comments on one sure comments on what pat was
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:17.120]  just saying well that's uh that's exactly right uh but i would just urge that uh people beware
[3:06:17.840 --> 3:06:26.400]  as as the political will amongst the populace begins to arise sufficiently so that politicians
[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:34.160]  know that something radical must be done there are already solutions that they i'm sure have
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:40.160]  as contingency plans that are waiting in the wings that they're going to roll out i believe one of
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:48.080]  those is a return to a gold backed money and that's a false solution those people who propose a return
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:54.880]  to a gold back money typically speak in generalities do not speak in specifics because there there
[3:06:54.880 --> 3:07:00.640]  really is nothing specific that you can do gold back money failed during the great depression
[3:07:00.640 --> 3:07:07.840]  we're on gold backed money then that's not the problem the problem is we have to democratize
[3:07:07.840 --> 3:07:14.240]  money as much as possible which means it can only be issued by the federal elected officials
[3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:22.320]  closest to the population yes they're rascals yes they'll print too much money but if that is the
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:28.240]  primary the primary political issue every single year how much money have you printed
[3:07:28.240 --> 3:07:32.560]  then we can we can yes yes yes we have to be in control of it or somebody else with hold on
[3:07:32.560 --> 3:07:41.840]  we're going to come back to the full audience right now here we go
[3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:51.840]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are continuing our discussion with the makers of the money masters
[3:07:51.840 --> 3:08:01.440]  film pat karmak and bill still your phone calls are coming up here in just a few minutes
[3:08:02.720 --> 3:08:08.880]  i want to debate some of the different systems of monetary reform now we see the public
[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:17.520]  tends to think that monetary reform that the word reform itself is good in and of itself
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:23.120]  not that reform just simply means to change the form of if you jump off a cliff and
[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:30.480]  bash into a bunch of pieces at the bottom uh that is a reform is that a good reform the reform
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:34.240]  that i believe that is going to be ran through because they've said it's the one they're planning
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:42.080]  is a uh remodeled ties the dollar under a north american uh larger system tying it into the euro
[3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:47.600]  and then a world central banking regulatory expansion of power and then they're now saying
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:52.000]  this as we said years ago they were this my prediction not hard to predict that they would
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:57.440]  say we've had these problems with bad lenders give give the central banks the big banks the power
[3:08:57.440 --> 3:09:03.200]  to go shut down smaller banks and and and control other groups and different types of lending
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:08.160]  organizations and we'll fix all the predatory lending and they run lots of pr pieces bashing
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:13.280]  little money cashing places and you know smaller loan sharks but never talking about themselves
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:22.080]  and that they're going to have a worldwide system where it's a basket of different scams they run
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:28.560]  but where where where they don't even have a world currency at first they just set in regions
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:35.040]  what they say that currency is worth and then they inflate or deflate but it'll always be inflate
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:40.640]  uh at their leisure for whatever helps them squeeze the domestic population but also to set the
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:46.640]  foundations of a global tax uh and a global regulatory system while they have the regional
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:52.480]  blocks they're going to make you and they've said this buy carbon credits on what you exhale
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:56.240]  even the new york timeset attacks on breathing was the headline a year ago and they're going to
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:10:02.880]  tax you there your car your home new environmental enforcers a new environmental guild uh to carry
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:09.760]  uh to carry all this out so i see that as the system they're going to push now uh it is true
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:14.800]  that ron paul who i agree with on 98 percent of things uh you know he has the kind of the austrian
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:18.320]  school and believes on gold and silver because you can't manipulate it and he says well it'll
[3:10:18.320 --> 3:10:23.600]  always be manipulated if you don't the problem is as our guests say they the globalist own most
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:28.640]  the gold and silver so they can manipulate that too i agree with the power of a fiat currency but
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:34.160]  an educated public about it transparent government getting money out of the equation where it's just
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:41.120]  an agreed upon emotive exchange to accelerate true commerce and business and free market instead of
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:47.760]  always allowing whoever it is to manipulate and control the fiat currency in private hands but
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.560]  so if you want to talk about ron paul's views and and disagree with those that's fine or add to it
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:59.520]  i just think that we tend to get to fight you know monetary researchers and reformers uh arguing
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:09.360]  about the gold system i i i disagree with you uh thinking bill that that it's going to be a gold
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:14.480]  silver system that's pushed we're going to find out real soon we have seen them announce it is
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:20.880]  going to be uh the regional system pegged and controlled by a new global regulatory authority
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:25.840]  with the private banks not just controlling government and and and issuing currency and
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:31.200]  credit liquidity but now becoming world government and then as i said phasing in the global tax
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:35.440]  through the carbon tax and and also carbon credit and trading uh i want to get your comment on that
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:42.240]  bill and then pat point out that uh they have to disguise it so that it doesn't sound like a world
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:49.600]  currency americans will revolt at that uh they uh nations that nations in general yeah it's going
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:54.720]  to be a carbon credit especially in america they will have to disguise as tremendously that's why
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:11:59.440]  i think ultimately this will fail and they'll have to go to some sort of gold standard but i mean
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:05.680]  we're really debating what the basis of uh of monetary of the monetary system is not nearly
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:10.960]  as important as as other basic reforms and and i'd like pat to speak to that he's the expert
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:18.160]  well i i don't know that i'm the expert but it's certainly true that uh the the nature of the
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:24.720]  reserve whether it's gold or silver or some other commodity uh or fiat that doesn't matter
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:32.640]  nearly as much as who gets to create the money that that base is used for as a base so if 90%
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:39.840]  of the money uh is created by private banks and it's a fiat currency that's no worse or no better
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:46.320]  than if they create 90% of the money if the base is gold so a lot of gold uh people who want to
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:52.880]  put in a gold or silver or some other commodity um as the monetary base don't don't understand that
[3:12:52.880 --> 3:12:58.080]  you know that's only a small part of the problem it certainly is true i mean there's something to
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:02.080]  be i don't i don't want to be totally against gold and silver in every respect because as
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:06.560]  you mentioned earlier alex like private ownership is a good thing because you're you know your us
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:11.360]  dollars you're holding your savings account are worthless every day so on a private basis it's
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:16.560]  a good form of uh you know to have some diversification in a gold silver and even other commodities
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:21.600]  for that matter but the fundamental reform that has to happen is fractional reserve banking has
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:26.240]  to be abolished and all that really means is private creation of money has to be abolished
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:31.840]  and another example of that isn't just fractional reserve banking it's banks or even credit card
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:39.280]  companies selling as securities uh bundles of credit card debt i mean that's another form where
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:44.240]  it's not just a classical banks doing it now it's just all sorts of groups running around
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:49.040]  doing it correct now that's absolutely correct there's new forms of money you know credit card
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:54.880]  debt has expanded the money supply outside of the control system of the uh you know fractional
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:14:00.000]  reserve banking so it's just a yeah it's another scam that private banks have created that money
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:05.280]  they created as debt they let you incrementally add to your credit card debt and they simply
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:10.080]  create that you know the government is involved in anyway so that should be abolished as well
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:16.560]  you know ultimately money must be created by the people for their representatives and not
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:22.160]  by these private bankers who are concentrating all wealth in their hands i mentioned last time
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:27.760]  the the un has estimated repeatedly each year how many people own as much as the poorest half of
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:33.680]  the world so roughly three billion people the number's gone from roughly 350 people a decade
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:41.280]  ago to around 200 people now own as much as three billion the three billion poorest that has to be
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:47.680]  stopped and the vehicle that's causing that is private creation of money well i agree with you
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:56.560]  um but but you know earlier you were talking about how you have this uh cabal uh or you have this
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:01.840]  combine um oh what was the particular term you use for the private group of banks that are the
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:10.640]  federal reserve well it's a cartel or a cartel cartel and this really is a cartel and imagine how
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:17.840]  dumb the elite think the general public is that in college and in school and in life it's still
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:23.120]  if you say the federal reserve is private and is a cartel when they describe themselves as a
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:28.480]  cartel when it's founding that that that you're told it doesn't exist and russia lembaugh says
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:34.800]  it doesn't exist now the good news is most people now know that was a lie and a fraud uh but but but
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:41.680]  i mean that's how masterful these people are is that we've now had a 98 year debate about whether
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:48.400]  it's private or not when if it was always private instead instead of do we want private banks
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:52.960]  controlling the issuance of currency and credit which then allows them to buy up the whole economy
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:57.920]  i mean this is like saying can alex jones call himself federal reserve bank of austin texas
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:02.320]  and then i'm the only one you can get money from i mean i would obviously take over the town
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:07.120]  in a matter of years and then they have i mean i you know so many listeners email me and say why
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:13.280]  does this even matter folks this is this is carnival show charlatans that have done all of this
[3:16:13.280 --> 3:16:18.960]  so comment on that pet well yeah it's it's the wizard of boss you throw back the curtain and
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:25.280]  you see you know the reality is there's this rather weak ignorant man who's really manipulating
[3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:30.320]  the whole system with smoke and mirrors and that's what we've got federal reserve sits on the mall
[3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:35.120]  in washington along with all the government building everybody assumes well this is another
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:41.360]  government uh agency and it's not you know it's privately owned and it's for the benefit operates
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:47.920]  to maintain reserve protect this cartel not the american economy you want evidence
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:52.240]  read the paper about what's happening in american economy how many of your listeners
[3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:59.680]  are working 20% less than they did say 10 years ago or 30% less how many of them are less productive
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:05.120]  and so on in other words we're all working harder we're producing more and more yet we're poorer
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:11.040]  the average american is poorer than 20 years ago despite all of our great natural resources and so
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:18.960]  on we have not had natural disasters that account for the economic situation we find ourselves in
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:23.840]  now or this gradual erosion of the middle class we're becoming like the mexicans where they have
[3:17:23.840 --> 3:17:30.720]  triple the resources the u.s has but are totally poor we are getting a dirtbag elite if i could
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:36.160]  break in you know what is what the most outrageous single point that people could take away here
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:43.840]  is is that 99% of the population does not realize that when you go to your bank and you take out
[3:17:43.840 --> 3:17:50.240]  a loan which is 90% of the money in circulation in the united states that money was created out
[3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:56.160]  of nothing they have the monopoly power to just create it out of nothing and then have the gall
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:18:01.440]  to charge us interest on it that's what the system is that's why they're getting rich that's why
[3:18:01.440 --> 3:18:06.720]  we're getting poor we have my loan it to our government the government gives them the right
[3:18:06.720 --> 3:18:12.000]  to print it uh... created electronic keyboards and then they loan it to the government at
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:16.480]  interest and the government's paying over 400 billion in interest well obviously that ought to be
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:22.800]  stopped and uh... it's by the policy of obfuscation of this fact that the public's kept ignorant of it
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:27.520]  how did they do that they use part of that money to buy the media if you look up the ownership of
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:33.200]  the major media in this country since the 1920s it's been owned predominantly by banks it's almost
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:38.560]  exclusive now so the only place you can get the truth about this matter it shows like this one
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:43.280]  on the internet and so forth uh... but that's you know most people take all their information
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:48.800]  from either the major newspapers magazines or tv and now we're kicking the butt of the mainstream
[3:18:48.800 --> 3:18:53.040]  media so the feds are coming out and saying we're going to end that neutrality and basically shut
[3:18:53.040 --> 3:18:57.440]  down the old web and you're not going to have websites you'll have a few thousand establishment
[3:18:57.440 --> 3:19:03.840]  sites that you can visit you know they've now announced that god help us man we got a break here

[3:23:47.520 --> 3:24:05.280]  I wanted to point out that they give the states unfunded mandates
[3:24:06.160 --> 3:24:12.080]  say the feds will fund it for one two three years four years sometimes and then after the
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:15.120]  laws that they get the states to pass with federal lobbyists down here
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:22.000]  to say that the states then have to fund it and so you know they triple quadruple the number of
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:26.080]  police and they're going to go out and write you tickets you go one mile over the speed limit
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:30.400]  they're going to do it neighbor sees you yell at your child they're going to see ps your child
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:35.200]  I mean it's all of a predatory state and the international banks you wonder how it could
[3:24:35.200 --> 3:24:43.200]  be in Germany or Australia or Russia or England or Canada it's all the same laws same names
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:48.640]  it's global and when you read the federal reserve information the club of rome info the
[3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:53.280]  builder bird group trilateral commission it's all this is for the administrative convenience
[3:24:53.280 --> 3:25:00.160]  of the international banks that's their words and so that you wonder why your school's a police
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:05.040]  station you wonder why you're treated like a slave they're getting their property in line
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:12.240]  this is a plantation and you are a slave now it's all done by fraud they just made it up out of
[3:25:12.240 --> 3:25:18.720]  nothing but this is life and death info you know I can't stress pat karmak and bill still
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:24.800]  have you know how this affects people's everyday life I mean the point you were making bill
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:30.160]  about how the banks just make it up out of nothing it's all fraud and they don't want you to pay it
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:35.440]  back that's where they get real assets and people don't understand that can you explain that to them
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:42.000]  99% of the population I'm telling you right now does not realize when they go to the bank and
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:47.680]  take out a loan where that money comes from they just made it up they have they have the right to
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:53.680]  just make the money up and loan it to us at interest and that's why they want a worldwide
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:59.280]  cash flow society because then they're going to outlaw barter and other forms so so that they can
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:06.640]  really reduce money supplies and really rape us go ahead well I've got a 1933 Franklin Roosevelt
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:11.920]  quote this was a letter to a confident he wrote it this way said the real truth of this matter
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:17.760]  is as you and I know that a financial element in the large centers has owned government ever
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:22.800]  since the days of Andrew Jackson that goes to Pat's point about 10 minutes ago
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:30.560]  yeah one of one of the uh one's Milton Friedman made about why is it that we should
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:36.080]  advocate and and Alex you pointed out well if the control of the bankers is so great why discuss
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:41.600]  of these reform measures and all well Friedman offered two reasons one of them is he said it's
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:47.120]  worth the discussing radical changes reform not in the expectation that they will be adopted
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:53.120]  promptly but for two other reasons one is to construct an ideal goal so that incremental
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:59.520]  changes can be judged by whether they move the institutional structure toward or away from that
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:06.320]  ideal there he's he's saying no it may not happen in Jake in a huge reform act it may be many little
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:11.360]  acts that are in response to public demand the other one is the other reason he says is very
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:17.360]  different it is so that if a crisis requiring or facilitating radical change does arise
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:22.640]  alternatives will be available that have been carefully developed and fully explored
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:27.600]  and that relates to what else he said that they already have false solutions prepared
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:33.920]  so when things go awry we're going to hear from the mass media and their experts a lot of
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.800]  false solutions that don't address this problem but Friedman saying no let's make sure that we
[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:45.920]  do know what the proper solution is so that when the time is ripe we know what to do well absolutely
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:53.680]  um i just i still think even some of the audience out there don't realize the stakes here because
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:59.520]  these bankers are making themselves gods forget enthroning themselves i mean they are they are
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:06.400]  just absolutely on power trips and and and bill the squeezing has only begun uh is it going to
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:12.000]  be hard for you to sit there and watch the people carrying out the execution of our economy posing
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:17.280]  as saviors being worshiped on television i know that's always hard on me well i've been watching
[3:28:17.280 --> 3:28:23.200]  it for 14 years now it's just amazing to me that it's taken so long to actually uh get to this
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:30.320]  point but i had no idea that they could really pump so much money into the system uh before it
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:36.640]  collapsed and so that's why it's it's taken so long oh well they wanted us hyper extended i mean
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:41.840]  that's another point here there's a whole system is designed to want to get people in debt that's
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:46.400]  why when you're a you know a guy working for six bucks an hour in college you get a credit card
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:50.720]  three or four times a week in the mail but when you're not in debt you get credit card offers twice
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:57.760]  a year this incentivizes this incentivize that but major banks are making big money off of this real
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:03.360]  estate run up and that's the the major economic factor well exactly i was about to say it incentivizes
[3:29:04.160 --> 3:29:07.920]  getting people in debt and making bad loans which then the taxpayer
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:14.160]  bails out uh let's skip this break let's just keep talking right now with all the colors here we go
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:23.760]  okay i'm going to skip that break folks i do that sometimes i'm here for the info wars dot
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:28.640]  com audio streams and the people watching on present planet dot tv the m and fm listeners
[3:29:28.640 --> 3:29:32.720]  and short listeners do not get to hear these behind the scenes interviews but it's just
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:38.720]  too important to not waste time uh let's go ahead and talk to todd rick bronco and others
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:44.480]  taught in ohio you're on the air with the makers of the money masters yeah i have two questions
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:49.680]  for bill impad at their time uh first question i've been telling people for years that we need
[3:29:49.680 --> 3:29:55.920]  to get free fiat uh money system now the objection that i usually get is that the government is so
[3:29:55.920 --> 3:30:01.200]  untrustworthy that if you gave them this power that uh within a few years you'd have run away
[3:30:01.200 --> 3:30:05.440]  hyperinflation and all these horrible things would happen but they have given the power
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:10.720]  to their private banker buddy so it's even worse with no transparency but uh go ahead
[3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:17.120]  absolutely simple answer very simple answer before go on and that is yes that's true however
[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:22.720]  they are electable and the current people who control the quantity of money in the system
[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:28.160]  are not elect i think the biggest issue is education because the public doesn't know
[3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:31.920]  how this works and that i think is the first that's why you made the film but i'm going to
[3:30:31.920 --> 3:30:37.280]  shut up god go ahead and finish your question yeah well i was going to say the response i
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:42.480]  easily give to that is that uh the fact that the government is is currently untrustworthy
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:48.880]  is uh that no more justifies uh keeping money issuance in private hands than it does turning
[3:30:48.880 --> 3:30:55.360]  the power to declare war over to private companies lia calibur and blackwater but what it does
[3:30:55.360 --> 3:31:00.160]  demonstrate is that we also need election reforms my first question is would you agree
[3:31:00.160 --> 3:31:06.320]  that uh in order for monetary reform to be implemented properly that we as a people
[3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:13.280]  must insist upon a simultaneous reform of our election system well they they own the electoral
[3:31:13.280 --> 3:31:18.240]  process so i mean monetary reform would take care of that whether or not you have to have
[3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:22.720]  the cart before the horse i don't know i'd leave that to the path's better judgment
[3:31:23.680 --> 3:31:28.800]  well i mean obviously both should be worked on simultaneously there's no reason to focus
[3:31:28.800 --> 3:31:35.360]  exclusively on one type of reform when more than one is needed so you know anything that
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:39.280]  will make it a more democratic process that's that's fine and we should work for that at the
[3:31:39.280 --> 3:31:44.640]  same time we should work for monetary reform you know if i can say something else this in a way
[3:31:44.640 --> 3:31:52.240]  this boils down to whether or not you are a believer in your in democracy or plutocracy if you believe
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:59.840]  in democracy you have to believe that the electoral electoral process can work correctly and so
[3:31:59.840 --> 3:32:05.840]  therefore the elected representatives of people should have the most important power of government
[3:32:05.840 --> 3:32:11.440]  according to lincoln namely the monetary power in their hands if you don't believe in elected
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:17.440]  government then you believe in plutocracy which is the current system whereby the bankers make
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:24.000]  their own rules about how much money they can create yeah there's the other another element
[3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:28.880]  of it too it's you know not all politicians obviously are equally corrupt i'll tell you what
[3:32:28.880 --> 3:32:35.280]  pat stay there stay there we're coming back out of the main audience here we go
[3:32:39.040 --> 3:32:43.280]  it's very simple we have private banking families and not your bank down the street
[3:32:43.280 --> 3:32:47.040]  the big banks jp morgan chase
[3:32:49.440 --> 3:32:53.280]  and a few others the Rothschilds the Rockefellers that's who owns the stock in those
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:57.040]  companies that's who dominates the controls that private stock
[3:32:58.960 --> 3:33:04.960]  they are cold-blooded they are predatory and so we can debate what monetary reform we want
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:12.160]  their reform is more mega control world regulation world tax on carbon just totally going from
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:16.800]  them out of the frying pan into hell i mean you know getting deeper into their system kind of
[3:33:16.800 --> 3:33:21.440]  like a bubble constrictor eating a monkey saying here i'll help you let me just get your tail
[3:33:21.440 --> 3:33:26.960]  finally down my gullet instead of the monkey you know trying to fight its way out uh so
[3:33:28.160 --> 3:33:32.240]  we can debate this all day long we were just now talking behind the scenes there for info wars
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:35.360]  dot com stream listeners you got to go to the streams folks we're listening on another stream
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:39.040]  on the web somewhere you're not hearing the behind the scenes stuff you got to go info wars dot
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:45.840]  com and listen to those streams we were just now discussing that and i i i mean it's a no brainer
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:50.240]  the central banks the private families own most of the golden silver it's a great investment you
[3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:54.400]  need to be in it because that beats the fiat currencies but the problem is if they come up
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:34:00.640]  with that monetary reform of now oh let's get off that and go to this that puts us right back
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:07.840]  under their control now i disagree with uh bill still is a very smart guy i mean certainly he's
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:13.280]  right about that and they could propose it but i have already seen them propose the regionally
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:18.160]  controlled uh with a world authority over all banks and financial institutions and
[3:34:18.160 --> 3:34:23.120]  to introduce you to the tax oh it's a carbon environmental tax that they don't want to call
[3:34:23.120 --> 3:34:29.360]  a tax but you buy it from the central banks so that's it we know what they're going with the
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:36.720]  next big global bubble uh that that will be the final bubble uh is controlling and taxing all
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:41.920]  carbon that is put off by all carbon based life forms so this is taxing you to breathe
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:46.480]  you're going to have your own bureaucrat assigned to you that inspects your home on a monthly basis
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:50.880]  i mean it's so hellish what they it's not my opinion so when this all happens don't say oh my
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:56.640]  god alex you were psychic again it's all stated uh so we're having some debate are are you still
[3:34:56.640 --> 3:35:02.960]  there todd uh i mean try to finish up your point of what you're trying to say well actually i'd
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:08.320]  finish my first uh point uh my second point has to do with inflation which you talk about a lot
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:13.040]  and i often hear it implied though it's never really stated in so many words that
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:18.560]  the problem with our current dollar crisis monetary crisis is that we have too much money
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:23.760]  chasing too few goods well i happen to have a copy of the truth and money book which is quoted
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:28.160]  in the money master's documentary right and uh one of the key phrases
[3:35:28.160 --> 3:35:35.040]  is yeah i used is that right or you're still there yeah it's a great book
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:40.720]  yeah what i was going to say is one of the key phrases in there is that we have a quote
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:45.840]  built-in shortage of money and quote and the reason we have a built-in shortage is two reasons
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.040]  uh number one is whenever the uh the bank loan is repaid or the principal of a bank loan is
[3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:59.520]  repaid that money vanishes it's uncreated and uh the second reason yeah but that's why they always
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:05.120]  want more debt right but the interest the money needed to pay the interest is never created
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:11.040]  and and and so if everyone got out of debt all the money supply would vanish but there would still
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:15.920]  be billions and on and on all this compounding interest debt so we have a built-in shortage
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:20.320]  of money and so that's why i'm always arguing with people that hiking the interest rate
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:24.240]  is a false solution because that's just going to drive the wedge even further between the
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:29.200]  outstanding interest debt and the money that's out there to pay it off that's right long term
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:35.760]  that's not a fundamental solution at all uh or even a partial solution well that's right yeah
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:42.880]  yeah you're correct and uh so again what needs to be done is uh that our money needs not to be
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:49.760]  created by private banks that we must borrow so that it's created as a you know as with an
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:54.720]  equivalent amount of debt for which you're also correct there isn't also money created for the
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:37:02.080]  interest so right away there's a shortage of money in the uh general economy because it's all
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:07.120]  bearing interest you know it has to be paid by someone yeah so we have to be a musical
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:13.200]  system yeah so we have to abolish that system and it has to be created not as debt but as
[3:37:13.200 --> 3:37:20.240]  it's the act of the sovereign state and i used simply to pay for the goods and services the
[3:37:20.240 --> 3:37:27.920]  state needs uh for the benefit of the common good for the general population well uh one last point
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:31.680]  at this time uh case you didn't know somebody mentioned the uh Wizard of Oz earlier i think it
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:37:36.640]  was bill uh there's a book out called uh web of debt by ellen brown came out last year and in that
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.000]  book she talks about how the Wizard of Oz or the original book that was written not the movie uh was
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:46.880]  actually an allegory for monetary reform yeah that's correct the ruby slippers were actually

[3:41:18.800 --> 3:41:24.240]  and i still enjoy it for reference but anyway uh it beat ralph epperson's book out by about three
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:29.920]  months right right well it uh it certainly helped me a lot and i still have it and uh
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:37.680]  it's one of my permanent pieces there um let's see uh you know that monetary reform act that goes
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:41.600]  back over 10 years now right that's in the end of your film i've seen your film at least a dozen
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:45.760]  times by the way and i love it and i've showed it to dozens and dozens of people it's amazing
[3:41:46.640 --> 3:41:50.560]  everybody gets a monetary reform act and they say okay well what happened what happened
[3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:57.120]  yep yeah pat wrote it about 12 years ago pat's an attorney and uh so he's the intellectual brains
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:42:04.080]  behind this operation so i mean basically it's it's one of the good ideas that's uh you know uh in the
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:11.440]  you know in the in the run for uh hopeful reforms someday right well that's right
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:17.120]  well yeah and the never never has we have we had such a chance at you know political pressure build
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:22.400]  at such a point where reform is now for the first time possible yeah rick thanks for the call what
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:29.440]  did uh how did ron paul or have you ever talked around paul receive your ideas pat uh well i've
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:34.240]  tried to meet with him i went i spoke went out and spoke to a conference of his in phoenix
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:37.760]  what about a year ago specifically because i thought he was going to be there so i could
[3:42:37.760 --> 3:42:43.680]  talk to him personally we've visited his office uh he's never met with the space to face you know
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:48.320]  there's a lot of folks claim ron paul's going to be places when he's not uh that's a problem out
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:51.600]  there so when he really does actually come to an event a lot of folks don't show up thinking well
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:55.280]  i thought it was another one of the events where they just claim he's going to be there uh let's
[3:42:55.280 --> 3:43:00.800]  talk some about the film in detail because you know we mentioned it's a great film but for
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:06.000]  those that haven't seen the three hours plus uh and just don't know this is a whole history
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:11.280]  and all the incredible interviews tell folks about the basic rundown of the film uh you
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:16.560]  know either one of you pat or bill and then uh break down uh some of the you know list some
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:20.880]  of the people you interviewed for this i mean this was uh you know tell us about the making of it
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:31.520]  well it basically goes through the history of fractional reserve banking uh from time immemorial
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:38.880]  from the time of christ actually is when we start and uh it just builds a case it's the same thing
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:43.520]  over and over and over again through history and then when we get to american history you can start
[3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:50.080]  quoting franklin and uh jefferson and madison it's the same thing they eventually these people
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:57.200]  there are people in every generation who figure it out and it's the same thing and it just builds
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:44:02.800]  i believe an indisputable case for what we're trying to put across that the only solution
[3:44:02.800 --> 3:44:08.880]  for this problem is to take the power to create the quantity of money in this country away from
[3:44:08.880 --> 3:44:14.080]  the private bankers which is the situation we have today and place it into the hands of the
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:20.320]  congress of the united states yeah going back even to the time of caesar there were you know
[3:44:20.320 --> 3:44:26.080]  there were petitions who has bill said that they understood that if they could get the power to
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:31.440]  create money i mean you know there's there's even uh uh you know fairy tales about it like the goose
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:36.000]  that led the golden egg you know and we've talked men to go back with the wizard of oz and so forth
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:41.520]  it's people understand it's not a hard concept if i have the if i'm the only fellow in the country
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:46.400]  that can create money and i can create it on a keyboard or with a printing press and i'm gonna
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:51.360]  ultimately control the whole country so if what you're after power then that's the vehicle to do it
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:54.400]  and people have understood this over and over again as soon as they understand it they don't
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:45:00.160]  want anybody else to understand it well tell the viewers some of the people that well in fact since
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:03.920]  you raised that as soon as people understand it they don't want anybody else to understand it
[3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:08.400]  that's what's so ridiculous of all the founders and all these different presidents and lincoln
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:15.200]  and jackson and and wars and editorials in the national banking association 100 years ago saying
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:20.800]  too many americans read buy up the newspapers dumb them down i mean it's all public to anyone who's
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:26.400]  informed but then we have a population 100 years under their brainwashing who can't even find iraq
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:31.360]  on a map but say kill them all you know they don't understand they're the target of these bankers too
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:35.520]  and these bankers got sold on eugenics 100 years ago so they're carrying that out everywhere that's
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:40.720]  another issue i cover an in game it's just this is everything this this and then to be called
[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:46.240]  conspiracy theorists because you can read newspaper articles from the time of andrew jackson
[3:45:46.240 --> 3:45:53.120]  well it's a it's a pocketbook issue the reason you don't have as much money in your pocket right
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:58.400]  now as you did 10 years ago is because of this issue if you don't like that then you should you
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:03.920]  should watch the video and figure out how to fix it there's a simple fix for this problem that's
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:08.720]  what's so incredible is you guys really do have a beautiful plan and it really does work and it's
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:13.440]  what our government is designed to do it's what's in the constitution it's what the founders first
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:19.200]  did uh what julia caesar did for god's sake that's what the roman empire was let's see we just can't
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:24.880]  have that we've got to let some dirtbag scammers run and rule and make us slaves and i know a lot
[3:46:24.880 --> 3:46:29.520]  of listeners are just saying you're laughing right now a lot of neocons are listening a lot of liberals
[3:46:29.520 --> 3:46:34.160]  you just can't wake up the government's not your mommy and your daddy and you've got to wake up that
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:38.560]  uh you know the federal reserve is at your pally well and and you're just not going to figure it
[3:46:38.560 --> 3:46:44.080]  out and so i just want you later to know that we i guess you know sometimes i think we don't have
[3:46:44.080 --> 3:46:48.160]  hope but we actually do have a lot of hope a lot of people are waking up it's just so obvious does
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:54.240]  it ever make you want to tear your hair out uh bill and pat to to to know how obvious and simple
[3:46:54.240 --> 3:47:00.400]  this is but that business people i talked to maybe you run into it just can't grasp it well
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:05.600]  actually business people often do when when you explain it to them but you know again this this
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:10.480]  money has been used to control the media and rather than reading books as we did a hundred years ago
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:16.000]  in this nation and uh you know reading perhaps hundreds of books if not thousands in a lifetime
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:24.240]  most of the information we now get is from three or four news massive news media so the the
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:29.200]  means of controlling the information to the average american has been radically
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:36.240]  uh made easier for the bankers and that's one of the things that um you know we have to deal with
[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:42.000]  now is there is that the media is so limited uh now fortunately again there's these alternative
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:48.160]  media but they reach obviously a smaller percentage of the people well you're right that's why we need
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:54.080]  more and more i realize as i said 12 years ago pirate fm as it's known micro fm you know 10 watts
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:48:00.240]  100 watts picking up satellite feeds of shows like this uh but it's a handful of people that are willing
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.920]  even though most of the time you never even get a civil letter from the fcc as long as
[3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:10.160]  you're not interfering with other stations especially in rural areas it's very easy to do
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:14.400]  they're not willing to step up and they don't understand the animating contest of liberty
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:19.520]  it's also exciting and fun to stand up against this scum let's take another call let's talk to
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:28.560]  bronco in toronto go ahead bronco hello yes bronco how are you alex good uh going from
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:35.360]  canada i was just wondering uh you're talking about the the influence of uh the u.s. economic
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:41.520]  meltdown and the fed um you have your same private bank up there is the uh or your guest to uh
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:48.000]  the uh influence in canada like here i'm just seeing uh gas prices rising much like in the states um
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:53.040]  um you know food prices have gone up uh the real estate bubble here hasn't collapsed yet well let
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:58.560]  me tell you why you think you're not on the dollar you're on the loony so why is it gone from below
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:05.440]  the dollar past the dollar you know parity and now past it about 70 of the fuel increase is is
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:10.400]  dollar devaluation and the rest is speculation on dollar fears you see worldwide everyone's
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:14.640]  rushing into commodities because the world reserve currency is dying and everybody's trying to
[3:49:14.640 --> 3:49:20.240]  quietly go to their dollars before it collapses and so that's the main thing driving that and
[3:49:20.240 --> 3:49:25.360]  that's what's hurting your economy but uh i mean is that your opinion guy yeah you know there's a
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:31.600]  there's a great canadian who discovered the truth his name was jerry j g e r r y mcgear
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:38.960]  in about 1935 uh he was in the parliament and uh he he fought at the bank uh tooth and nail and
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:45.200]  just just go to google and look up jerry mcgear and some of his quotes uh he was a wonderful
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:49.680]  canadian and he knew the truth uh this is one of his quotes they were the men interested in the
[3:49:49.680 --> 3:49:54.240]  establishment of the gold standard and the right of the bankers to manage the currency and credit
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:49:58.880]  of every nation in the world with lincoln out of the way they were able to proceed with that plan
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:04.160]  and did proceed with it in the united states within eight years after lincoln's assassination silver
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:09.440]  was demonetized and the gold standard money system was set up in the united states and he goes on and
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:14.160]  on he's just he was so right on stay there stay there bronco i want to let you talk some more

[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:44.320]  certain uh predict how long it will last is very perilous it's hard to know because it
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:49.280]  does involve the political order at that point it has to do with whether or not there's wars going
[3:55:49.280 --> 3:55:54.720]  on or whether or not new wars happen and so on and that i can't predict but it appears wars
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:55:59.840]  will accelerate that but you know regardless who knows what's going to happen uh 30 seconds uh
