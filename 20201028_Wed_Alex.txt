[00:00.000 --> 00:11.900]  All right, the only way I'm going to be able to cover all of this is to remain very, very
[00:11.900 --> 00:16.720]  calm and get it out to you, but let me just tell you right now, I've been on air 26 years.
[00:16.720 --> 00:20.200]  This is the biggest, most important news we've ever covered.
[00:20.200 --> 00:22.440]  The quickening is here.
[00:22.440 --> 00:27.120]  We are five and a half, six days out from the most historic election, and the deep state
[00:27.120 --> 00:30.800]  criminal actors are going to try to overthrow the president, claiming that he lost, even
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.600]  though all the evidence coming in is just going to be a landslide.
[00:35.600 --> 00:44.840]  I'm not complaining, but if I seem a little off today, I clench my teeth when I sleep,
[00:44.840 --> 00:49.960]  and I crushed one of my wisdom teeth right down the middle four days ago in my sleep.
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.440]  I tried to ignore it, turns out it was already had a problem from me crushing it previously.
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.440]  I just totally cracked it.
[00:57.440 --> 01:00.840]  I had an abscess in my jaw.
[01:00.840 --> 01:04.680]  Worst pain in my life, worse than the compound fracture I've had, worse than being in car
[01:04.680 --> 01:05.680]  wrecks, you name it.
[01:05.680 --> 01:11.680]  I ignored it because I don't take opiates to have kind of an allergic response to them,
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.640]  but the pain is so bad, I went ahead and got the prescription fill they gave me when they
[01:15.640 --> 01:21.200]  extracted the tooth yesterday, and I'm a little juiced up on that right now, so we're
[01:21.200 --> 01:25.800]  going to see how this goes here today, but I had to be on air today, so I'm here just
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.560]  once you know I'm a little under the weather as they say.
[01:29.560 --> 01:38.440]  Also this news is so incredibly huge that it's staggering, so if you ever called your
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.920]  neighbors, your friends, your family, your next door neighbors, people that live a street
[01:42.920 --> 01:49.240]  down that you don't even know, if you ever did anything like that, you need to do it
[01:49.240 --> 01:52.800]  again, and if you've never told folks about the show, you really need to.
[01:52.800 --> 01:58.280]  You need to take the live feed from infowars.com and newswars.com and band.video and show them
[01:58.280 --> 01:59.960]  the number one you know.
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.680]  We're blocked on Twitter to share band.video, they blocked that URL, and so we created 2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.920]  Now they're blocking that URL, but we have a new URL that we'll put on screen that can
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.240]  be shared to be able to get this information around the sensors.
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.000]  Now that's electionnight.news.
[02:19.000 --> 02:30.040]  All I can tell you is this country is fighting for its life, and when we come back from break,
[02:30.040 --> 02:35.040]  I'm going to do my very, very best job to lay out what I have been told and what I have
[02:35.040 --> 02:40.520]  discovered and just providence how it works, the types of individuals that have been contacting
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.520]  me.
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.040]  We're talking about folks that work directly for the president high level.
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.320]  We're talking top talk show host of the country.
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.680]  We're talking high level patriots that are in intelligence agencies.
[02:52.680 --> 02:58.000]  We're talking about people very close to the president.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.200]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.640]  And we're talking about folks in the Justice Department that are patriots as well.
[03:03.640 --> 03:14.720]  They have all separately texted me and called me to give me intel in the last 24 hours.
[03:14.720 --> 03:16.560]  Now that's because a quickening is happening.
[03:16.560 --> 03:22.360]  I was getting these calls before the Joe Rogan podcast that we taped on Monday, aired yesterday
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.320]  or went out yesterday, but obviously that accelerated it, and a lot of these people were calling
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.720]  me to get my opinion on things and my take in to get my intel.
[03:31.720 --> 03:38.500]  But separately, they all gave me the same intel, which I can separately confirm myself
[03:38.500 --> 03:43.960]  and that when you're tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, a lot of times though,
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.720]  you're already looking for what's coming next that finally when what you've said is coming
[03:47.720 --> 03:49.800]  happens, you're not on the spot.
[03:49.800 --> 03:52.520]  So people are kind of asking me, why aren't you on this?
[03:52.520 --> 03:54.440]  Don't you know about this?
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.840]  And I do know about all this.
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.160]  It's just that, again, when you're so close to a problem, sometimes it's the same as being
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.800]  far away.
[04:01.800 --> 04:06.800]  So I'm trying to juggle all of this information and I'm going to try to be as judicious as
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.960]  I can to lay it all out for you when we come back.
[04:09.960 --> 04:17.040]  But we have just shocking, absolutely horrifying information, but also very, very positive information
[04:17.040 --> 04:19.280]  on what it's triggering to happen.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.280]  But that said, Biden is not giving up.
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.040]  He's been basically given the chance to not contest the election and engage in fraud,
[04:27.040 --> 04:30.000]  or they're going to release all the pedophilia and they've got the videos, they've got the
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  photos.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.160]  As we were told two weeks ago, it's all true.
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.840]  And now it's starting to be released.
[04:34.840 --> 04:37.400]  So this is insane.
[04:37.400 --> 04:41.240]  This is like two freight trains coming at each other at a hundred miles an hour apiece.
[04:41.240 --> 04:42.240]  It's going to be explosive.
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.400]  I just, you better pray to Jesus, I pray to Jesus, because we're living in one insane
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.400]  time.
[04:48.400 --> 04:51.520]  All right, you're going to get the biggest data dump ever on the other side.
[04:51.520 --> 05:18.800]  Stay with us.
[05:18.800 --> 05:24.200]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content
[05:24.200 --> 05:26.840]  across all media platforms.
[05:26.840 --> 05:30.920]  They blocked you from sharing band.video on social media.
[05:30.920 --> 05:38.440]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[05:38.440 --> 05:46.640]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID vaccines, Bill Gates and Big Pharma.
[05:46.640 --> 05:54.120]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[05:54.120 --> 06:21.040]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[06:21.040 --> 06:26.400]  I've been on air 27 years, but a lot of people came before me and even gave their lives to
[06:26.400 --> 06:33.440]  fight for the very hour we have now entered, America, a much left of Western civilization
[06:33.440 --> 06:38.720]  and Christianity, awakening to how desperate our straits are and rallying to fight back
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.360]  and winning.
[06:41.360 --> 06:47.160]  The tide is turning October 28th on this Wednesday edition, six days until we're the middle of
[06:47.160 --> 06:51.600]  election day, 84 days until the inauguration.
[06:51.600 --> 06:53.400]  I am so honored to be here.
[06:53.400 --> 06:55.760]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:55.760 --> 07:02.480]  No amount of powerful music could even accentuate how incredibly historic, life-changing and
[07:02.480 --> 07:08.640]  quite frankly dangerous the times we're all in together on spaceship Earth.
[07:08.640 --> 07:14.160]  Okay, here's the headline and I guess I should just lay it out right up front very simply
[07:14.160 --> 07:17.400]  and then walk into all the evidence.
[07:17.400 --> 07:22.720]  Global Exclusive, more than 40 news organizations now have Hunter Biden laptop and confirmed
[07:22.720 --> 07:28.960]  pedophilia and we'll be going over some of those already breaking it, who have the WAVOS
[07:28.960 --> 07:31.720]  rancheros.
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.320]  Here's the gateway pundit, exclusive, which just means they have the nerve to put it out.
[07:36.320 --> 07:44.080]  Hunter Biden pictures of himself, this robe exposed with a young girl, let's just say
[07:44.080 --> 07:51.520]  below the age of 15 and of course it's going to turn out it's a family member, these little
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.160]  trophy photos they send around, dad of course approves and we've already known this but
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.160]  it's all coming out, just like what broke two days ago.
[08:00.160 --> 08:04.440]  Hunter Biden crying about how he works for the Chinese spy chief and the Chinese spy
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.360]  chiefs angry with them because the Southern District of New York is investigating them
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.360]  for espionage.
[08:10.360 --> 08:14.520]  Oh, by the way, they're not blocking that on Twitter right now because that would be
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.400]  Twitter being part of espionage, same thing with Facebook.
[08:17.400 --> 08:21.200]  I noticed it's being left up there because it's real, just like the laptops, just like
[08:21.200 --> 08:22.200]  all of it.
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.520]  Now that's just a little schmidgen of what's coming up, up front, an hors d'oeuvre as
[08:26.520 --> 08:28.960]  they say.
[08:28.960 --> 08:34.920]  Now, I'm going to explain this this way.
[08:34.920 --> 08:40.600]  A lot of times, again, we're tomorrow's news today, next year's news today and so we've
[08:40.600 --> 08:45.080]  already covered this so much and already knew about this that I psychologically, once it's
[08:45.080 --> 08:51.040]  all finally breaking spectacularly, barely cover it or cover it some but don't talk about
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.760]  what it signifies and what it means and how dangerous it is and what the next steps are
[08:54.760 --> 08:58.280]  going to be from both sides.
[08:58.280 --> 09:00.320]  This is spectacular.
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.320]  It's not just his laptop, it's recordings of him, it's other data, it's his sister's
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.040]  information, it's information coming in from Ukraine, it's all of this information.
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.640]  Since the Office of Personnel Management hack, what was it, seven, eight years ago, when
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.400]  Obama gave the chai comms and their own globalist network the names of 22 plus million, American
[09:22.400 --> 09:29.760]  intelligence, law enforcement and their families, social security numbers, dates of birth, driver's
[09:29.760 --> 09:35.320]  license numbers, files, personnel files, that was given to the globalist to be able to roll
[09:35.320 --> 09:38.400]  up America and take us down.
[09:38.400 --> 09:43.040]  When that was confirmed, that was the last straw in major groups loyal to the republic
[09:43.040 --> 09:48.560]  and the common sense, who don't want to be run by the communist Chinese, who aren't insane
[09:48.560 --> 09:54.800]  satanists, these aren't even really heroes a lot of them, they're just not criminals,
[09:54.800 --> 10:00.760]  they began to use all the back doors and systems that big tech, working with the globalists
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.640]  and the chai comms using their stuff, they began to grab up all the data of Clapper and
[10:06.640 --> 10:13.360]  Brennan and Obama and the Clintons and Hunter Biden and all of them.
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.800]  So this has all been vacuum cleanered up.
[10:17.800 --> 10:23.120]  This is stuff far worse than what's on the laptop that was found in Delaware at the
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.920]  Mac shop, but just like when the DEA has information illegally, they will parallel construct and
[10:28.920 --> 10:33.240]  open a new investigation where they find the same info, you're just seeing parallel construction
[10:33.240 --> 10:39.000]  right now by Giuliani and everybody with just stuff they've got that's over the top and
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.520]  here's the key.
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.560]  They have come to them months ago and then again two weeks ago and said we don't care
[10:44.560 --> 10:47.840]  if you death threat us, we don't care if you have hit teams following us around, this is
[10:47.840 --> 10:52.480]  Giuliani and others, we don't care if you're spying on our phones, we don't care what you're
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.600]  doing with all your operatives after us like Barat and the rest is foreign scum, it's foreigners
[10:58.600 --> 11:01.920]  all allied to bring down America.
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.760]  We don't care, we've got it all and we're going to release it on you because you're
[11:04.760 --> 11:08.480]  chai comm operatives and for the betterment of the country in the world, we'd like to
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.200]  not have to release all this, you better put up a real candidate that didn't part of the
[11:12.200 --> 11:15.480]  Clinton-Obama crime syndicate, you better run one of the few Democrats that did the
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.440]  criminal and you better be fair and square and stop your one-sided deals to screw America
[11:20.440 --> 11:27.040]  and stop operating as foreign assets, they didn't stop, they only intensified operations.
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.400]  Hutzpah, bravada, whatever you want to call it and so now all of this information is coming
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.960]  out, Hunter on tape working for the Chinese spy chief, Hunter with a bunch of naked little
[11:39.960 --> 11:45.680]  girls and you know, they figured out, well, it's bad enough that we show him raping 12-year-old,
[11:45.680 --> 11:51.960]  10-year-old Chinese girls and slapping them around, but how about we just release the
[11:51.960 --> 12:00.200]  stuff on his niece and her cousin and so it's being released, everyone will marvel who's
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.480]  the girls, blur it out on this and then you're going to learn who they are, now we told you
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.920]  that last week, now it's coming out and notice Biden isn't stopping, none of them are stopping,
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.800]  they've used the U.N. they control, the Chinese they control, the media they control to lock
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.160]  the country down under martial law, claiming it's COVID-19, it's all a giant fraud, somebody
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.320]  dies of pneumonia or cancer, somebody dies of HIV, you know, car wreck, they say it's
[12:23.320 --> 12:29.040]  COVID and this is their martial law, that's why Newsom says you don't get to have Thanksgiving,
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.680]  that's why the British say you don't get to have Christmas, but Black Lives Matter can
[12:32.680 --> 12:37.680]  ride the street because you're under martial law so that if they kill Trump or they kill
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.400]  Boris Johnson or somebody else or kill Bolsonaro, the whole shadow government can come in and
[12:42.400 --> 12:51.200]  use the martial law of COVID as the cover for real martial law, so this information,
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.920]  and I already knew this, I already saw all this, but I started getting calls yesterday
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.640]  from high-level people saying, Jones, you've been ahead of the curve, you realize it's
[12:59.640 --> 13:06.720]  all come out, they're not denying the laptop's real, more info's breaking and the big news
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.160]  is, is that Biden isn't giving up, he doesn't care, and they're planning something big,
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.840]  terror attacks, race riots have already activated, God knows what's going to happen, but they're
[13:16.840 --> 13:23.920]  not giving up, and so they're going to just start releasing all the child porn with the
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.480]  Bidens and others, him producing child porn, him collecting child porn, they're going to
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.240]  start putting the big Biden business partners on Fox television, which they've now done
[13:34.240 --> 13:41.320]  with Tony Bobolinski, I mean, it's on, ladies and gentlemen, it's on, it's on, and then
[13:41.320 --> 13:48.200]  I found this out, and the way this works is people call you up, they tell you info, and
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.480]  then of course you're not supposed to talk about it or say who it is, but two separate
[13:53.480 --> 14:00.680]  high-level individuals called me, and they said, basically, you need to be careful because
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.680]  they're tapping everybody's phones, and here's an example of where there, there's all these
[14:06.680 --> 14:11.000]  Hunter laptops and all these Hunter recordings that are verified, confirmed, with witness
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.520]  packages of people that receive the emails over there know what happened, so the media
[14:14.520 --> 14:21.640]  can even call sources that confirm it that are well-known, and the Obamas and the Clintons
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.600]  and the Biden crime syndicate backed up by the Chinese in all our major cities, but New
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.560]  York and LA are the worst, and Seattle, San Francisco, not the Chinese people, they're
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.000]  great American citizens, most of them are Chinese commerce operatives, they are listening
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.720]  to everybody's phones tracking your locations, you got to turn your locations off, and I've
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.200]  been warned to turn my location off, and I'm, don't worry, I've got my location, I put
[14:46.200 --> 14:52.240]  it inside a privacy pocket, because for my own safety coming up on election and after
[14:52.240 --> 14:57.480]  it, and because of the tracking, people that are being sent this information by members
[14:57.480 --> 15:08.080]  of US intelligence that are loyal to America are having an intercepted at FedEx, USPS,
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.720]  and UPS, and so imagine this, you put the hard drive, or you put the thumb drive in
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.840]  with all the evidence, you mail it to a major newspaper, a major TV network, a major talk
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.240]  show host, and let's say it's mailed from one big city to another, this is really
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.760]  going on, people are breaking into it, and this is confirmed by the security companies
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.480]  at the major shipping companies, and these are ongoing investigations, it's happening
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.320]  to everybody, and I was separately in the room and another national talk show host
[15:39.320 --> 15:44.440]  had US intelligence on the phone, offering them the entire thing just a few days ago,
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.320]  so it's on folks, America's fighting for its life against the chai comms and their
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.560]  collaborators had analyzed every possible angle, and the globalists are going to lose
[15:52.560 --> 15:57.720]  this even if they set nukes off, it's over New World Order, it's over.
[15:57.720 --> 16:03.040]  Six months ago, the highly respected former head of the Rockefeller hospital, virology
[16:03.040 --> 16:10.240]  department, went public and said, the mainline science on virology is, you cannot protect
[16:10.240 --> 16:14.880]  somebody from a virus like this, you have to wait till there's herd immunity, and there's
[16:14.880 --> 16:20.560]  never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses, they do not work, well
[16:20.560 --> 16:25.160]  even Bill Gates now admits, oh the vaccine will really never work, but you have to keep
[16:25.160 --> 16:29.720]  social distancing and wearing masks, they're now saying forever, last week it was 10 years,
[16:29.720 --> 16:35.080]  now it's forever, see how the power grab works, so when you hear them saying, Trump is surrendering
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.480]  and his chief of staff is surrendering to coronavirus, when they say we just have to
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.520]  learn to live with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and of course
[16:43.520 --> 16:49.000]  zinc, that's the reality, that's not fear mongering, that's not giving in to the power
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.800]  grab and the endless fear of the New World Order, they've created a problem to which
[16:52.800 --> 16:57.040]  there is no solution, but they are again the people that say they've got to be in charge.
[16:57.040 --> 17:11.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:11.840 --> 17:25.840]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened, because we are effective.
[17:25.840 --> 17:34.680]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share, support the
[17:34.680 --> 18:00.720]  information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[18:00.720 --> 18:26.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.200 --> 18:45.160]  Well, my friends, if you ever wondered what it would look like to have a bunch of foreign
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.400]  powers that have infiltrated our government, our media, and we're trying to take over the
[18:50.400 --> 18:54.560]  United States so they could dominate the planet, if you ever wanted to know what it
[18:54.560 --> 18:58.920]  would look like when America woke up to it, was fighting for its life, that's what you're
[18:58.920 --> 19:02.960]  seeing right now, and that's why things are spectacular, that's why big tech is losing
[19:02.960 --> 19:08.040]  the fight to suppress all this, and I'm here to tell you, from the estimates I've been
[19:08.040 --> 19:12.240]  told by very trustworthy people that have been great sorts in the past, they have not
[19:12.240 --> 19:21.400]  released one tenth of one percent of the incredibly damaging information on the Bidens, on the
[19:21.400 --> 19:26.440]  Clintons, on the Obamas, on the Hollywood people, I mean, if you think Weinstein going
[19:26.440 --> 19:33.360]  to jail and you think the head of the maximum cult just getting convicted and then getting
[19:33.360 --> 19:39.320]  a hundred and something in your sentence yesterday, that is all a message of these chai-com trader
[19:39.320 --> 19:41.640]  pieces of filth.
[19:41.640 --> 19:47.280]  It's over for you.
[19:47.280 --> 19:51.160]  And America sees through you dirty rats.
[19:51.160 --> 20:00.480]  I mean, now publications are publishing Hunter Biden with 14 naked year old girls.
[20:00.480 --> 20:03.680]  These are sick people.
[20:03.680 --> 20:09.160]  It's all coming out.
[20:09.160 --> 20:13.320]  And here's the thing, if it needs to come out, but really over the top stuff that's even
[20:13.320 --> 20:16.800]  worse than this over the top, it's going to come out.
[20:16.800 --> 20:25.600]  And there's nothing Sundar Pachai and Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and Tim Cook and
[20:25.600 --> 20:29.480]  all the other little chai-com minions can do about it.
[20:29.480 --> 20:33.960]  If you go ahead and kick in your Internet kill switch, you go ahead and selectively
[20:33.960 --> 20:37.520]  try to ban everybody, you go ahead and try to trigger your race riots, you go ahead and
[20:37.520 --> 20:38.520]  do it.
[20:38.520 --> 20:39.520]  You're dying.
[20:39.520 --> 20:48.240]  Look at this headline on infowars.com, global exclusive, more than 40 news organizations
[20:48.240 --> 20:57.120]  now have Hunter Biden laptop and confirmed pedophilia.
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.120]  Alex Jones is confirmed with top journalists, individuals very close to the president, U.S.
[21:02.120 --> 21:07.240]  intelligence agencies, and will deliver the motherload of information, such as destroy
[21:07.240 --> 21:08.640]  the deep state forever.
[21:08.640 --> 21:16.560]  Now, I could play you, Bob Olensky, now on Fox News with all the documents, all the recordings,
[21:16.560 --> 21:20.640]  all the proof of them working for China and him not being part of it, when Chinese intelligence
[21:20.640 --> 21:26.760]  approached him and said, you work for us now, and he said, I'm a Navy officer retired with
[21:26.760 --> 21:30.120]  a high level security clearance.
[21:30.120 --> 21:31.200]  I love all the Q people.
[21:31.200 --> 21:34.800]  They mean well, and a lot of them are doing good work, but like the Q priests are like,
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.800]  hey, he said Q, that means that comes out of British intelligence and then U.S. intelligence
[21:40.800 --> 21:44.760]  uses that as a Q level security.
[21:44.760 --> 21:45.880]  That's 70 years old.
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.240]  That's why they call the guy Q and James Bond, but it's so cute, the Q folks like, look,
[21:50.240 --> 21:54.680]  he said Q, he said Q, yeah, that's why the Q person calls it that, meaning high security
[21:54.680 --> 21:55.680]  clearance.
[21:55.680 --> 22:02.800]  Next will be Q had birth of George Washington, but I'm not going to digress.
[22:02.800 --> 22:05.920]  I love folks getting excited about the Q thing and learning about the new world order and
[22:05.920 --> 22:06.920]  all that.
[22:06.920 --> 22:11.280]  It's a good, healthy thing that's going on, but see Bob Olensky actually was an officer
[22:11.280 --> 22:15.040]  in the Navy and did have a high level security clearance and did work with the Bidens and
[22:15.040 --> 22:16.440]  has released the evidence.
[22:16.440 --> 22:21.320]  He's a real person, so we're talking about him.
[22:21.320 --> 22:32.080]  Not random people claiming things shadowy, but continuing, here's the big news story.
[22:32.080 --> 22:38.680]  More than 40, as of last night and this morning, major news organizations have not just the
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.760]  Hunter Biden laptop with all the child porn that the New York Post said a week and a half
[22:42.760 --> 22:45.720]  ago they can't publish, it's a child porn.
[22:45.720 --> 22:49.360]  And then we went off with Giuliani and others that had seen the laptop said and the media
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.480]  is like, Jones is making it up that there's girls that look like they're 12 year old being
[22:54.480 --> 22:57.640]  roughed up on the videos and he's just making it up.
[22:57.640 --> 22:58.640]  Oh, really?
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.480]  Oh, and they also said the laptop's fake.
[23:00.480 --> 23:03.080]  It doesn't exist either.
[23:03.080 --> 23:05.920]  That didn't age well, did it?
[23:05.920 --> 23:09.800]  Like media matters, 10 days before it came out in court, I said day one, looks like this
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.000]  militia that was planted a kidnap Governor Whitmer, the police state lady, had just been
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.480]  overturned in the Supreme Court with her lockdowns.
[23:16.480 --> 23:19.800]  I guarantee you the leadership will end up being FBI informants that led the thing.
[23:19.800 --> 23:34.360]  Turns out they were exactly as I said, but not hard to do, ladies and gentlemen, not hard
[23:34.360 --> 23:35.360]  to do.
[23:35.360 --> 23:37.360]  Look at some of these blurred out photos of your TV viewer.
[23:37.360 --> 23:41.760]  You don't want to see it, don't look, but there's some of the stuff that the Gateway
[23:41.760 --> 23:47.760]  Pundit has published, breaking exclusive Hunter Biden pictures himself, disrobed and exposed
[23:47.760 --> 23:55.920]  with a certain minor, with a little kid, looks like they're about three feet tall, word is
[23:55.920 --> 24:01.320]  this child's as young as 11 years old, he admits in emails to doing things naked with
[24:01.320 --> 24:07.040]  his 12-year-old niece, reportedly, but Hunter Biden picture of himself, disrobed and exposed
[24:07.040 --> 24:13.120]  with a certain minor.
[24:13.120 --> 24:15.760]  And so that's what's going on with these people, man.
[24:15.760 --> 24:21.000]  These are some sickos and that's why they've been picked for carrying out the treason against
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.040]  common sense in America and a Christian country because they hate goodness.
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.040]  They love evil.
[24:27.040 --> 24:28.400]  They love being compromised.
[24:28.400 --> 24:35.680]  They love being involved in absolutely horrible things and it's all coming down.
[24:35.680 --> 24:43.360]  It's all unfolding and still Biden and the deep state doesn't quit, doesn't give up.
[24:43.360 --> 24:48.440]  You know, last week we had a guest on who said word is Jeff Zucker is about to be fired
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.440]  by next week.
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.280]  You can call that guest back and see where they got that info because it turns out in
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.480]  hearings we learned that Jeff Bezos is thinking about buying up CNN and then propping up that
[25:00.480 --> 25:02.480]  reanimated corpse.
[25:02.480 --> 25:03.480]  It just never ends.
[25:03.480 --> 25:07.720]  I guess he can buy everything, buy up the grocery stores, make us take self-driving cars,
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.840]  have his wealth go up $80 million since the COVID lockdown because people can only shop
[25:11.840 --> 25:17.160]  with him because he's essential, you're not and you follow the orders and so he rules
[25:17.160 --> 25:18.160]  you.
[25:18.160 --> 25:19.320]  They wrote all this up.
[25:19.320 --> 25:22.920]  They had all this planned out and it's truly disgusting.
[25:22.920 --> 25:25.000]  Roger Stone joins us in the second hour.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.520]  I want to open the phones up now and then.
[25:27.520 --> 25:35.800]  I'm going to walk through a lot more of this but I want to take your calls at 877-789-2539
[25:35.800 --> 25:43.560]  for first-time callers specifically on this information that the media has this, the New
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.920]  York Post got it, they're scared to publish it but it's not just the laptop, it's even
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.600]  more like Hunter coming out on that tape that was released saying I met with the Communist
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.880]  Chinese spy chief, I'm under criminal investigation on the Southern District of New York, what
[25:57.880 --> 25:58.880]  are we going to do?
[25:58.880 --> 26:10.160]  We're all crying and whimpering, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, see when I cry it's for tears
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.640]  of joy and appreciating people not in fear.
[26:13.640 --> 26:19.040]  When he cries it's because he can feel the fires of hell lapping up towards his little
[26:19.040 --> 26:27.520]  satanic spirit, 877-789-2539 and we will take your calls on this situation.
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.800]  I've got some other huge news that ties into all this and the Big Joe Rogan podcast set
[26:31.800 --> 26:36.720]  to top our previous podcast that is the biggest in history, very, very exciting, they're trying
[26:36.720 --> 26:40.400]  to suppress it, they're not letting it trend on YouTube and though it's the number one
[26:40.400 --> 26:46.480]  show in the last few days and so much more and there's a lot going on there and it ties
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.720]  into everything else that's unfolding, they'll all want to stay with us today, there's a
[26:51.720 --> 26:57.840]  lot more coming up on the other side, I want us to sink in, I want to sink in real good
[26:57.840 --> 27:03.360]  and to everybody listening including my own brain, this lockdown is incredibly sinister
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.400]  and has already started 2 million people to death, it is designed to incrementally be
[27:07.400 --> 27:14.080]  slowly tightened down around our necks, they are never going to release it, that's why
[27:14.080 --> 27:19.120]  Trump coming out and saying we cannot quote beat the virus by staying locked up, we have
[27:19.120 --> 27:23.160]  to get herd immunity, it's not as deadly as they said, it's so important because this
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.520]  is a UN, Bill Gates, globalist deployed corporate takeover where their businesses are all essential
[27:29.520 --> 27:35.880]  but our businesses aren't, this is destroying the world economy by design, this is economic
[27:35.880 --> 27:41.000]  warfare, this is war crime and now they're coming with the attempted forced emaculations
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.600]  that Gates is pushing, well you know what that is, that violates the Geneva Convention,
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.320]  the Nuremberg Code and so much more, please spread the words, please tell folks about
[27:51.320 --> 27:58.680]  bandot video and the facts that are posted there, finally the stagnant republican establishment
[27:58.680 --> 28:03.200]  understands what info wars understand, what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump
[28:03.200 --> 28:10.520]  understands, we are in a digital civil war, there are giant filters filtering out 99%
[28:10.520 --> 28:16.360]  of communication going on on every major tech platform and now they're doing it to the
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.160]  private apps, they're doing it to text messages, they're doing it to email, this is mafia
[28:21.160 --> 28:27.680]  organized crime election meddling, but finally when they blocked Hunter Biden and the barisma
[28:27.680 --> 28:32.440]  information and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the
[28:32.440 --> 28:37.320]  rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied it, finally Congress got
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.680]  pissed and said this is out of control, you've got to stop it now, we're taking action, oh
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.400]  injectors went, oh it's a mistake, it's an accident, it's an accident, but they keep
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.160]  pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff, well info wars is calling their
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.200]  bluff and I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[28:54.200 --> 29:00.920]  In January and February of the year 2020, the communist super state China working through
[29:00.920 --> 29:07.000]  the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID,
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.720]  social distancing, permanent mask, apps that track everywhere we go and what we do, contact
[29:13.720 --> 29:20.240]  tracers come into our doors with the police and dragging us away, this is the authoritarian
[29:20.240 --> 29:25.880]  medical tyranny takeover and it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying
[29:25.880 --> 29:31.600]  no, already foushee and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the
[29:31.600 --> 29:38.320]  lockdowns are permanent, Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions
[29:38.320 --> 29:44.280]  are raised, by then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery
[29:44.280 --> 29:50.200]  and it will never end, this is the authoritarian takeover, everyone must resist, everyone must
[29:50.200 --> 29:57.800]  speak up, everyone must say no now.
[29:57.800 --> 30:10.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:10.800 --> 30:20.800]  It seems like yesterday, it seems like yesterday, but it was long ago, but it was long ago,
[30:20.800 --> 30:24.800]  they didn't have contact tracers coming to our door, spending the rest of it, Jane it
[30:24.800 --> 30:34.800]  was long ago.
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.320]  The globalist got control of society, they turned the colleges into police states, they
[30:39.320 --> 30:44.100]  took over the Internet and put in communist Chinese level censorship and they made their
[30:44.100 --> 30:51.160]  move against society, but humanity woke up as it does so many times, way down on the
[30:51.160 --> 30:56.320]  scoreboard but battling back in the nick of time. Okay, here we are, ladies and
[30:56.320 --> 31:01.400]  gentlemen. And I was just covering the huge news that over 40 major news
[31:01.400 --> 31:05.880]  organizations have the Hunter Biden laptop, him admitting he worked for
[31:05.880 --> 31:10.040]  Communist Chinese intelligence from other sources, eyewitnesses coming
[31:10.040 --> 31:13.840]  forward, more eyewitnesses coming forward, business partners on record that
[31:13.840 --> 31:20.400]  have the facts confirming the emails that are in the laptop and others that
[31:20.400 --> 31:25.640]  were from his phone, and the media, the control corporate media has signed on to
[31:25.640 --> 31:30.640]  that incredible evil to cover it up just like they make fun of people that say,
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.960]  oh, there's a big child trafficking problem. And then meanwhile, they have all
[31:34.960 --> 31:39.360]  these shows on Netflix and HBO promoting pedophilia. This is a group of arrogant
[31:39.360 --> 31:42.880]  people that believe they're invincible. They're trying to overthrow our once-
[31:42.880 --> 31:49.520]  great republic, but humanity's waking up. Now, that said, you've seen a massive
[31:49.520 --> 31:56.320]  push and a call to have Joe Rogan taken off Spotify or to have him get in some
[31:56.320 --> 32:01.600]  type of trouble for having yours truly on right after he had Kanye West on. It's
[32:01.600 --> 32:08.440]  a big national news story. Let us cry and moan to Spotify as Alex Jones appears on
[32:08.440 --> 32:13.920]  Joe Rogan podcast. Here's one independent Spotify criticizes for Joe Rogan
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.440]  interviews conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. Newsweek, Alex Jones on Joe Rogan
[32:19.440 --> 32:24.480]  podcast sparks outrage. People canceling their Spotify accounts. Oliver D'Arcy
[32:24.480 --> 32:31.560]  singing in here is the Spotify Joe Rogan giving Alex Jones a platform at the
[32:31.560 --> 32:37.160]  Spotify platform Jones back in 2018. So there wasn't censorship in 2018. They
[32:37.160 --> 32:41.520]  claimed I made it up. Though they censored me and 50, 60 plus tech groups all
[32:41.520 --> 32:51.160]  banned me in the same week. But now they use that as an excuse saying Joe Rogan
[32:51.160 --> 32:55.760]  can't have me on. So they're not censoring what they are, but here's
[32:55.760 --> 33:00.000]  where it gets interesting. In these newspapers, the London Independent and in
[33:00.000 --> 33:08.400]  other U.S. papers, they say Jones must be taken off. He claims that Bill Gates
[33:08.400 --> 33:13.320]  funded vaccines gave children polio. I showed the AP article and Jones claims
[33:13.320 --> 33:21.040]  80% of people in one Bill Gates funded vaccine trial got sick 20% went to the
[33:21.040 --> 33:28.400]  hospital, the 80% and Jones even claims some vaccines made 100% sick. Now,
[33:28.400 --> 33:32.800]  ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to play you the clips of Bill Gates himself
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.120]  saying it. Then I'm going to show you mainstream news admitting it. But see,
[33:37.120 --> 33:41.440]  that's them telling you, oh, it's no big deal if you all get sick. It's okay if
[33:41.440 --> 33:45.200]  people in the trials have been dying. But when I go out and talk about it,
[33:47.200 --> 33:51.360]  I'm not allowed to because I'm the bad guy. They're not trying to be platforming
[33:51.360 --> 33:54.720]  because I'm lying. They're trying to be platforming because I predicted all of
[33:54.720 --> 33:58.080]  this and laid it out and they're scared to wear their criminal plan. Now,
[33:58.080 --> 34:01.760]  they're working with the chai comms to overthrow this country. And now all of
[34:01.760 --> 34:08.000]  their plan is burning down in flames. This is the end, my friend, of our
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.600]  elaborate plans. And so their system is burning down. They don't know what to
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.560]  do. It was supposed to absorb America. It was supposed to bankrupt America.
[34:16.560 --> 34:19.280]  It was supposed to defeat it. And so they're launching all their weapons,
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.760]  the COVID lockdown, the martial law, the race war, but people are seeing through
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.040]  them and it's beautiful. Look at some of these other tweets.
[34:27.040 --> 34:34.800]  Alex Jones posted death threats against me. This is Nancy Pelosi's daughter.
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.440]  He called the Sandy Hook a hoax and harassed morning families. Let's analyze that.
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.640]  Hey, lady, put up or shut up. You've been staying for years. Even on Fox News,
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.600]  you called for my arrest saying I death-threaded you. Where is the video or the tweet?
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.160]  Didn't do anything. I said you were a traitor for trying to have people become
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.760]  faithless electors and not give Trump his inauguration four years ago.
[34:59.760 --> 35:07.120]  I said you're a traitor. You're a sack of globalist garbage trying to steal an election.
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.760]  That's what I said. I didn't say somebody should kill you. You lying monster.
[35:13.440 --> 35:16.960]  And you're a corrupt mother that's perched on this country for decades and sold us out to China.
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.440]  You are an enemy of the Republic. That is not a death threat. That is the truth.
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.680]  I never sent people to harass people's families. I'm sick of them saying I did that.
[35:27.680 --> 35:31.840]  So I've come out and explained what I did, but they never let it go because they're liars.
[35:33.040 --> 35:36.720]  Alex Jones posted death threats against me. Show it, lady. If I said that about you,
[35:36.720 --> 35:41.200]  I'd show a link. He called Sandy Hook a hoax and harassed morning families.
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.280]  Now he's lying about hashtag COVID vaccine. This hate speech is not just vile. It's dangerous.
[35:47.280 --> 35:56.320]  What the H Spotify? Here's another one. Nathaniel Bernard, another great blue check mark.
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.560]  Joe Rogan says kids earning polio from taking vaccines. No, the Associated Press did the UN does.
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.960]  After Alex Jones spread conspiracy that Bill Gates is trafficking in vaccines that get 100%
[36:06.960 --> 36:13.840]  of people sick. Well, I'm going to show you after we play this clip, mainstream news articles,
[36:13.840 --> 36:20.560]  Atlanta Business Journal, you name it, AP, you name it, saying 100% and one of his trials did get
[36:20.560 --> 36:27.520]  sick, but 80% of the others. But here, hear it from Bill Gates on CBS. First, let's hear where I
[36:27.520 --> 36:34.400]  said it on Joe Rogan. Then let's go to CBS. Here it is. Bill Gates was on CBS news and he said 80%
[36:34.400 --> 36:40.560]  of the people get sick. Yeah. And 20% of them go to the hospital. No, it's two vaccines. They said
[36:40.560 --> 36:48.000]  one vaccine, 100% got sick and a certain percent went to the hospital. The other 80% got sick and
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.160]  20% of those. And sometimes that does happen even with a flu vaccine, right? Like sometimes people
[36:52.160 --> 36:57.600]  get a little sick. I swear to God, you type in Bill Gates grilled by CBS. I'll bring it up.
[36:57.600 --> 37:04.480]  Pull up AP Bill Gates polio vaccine. But that's a coronavirus. He said polio vaccine.
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.920]  All right. Okay. Now I'm pissed. I'm going to tell you the headline. It was, uh, we'll see if
[37:09.920 --> 37:18.240]  there's a polio. Hold on. What was the headline? Particle. It was, uh, UN, UN vaccine causes polio.
[37:18.800 --> 37:27.120]  UN vaccine causes polio. Okay. UN vaccine causes polio. Google is not going to show you shit.
[37:27.120 --> 37:34.000]  Google is compromised. Can you just ask Jesus, please? UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan was
[37:34.000 --> 37:41.760]  caused by oral vaccine. Yeah. Whoa. It's not good. New polio outbreak in Sudan is caused by
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.240]  oral vaccine and this, look at that kid's face. Oh my God. Is that a terrifying image?
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.120]  The image of them distributing that look at that poor kid's face. Imagine that kid getting polio
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.600]  from that vaccine. They're just, he looks so terrified. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, that's tragic.
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.920]  Oh, then a bunch of them died, but Jesus Christ. Hold on. Hold on. Back up. Back up. Back up.
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.520]  Let's stop there. Let's stop there. I'm going to come back and play actually Bill Gates saying
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.000]  all of this himself, but imagine they're telling Joe Rogan with the biggest show in the world right
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.920]  now for English speaking information. He can't show AP articles and he can't show CBS articles
[38:19.920 --> 38:25.200]  because we're simply bringing a bigger audience to the fact that they in fine print are admitting
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.880]  all this. Now there's Nancy Pelosi's lying daughter saying, I'm making all this up and I'm death
[38:30.880 --> 38:37.680]  threatening her and I'm harassing people. None of it's true because she's the lying sack of crap
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.360]  daughter of the biggest lying sack of crap in the house of representatives.
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.320]  Unbelievable. She was organizing the group to not get electors to be faithfully execute
[38:50.320 --> 38:56.080]  the electoral college and put Trump in power after the people elected him and I said she's a
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.440]  traitor. So she went on Fox News and said, I want him arrested and we learned the justice department
[39:02.080 --> 39:06.160]  was pressured Loretta Lynch before she left to have me arrested. But Loretta Lynch looked up her
[39:06.160 --> 39:11.760]  claims and said they weren't true. They had a DOJ investigation into me. This came out in the news
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.920]  over what she said. Her lying mouth is like the word of God because she's such a lying fraud.
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.280]  It's like, oh, you're an online fraud? Let's go with that. But when we come back,
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.840]  I'm going to show you Bill Gates saying 80% got sick in one trial, 20% of those with the hospital
[39:27.840 --> 39:37.200]  and then another trial, 100% got sick. 100, 100, 100, 100, 100%. Do you think I just go up on TV
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.640]  and make stuff up? I don't want to make stuff up, but if I did, I'd be destroyed. I just take you
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.960]  the hardcore stuff they're hiding in plain view. There's their Satanist and under beneficial law
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.280]  that got to hide it to find print. I assume in on the fine print. The red button.
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.960]  Triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[40:22.960 --> 40:29.760]  inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high
[40:29.760 --> 40:36.400]  EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and
[40:36.400 --> 40:43.520]  activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[40:43.520 --> 40:50.080]  about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member
[40:50.080 --> 40:56.640]  or yourself at InfowarsStore.com. As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out
[40:56.640 --> 41:02.080]  from the election and the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.120]  and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge populace for alignment. And so they've openly
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.800]  said we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[41:12.800 --> 41:18.480]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that once
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.760]  they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us
[41:23.760 --> 41:29.600]  and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama
[41:29.600 --> 41:35.760]  bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi saying. This is their
[41:35.760 --> 41:41.680]  stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and
[41:41.680 --> 41:46.320]  force denoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.840]  voluntary. Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.280]  and tell your family to vote now. CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.760]  false headline that Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus. It's the opposite. He's not
[42:01.760 --> 42:08.320]  surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science that it's incredibly deadly and that
[42:08.320 --> 42:14.080]  we have a chance of eradicating it. Bill Gates, Fauci and the UN have said we will always wear
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.920]  masks. We will never shake hands and even the vaccines won't protect us forever until the
[42:19.920 --> 42:27.520]  civilization as we know is over until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated. That's
[42:27.520 --> 42:32.320]  impossible. That's right. They're trying to say they have never cured to the common cold. That's
[42:32.320 --> 42:39.440]  what COVID-19 false positives for on the test. They created a problem that can never be defeated,
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.160]  but of course they're the ones in charge of the problem. And so they stay in power forever and
[42:44.160 --> 42:50.160]  take control of society with contact tracers now going with the police to people's doors in Texas
[42:50.160 --> 42:57.040]  at gunpoint and taking force samples. We must say no. Introducing in full war's life pure
[42:57.040 --> 43:04.880]  turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.560]  with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the
[43:10.560 --> 43:15.920]  stomach and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the
[43:15.920 --> 43:20.960]  remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.440]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated and our first product got rave
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.600]  reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months. Some of our staff like it more than
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.960]  bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[43:34.960 --> 43:40.400]  and so much more and they fund the M4. So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively
[43:40.400 --> 43:48.080]  at m4store.com today. An additional 25% off. This is a 360 win. Turmeric is renowned for what it does

[44:18.080 --> 44:26.320]  This is the end. My only friend, the end.
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.560]  But during the vaccine sound concerning, we looked. After the second dose, at least 80%
[44:32.560 --> 44:39.120]  of participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers.
[44:39.120 --> 44:50.400]  So are these vaccines safe? Well, the FDA not being pressured will
[44:51.760 --> 44:58.000]  look hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard of regulators and their current guidance on this,
[44:59.200 --> 45:08.800]  if they stick with that, is very, very appropriate. And, you know, the side effects were not
[45:08.800 --> 45:15.360]  super severe. That is, it didn't cause permanent health problems for the things there. They,
[45:15.360 --> 45:22.800]  you know, Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose and so, you know, to get the antibodies.
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.640]  Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're
[45:29.200 --> 45:35.600]  most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet
[45:35.600 --> 45:42.880]  that you don't have side effects. You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects,
[45:42.880 --> 45:50.800]  that's, you know, way more 700,000, you know, people who will suffer from that. So really
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.960]  understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know, pregnant,
[45:56.960 --> 46:04.880]  male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard. And that actual decision
[46:04.880 --> 46:11.360]  of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved
[46:11.360 --> 46:18.400]  because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.
[46:19.360 --> 46:26.800]  So, I went on the biggest podcast in the world where I already have the two largest previous
[46:26.800 --> 46:30.160]  record ones. It's already on track. I talked to Joe last night. It'll be the biggest one he's
[46:30.160 --> 46:34.400]  ever done. They're thinking probably 50 million. It's number one on iTunes. They're blocking it
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.080]  from the top. It's number one on YouTube. They're blocking it from the most trending, but it's still
[46:38.080 --> 46:46.480]  the top video. And all I did was say what you just saw. But see, I'm saying that's not good.
[46:46.480 --> 46:51.200]  He's like, oh, it's no problem. Even though the studies show it's killing people. You got to go
[46:51.200 --> 46:55.440]  to DuckDuckGo to find it though. Google's merged with Big Pharma, so it doesn't work anymore.
[46:55.440 --> 47:03.040]  DuckDuckGo, go to DuckDuckGo and type in patients die in COVID-19 trials. Healthy man dies in COVID-19
[47:03.040 --> 47:09.360]  trials. A seven die in healthy COVID trial. And you hear about it, this third world country,
[47:09.360 --> 47:15.680]  that third world country, they're killing people with these. There's one with the flu shots, death
[47:15.680 --> 47:20.160]  after flu shots in South Korea. Fan fears, but authorities find no link. Oh, yeah, everything's
[47:20.160 --> 47:24.960]  fine. That's not the one. You got to search DuckDuckGo. They're using Google in there.
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.360]  Brazil confirms death of volunteering COVID-19 vaccine trial. They've died here. They've died
[47:29.360 --> 47:36.480]  in England. They've died in Germany. There it is. So that's what's going on here. Now,
[47:36.480 --> 47:39.760]  I said I'd go to your calls, Roger Stone's on about 15 after next hour, but I'll start going
[47:39.760 --> 47:46.560]  to your calls here in just a few minutes. But let me just show you these tweets again.
[47:46.560 --> 47:52.880]  This is Christine Pelosi and everything she says here is a lie. And she's quoted all these
[47:52.880 --> 47:58.800]  newspapers that I posted death threats against her. Wow, that's defamation. But please show me,
[47:58.800 --> 48:05.680]  you lying monster, that a harass people's families didn't do that. And then I'm lying about COVID
[48:05.680 --> 48:11.760]  vaccines. And her surrogates come out and say, I say wrongly that 100% of people get sick from
[48:11.760 --> 48:18.320]  all the vaccines. Now I said with this particular one, let me show you the news articles about that.
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.400]  Bill Gates thinks these three coronavirus drugs could cut the death rate. And you actually get
[48:24.400 --> 48:30.960]  into all these articles. And it lays it out here. Here is the Atlanta business journal Gates tries
[48:30.960 --> 48:37.200]  to justify side effects of fast track vaccine 100% of Moderna vaccine participants suffered side
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.840]  effects. And I've got a whole bunch more of the same headlines. And it's in the studies.
[48:42.720 --> 48:49.120]  That is out of the Atlanta business journal. There's another one out of the libertarian hub.
[48:49.120 --> 48:53.520]  There's AP UN says new polio outbreak and sedan caused by oral vaccine.
[48:56.240 --> 49:00.640]  He experiences a very actual Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. He's still a believer, though,
[49:00.640 --> 49:13.520]  all this crap. So did I lie to you? No. Did I lie to you, baby? Did I tell you something that wasn't
[49:13.520 --> 49:20.080]  true? Let me tell you again, baby, that I lie to you. All right. Let me tell you what's coming up
[49:20.080 --> 49:23.840]  and then start going to your phone calls. There's so much I haven't even hit yet coming out on
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.800]  Hunter Biden and on Biden and just bombshell information. Such an incredible time to be alive.

[51:15.840 --> 51:20.880]  go back to 25% off soon because we're getting close to selling it out. And then we go back to a
[51:20.880 --> 51:28.240]  closer to regular price until more gets in. Black Friday in October will end on Sunday.
[51:28.240 --> 51:34.240]  And we have a new sale. It won't be as big across the board, but it's what you just heard. It's
[51:35.280 --> 51:41.200]  bio true selenium and it is body's ultimate turmeric formula. That will be the new sale.
[51:41.200 --> 51:46.240]  But the things are so crazy. I'm just bringing you that next week's sale. Now both sales can buy
[51:46.880 --> 51:50.480]  free shipping, triple Patriot points. Triple Patriot points will go away next week. Rarely do
[51:50.480 --> 51:56.480]  that. That's 15% off your next order. Usually it's 5% with a sale. It's 10%. You sign up for
[51:56.480 --> 52:02.480]  auto ship on your next order. Canceling time for free. An additional 10% off at infowarstore.com.
[52:02.480 --> 52:05.600]  You're not just getting great nutraceuticals and great products and great t-shirts that spread the
[52:05.600 --> 52:11.680]  word like a rest fouchy and Bill Gates and mask free zone. But you're also funding the Second
[52:11.680 --> 52:16.720]  American Revolution worldwide with folks that deliver the truth, deliver the goods and don't
[52:16.720 --> 52:23.360]  back down. I can have 102 fever. I'm on air. I can have, you know, infection in my jaw and a
[52:23.360 --> 52:27.840]  wisdom tooth pulled out last yesterday afternoon. I'm here because I want to be here. I want to be
[52:27.840 --> 52:34.560]  in this fight. I'm so honored and I'm so thankful for you keeping me in the fight. So I salute you.
[52:35.680 --> 52:40.640]  We've got the globalist as we knew clamping back down that falls getting here. Now admitting
[52:40.640 --> 52:46.480]  10 year lockdowns, 100 year lockdowns, banning Thanksgiving, banning Christmas and all their
[52:46.480 --> 52:52.000]  evil fetid leftist areas. These are sick, evil, chai, calm front people that are all been
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.400]  compromised. Newsome's on the Chinese payroll. They're all on, they're all criminals. They're
[52:56.400 --> 53:00.880]  all foreign agents. It's all coming out. They're all going down. All these old smiley face psychos
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.840]  game over, but they're going to go kicking and screaming. Look at these headlines. Governor
[53:06.400 --> 53:11.920]  California Newsome announces draconian rules for Thanksgiving. UK police force says it will
[53:11.920 --> 53:18.240]  break up Christmas gatherings and force COVID rules. Any lockdown protest erupt across Italy.
[53:18.240 --> 53:23.760]  And I've got all these videos of medical doctors coming out and saying it's all a fraud. It's all
[53:23.760 --> 53:28.960]  exaggerated hundreds of times what it really is. It's a control system. It's evil. It's causing mass
[53:28.960 --> 53:32.800]  suicide. It's causing economic collapse. It's causing millions of starved to death. It is an
[53:32.800 --> 53:37.360]  economic weapon by these criminals and they think that they're safe because the mainstream media
[53:37.360 --> 53:42.000]  keeps promoting the lie and none of them are seen as the heads of it. So they all think they can
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.560]  get away with this mass murder and societal collapse for the chai comms to make them number
[53:46.560 --> 53:58.000]  one, but you will all be held accountable. Newsome and other criminals like mayor there in New York
[53:58.640 --> 54:04.160]  and the governor of Michigan. And that's why they stage that attack on her to let them all know,
[54:04.160 --> 54:06.960]  hey, we'll prop you up and make it look like a victim. We don't want anybody to hurt them
[54:06.960 --> 54:10.320]  illegally outside of law. We're going to have them indicted in front of a grand jury and then
[54:10.320 --> 54:15.280]  put in federal or state prison. Oh no, don't shoot. Seriously, they're all going to prison.
[54:15.280 --> 54:18.880]  They're not going to stop. And so all the pedophile ring stuff's coming out. How they're on
[54:18.880 --> 54:23.200]  chai comp. It rolls all coming out. It's all coming out. You knew all order people wanted it. You
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.840]  got it. Trump's going to win. We're going to win. America's going to beat you again because my
[54:27.840 --> 54:33.840]  Bismarck got it right. God loves children, drugs and the United States of America. We'll be right
[54:33.840 --> 54:38.560]  back. You knew all order people better run up the white flags trash because you're burning down
[54:38.560 --> 54:47.360]  right now and you're going to burn in hell. You piece of the filth. China is open. America is
[54:47.360 --> 54:51.680]  closed. And in the European Union, where the people are revolting trying to get out of the
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.440]  authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of lockdown. It's very simple.
[54:57.440 --> 55:02.240]  Where authoritarians are, you have complete control of commerce. China. Oh, there's no more
[55:02.240 --> 55:07.360]  lockdowns and their heroes and the UN says they're the example for assault. After all,
[55:07.360 --> 55:11.760]  that's where the virus came from. After all, that's where the fear monster came from. The
[55:11.760 --> 55:17.680]  lockdown came from. But that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little
[55:17.680 --> 55:26.160]  syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into
[55:26.160 --> 55:33.360]  a stampede of mass hysteria. And so far, it's been incredibly successful until just the last few
[55:33.360 --> 55:39.600]  weeks as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN communist
[55:39.600 --> 55:48.240]  Chinese world government power graph. I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your
[55:48.240 --> 55:54.640]  children to listen to you, whisper. And it's true. A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling,
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.080]  even if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out. You know why I know
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.080]  that? Because I'm Alex Jones. And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried
[56:06.080 --> 56:11.040]  about the new world order. And I read about all their plans to lockdown civilization, start of
[56:11.040 --> 56:16.400]  the third world and then enslave the first world. So I've been really, really loud and really,
[56:16.400 --> 56:21.280]  really aggressive. And we've had a big effect. But, but now it's time to think about every
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.640]  different angle and every different way we can get people to think for themselves before it's too
[56:26.640 --> 56:33.840]  late. The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization. We are under
[56:33.840 --> 56:41.280]  a civilization collapse weapon. So this is life and death. Please share info wars.com and band
[56:41.280 --> 57:00.800]  our video and watch our live election coverage. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:11.840 --> 57:15.120]  Let's go to Mike in Idaho. Because that spell
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.040]  loved us have had over America, the world starting to lift.
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.480]  And the cockroaches as the lights get flipped on, starting to get real scared.
[57:31.280 --> 57:36.400]  Mike in Idaho, go ahead. The Biden photos held back by the media. Yeah, that's the big story.
[57:36.400 --> 57:42.800]  The, all the dominant media has the pedophilia has the videos has stuff a lot worse. Here's
[57:42.800 --> 57:47.120]  what I should have said earlier. It's being dribbled out very slowly to give Biden the globalist
[57:47.120 --> 57:52.640]  a chance to give up. Does that make sense, brother? I mean, it makes sense. I, you know,
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.720]  this is what it, you know, this is how I've been thinking about it for watching all of this come
[57:56.720 --> 58:00.480]  out. There's a lot of things I don't know. I don't know. I put my trust in the people that,
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.960]  you know, that are trying to lead this. But at the same time, I'm looking for this to be
[58:04.960 --> 58:10.320]  decentralized as fast as possible. Believe me, they're trying. The people I've talked to say at
[58:10.320 --> 58:17.040]  least 40 major news organizations have it. Okay. And where have they been for the last four years?
[58:17.040 --> 58:20.320]  I mean, we were watching them four and a half years ago, five and a half years ago, lying to
[58:20.320 --> 58:24.640]  our face. That's when most of the people, what it seems to me, most people woke up to the media
[58:24.640 --> 58:29.520]  live so they can hold it for all day. And it doesn't matter if there's 50 of them or 60 or 400,
[58:30.080 --> 58:33.360]  you know, that information is not getting out to the people. Well, let's just be clear. Let's
[58:33.360 --> 58:38.880]  just be clear. We have it. Okay. I mean, I have access to it. I've made strategically the decision
[58:38.880 --> 58:42.800]  that we not be the one out front because they've already tried to discredit us so much.
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.560]  And it's there. They'll just deny it's real. But you, I mean, you see, it's already all coming
[58:46.560 --> 58:51.600]  out. Some of this stuff, I refuse to make my crew open. I refuse to open it. I have people that
[58:51.600 --> 58:57.040]  have outside that have seen it. And I just, I mean, look, I'm not looking at child porn. Okay.
[58:57.040 --> 59:00.560]  Never seen it. Not going to look at it now. I've talked to folks that have looked at it.
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.760]  Law enforcement that's seen it. It's confirmed. And so, but I understand why the New York Post,
[59:05.760 --> 59:10.400]  everybody's scared to do this. But see, that's how the evil keeps defeating us because
[59:10.400 --> 59:14.880]  the FBI should be arresting these people. We shouldn't have to look at this. That makes sense?
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.920]  Yes. Yes, absolutely makes sense. You know, I'll give you, I'll give you a, you know, a full circle
[59:19.920 --> 59:25.360]  on this too. You have kind of opened my eyes to the idea that they're putting the truest out there.
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.320]  And you're not the only one, but you're one of them. They're putting the truest out there right
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.320]  in front of the, out in the open, right? They put it in movies and give you an example. We watched
[59:32.320 --> 59:36.800]  the eight millimeter last night with Nicholas Cage, right? And Joaquin Phoenix's character in
[59:36.800 --> 59:40.560]  there has a line in that movie. He says, you dance with the devil and you don't change. The devil
[59:40.560 --> 59:44.880]  doesn't change. The devil changes you. So looking at that garbage is not a good thing. But at the
[59:44.880 --> 59:49.920]  end of the day, we have got to expose these people for who they are so that people wake up. And
[59:49.920 --> 59:54.480]  there's too many narcissistic, delusional, authoritarian sociopaths out there that only
[59:54.480 --> 59:59.680]  want to see the world and they're, and it positively reflected back to them that we, we have got to
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:04.800]  look at, let me give you the equation on us. Okay. We've already walked point so much. I'm not afraid
[1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:09.920]  to do it. I had a gut level strategically how we've already been demonized so much have been waiting
[1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:13.600]  for others to bring it out. Then people've offered it to me. I've confirmed people that have it,
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.760]  that have seen it. They say, do you want it? And I've been very close to doing it. I mean,
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:22.320]  I'll be quite frank with you. Well, I don't want to give that an inside baseball. I've had national
[1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:26.160]  talk show host consult with me. I've been on the phone with these people with the national talk
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:29.600]  show host on the phone with these well-known individuals that are willing to give it to us.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:35.040]  They work for the White House. And my issue is the White House should release it. Trump should
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:39.360]  release it. And because here's the deal. They already tried to plant child porn on us last year,
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:43.680]  as everybody knows. Okay. And the FBI said, no, we never opened it. It's a setup. But see,
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:48.080]  they already planted that because they know I'm exposing that. So see, they would just tie that
[1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:54.240]  to me. Look at what national news said and media matters said they're like, and right wing watch
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:01:00.320]  are like, Oh, Alex Jones, you know, is claiming that the New York Post has this and is saying the
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:04.320]  president's going to release child porn. They're going to spin it that the president's releasing
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:10.080]  this or say it's fake. And so I understand justice be done. May the heavens fall. I'm trying to war
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:16.480]  game here. Hell, here's another thing. I guess I'll go look at it and I'll blur it out myself. I just,
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:19.760]  I just haven't gone to one of my crew members and said, Are you ready to look at hunters
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:25.440]  screwing little kids? Because no one wants to open that. You understand? I do. I understand it.
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:29.680]  And you're, you're good people. You're a good man for not asking anybody else to do that. Somebody
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.520]  has got to step up and take the bullet on this metaphorically. Somebody has got to get the
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.760]  information out to the people. And maybe it's not you, but somebody has to do it. So maybe that
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:41.280]  somebody's listed and look, I already made the decision to do it. Nobody else does. And it's
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.600]  starting to come out. Gateway Pundit's doing it. Gateway Pundit. We love them. We'll be right back.
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:49.440]  I'm just saying, I don't have to get in the ring. It's my Tyson every time. Do I? Hell, I'll, I'll
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:57.280]  release it then. Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:07.440]  night? Is your city too safe? Well, not anymore. Introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:15.440]  they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence and even homelessness. The secret
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:22.160]  is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity. No more pesky law and order.
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:28.720]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:34.880]  your neighborhood burn to the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:44.240]  blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:03:05.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:32.720]  Okay, if you just joined us, I'm taking your phone calls. It's come out, Hunter Biden, they're not
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.320]  denying it, saying he works for the Chinese spy chief. He's done a criminal investigation with
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.840]  the Southern District of New York. Respionage against the U.S. with his dad. You already know that.
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:45.120]  There's all these tapes and videos of him with little girls, his own family, naked photos,
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:53.360]  little Chinese kids, you name it. And it's all coming out. And Biden doesn't know how to back
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:57.440]  down. The deep state doesn't know how to back down. And so more and more, this is going to come out
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:03.200]  with just six days left until the election. Five and a half days left until the election.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.360]  I've been having a lot of equipment failures lately because we didn't reorder equipment.
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.440]  This little wire breaks up. So I'm going to re-broadcast here while I get another headset
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:15.120]  here in a moment. But I'm going to try as best I can. Let's order five of these wires.
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:18.240]  So this doesn't happen again when one breaks. Just please. I love the crew. It just seems
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.120]  like when I say something on air, it magically happens. If it don't say it on air, it doesn't
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:29.440]  happen. But again, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Very, very thankful for you all tuning in here to
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:34.560]  the worldwide broadcast today. Roger Stone is coming up next segment. Let's go ahead and try to go
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:40.240]  to your phone calls right now. Let's go ahead. And actually, I can't headset totally went out again.
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:43.440]  All right. Oh, it's back now. Let's see how this works. I'm going to try again. Sorry,
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:47.440]  I have to do this on air. It's just how it is around here. Okay. Let's go ahead and take a call
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:53.120]  here. Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Maryland. Chris, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:58.880]  Good morning slash afternoon to you, Alex. Yes, sir. Go ahead. I've been listening to you for
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:03.520]  years. I mean, I don't even know how many it's been over 10 years, sir. I mean, I'm in here,
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:09.280]  Baltimore. I'm an African American male who voted for Obama the first time and was deceased.
[1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:16.400]  And since then, I've always taken the like into Trump. And once he ran and put his bid in for
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:22.560]  the presidency, I was behind him for support. And I'm here in Baltimore trying to get my
[1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:27.200]  fellow brothers, the African American community to open their eyes to see that Joe Biden was the one
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:34.480]  who helped write the crime bill that locked up a lot of the African Americans that are in jail
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:40.320]  now. But that's another tangent. First, Alex, if I may, I want to give you some protection, sir.
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:50.240]  The name of the Lord God is truly Yahweh. I know you know that. And I was told to do this,
[1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:54.640]  so this is the reason I'm taking this time. No, you're right. I mean, listeners know the name
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:59.440]  is Jesus. But in the Hebrew, it is Yahweh. And everybody argues about the name. But in my soul
[1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:03.200]  and heart, I know who God is. But yes, in the name of Yahweh, I hope America wakes up.
[1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:09.520]  Okay, Alex, let me give you the breakdown real quick. It's real simple. All languages have
[1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:15.920]  vowels. The most consistent vowels in language is the A-E-I-O-U. The name of the Lord God is the
[1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:24.240]  tetragrammaton, four letters, yod hei waw hei. And to transliterate that into English is E-I-O,
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:30.400]  E-I-U-A, if you will write it down, E-I-U-A. But when it was heard by the ancient, it sounded
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:37.120]  like this, E-I-O-A. So they transliterated it into Yahweh, which is the true name of God.
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:43.280]  Now, I want to reveal the man of sin also and the coming false flag. The coming false flag
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:49.120]  is the fate or stage assassination of Barack Obama, the man of perdition, the matriarch.
[1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.400]  Now, what's going to happen is they're going to stage that he was shot by a Trump supporter,
[1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:58.800]  and then the whole world will burn. While he's in the hospital getting his
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:09.840]  transhumanism cyber-genic or cyber, I'm a loss for words, but you know what I mean.
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:10.560]  Cybernetics.
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:16.400]  Yeah, while he's in the hospital getting prepared and getting ready, the whole world will burn.
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:23.920]  The African-Americans who are deceived and to believe in this guy as a player or to believe
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:32.640]  that he just said that their last want was to totally irate. The whole world will burn,
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:40.080]  and while he's in the hospital getting his repairing, they will send gifts from all over
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:45.520]  the world and to the hospital, balloons, all types of sorts of gifts, and then they will reveal him
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:52.560]  for Barack Hussein Obama as matria. He's the only one that has a connection to matria,
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:58.320]  but that's the false flag, Alex, and none of this will matter. The Trump presidency,
[1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:03.440]  the Biden presidency will not matter if they take down Obama, and that's the plan.
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:09.680]  Well, I know a lot of people have had that theory. We're certainly going to find out. I know Obama
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:13.920]  can speak better Arabic than most Arabs. I know he is a globalist and they really push him like
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.480]  the Messiah of the left of the New World Order. Thank you so much, Chris. I appreciate your call.
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:22.160]  Let's talk to Chad in Illinois. Chad, you're on the air.
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:28.240]  Wow. Great to talk to you, Alex. I've been listening to you for over 13 years now and
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:33.360]  you helped me wake up and love you, brother, and be the globalists together.
[1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:39.200]  So my question is this. I listened to your podcast with Joe Rogan recently,
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:44.400]  and I noticed that there was almost no discussion about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:49.920]  So I was curious if you had any conversations with Joe Rogan separate from the podcast
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.040]  about these talks about him being involved in pedophilia,
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:01.280]  his connections with the Chinese Communists, and if so, how can Joe help us in our fight?
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:06.240]  Well, I think we did talk about it some. I had a split tooth and a huge toothache.
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.560]  I was exhausted when I was on the show. I think I did an okay job. Joe had decided to fact-check
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:14.160]  everything I said, knowing that usually what I say he can pull up is a way to actually help me.
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:17.920]  Some folks thought it was an attack. I didn't know he was going to do that until he did it.
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:23.280]  But we did talk some about the laptop there on air and the laptops all over the place now.
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:27.280]  They admit the laptop's real and the horrible contents are now coming out quicker and quicker.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.880]  But I'm supposedly going to co-host. I'll be here doing it too, but his office is very close.
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:38.080]  There's going to be live coverage here election night from InfoWars and Joe Rogan live as well.
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:42.720]  I'll be with him part of the time. We'll be sure and bring all of that up, sir.
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:46.800]  Okay, awesome. Look forward to it. Thank you. Anything else?
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:53.440]  Oh, no, just everyone that's listening. Alex has the best products. I've been using
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:57.280]  all your products to Alex for a long time. You have the best vitamins,
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:03.920]  best supplements, water filtration. I even have your shower filtration system. It's great.
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:06.960]  Forget to get the fluoride out of the water. Thank you, sir. I love you and I appreciate
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:10.800]  your chat. Incredible time to be alive right now. Pray for global awakening. Pray for President
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:18.160]  Trump. Jack in Kansas. Jack, you're on the air. Welcome. Yes. What I wanted to say is the disinformation
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:23.040]  campaign that is being used against the people here in this country is really neuroinguistic
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:29.920]  programming mockingbird coupled with MKUltra. And they're using that on two fronts against the
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:36.160]  people. Number one, the virus hoax, and number two, BLM slash Antifa. And how they're using
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:40.800]  both of those against us is, for example, you'll see the black lives matter on the back of the
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.720]  helmets or the players and you'll see it in the stadium. But then also in the stadium,
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:49.040]  you'll see that there's nobody in the stadium because of the virus hoax. So what they're using
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:57.040]  both of those against us for is really bringing, it's basically bringing us to a situation where
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:02.480]  we need to get Trump into the White House so he can put a stop to this. See what I'm saying?
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.760]  I do hear what you're saying. Continue. Okay. Well, what's happening is BLM's working with the
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:14.480]  Chinese Communist Party's Intel apparatus on the West. Oh, they admit their malice. They admit
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:22.160]  their Marxist-Leninists that follow Mao and Soros funds them. Yeah, but what's really happening is
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.840]  they're creating a discord in this country and also creating racial tension. And what that's
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:34.880]  doing is dividing us even further on top of the virus hoax division that they've been using against
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:42.800]  us. And why can't some of the wealthy top black elites get together and go to the areas that are
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:50.960]  in the Democratic-controlled cities like Philadelphia, Cleveland, and so on and go to the
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:56.240]  poor parts of town where there are disenfranchised blacks and put a stop to this before it gets
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:04.560]  to the point to where we get invaded by the Chinese. Does that make any sense to you?
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.200]  Yes, sir. That makes total sense. And I appreciate your call. The globalist plan
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:15.040]  is to have the U.N. come in during race riots after the election. Plain was not Democrats
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:19.280]  overthrowing Trump, but it's race riots doing it. And that's actually one of their plans and Soros
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:24.640]  has spent hundreds of millions of dollars just this year on just that. Thank you so much. All
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:29.920]  right. Roger Stone's coming up with a lot of big breaking news and we'll continue with phone calls
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:36.480]  for everybody here on This Live, October 28, Wednesday, Transmission. I'm Alan Jones. The
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:42.800]  forbidden websites are electionnight.news. Electionnight.news. That's the new URL you're
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:48.640]  able to share on Twitter in places that isn't blocked for now. The new website is electionnight.news
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:55.840]  for all the videos. In January and February of the year 2020, the Communist Superstate China
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.360]  working through the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:08.080]  after COVID. Permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps to track everywhere we go,
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:13.280]  and what we do. Contact tracers come into our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:20.320]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover and it's never going to end until we
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:26.160]  start standing up and saying no. Already Fauci and the WHO and the Communist Chinese are all over
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:33.760]  the news saying the lockdowns are permanent. Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:39.440]  restrictions are raised. By then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:45.520]  slavery and it will never end. This is the authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist.
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:51.680]  Everyone must speak up. Everyone must say no now. It's on record. It's not disputed. It was rolled
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.680]  out more than eight months ago in Communist China. Now it's in Europe. Now it's the United States,
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.560]  Canada, and most other industrial parts of the planet. Every restaurant you go into,
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:07.360]  even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly check their menu and they really
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:11.360]  get upset if you ask for a paper menu but of course they have them. Now what are they saying
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:15.360]  there? Well you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.520]  have a piece of paper because oh everybody's diseased and you know we're spreading germs.
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.840]  It's absolutely asinine. They could throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:29.440]  believe that. Now what this really is is a contact tracing database. Again this is admitted that
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.720]  everyone's being habituated and to scan to be part of so in the future everywhere you go is tracked
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:38.480]  officially. Now your cell phone's already tracking. You already have home assistants watching and
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:43.200]  listening to your house but now this is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell,
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:47.840]  have a job, get an airplane without it and Bill Gates even admits it. So think about that folks
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:49.840]  and then we'll look out.
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:15:15.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:29.840]  How you like me now? How you like me now? Remember the bomb when I eat you up.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:37.840]  Well former top advisor to candidate Trump and former political president are now vindicated.
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:44.960]  But the presidency is Roger Stone for the balance of the hour. We'll continue with calls after that
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:50.800]  and Sheriff Joe Arpaio is going to be popping in with new information. His take on the whole
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:54.560]  election will continue with your phone calls. But Roger Stone sir, we're going to talk about the
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:16:00.640]  big picture. Only five and a half days out. The latest intel, the latest real internal polls
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:07.120]  on election 2020. Roger thanks for joining us. Alex I'm delighted to be here. I must say in the
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:13.200]  40 years I've been involved in American presidential politics this is without question
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:20.720]  the most exciting, the most consequential and the most hard fought race I've ever seen.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:29.840]  We have a contrast between two campaigns. Joe Biden is essentially just trying to run down the
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:37.040]  clock. He's like a basketball team ahead in the fourth quarter. He is barely leaving his compound.
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:44.240]  He only makes appearances locally to small groups essentially just to prove to the American people
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:50.640]  that he's still alive. He takes no questions from the press. And of course when he gets questions
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:57.360]  from the press, they're all softballs. Nobody asks him about the epic story of international
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:03.040]  corruption that is opening up around him. He really has nothing interesting to say.
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:09.200]  Just to pose that with Donald Trump who has run a driving, interesting, boisterous,
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:16.880]  I would say audacious campaign where he is barnstorming and taking the fight right to the
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:24.880]  Democratic strongholds, continuing to draw record crowds. But putting for the American people
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:32.240]  a message of optimism, a sunny message about America having a great future while Joe Biden
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:40.240]  said in the debate, we were headed to a dark winter. This has essentially been, I think,
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:47.600]  wisely on the president's part, an adoption of the Ronald Reagan campaign strategy because people
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:56.720]  would rather vote for hope than they would for disaster. And all the Biden Democrats and Biden
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:03.040]  Kamala off the American people is doom and gloom. People don't like to buy doom and gloom. Now,
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:10.560]  there still continues to be, I think, three major obstacles to the president's come from behind
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:18.560]  victory. First and foremost is the mainstream corporate-owned press. In 10 presidential
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:26.160]  campaigns, now 11, I have never seen this level of censorship, this level of manipulation,
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:34.000]  of manipulation of the news, this level of unfairness and bias. It's really,
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  it boggles the mind. It would not be problematic if we still had a free and level playing field
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:50.240]  on the internet. But the social media giants are in bed with big media, big tech, big media,
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:58.880]  and the Democrats. And they are ending essentially the end around, which Donald Trump used so
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:06.400]  effectively in 2016, to circumvent the lying mainstream press and tell the American people
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:14.160]  the truth. This is going to come down to a handful of states. I believe those will be
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:24.320]  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. I was surprised and a little concerned to see polls
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:31.920]  published by the Daily Caller only hours ago showing Joe Biden with a 17-point lead in Wisconsin.
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:37.680]  I doubt that that is correct. I saw a second poll that showed him with a nine-point lead.
[1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:42.000]  I'm not going to pass judgment on those surveys till I have a chance to
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:48.480]  study the methodology, determine the sample size. We see a repeated 2016 where they were
[1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:53.040]  adding 10, 15 points more for Democrats as a sample. It was who they were targeting.
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:57.840]  I mean, this is ridiculous. Yeah, look, I'm not going to pass judgment on any one poll
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:02.560]  till I have a chance to examine it. You're exactly right. In some cases, they purposely
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:08.800]  oversampled Democrats to get a desired result. And then they take that desired result and they
[1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:13.840]  publicize it to try to make it a fata complete. To try to create a bandwagon effect.
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:21.520]  Exactly. And also, I think, tamp down the enthusiasm of Trump supporters. The good news is
[1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:28.000]  the president's supporters have real intensity. The president's supporters will be there if
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:34.560]  there's a blizzard or if there's a hurricane. President's supporters are not going to change
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:41.600]  their mind. There is no such thing as a soft Trump voter. Biden's support, on the other hand,
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:48.720]  is substantially less intense. There are many voters voting for Biden simply not because they
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:55.280]  think he'd be a good president, but because he is not Donald Trump. He has trouble getting 200
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:21:02.720]  people at a rally or a public function. Where did we see this before? Well, we saw it anecdotally
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:12.160]  in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016. Then you have these extraordinary, not campaign coordinated,
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:20.880]  but totally grassroots and indigenous boat parades, car parades, motorcycle parades.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:28.560]  I've never seen anything like it. Alex, there were 35,000 cars in a anti-socialist,
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:37.200]  anti-communist pro-Trump cavalcade in Miami Dade last weekend. We saw a boat parade from
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:46.400]  Jupiter to Palm Beach and back. 3,500 crafts. I saw one row boat for Joe Biden. Same thing
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:51.200]  happened here in Austin a month ago, and the waves were so big in the lake from over 5,000 boats
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:58.720]  that boats sank. I mean, it was just, it was insane. This kind of grassroots indigenous
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:05.360]  show of support, I think, is an accurate reflection of the intensity of the president's support.
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:12.720]  Now, let's come to the crucial and, I think, important issue of the epic corruption of Joe Biden
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:21.120]  as proved by the emails from his son, Hunter Biden. First of all, when The New York Times reports,
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:28.640]  Ben Smith, who ironically, as the publisher of BuzzFeed, is the guy who published the unverified
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:36.240]  and totally fabricated Steele dossier smearing Donald Trump, he's now lauding the Wall Street
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:43.680]  Journal for their failure to report on the Hunter Biden emails, which I can tell you definitively
[1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:53.920]  have been absolutely confirmed as authentic. Now, Hunter Biden's emails are bolstered by the
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:23:01.280]  firsthand testimony for Robert Babinski, pardon me, Tony Babinski, a naval veteran,
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:08.400]  a wealthy businessman in his own right, who had eyewitness testimony regarding the corruption
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:13.920]  and involvement of Joe Biden and Hunter's shady business deals with the Chinese.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:20.320]  And then lastly, you have the third party testimony of a man named Bevin Cooney,
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:27.040]  yet another Hunter Biden partner. Roger Stone, stay there. Roger Stone with us.
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:32.560]  That has turned over his emails. Roger Stone is with us. We'll be right back as he lays out
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:37.200]  the corruption and where it's going with five and a half days left until the election.
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:43.280]  Then your phone calls Sheriff Arpaio and more than the war room with Owen Schreuer will be right back.
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:52.480]  Stay with us. I want us to sink in. I want to sink in real good and to everybody listening,
[1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:57.920]  including my own brain. This lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already started
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:02.560]  over two million people to death. It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:10.080]  our necks. They are never going to release it. That's why Trump coming out and saying we cannot
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:15.200]  quote beat the virus by staying locked up. We have to get herd immunity. It's not as deadly as they
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:20.640]  said it's so important because this is a UN Bill Gates globalist deployed corporate takeover
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:26.960]  where their businesses are all essential, but our businesses aren't. This is destroying the
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:33.360]  world economy by design. This is economic warfare. This is war crime. And now they're coming with the
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:37.920]  attempted forced inoculations that Gates is pushing. Well, you know what that is. That violates the
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:44.480]  Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code and so much more. Please spread the words. Please tell folks
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:51.040]  about banned video and the facts that are posted there. Info wars has been reporting on the dark
[1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:57.280]  unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades. It is why they attack us.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:05.440]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world. The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:11.360]  is merely the tip of the iceberg. Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:17.600]  establishment is censoring content across all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:25.520]  banned video on social media. So go to election night dot news and share it like your lives
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:34.800]  depended on it. Go to election night dot news to find the truth about covid vaccines Bill Gates
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.760]  and big pharma go to election night dot news to find all the information the crooked establishment
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:50.640]  is most afraid of go to election night dot news and share now. Six months ago, the highly respected
[1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:57.840]  former head of the Rockefeller hospital biology department went public and said the mainline
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:04.320]  science on virology is cannot protect somebody from a virus like this. You have to wait till
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:09.200]  there's herd immunity and there's never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:15.440]  viruses. They do not work. Well, even Bill Gates now admits, oh, the vaccine will really never work,
[1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:19.680]  but you have to keep social distancing and wearing masks. They're now saying forever.
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:24.400]  Last week, it was 10 years. Now it's forever. See how the power grab works. So when you hear
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:28.800]  them saying Trump is surrendering and a sheep of staff is surrendered to coronavirus, when they
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:33.440]  say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D,
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:39.200]  C, and of course, zinc, that's the reality. That's not fear mongering. That's not giving
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:43.840]  in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new old order. They create a problem to
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:27:04.080]  which there is no solution. But they are again the people that said they've got to be in charge.
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:23.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:26.080]  studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:43.200]  If you are a radio listener, you can't see this, but when the show's not live today,
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:49.600]  I'm going to take this clip out and post it. The man dot video with a headline like
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:56.160]  two videos that illustrate the difference between Biden and Trump. And here is the video.
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:02.080]  I want to get Roger's take on this. It's Trump landing a few days ago to a giant crowd of people
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:08.800]  cheering him doing one of five events a day. And here's Biden doing one event
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:12.560]  like something out of a cult science fiction movie.
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:19.280]  That's just unbelievable with all these weird little circles around people and everyone's
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.800]  social distance and everyone wearing mask and he's wearing his mask and he's in all the campaign
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:29.360]  ads with a mask saying live in fear, keep everything shut down, exaggerating with death tolls.
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:35.680]  This is so illustrative of everything that Roger Stone was just talking about.
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:38.800]  What is your view of the images you just saw, Roger?
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:46.720]  Well, Alex, before I forget, I want to congratulate you on being trending yesterday on Twitter.
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:52.480]  It's always great when someone who is completely banned there still dominates it because of your
[1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:59.440]  courageous comments regarding the unsafety of vaccinate vaccinations on Joe Rogan's show.
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:04.720]  So I want to congratulate you on that. I'm always tickled when I'm trending on Twitter
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:12.080]  since I've been banned since for three years now, I guess. In any event, as I think I've told you
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:19.520]  previously, an analysis of polling pre-pandemic when Donald Trump was leading Joe Biden by nine
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:28.240]  and an analysis of post-pandemic polling when he is essentially trailing Joe Biden now by nine
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:36.720]  is to examine the shift of votes. And those who shifted position were largely African American
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:44.000]  and Hispanic, meaning pre-pandemic, the president was getting record numbers for a Republican
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.840]  of those votes. Remember, he doesn't need a majority of either one of those traditionally
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:55.120]  Democratic constituencies. He just needs to make significant inroads.
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:30:03.840]  Significant can be 3% or 4% greater than he got last time. That would be enough to deliver Michigan,
[1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:12.000]  Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. And therefore, my advice to the Trump campaign is to move resources
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:20.160]  from elsewhere and to buy saturation urban and Spanish language radio for the final week
[1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:27.120]  in those swing states. Now, you know how radio works. You'd prefer to have three weeks of it.
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:34.240]  It as a medium tends to require more repetition, which is why a heavy schedule is absolutely
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:40.880]  required. And a campaign that raised a billion dollars should be able to move money around
[1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:48.960]  to fund this important endeavor. It's kind of ironic at Alex in 2016, we came down to the exact
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:56.480]  same place. In the end of the day, the election was secured in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
[1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:04.480]  Ohio was safe for Trump, as I believe it is today. In Florida was close, but the president wanted.
[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:10.400]  I think Florida will yet again be close. But I think if we get an honest count,
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:17.920]  the president will squeeze it out. I do think we have to be concerned over what is in fact,
[1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:27.040]  an illegal ballot harvesting operation run by a veteran left-wing dirty trickster and a saboteur,
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:35.360]  whose name is Norm Eisen. Norm Eisen has actually written a book about how to topple foreign
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:43.200]  governments using a combination of election fraud, controversy over election results,
[1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:49.920]  and then backing it with violent mobs in the streets. This is Mr. Eisen's playbook.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:58.400]  He will be assisted by Mark Elias. He's the guy who paid for the illegal steel dossier
[1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:06.800]  and who laundered the money through his loss firm for that piece of Russian asset written
[1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:17.040]  disinformation. And then the last conspirator is Neil Keitel, a man who was proud to represent
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:25.360]  some of the terrorists who killed Americans on 9-11, and who screams endlessly about the
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:32.320]  rule of law, but doesn't seem to be concerned about Barack Obama and Joe Biden using the full
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:36.880]  authority of the United States government and the capabilities of our intelligence service.
[1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:39.040]  I totally agree, Roger. Let me interject.
[1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:45.760]  Of the United States. That, of course, doesn't bother him at all. I just named the three people
[1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:50.800]  in charge of the theft of this election. I've told you exactly how they're going to do it,
[1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:56.080]  but if you don't believe me, you can go to Norm Eisen's book, which is entitled Playbook,
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:01.360]  tells you exactly what they intend to do. The president needs to be prepared to deal with this,
[1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:10.960]  legally. If there are legitimate disputes regarding the accuracy or ballot fraud in any
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:16.240]  of these states, the president's lawyers or the Republican National Committee's lawyers
[1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:22.880]  or the Republicans working as volunteers at Stop the Steel need to be prepared to
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:30.240]  collect the evidence, find someone withstanding, and file the appropriate challenges. Let me be
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:38.400]  clear. We renounce violence. Violence is not the answer to any election dispute.
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:45.200]  We will settle this peacefully in the courts, should it happen, as I think it will.
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:53.280]  But it's notable that Mr. Eisen has been a key architect filing over 100 lawsuits against the
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:58.240]  president, long before the president made that call to the Ukrainian president,
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:08.400]  and has been an architect of the two-fold failed illegal coup attempts. These are very dangerous,
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:15.840]  serious people, but they need to be dealt with legally in the event that we have hard, solid,
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:21.760]  overwhelming evidence of election fraud. I'm hopeful that the Trump campaign
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:29.600]  is prepared for that legal eventuality. All right, Roger Stone is again here with us live.
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:34.320]  I wanted to talk about that. This is obviously the playbook, the short sorrows this playbook,
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:37.760]  the Democrats admitted to their playbook, try to drive Trump from office. They said they're
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:41.520]  going to assault the White House as soon as he declares victory. They're going to say it's a
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:46.000]  false declaration of victory. John Podesta has said they're going to try to have states secede.
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.200]  I mean, this is bold, but the attempt at coup, trying to put you in prison, all the stuff we've
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.960]  seen has been bold because the Justice Department is still somewhat controlled by the deep state,
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.760]  or is rage is completely scared because all this laptop stuff is now confirmed. And
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:08.000]  audio tapes of Hunter saying he works for the Chinese spy chief, all this coming out,
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.520]  they're not even trying to block that now on Twitter. They admit it's real. This is getting
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:18.320]  insane. No, it is being blocked in mainstream media. It is being blocked on Twitter. So,
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:24.400]  as again, the end around through social media that Trump supporters were able to use in 2016
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:31.680]  has now been shut off. It is damning material. When reporters like Ben Smith of The New York
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:36.560]  Times say the province of these emails is questionable, that's a lie. But that's what
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:43.680]  they do at The New York Times. They print lies on the pay on the front page. It is extraordinary
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:50.640]  because every day we get more damning evidence. This is not about Hunter Biden being a degenerate
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:56.080]  drug user. That's kind of immaterial to me. It's about the epic corruption of his father,
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:04.640]  who very clearly was his partner in the Chinese energy deal, and very clearly did use his influence
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:13.760]  to help his son get a $1.4 billion wire transfer, actually two, one for a billion,
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:20.720]  one for an additional $400,000, only days after son and father returned from China
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:28.000]  on their trip on Air Force Two. Hunter Biden has never managed or run a dollar in his life,
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:34.880]  nor have any of his criminal partners. Why you would give him that kind of money is kind of obvious.
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:42.080]  When Joe Biden says, I never accepted a dime in foreign money, those are weaselworks.
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:45.920]  Of course, again, this is family. Roger Stone, stay there. More key questions straight ahead.
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:54.960]  China is open. America is closed. And in the European Union, where the people are revolting,
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:00.640]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of lockdown.
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.040]  It's very simple. Where authoritarians are, you have complete control of how much China,
[1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:10.560]  oh, there's no more lockdowns, and there are heroes, and the UN says they're the example for us all.
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:15.280]  After all, that's where the virus came from. After all, that's where the fear mongering came
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:22.000]  from. The lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:30.320]  syndrome being created that was to then be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:37.200]  into a stampede of mass hysteria. And so far, it's been incredibly successful. Until just the
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:43.520]  last few weeks, as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:50.480]  communist Chinese world government power grab. As I take this announcement, we are exactly 14 days
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:56.240]  out from the election. And the globalist-controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:01.120]  them and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:07.200]  openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.800]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that once
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.160]  they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:23.920]  and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.080]  bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying. This is their
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:36.080]  stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:40.640]  force binoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and his state vaccines will be
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:46.240]  voluntary. Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:51.680]  tell your family to vote now. CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:56.080]  false headline that Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus. It's the opposite. He's not
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:02.320]  surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science, that it's incredibly deadly,
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:07.520]  and that we have a chance of eradicating it. Bill Gates, Fauci and the UN have said,
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:12.800]  we will always wear masks. We will never shake hands. And even the vaccines won't protect us
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:20.320]  forever. And so that civilization, as we know, is over until every coronavirus in the world
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:25.040]  is eradicated. That's impossible. That's right. They're trying to say they have to have a cure
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:31.920]  to the common cold. That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test. They created a problem
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:36.720]  that can never be defeated. But of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem. And so they
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:42.800]  stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers now going with the police
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:49.200]  to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking force samples. We must say no. It was in the
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:56.160]  Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location. I read from
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:02.000]  the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American. Now the media
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:07.520]  admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids, don't just track
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:13.280]  your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:18.160]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:24.080]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do,
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:29.360]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:34.400]  saved forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:39.920]  based on information. This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your protection

[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:09.760]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's way to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:18.960]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:25.760]  Hi, Roger Jones. I'm going to leave us here in a few minutes for an honor to have him,
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:29.440]  then I'll be going to your phone calls for 30 minutes. I'll get to everybody that's holding.
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:35.040]  I promise, one way or another. Natasha, you name it, Chad, Nathan, Casey, all of you,
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:40.800]  and then Sheriff Orpio is going to pop in for 30 minutes ahead of the next guest host we've got
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.120]  coming on here today. But we're talking to Roger Stone right now, just briefly.

[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:19.520]  finish up what you're saying and other key advice to America, key advice to Trump. As you said,
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:25.920]  this is your 11th presidential campaign. You've been in the game a long time, Mr. Silver Fox.
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:32.160]  And I tell you, this is a one insane moment to actually be here. This is so historic, the craziest
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:38.720]  yet. Well, Alex, I must tell you, I'm putting in 18-hour days because I'm involved in
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:44.640]  a perfectly legal but independent political action in a number of these swing states,
[1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:50.160]  trying to help the president I love get across the finish line. If it were not for
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:55.840]  brain force right now, brain force plus, I don't know how we put in these hours. I really like it
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.040]  because it gives you that burst of energy around four o'clock when you really need it. But then
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:08.400]  later at night, when you have to get badly needed sleep, you don't have that jagged feeling that you
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:17.920]  get from other energy and focus based products. I cannot say enough good things about brain force
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:25.680]  plus. I live on it. Now let's go back to the election. It is really tragic the way the hunter
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:32.000]  Biden story is playing out. First of all, we know for certain that the emails in his laptop are
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:38.880]  genuine. We now have two former partners who have come forward with not only their own emails
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:45.920]  between them and Hunter, but receipts and other documentation of their claims of corruption
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:52.320]  and the involvement of Joe Biden. This story was slated to run in the Wall Street Journal
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:45:00.800]  who had verified the authenticity of the initial emails from Hunter's laptop
[1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:07.840]  that was left at a repair shop in Delaware. They had dug in and had begun drafting their story
[1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:15.440]  when, unfortunately, Steve Bannon jumped the gun, leaked this information to Breitbart,
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:22.640]  which makes it relatively ineffectual. I love Breitbart, but they're speaking to our own converts.
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:30.160]  We needed this story widely covered in the mainstream media and had it been covered by the
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:36.080]  August Wall Street Journal. I think it would have been much harder for the TV networks, the wire
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:45.680]  services, and so many others to ignore. That was an opportunity lost. When that did happen,
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:52.240]  I believe Mayor Rudy Giuliani took the information immediately to the New York Post
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:46:00.480]  in an effort to salvage the story and make sure it was widely reported. Very good move,
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:09.360]  in my opinion, by the mayor. This issue is so devastating that the mainstream media is determined
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:16.400]  to make sure the American people do not know about it by next Tuesday, which is why for all
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:23.600]  those info warriors out there, you can take the links from Fox, from Info Wars, from any other of
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:31.280]  the legitimate news organizations that are covering it in detail, take the link to Tucker Carlson's
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:39.040]  historic hour-long show last night, in which he got the highest ratings of his entire television
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:45.920]  career, and get that out to people you know who are undecided, who aren't that interested,
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:52.160]  but you could convince to vote for the president. This is going to be an election in which every
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:59.520]  single vote counts. When I run into Trump supporters, and I do every day, who tell me it's
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:07.120]  going to be a landslide. It's going to be a walk in the park. It's going to be easy. None of those
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:14.160]  things are true. I have no doubt if we had an honest election, the momentum is with the president.
[1:47:14.160 --> 1:47:20.880]  He's a happy warrior. He is running an upbeat, interesting, enthusiastic campaign talking about
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:26.960]  how great America can be, what he already has achieved, rebuilding our military strength,
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:35.680]  the highest wage growth, the highest unemployment in history, the highest job creation in our
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:42.400]  history. If he did it once, he has the formula to do it again. Joe Biden is preaching higher
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:50.160]  tax increases, more regulation, masks for the next four years, mandatory. Even if you're driving
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:56.000]  down a federal highway in the car by yourself, you will be arrested if you are not wearing.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.560]  I mean, this is total cult. In fact, roll that video we showed earlier of Biden walking out with
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.800]  people in little circles, and then Trump landing the helicopter. This is a cult of control.
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:09.360]  Gates says 10 years. The UN says forever, but China is open for business. I mean,
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:14.080]  this is their excuse to make us all criminals, to track traces and forcibly inoculate us.
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:19.280]  It's just madness. The Democratic Party has become a psychotic chai-com weapon.
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:26.160]  No, there's no question. The influence of the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic Party
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:34.400]  is now deep. I'd say it is one of control. The Biden story will not go away whether he wins or loses.
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:41.360]  He will need to be prosecuted for those crimes or removed from office once they are proven.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.120]  Should he win? Well, that's another question. If he did win, he's totally destroyed.
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  Even Kamala's involved with the chai-coms. I mean, what are they thinking? This is insane.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:52.080]  They've got to pull out because the word I've gotten is, and I've talked to some high-level
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:55.120]  folks, like, off air, you should probably talk. They're warning me. Our phones are all tapped.
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:01.680]  We already know that. Is that that's why they dribbled out this stuff, hoping Biden doesn't
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:06.720]  try to contest the election and run the scam. But they're not giving up. They don't care if the chai-com
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:10.640]  stuff comes out or the pedophilia. The word is, they're just going to go for it no matter what.
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:16.000]  They're crazy. Well, I think that's exactly right. So let's say we have an honest and true result in
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:23.280]  which the president wins. They will dispute it. And then right out of the Norm Eisen dirty trickster
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.160]  playbook, they will fight us in the courts. At the same time, violent thugs will be
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:37.520]  beating Trump supporters and trying to burn down our cities as a pressure point on the
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:43.840]  decision-making process. The idea that the proud boys are going to be harassing and
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  intimidating voters on election day at polling places is not only a laughable joke, but it is
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:57.520]  proof positive that the left always does that exact thing that they accuse us of. They are the ones
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:02.880]  that have the numbers, the funding, the structure, the organization, the lawyers, the bail money
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:09.440]  to do exactly that. Because of our distrust for mail-in voting, it's more important to get
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:15.600]  Trump voters to the polls on election day, including many, many senior citizens who watching
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:21.200]  television no longer trust absentee ballots and want to vote in person. And isn't that why
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:24.480]  mainstream media said, oh, everybody's got to vote early, but folks haven't actually taken the
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:30.320]  bait. They haven't done it. I think that's good news. I think the majority of our vote is still
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:35.040]  out there, although I think interestingly enough, in the early voting in Florida so far,
[1:50:35.040 --> 1:50:43.360]  more Republicans have early voted than Democrats. A very good sign. So I feel good. I'm optimistic.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:49.040]  The president is running exactly the campaign you would expect him to. He is being Donald Trump,
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:54.000]  and the people love it. He's audacious. He's daring. He's got a great record to run on.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.680]  But we've all got to take people to the polls. We've all got to get involved now. Don't wait.
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.600]  Five and a half days out. Roger, what's the best website of the plethora you've got for folks to
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:07.360]  visit for uncensored election news? Well, right now you should go to StoneColdTruth.com. It's
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:16.400]  about to get a total makeover. But StoneColdTruth.com is where you can go. If you are a desirous of
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:22.960]  your very own Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt, you can either go to the InfoWars website.
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:28.800]  There's an excellent version there. Or you can go to fightback.store. All right. Amazing.
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:33.360]  Election night.news. Election night.news will be on with us. Election night at least by Skype.
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:57.440]  Hopefully in person. Roger, thank you so much. Stay with us. Call straight ahead.
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:08.640]  Oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading germs. It's absolutely
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:12.560]  asinine. They could throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:17.680]  Know what this really is, is a contact tracing database. Again, this is admitted that everyone's
[1:52:17.680 --> 1:52:22.480]  being habituated in the scan to be part of. So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked
[1:52:22.480 --> 1:52:25.920]  officially. Now, your cell phone's already tracking. You already have home assistants
[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:29.920]  watching and listening to in your house. But now this is officially rolling the sound
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:33.920]  where you won't buy or sell, have a job, get an airplane without it. And Bill Gates even
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:36.480]  admits it. So think about that, folks, and we'll look out.
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:43.200]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you,
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.400]  whisper. And it's true. A lot of times, if somebody's shouting and yelling,
[1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:52.480]  even if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out.
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:58.080]  You know why I know that? Because I'm Alex Jones. And I've been pretty obnoxious over
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:02.720]  the years because I'm worried about the New World Order. And I read about all their plans
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:08.880]  to lock down civilization, start the third world and then enslave the first world. So I've
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:12.640]  been really, really loud and really, really aggressive. And we've had a big effect. But
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:18.320]  now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get people to
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:24.480]  think for themselves before it's too late. The lockdown, social distancing, the mask
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:30.320]  is meant to end human civilization. We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:36.480]  So this is live and death. Please share info wars.com and band on video and watch our live
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:54.960]  election coverage. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:15.440]  When you're out there, without care, yeah, I was out of time. But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:22.480]  Does that do too much? Haha. Does that make me crazy? I don't believe it.
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:28.240]  The world of people that are slaves, the guy that wants to be free is crazy.
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:41.120]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls here for the next 30 minutes. Then we
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:46.160]  got Joe Arpaio, the famous sheriff joining us, who's been holding the longest here out of these
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:51.360]  great people. Natasha in Arizona, speaking of Joe Arpaio, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:59.280]  Hey, Alex. Can you hear me? I can. Thanks for calling. Hey, I just wanted to talk to you and
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:06.160]  tell you, you know, if you really want to defeat the communist takeover, you have to defeat the
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:14.240]  basis of the communist ideology. And the basis of it is evolution. And yesterday, when you were on
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:26.240]  out Joe Rogan's show, you had a chance to totally destroy communism by saying God is the creator
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:35.600]  of all. And you didn't do that. And it is a disgrace to me. Well, keep going. Keep telling me. It's
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:42.720]  fine. Well, that's all that's what I have to say. And I hope that when you're on on election night
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  on Joe Rogan's podcast that you can set the record straight. Well, I mean, just to be clear,
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:57.840]  I don't believe in the official system of evolution. I also don't believe what preachers
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:02.800]  in the United States 200 years ago said about the age of the earth and their interpretation of the
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.840]  Bible. That's why there's over 5000 sex of Christianity on the world, because other people
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:13.680]  don't agree with each other. And I've read deeper into the Bible and, you know, what God talks about
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:19.360]  and things that God's done before. And when you actually mean the main line Baptist main line
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:26.320]  Catholics, they talk about Nephilim and, you know, the sons of God, the daughters of men,
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:31.120]  and then the genetics were improper. So God wiped everybody out. That's clearly genetic
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:36.240]  engineering. It describes it all. It's all the other ancient Egyptian and Babylonian and other
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:41.360]  texts. And it mirrors what the Bible says, you know, fulfilling that it's that it's accurate.
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:48.320]  And then you'll get some preacher, you know, that doesn't agree with that and says he's God.
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:51.440]  So I'll read the Bible. I'll interpret it the way I want to with the Holy Spirit.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:57.440]  I'm not going to go through a priest, whether it be a Protestant or Catholic or an Imam or
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:02.480]  anybody else. Christ told me to go directly to God. And that's what I do. And if you look at the
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:08.000]  globalist wanting to be God again, genetically engineering, changing us, Genesis says, as in
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:12.640]  the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the son of man. And it says, and again,
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:19.360]  they will change the genetics, the seed of humans. You know, the ancient Sanskrit and the ancient
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:25.520]  documents from not just the Babylonians, the Egyptians, but others show the double snake
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:33.600]  being the human code. And that's, that's the double helix. They already knew all this. Plato,
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:39.840]  2,300 something years ago, everything he talks about, they've dug up or found except one thing.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:43.920]  And it also matches what the Bible says, matches with Plato, who was a main line historian,
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:50.560]  philosopher. He said out in the Atlantic Ocean, there was a giant base. And there were flying
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:55.840]  machines and a huge light pillar that shot up into the sky where, where, where these advanced
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:02.400]  humans had flying machines and flew around the world. And then it blew up. Okay. So
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:08.080]  I, I mean, I look into all of that. I believe in God. I love God. I'm fighting Satan. I'm
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:11.840]  fighting the New World Order. I'm fighting for the unborn, judge rebots, fruits, but I don't
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:18.320]  take the limited interpretation of these corrupt institutions. I mean, my God, the current Pope,
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:23.920]  ma'am says that, says that Christianity shouldn't be in Europe, basically, and that we should open
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:27.760]  our borders and that, and we should have, you know, same-sex marriage or whatever. And I'm not
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:31.120]  against people that are gay or whatever. I'm just saying that's a Christian institution or a human
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:35.040]  institution. It's being done as an attack on the family. And, and, and so that's where I'm coming
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.080]  from. But, you know, you write me a letter, tell me what I'm supposed to believe. And I'll, I'll,
[1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:49.680]  I'll see if I agree with you, but I just don't agree with every preacher comes down the road.

[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:20.480]  We're taking your calls broadcasting worldwide on this live Wednesday, October 28 transmission.
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:24.720]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, very honored and blessed to be here. I appreciate everybody calling even
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:29.120]  people that disagree with me and people that ask questions. I've got an open heart, doesn't mean
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:33.360]  I don't make mistakes, doesn't mean I'm a sinner, and I really appreciate all you and your information
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:39.600]  and the ideas you bring forward. Okay, should we talk to Casey, should we talk to Nathan,
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:47.120]  should we talk to Greg, Paul, I am Nick, Jason, Chad, Mr. J, Jonathan, let's go to who's been
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:50.800]  on the longest here. Let's go to Chad in Canada. Chad, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.840]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, sir, go ahead. Okay, I've got a question for you, but hear me
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:02.800]  out here first. You're a living legend, and we want you to stay here and be healthy for a long
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:08.720]  time. Now, I believe your supplements and products are great, but you need to lose the excess weight
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.600]  now by switching up the eating habits and working out with oh, I've always said that I've got good
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  ideas, doesn't mean I follow them all. And then I eat too much and work too much and do a lot of
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:22.880]  the things. I totally agree with you. But I just want the best for you. Like I'm saying, like,
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:27.440]  you know, get him some watermelon, papaya, whatever you got. As soon as Trump wins this election,
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:30.960]  and I hope they don't contest it, but you know, they are as soon as we're over that hump, I didn't
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:36.160]  take a couple of weeks off because I am just, I'm not the Superman like Trump is. I'm worn out,
[2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:40.720]  and I'm exhausted, and I totally agree with you, brother. You've got to do it because I don't want
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:44.880]  you killing yourself with the daily grind. So God damn much. I know how hard I hear you, Chad. You
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:49.760]  want to talk about the perfect storm scandals in the election? Go ahead. Absolutely. Yes, sir. I'm
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:55.840]  wondering, is honestly his child pedophilia rape and torture the only thing that will wake the
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:02.320]  leftists up? Is that it? Yes, I think that's it, brother. I mean, here's an example. Another
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:07.440]  incredible gateway upon an article they picked up on local news. Looter calls Philly police to report
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:13.280]  looting after fellow looters steal his car. There's video of this on the news where, oh,
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:18.480]  I'm robbing, but now you stole my car, so I'm going to call the police. It's like when Black Lives
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:23.280]  Matter is like shooting at cops and somebody shoots them, they call the police. There's no
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:29.600]  logic in this. I agree completely. And you know what? I'm calling from British Columbia. Everybody
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:33.520]  here in Canada, lots of people here were polling for you. We're polling for America, too, just like
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:38.640]  everybody around the world. Trump is a worldwide movement, and that's just the way it's going
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:43.600]  right now. I agree with you, but I'd say this. Trump caught the populist way of things, a great guy,
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:48.720]  but its populism is a worldwide, global awakening is a worldwide movement, and I really appreciate
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:54.000]  your calling. Anything else? No, that's it. God bless you and just do what I said, brother,
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.320]  because I want to. I totally agree with you. I am a wreck, and I've just had so much stress
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:03.920]  worried about this election and everything, and I've taken it all myself, and I've just,
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:08.960]  I've been clenching my teeth till they fall apart. I've been, I even go for like 10 mile hikes,
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:15.280]  and I'm still just fried, and I agree. I need some time in the dry dock, because all I do is think
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:20.080]  about this, man. I have dreams all night about it. I just, it's all I do, and I appreciate you,
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:24.480]  and I'm going to take a break. Hopefully you have such a landslide, but you know it's not going to
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:30.080]  be that. It's going to be a damn nightmare. So whatever. I'm here. I'm honored to be here,
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:33.920]  and I appreciate you. All right. Who's up next here? Who's been on the longest now?
[2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:38.320]  That'd be
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.920]  Jonathan in South Carolina. Go ahead. Thanks.
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:48.560]  Alex, it is wonderful to talk to you. Thank you. Go ahead.
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:52.960]  I would like to start by saying I am honored and humbled to be a member of the best
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:56.160]  and strongest family on this planet. That is the Info Wars family.
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:00.640]  We are a family brother, and we're a little dysfunctional, but we mean well, and we've
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:06.480]  had huge success, haven't we? We certainly have. And a little bit of dysfunction, I think,
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:15.360]  is required to make it all work. I actually, I guess to follow up with the woman who was
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:23.120]  kind of giving you a little bit of grief about not speaking up for God, I think we all understand
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:29.440]  that our Creator is the only reason that we are still here doing this, and that the time is coming
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:38.560]  that we're going to have to fight and possibly die. For that, for that reason, we're here to
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:43.360]  try off good or questionary, fight off bad with good. Now, what is that?
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:46.240]  By the way, your phone's breaking up a bit, but I'll go back to you in a moment if it stabilizes.
[2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:50.480]  I don't know any billionaires, any globalists that believe in evolution. They know it's
[2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:55.920]  completely made up. They know stuff doesn't go over millions of years. I never get into that,
[2:04:55.920 --> 2:05:01.280]  but I don't go off preacher's model of a 6,000-year-old Earth, and if I don't agree with them,
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:07.600]  it doesn't mean that I'm a sinner. It's very, or a devil works for basically, that I'm sinning
[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:12.640]  because of that. I am a sinner, but not because of that. And so, this pharacetical view that if you
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:17.760]  don't agree with whatever this church is saying, or this group is saying, I've read the Bible,
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.560]  it says things very clearly to me about what's going to pass, and it's happening. The genetic
[2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:27.600]  engineering, the world government, all this stuff. And so, nothing against these preachers. I'm not
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:30.880]  saying they're not going to heaven or whatever, but they're not connected to God. I'm just saying
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:38.080]  they're not my God. Jesus Christ is. And so, we had a call earlier saying you got to say Yahweh,
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:42.640]  but you're not going to basically break through and go to heaven. Well, I'm not against folks that
[2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:47.280]  use the word Yahweh, but the Bible talks about people fighting over God's name. I have the Holy
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:52.240]  Spirit. I have a relationship with God. I want life. I want justice. And I don't need 10,000
[2:05:52.240 --> 2:05:57.360]  denominations telling me what to do all day. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. And one of the ways
[2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:03.200]  I was fighting this morning, actually, David Knight, taught a story about an infall warrior.
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:07.760]  Back off your phone a little bit. Okay, yeah. Go ahead and try it again.
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:14.480]  I can't do it, brother. I got to let you go. If I can't understand you,
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:17.840]  it means the listeners can't call me back. You've got a phone that works. I really appreciate your
[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:23.520]  call. I'll share another call. We kind of get into the calls today about you need to lose weight,
[2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:30.320]  Jones. You need to speak out against evolution because I was on that show talking about how
[2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:35.920]  our bodies are a genetic mix of all of our ancestors, but our bodies are our earthsuits
[2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:41.440]  that our spirit sits in. And that's what the Bible clearly says. I wasn't sitting there
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:45.520]  saying that we don't have a spirit and we are nothing but our ancestors. She totally didn't
[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:51.760]  even get that. And so just you go ahead and have your view and I'm going to have mine. Okay,
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:06:57.040]  because I've seen it. All right, let's take another call here. Let's talk to Paul in California.
[2:06:57.040 --> 2:07:04.720]  Paul, you're on the air and welcome. Yeah, I'm wondering if Roger is informed what with all the
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:12.720]  mail-in voting and the poll watchers not allowed. Roger seems to still be under the impression
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:22.000]  of an honest vote count. Also, your vitamins, your vitaminal effusion doesn't have table salt.
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:28.800]  I was shall we say irregular until I started supplementing with table salt.
[2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:33.680]  Well, you certainly do need salt, but a lot of folks get pissed. I agree, salt's one of the most
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:36.800]  important things you can take, but a lot of folks get mad if you put it in a supplement.
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:45.200]  Well, anyway, I'm wondering with this January 20th, the presidency leaves,
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:51.040]  are we going to be without a president? Well, that's what the 20th Amendment says,
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:53.920]  is that the House of Representatives goes to the states and they have this big vote
[2:07:53.920 --> 2:07:57.520]  and Pelosi would be over it. But yeah, that's what they're going to try.
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:05.440]  So far, the courts have been mixed, but about, I haven't done the math, but the majority of federal
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:10.480]  courts have said that the states can't keep voting going on for weeks or months, but some are still
[2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:14.800]  going to do it. And then when the courts block it, the liberals are going to, the left's going to
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:21.760]  say it's illegitimate and trigger race riots. That's the plan. Well, anyway, if we're without
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:28.800]  anybody on the nuclear football, it just seems to me a wide open America.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.640]  I totally agree with you. Thank you so much, Paul. Let's just jam in one more right now.
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:41.360]  Casey in North Dakota. Go ahead, Casey. Hey there, Alex. We're riding on the razor's edge
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:45.680]  with you too right now and hopefully we get a little break in a week, but we know it's not
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:51.280]  going to last. I kind of got this uneasy feeling. I mean, it's great news hearing about Ray and
[2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.200]  Haspel. They're on their way out, which is long overdue. I don't even know why they're still there.
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:02.800]  And with everything coming out, I mean, it's great, but I've got this uneasy feeling yet,
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:07.120]  even though things are the tights turning mass. Well, yeah, because evil forces are making their
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:10.800]  move. I have a very uneasy feeling as well. And that feeling is important because that's your
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:16.160]  subconscious in your spirit. What are you seeing? Think about when you visualize, I'm going to go
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:22.400]  to break, come back to you. Don't hang up, Casey. Visualize why you're uneasy and then tell us why
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:28.640]  when we come back. And then Nathan and Greg and I am and Nick and Jason and Mr. J. Like Mr. J is
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:32.960]  right after the next caller than Jason and others. Your calls are straight ahead. Hey,
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:36.160]  this is a battle and it's good and evil. It's supposed to be exhausting. Not supposed to be
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:41.280]  easy, but I think we're going to win with God's help. Stay with us. We'll be right back. Infowars.com
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:48.480]  and alexandknight.news. Much of the time on big issues and societal developments,
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:54.480]  Infowars is many, many years ahead and almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today,
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.120]  but there's a blind spot that Infowars has. I've noticed that really informed people
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:03.120]  have this as well. I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most performable out there.
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:06.640]  So I want you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:14.160]  day. This Hunterbyte laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him where he admits
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:20.320]  he works under the communist Chinese spy chief. He should be arrested right now. That is so huge.
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:27.040]  That is hiding in plain view and it's getting almost no attention. We have to get that information
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:33.680]  out to everybody. It's all posted on Infowars.com, so many other major patriotic sites, but we need
[2:10:33.680 --> 2:10:38.480]  to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this. We knew it a long time ago.
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.240]  So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us what we didn't know. The point is now it's
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:49.040]  documented, now it's proven. It was 30 months ago that Infowars and of course yours truly Alex
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:55.920]  Jones was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook who
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:01.120]  helps China run giant death camps. Always just let that be in the back of your mind. We talk about
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:07.120]  these monsters and where they're taking us. They have no bottom. People said, Jones, how are you
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:11.280]  taking it? I said, I'm taking it just fine. They're coming for you next. This is a technocracy. They're
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:16.400]  emerging with Big Pharma. They're taking over the media. This is a digital psychological dictatorship
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:21.280]  in their own words. This is a planetary takeover. They're then going to start locking us in our
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:27.520]  houses using supposed plague threats. That's so the wireless system can come into place with
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:31.760]  the driverless cars and the robot takeover. How did I know all this would happen? Because they've
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:37.040]  been saying they're going to do it. You see, it's not that I'm psychic. I know how to read what
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:41.840]  these monsters are saying. So you have to understand as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:59.280]  me. It comes from them. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:07.360]  Now listen up.
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:16.080]  Joe Rogan just sent me this link. He botifies and fitting out with Jones' appearance on the Joe
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:23.440]  Rogan experience. Somebody inside leaked it. There were operatives in there going. These people are
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:30.480]  attacking Jones and making stuff up Jones didn't say. Which is true. It doesn't matter. They realize
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:37.200]  that if they let their woke audience of leftist gang up, who's only part of their audience and
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:41.120]  tell them what they can't have, what's going to happen to all the rap music and the rest of it?
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:47.280]  It's insane. Or the comics or the other podcast. This is just a mob wanting to control reality.
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:51.920]  The good news is people are waking up big time to it. It's backfiring. The tide is turning.
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:57.200]  Casey in North Dakota. I still have an uneasy feeling. I agree with you. I don't think we won
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:02.080]  the election yet far from it. I just see a big awakening happening. But is it too little too
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:10.640]  late? Why are you uneasy? Well, just just knowing that when these people start going down, they're
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:18.400]  not going to just throw up the white flag and and walk walk away and cuffs easily. They're
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:24.720]  going to I just I know they're going to trigger something, whether that's another virus, hope,
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:29.680]  file weapon, trigger a war. And that's the thing I was asking back in December. I said they're
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:34.640]  going to fail in this impeachment. What is the next thing up their sleeve? And we saw COVID.
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:39.120]  Exactly. So we should be debating and looking on the horizon. What is the next thing they've
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.320]  got cooked up? Stock market crash? What do you think? Yeah, definitely. I mean, I'm working
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:49.680]  out in the box and I serve my own business in June. I've been a crane operator out in the
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:54.960]  oil field for 10 years and just poof. Thank you, China and globalists, the assholes. But anyways,
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:00.320]  I took the leap and said, well, we've got to make it work. So I've been fucked in my ass like you
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:08.080]  guys. Casey, here's an example. Two months ago, a guy hit me, not T bone, but kind of in the back
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.480]  on the side at the same time, whenever you call it a half T bone, and it broke the axle on my
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:22.560]  Chevy vehicle. And they told me, oh, because of COVID, we don't have axles. You might get one
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:28.000]  in six months a year for a Chevy Tahoe. So think about that level of, I mean, we've got like a
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:32.240]  third of our products, we just can't get anymore. People are like, why is this product no longer
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:38.080]  available? Because everything's exactly, people don't get how serious this is. And for us, it's
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:41.760]  an inconvenience. You lose your job, moving with your parents, you know, whatever. I have a lot
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:44.960]  of family that have got college degrees, they're having to move in together. That's fine. But the
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:50.960]  third world, they starved to death, brother. Yeah, you know, we can't even comprehend what
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:54.160]  a lot of those people are going through in our thoughts or in prayers or with them.
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:58.240]  Yeah, the supply chain, building materials, I'm noticing it in my line of work,
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:03.360]  price of lumber. And here we've got force burning all over the United States.
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:07.600]  I mean, come on, where's the common sense? Let's, let's, let's open up some lumber mills. Let's,
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:12.080]  let's get things back together. And hopefully after the election and things came down,
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:15.760]  that's where we're headed with it. Well, you and the lawyers wrote all this up. So they come in,
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:20.240]  they do these rapid tests, most of them are false positives. They say half a 3000 person
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.120]  meat backing planets, real case, have COVID, none of them are sick. It's made up. It's made up.
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:30.400]  One person gets COVID in the damn warehouse. They shut it down. I mean, this is, this is causing
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:34.880]  a depression. Just what the big banks want. Casey, God bless you and thanks. All right,
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:41.600]  we got Jason in Texas. But first I'm going to go to, since we're talking about this, Greg,
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:46.080]  about the stock markets, elite scrambling, Merkel and Macron are super unpopular.
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.160]  They're using COVID for a permanent lockdown, but the doctors are revolting in Europe.
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:53.600]  Greg, give us your take on the situation. Hey, Alex, how are you?
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:57.600]  Man, I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest.
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:01.600]  Well, brother, keep it going. Stay healthy. Hey, uh, yeah, Merkel,
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:07.440]  Merkel's going to announce this lockdown all across Germany next week. Locking, I mean everything,
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:12.880]  restaurants, businesses, everything. Uh, Macron, Macron, I didn't catch what he was saying today,
[2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:18.160]  but he's supposed to come out with a speech today. Uh, the sell off on the stock market today, it's
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:25.120]  going between 800, 900 points down right now was on the, uh, on the big tech. That's the sell off.
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:32.560]  They just had, uh, about a half hour ago, uh, probably the most lame dog and pony show I've
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:39.680]  ever witnessed with Zuckerberg, uh, that, uh, uh, those other two clowns, uh, Dorsey and, um,
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:45.360]  uh, that guy with the, uh, you know, that weird beard, uh, I forget what his name is.
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:46.240]  Zach Dorsey, man.
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:56.160]  And he was, I mean, it's only in these, these senators, they're asking questions. I mean,
[2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:00.720]  it's like, they're, they're, they're not, they're not saying, well, you did this, you did that.
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:03.920]  They're not saying any proof. They're just asking questions and they're saying the same thing.
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:08.240]  Oh, we don't do that. We don't. And I didn't notice the senators aren't even in a hearing.
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:13.360]  Everyone's been isolated, put into these roles by this cult of cooks, working for the UN who
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:18.480]  were laughing at them because the Congress are a bunch of adult lawyers who were worried about
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:24.720]  liability. The lawyers got rid of dodgeball. They got rid of the pools. They got rid of the,
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:29.200]  of the diving boards. They're getting rid of everything. And so now the big tech knew how
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:32.320]  to manipulate them right into a prison and they're laughing at them.
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:38.080]  I tell you what's going on. Just what this fella said earlier, what you asked him if a crash is
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  coming. You know what it is? It's right now the stock market. It's like, dip your feet in the
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:49.120]  water. Okay. Now dip your dip, go into the water up to your knee. Now go up to your waist. That's
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:54.880]  what's going on. It's going back and forth, back and forth. They're bringing it out at all angles,
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:58.880]  trying to make trouble with that, trying to bring it out. Cause if they bring down to US,
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:05.520]  it happens in history. Anything goes wrong in the US. Yeah. Well, I predicted a week before the
[2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:10.720]  stock, a week, two days before they would plunge the stock market to herd Trump. Right. And the
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:15.520]  same thing to get Obama elected 2008. And it looks like they're trying to pull it right now.
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:19.680]  Dow's down 3%. But we'll see if they're successful. God bless you, Greg. Anything else?
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:25.840]  Well, I tell you what, Alex, keep it going, brother. I've been with you for 25 years and
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:30.560]  you know, good friend of mine and his father, you had him as a guest down there in Texas on their
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:36.560]  show 15 years ago. And that was great. You're doing great stuff. I can't believe it. Greg,
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:41.440]  we love you. We appreciate you. All right, let's take them to the call here. Let's talk to Jason
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:51.600]  in Texas. Jason, go ahead. Go ahead, Jason. Yeah, I've been listening for the last 15 years. And
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:56.640]  like you said, I'm tired. I've been spreading the message. Well, I feel like Roddy Piper and they
[2:18:56.640 --> 2:19:05.120]  live, I try to put the glasses on everybody. I keep fighting them. And you're exactly 100% right.
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:08.560]  I know exactly. They've already told us what they're going to do next.
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:14.800]  Eric Saul, well, if you go back, he said we're going to nuke our own cities. If we can pull
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:19.280]  that tweet up. Yeah, Swallows, well said. We will nuke the red stage to get your guns.
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:25.840]  Correct. That's exactly they don't care. They've killed us. They kill us for years. I mean,
[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:32.000]  they had the HIV and the Bayer aspirin, you know, they knew some is a communist Chinese agent. So
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:36.480]  so are the top. I mean, these are our enemies. They are sworn. They hate us. They love it.
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:42.720]  It's sick. I mean, I don't know how doctors are. Well, he's not a doctor. We'll get that out of the
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:47.680]  way. Bill Gates is no doctor. I don't know how him and George Soros are down the number one FBI's
[2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:52.640]  most wanted. That's because they put in a bunch of people at the top that are cowards that follow
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:20:00.640]  orders. Correct. Why are we all the listeners out there? You know, it's it's scary times right
[2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:07.760]  now. We need to be ready. And like Trump said, stand back and stand by. That's who he's talking to us.
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:12.160]  Let these people go out and destroy their cells in the streets like they already are.
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:16.880]  Look at them collecting money and all that, you know, that money, look at Venezuela,
[2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:21.520]  there's money laying all over the street. No one picks it up. It's not worth anything.
[2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:25.520]  Why? They don't do nothing here with the people breaking into the ACM. They ain't gonna be worth
[2:20:25.520 --> 2:20:32.000]  nothing. Damn right. And they'll they won't blame themselves. They'll blame us that tried to stop it.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:37.440]  Great points. All right, Sheriff R. Pio joins us and more of your calls. And I've got some big,
[2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:40.480]  big news. We're gonna be covering start of the next hour. Stay with us.
[2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:48.160]  Info wars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption
[2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:55.600]  for over two decades. It is why they attack us. And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:21:01.280]  in the world. The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:07.600]  Evil has infested governments everywhere. But the evil establishment is censoring content
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.160]  across all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing banned dot video on social media.
[2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:20.240]  So go to election night dot news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:30.000]  Go to election night dot news to find the truth about COVID vaccines, Bill Gates and big pharma.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:36.320]  Go to election night dot news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:45.920]  afraid of. Go to election night dot news and share now. In January and February of the year 2020,
[2:21:45.920 --> 2:21:51.760]  the Communist super state China working through the United Nations told the world how we are now
[2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:58.640]  supposed to live our lives after COVID permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps to track
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:04.640]  everywhere we go. And what we do contact tracers come into our doors with the police and dragging
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:12.160]  us away. This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover. And it's never going to end until we
[2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:18.000]  start standing up and saying no. Already Fauci and the WHO and the Communist Chinese are all over
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:25.600]  the news saying the lockdowns are permanent. Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:31.360]  restrictions are raised. By then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:37.360]  slavery. And it will never end. This is the authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist.
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:40.240]  Everyone must speak up. Everyone must say no now.
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:47.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:23:05.520]  Well, I couldn't think of somebody better to pop in with us than Sheriff Joe Arpaio,
[2:23:06.240 --> 2:23:11.840]  an American legend. And that's the new book. The Sheriff's own words with David Thomas Roberts
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:16.320]  Ford about dead Nugent. I haven't read the books. I just got it today, but I'm going to be reading it.
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:21.120]  He predicted everything that's happening now. We have police being run over in Philadelphia,
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:26.480]  run over in LA, the media celebrating it, the police running from looters, just insane garbage,
[2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:33.040]  the U.N. saying they're going to oversee our election. Sheriff Arpaio was convicted by a judge
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:40.000]  without a jury of not following her orders, I guess contempt. The president had to harden him.
[2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:44.240]  Now we see the judicial tyranny of this other judge, even after the Justice Department drops
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:50.400]  charges on General Flynn, the judge continues the prosecution, not in the Constitution. So he
[2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:56.160]  joins us. Let's talk about the book. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an American legend. You can find it at
[2:23:56.160 --> 2:24:03.920]  real Sheriff Joe on Twitter or at defiancepress.com. And of course, on Amazon everywhere else,
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:10.720]  he's here with us right now. Sheriff, the state of the world, the election five and a half days
[2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:15.840]  now. What is your just view on what's happening and where our republic is? You're a famous retired
[2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:21.040]  DEA agent. And then of course, you get a famous sheriff there in Phoenix, Arizona battling to
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:26.000]  keep the area free. And now, I mean, this is just an unbelievable time. How would you describe this?
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:33.920]  Well, first of all, great to see you again, Alex. We had a lot of fun in the past, but thanks for
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:44.720]  continuously telling us like it is. We're trying, sir. So it's sad what's going on. I was hurt
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:54.560]  Donald Trump, July 2015. I was the only one to support him then it looked like I talked about
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:25:01.120]  elected officials. I got introduced them and I said three things out. There's a silent majority
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:08.560]  out there. We're born on the same day, flag day. And you're going to be the next president. I guess
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:15.520]  I was right. I never had a hero in my life. It took me 80 years. When NBC interviewed me last
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:22.480]  year, it says, John McCain, your hero. And I pause and I said, I found my hero four months ago at
[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:31.360]  when the question was asked, woke up, told my wife of 62 years, took me 80 years to find my hero. And
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:39.280]  we have to do everything we can to get him back in office. So anyway, just doing my job. This is
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:45.920]  the third book I wrote the first one that I was with the sheriff. And you know, Alex, that people
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:53.920]  do not cover stories that they don't want to cover. I'm one guy, they sure don't want to cover,
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:26:00.160]  especially one chapter in there called the fake birth certificate of Obama.
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:05.120]  Let's get into that now because they've tried to put me in prison. They tried to put you in prison,
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:10.800]  trying to put Trump in prison. I mean, the left's control of the Justice Department is just staggering.
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:16.160]  Hopefully, hopefully Trump gets control of it. We can have justice, but this has been crazy.
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:27.920]  Well, you know, I've been around law enforcement over 55 years. I'm 88. I forgot my age. 88. So I
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:35.440]  have life experience like you do. In common sense, that's what kept me going for all those years.
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:44.400]  And what burns me up, Alex, to me is the biggest coverup. Now, the president has his theory on
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:51.200]  coverups, but sometimes his coverups are the same people that covered my stuff up. It's not
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:55.440]  just a birth certificate. Well, let's just say you were the first to break with DEA documents,
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:26:59.520]  well, through youth, or another source, you don't want the credit that Trump was being
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.480]  illegally spied on. My name was in there too, going back years under Obama. So I'm just saying
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:07.920]  you've, you've been there putting it on the line. You've been hitting the bar bar.
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:18.400]  Well, you know, a lot of this came as sure, although I, you know, I was headed to DEA
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:25.600]  in Turkey, Syria, Mexico, Latin America and go on and on. I worked around the corruption. I knew
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:32.160]  how CIA operates. I knew how intelligence operates, whether they're foreign or the United States. So
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:40.720]  I've been there. I lived all that overseas. And I took that experience. It went in my mind.
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:47.040]  And I took it and as the elected constitutional sheriff,
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:55.600]  everything I knew, other than being the sheriff, I felt I had to take action. I just can't keep
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:28:00.320]  it. Well, you did. But let's be clear. They did do illegal kill attempt. They were spying on him.
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:04.480]  You, at least through your contacts, you didn't want the credit, but it was through your contacts
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:12.400]  that we first proved Trump was being illegally spied on. Yeah. And who's that clapper and the
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:20.480]  other guy? Yeah, this was on TV. We had his number way before to a sensitive source. And
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:23.520]  they had nothing to do with the bursaries, I think.
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.880]  Britain is an admitted Wahhabist. He converted and he's a communist. He admits he was a communist
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:35.600]  in college, voted communist twice. Okay. You talk about him. What about George Soros,
[2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:43.760]  our famous billionaire who gave $3 million to my Democrat opponent in 2016? How about the judge
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:50.640]  and Obama waited till the day before voters started to say they're going to charge. We would
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:56.640]  contempt the court, put me in jail for six months. That's a Mickey Mouse charge. It's,
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:04.240]  it's like a, it's like a dog bite, same penalty. And then the judge, the second judge, because the
[2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:10.320]  first one hated me, who had a conflict of interest. When you have a judge's brother-in-law, it's a
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:19.520]  big shot with Covington burrowing. That's where Obama, a holder came from. And then he hears a
[2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:28.160]  case, wait years later, ACLU. And then his wife tells the people in a restaurant that he's going
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:34.960]  to do everything in his power to get rid of me, hates me. What is this? Why is it a judge
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:39.920]  still stay on the bench? New documents came out that even Biden and people have been meeting
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.240]  with Democrats in other areas to persecute other prominent Republicans. They really are
[2:29:44.240 --> 2:29:51.680]  little vindictive people, aren't they? Yeah, it's really sad, Alex. Very sad what's going on.
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:58.720]  When you were reporting several years ago, I'm sure you came up with a lot of information.
[2:29:59.280 --> 2:30:05.760]  But here we are today, Alex. And I know you must be saying, hey, you know, you had the right thing.
[2:30:06.400 --> 2:30:10.320]  Let me ask you this question. The book is Sheriff Joe, a pilot American legend. Why did you have
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:14.720]  the right stuff and the courage? And why doesn't Ray have it? I mean, Trump's even saying he wants
[2:30:14.720 --> 2:30:19.040]  to fire him. Why the hell won't Ray do his job when we have Hunter Biden and his son dead to
[2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:25.360]  rights admitting they work for Communist Chinese? Do we have their ass? Well, you know, I was a
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:34.880]  bureaucrat for years and always had a boss. I was ahead of many DEA offices overseas and the
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:43.040]  United States, I've been in positions just by chance, just by chance of being, you know,
[2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:49.440]  around certain officials, like the former attorney general, clientee, so I can go on and on.
[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:58.400]  And also being Sheriff, I was the honorary chairman of George Bush, Mitt Romney,
[2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:05.360]  Rick Perry, they all come knocking on the door for my endorsements and I campaigned for them.
[2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:14.720]  Of course, they forgot my name now, you know, how that works. I don't care. So I'm very disappointed
[2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:20.880]  in our government. I'm disappointed that the people that criticize the president,
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:28.320]  I'm disappointed in generals, generals of bad mouth and the chief, you know,
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:35.360]  our guy, the president, commander in chief, why did they do that? They took an oath of office.
[2:31:36.160 --> 2:31:41.200]  Even though they're retired, you're still drawing a pension. Why are they still going after
[2:31:42.080 --> 2:31:48.720]  President Trump? And so in worse than that, you're supporting the Democrat Biden. But why
[2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:52.560]  did he keep bad mouths in our presence? We know why because they're being blackmailed in there on
[2:31:52.560 --> 2:31:56.400]  the Chinese payroll. But the good news is it's coming out. I want to talk about some of the best
[2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:00.240]  chapters in your book. I'm going to read it this weekend. I got so much coming the next few days,
[2:32:00.240 --> 2:32:04.320]  won't be able to, but the election, what you think is coming up with the election. It's a piece of
[2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:10.400]  history flipping through it. All these photographs picture you with your dad right here. This is
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:15.360]  pretty amazing, Sheriff. And you're a living legend, 88. I hope I make it 88, but you look like
[2:32:15.360 --> 2:32:20.640]  you're about 70. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is our guest when we get this living legend on Sheriff Joe
[2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:26.160]  Arpaio, an American legend. And you can find the books by searching that term, defiancepress.com,
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:31.520]  port slash Joe defiancepress.com, forward slash show with all the tech censorship. It's important
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:36.720]  to have hard copies of history now more than ever will be right back with Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Then
[2:32:36.720 --> 2:32:46.720]  the fourth hour. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful
[2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:51.840]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[2:32:51.840 --> 2:32:58.240]  degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com.
[2:32:58.240 --> 2:33:03.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood
[2:33:03.920 --> 2:33:09.920]  pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[2:33:09.920 --> 2:33:16.240]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:23.040]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:30.080]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:36.400]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:34:02.400]  for a friend, family member or yourself at info wars store.com.
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:12.400]  It's not as deadly as they said it's so important because this is a UN Bill Gates globalist deployed
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:17.600]  corporate takeover where there are businesses are all essential but our businesses aren't.
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:25.440]  This is destroying the world economy by design. This is economic warfare. This is war crime and
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:29.120]  now they're coming with the attempted forced inoculations that Gates is pushing. Well,
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:34.480]  you know what that is that violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code and so much more.
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:40.240]  Please spread the words. Please tell folks about Bandot video and the facts that are posted there.
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:48.880]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understand what our
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:55.680]  listeners understand what Donald Trump understands. We are in a digital civil war. There are giant
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:35:01.840]  filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech platform and now they're
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:08.240]  doing it to the private apps. They're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email. This
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:14.800]  is mafia organized crime election meddling. But finally, when they blocked the Hunter Biden and
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:20.240]  the barisma information and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:25.440]  rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied it. Finally, Congress got pissed
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:29.760]  and said this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're taking action. Oh, and check
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.240]  doors. Oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident. But they keep pushing and pushing
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:39.040]  because no one ever calls their bluff. Well, info wars is calling their bluff. And I want to thank
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:45.920]  you all for keeping us on the air. Six months ago, the highly respected former head of the
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:54.320]  Rockefeller Hospital virology department went public and said the mainline science on virology is
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:59.440]  you cannot protect somebody from a virus like this. You have to wait till there's herd immunity
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:04.800]  and there's never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses. They do not work.
[2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:10.240]  Well, even Bill Gates now admits, oh, the vaccine will really never work. But you have to keep
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:14.880]  social distancing and wearing masks. They're now saying forever. Last week, it was 10 years. Now
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:20.320]  it's forever. See how the power grab works. So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and a
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.480]  chief established surrender to coronavirus, when they say we just have to learn to live with it
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:30.640]  and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and of course, zinc, that's the reality.
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:35.600]  That's not fear mongering. That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:40.080]  new world order. They create a problem to which there is no solution. But they are again the people
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:56.000]  that said they've got to be in charge. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio is our guest with just five and a half days after the election. Sheriff,
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:16.560]  you are a living legend. You've done so much. You fought so hard for freedom. You are one of the
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:21.760]  first right after Ann Coulter, about the second person endorsed by all from me to smell victory.
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:25.680]  And boy, he not delivered the last four years under unprecedented attack. I can ask a lot of
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:29.200]  questions. I can ask what chapters of the book are the best. You've got the floor the next 10
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:36.480]  minutes. What do you want to cover right now, my friend? Well, you know, Davis, Thomas Roberts,
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:46.240]  let's not forget him. He's those publisher, Defiance Press. He's a patriot, great guy. I felt
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:57.200]  comfortable dealing with him. And he helped me through that whole process. So I had to give
[2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:06.000]  him credit. But you know what, Alex, everything in that book, I kept copies. The day I was born,
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:18.400]  all over the world, I kept copies of everything, kept copies of the shows that I had the opportunity
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:28.000]  to talk to you during the years. And so I feel comfortable with the book. Very comfortable.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  I went through some chapters. The two big ones were the racial, if you want to call it, I call
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:47.520]  witch hunt situation where they went after the Obama administration. And then the other one,
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:54.560]  of course, is the birth certificate. But I talk about McCain. I talk about Flake. I talk about
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:39:02.320]  the tense, the policies I can go on and on, talk about my experience overseas, because the public
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:09.920]  never realized my other 28 years of service, especially with the federal drug enforcers.
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:16.080]  So I have to get it out, Alex, because the media will not cover the main media.
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:21.840]  And they obsess over taking over history and lying about it. And you were the first to warn
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:26.480]  that the border was collapsing. I remember like 25 years ago, you were covering it. And boy,
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:28.560]  the UN is now involved trying to break our border.
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:34.960]  But Alex, it's your show. I'm not supposed to ask you any questions.
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:35.520]  No, go ahead.
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:42.320]  I bet you can't answer it. No, I bet you will answer it. I want to know why and how.
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:49.520]  Let's take the birth certificate. Forget everything else is similar. I want to know why.
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:59.280]  No one, no one, no media, no government, no elected officials, no Congress will ever talk
[2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:08.080]  about this. And I have it 150% guaranteed. Why would someone come to me after five years
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:14.240]  investigative and say, sure, you've been around a long time. Can we read your report?
[2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:21.520]  Or all we want to do is read it. Nobody even wants to read the report. That is a false,
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:25.680]  fake government document. I don't care where he came from.
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:29.520]  Sure. You got, you got top forensic experts in the world look at it, but they put it out in
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:33.680]  six layers when they did. They put it out, I think on purpose, showing it was fake to flaunt
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.000]  it in our face. Or why do you think it was so obviously fake? Why do you think Hunter Biden
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.200]  left his laptop inside that shop? I mean, why do criminals want to get caught? Or why do they
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:54.080]  flaunt it? Well, it is sad for our country when you have these types of cover ups, involving
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:41:02.400]  politics. And right now the mission is to get rid of our president. That's it. Get rid of our
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:11.280]  president and causing this situation with the economy. And you're kind of more of an expert
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:16.000]  on what's going on with the virus. I have my own ideas. No, no, we want to hear your idea. I mean,
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:20.800]  it sounds like you get it. It's an economic weapon to crash the economy. It's way overexaggerated.
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:27.600]  I mean, that's all been proven. Okay, let me bring you back to 2009. And that's when they
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:35.760]  really went after me. When I interviewed 10 illegals in my 10 city, they were from Mexico.
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:43.680]  So we had something called the swine flu. I think 60 million people were affected with that
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:54.720]  flu. And I show south of Mexico City that most of the people there had the flu. I went public on
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:03.200]  that. I think I only one person listened to me. I think that was Kabuto when Fox used to talk to
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:12.160]  me. They don't talk to me anymore. And nobody would print when I said nobody expand on that 1.4
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:19.200]  million 1.4 million Americans died in 2019 from TV 220,000 have died from COVID with exaggerated
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:24.720]  numbers. So you would warn about TV. You tried to block it. You were a bad guy. But now shut the
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:29.280]  whole country down shut the whole world down. Don't go to Christmas. Don't go to don't go to
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:33.760]  Thanksgiving because somebody might get sick. It doesn't hold water. The left remember used to say
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:38.480]  it was racist to worry about diseases coming across borders, which is why we have borders or
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:46.000]  Ellis Island. Yeah, but Alex, that was 2009. I had to throw something else in on this. You know,
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.480]  after presidents take office, they do a 100 page or what they're going to do.
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:58.000]  Why was my name mentioned? Holder and that bunch. Why did they say we're going to go after Sheriff
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.880]  Joe Arpaio because they're worried about local government organizing the people to defend the
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:09.040]  country under the whole UN Bill Gates towards Soros plan. They want to take control of law
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:15.600]  enforcement and you were an example of what they didn't want. Well, they even said they
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:20.400]  didn't have any evidence. I'm going back to 2009 with a swine flu. I'm sure they're not happy. I
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:25.920]  brought that up because they had to do with illegal immigration too. But why did they tap me on that
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:35.760]  year? Why are it tap me? And also, that's the year that just by chance, I met with Obama.
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:43.440]  And then Biden came to town did a courtesy meeting with him. Secret service lined it up.
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:50.560]  Why did that's the only time in history? I never never got a photograph. They lost a
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:59.440]  photograph. You know why? Biden didn't want me to be photographed with him because he forgot.
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:06.320]  He was investigating me. Someone had a tip of a moth. So that photo went in a garbage, I guess.
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:10.960]  Maybe he has it. That's another question. How could you have a better example of a president
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:17.120]  with Trump versus a more low down example of Biden? How in the hell could we even be considering
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:24.240]  putting that little lying chai-com operative in the White House? Well, I don't want to incel you,
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:32.880]  but you have more knowledge than Biden even only spent 47 years. You probably could win the election
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:37.520]  more than he could win the election. Except the money is propping him up and has all these people
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:46.560]  voting in the name of dead people. So yeah, that's good. So, you know, I never seen anything like
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:53.200]  this in my life and career. And it's sad what they're doing throwing cops under the bus because
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:45:01.600]  the video shows circumstances. All these mayors and governors have no guts. They call the Department
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:07.760]  of Justice. Two police have been run over in the last 48 hours in Pennsylvania and California,
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:13.360]  and the media is defending it. So now we have the left picking up jihadi tactics of using truck
[2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:21.840]  attacks. Well, it's sad for the cops. I'll tell you, they're afraid to do anything now. And the
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:28.400]  worst thing that could have happened standing by letting these people go into stores, bringing TVs
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:35.040]  out and allowing the whole world to look at the greatest country in the world and can't even lock
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:42.320]  up a few punks for stealing. So where's the strength of our country? How do you think the foreign
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:48.080]  countries feel about it? If we can't even take care of a few nutcase people to go in and steal,
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:54.400]  it's just law enforcement standing by with the guns and do nothing? That's how you just said it.
[2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:59.600]  They're trying with blue city mayors to tell the police to stand down, to run from looters,
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:04.000]  to trigger a collapse of the country when Trump wins the election. That's the plan.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:13.120]  It's sad that that's going on. So we have to get the president back in there. If we don't,
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:19.200]  I don't know what's going to happen to this country. I really don't. I love the United States of
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:26.880]  America. And I feel for what's going on. I don't know, Alex, you've been around a long time too.
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:31.920]  And I don't know. I mean, I have a feeling of dread, but also optimism at the same time.
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:34.720]  I think it's up for grabs is going to happen. We've all got to go vote. We've all got to be
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:38.720]  engaged. We've all got to get good local governments elected. Soros, as you know, has elected
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:46.320]  hundreds and hundreds of sheriffs, hundreds of district attorneys, a bunch of state attorney
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:50.560]  generals like Leticia James, and they're coming after everybody. We've got to reverse that.
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:56.000]  She helped, you know, get you kicked out of office or George Soros did. See, it's a nightmare.
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:02.240]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an American legend, get the book today. Join us when Trump wins or regardless,
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:05.440]  middle of next week. Sheriff Joe, thank you so much and God bless.
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:08.000]  Thank you. Thanks, Alex.
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:12.160]  Thank you. Great having him on. He's been a great patriot, folks. The boy was he right. All right.
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:17.200]  I got a few final calls I'm going to hit that I'm going to air this very powerful interview
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:24.720]  with Tony Bobolinski, with the highest rated ever Fox News show in their history,
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:27.760]  with a great time, girls. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:38.400]  China is open. America is closed. And in the European Union, where the people are revolting,
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:44.000]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of lockdown.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:49.360]  It's very simple. We're authoritarians already have complete control. I come to China. Oh,
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:55.120]  there's no more lockdowns in their heroes. And the UN says, for example, for assault. After all,
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:48:00.000]  that's where the virus came from. After all, that's where the fear monster came from. The lockdown
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:07.040]  came from. But that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little syndrome being created
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:14.960]  that was to be the aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:21.760]  hysteria. And so far, it's been incredibly successful. Until just the last few weeks,
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:27.360]  as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN communist
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:35.600]  Chinese world government power grab. As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:41.040]  from the election. And the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:46.800]  and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've openly said,
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:51.760]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:57.360]  and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda. And they're on record saying that once
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:02.720]  they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:08.480]  and put us all in prison. This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:15.280]  bots are saying. It's what Keith Oberman saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi saying. This is their stated
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:20.960]  criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:26.320]  inoculations. Trump is trying to end the lockdowns. And the same vaccines will be voluntary.
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:31.360]  Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote until your family
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:39.120]  vote now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:07.200]  It's going to Mr. Jay in Vegas. Thanks for holding you're a tripper. Welcome, my friend.
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:16.080]  Oh, yeah. Man, the only thing I can say is that it's power. You're giving us power back. And
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:23.280]  power is this strong mind, strong body, strong soul. This is what the only defeat to corruption
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:30.320]  of the new world order. And the natural part is in a globalist. You're also giving us a
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:36.000]  backbone, which is your eyes. Your eyes are the backbone to your body. And the more you show us
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:43.280]  this corruption that Biden has, you're making us stronger. Another thing is this, fear,
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:50.000]  ignorance, and violence of sworn enemies of the law. That's another backbone you're giving us.
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:58.400]  You're also giving us a backbone to let us know that we all have, are made of liquid
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:05.920]  with oxygen. And what should I say, food, water, because you're always, hey, I like that plant
[2:51:05.920 --> 2:51:10.240]  that you got. That's a viral kid. Oh, I hear you, man. You're absolutely. Listen, you're giving
[2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:17.440]  me the power. We're awake together. That's what matters. I agree. And for the power that you've
[2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:22.960]  given us, as far as being individuals who believe in Jesus Christ, God, Jesus said, God,
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:30.080]  my son, you also said that we are numbered the seas of the evil because we are Abraham
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:34.720]  children. So all the Abraham children have to do is hear your message and say, Hey, wake up,
[2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:40.720]  Abraham children. We are numbered the stars in the sky. Exactly. We have to just take our birthright
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:47.280]  as God's children and it's over. I agree. And it's the bloodline. We ain't got bloodline. We're
[2:51:47.280 --> 2:51:51.200]  not in the devil's bloodline. Oh, yeah. Another thing that you had pointed out to me. Thank you
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:55.680]  for giving us power. I appreciate you sir. The devil got two points on his head and you got the
[2:51:55.680 --> 2:52:01.120]  devil by both horns, political and religion and the power that you're giving us to stand up against
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:08.640]  us. Man, you have a great, shall I say, a great tongue and a great mouth, man. Listen, you got a
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:13.920]  lot. I love your voice, my friend. But what I'm saying is, Mr. J is that you're giving me power.
[2:52:13.920 --> 2:52:17.600]  I'm giving you powers. The Bible says what two of us agree upon on earth. God will make it sure
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:22.080]  it happens in heaven. But we've got to know it. It's got to be right. We've got to agree upon it
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:25.280]  and trust in God. It's going to happen. And that's why we have that birthright the devil
[2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:28.320]  so upset about. I totally agree with you. What do you think is going to happen in five days?
[2:52:28.320 --> 2:52:36.080]  What your gut tell you, Mr. J? Well, weed is going to keep the stock market
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:44.240]  mere water. Don't Trump only had to do a legalized weed quality as a kid. I agree. But it has,
[2:52:44.240 --> 2:52:50.640]  it has the same quality of 900 billion trees that outnumber the people on earth.
[2:52:51.680 --> 2:52:55.360]  You're right. It's a lot better than cotton. I mean, even the time it doesn't have THC in it,
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:52:59.840]  it's really a miracle plan. And Trump is moving to try to decriminalize it. And then sessions
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:04.560]  wouldn't do it. But now in his second administration, he intends to do it with Obama, said he would
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:10.400]  do it, but Trump intends to do it. I agree with you, sir. And another thing that we got to close
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:18.880]  this thing out on, we got to find out how to maintain the success and the profits and the gift,
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:23.920]  the money, the gold, the silver that God has promised us because, you know, for a fact,
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:28.560]  God don't lie if you don't play. You're right. God bless you. Great caller.
[2:53:28.560 --> 2:53:33.120]  Look, I'm sorry to Matt. I am. And Nick, if you want to be on tomorrow, name a number,
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:36.400]  please get it, John. I'll put you first up. We've gotten good about this. You try to say,
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:39.920]  oh, give me your number. And I never call the next day. We're getting everybody on.
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:44.160]  You'll be first up tomorrow. Open phones. The war room's coming up. Owen Schreuer.
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:50.240]  We've got another great guest host. Who is that guest host? I got a guest host coming up.
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:57.520]  J. Dyer. That's right. J. Dyer is coming up. So I am absolutely blown away right now. What's
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:02.560]  going on in this country? It's very, very exciting time. I want to air this piece with
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:10.400]  Tucker Carlson. The great work Tucker Carlson is doing with Tony Bob Olensky and all these
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:14.800]  other whistleblowers that are on record working with the Bidens, on record exposing them.
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:18.960]  But they're Chinese agents, man. Think about how crazy that is. And thank God,
[2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:22.720]  literally thank God that that is coming out. This is all happening. We've got to just keep
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:26.800]  thinking God every minute because we're so close to beating these people. We'll still have challenges,
[2:54:26.800 --> 2:54:31.440]  but there's just so much going down, so much happening. And then we've got J. Dyer coming
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:36.480]  up as well and a bunch of other big breaking news. I promised you big news today, so that's what I was
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:43.920]  talking about. CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline that
[2:54:43.920 --> 2:54:49.120]  Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus. It's the opposite. He's not surrendering to the endless
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  drumbeat of fear and false science that it's incredibly deadly and that we have a chance
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:00.640]  of eradicating it. Bill Gates, Fauci and the UN have said, we will always wear masks. We will
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:06.560]  never shake hands. And even the vaccines won't protect us forever. And so the civilization,
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:14.400]  as we know, is over until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated. That's impossible.
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.000]  That's right. They're trying to say they have to have a cure for the common cold.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:24.560]  That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test. They created a problem that can never be
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:29.360]  defeated. But of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem. And so they stay in power
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:34.320]  forever and take control of society with contact tracers and outgoing with the police
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:39.360]  to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking force samples. We must say no.
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:53.360]  The shortest straw. Shortest straw has been pulled for you.
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:57.280]  All right. Tony Bobolinski knocks it out of the park last night with Dr. Carlson.
[2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:03.040]  Highest viewed show in Fox history. Tucker is staying in attack formation. He understands
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:09.440]  the staying in the game and the fight is victory itself. And I'll just leave it at that. But
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:15.520]  Tucker and I are in attack formation. Please remember, the only way we fund this operation
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:19.840]  is you. And we've only got a few days left where you can get ultra 12 and a bunch of the products
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:25.040]  that 50% off was free shipping and triple patriot points plus 10% off the sound of
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:29.360]  ridership. But two new things will be our sale next week. I'm watching it now is
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:39.360]  the amazing mustard seed derived ultimate selenium critical for the body, an essential nutrient
[2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:43.840]  for immune system, electrochemical activity in the brain. Every nerve in the body must have it.
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:49.520]  Biotree selenium info or short out confidence percent off free shipping triple patriot points.
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:54.640]  And of course, body's ultimate turmeric formula, the most concentrated tumor you're going to find
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:59.840]  out there on the market. It's 50% off triple patriot points free shipping. That is the new
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:03.360]  sale. The other sales about to have to end all those other items that are on sale about the
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:08.240]  end on Monday, because a bunch of it's selling out in full war store.com or triple eight, two,
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:12.560]  five, three, three, one, three, nine. Here's Tucker Carlson, part of his hour power pack
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:17.440]  transmission Lance night. I'll be watching tonight. I'll also be watching Owen shroyer and
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:25.760]  question countdown tonight as well. Seven to nine at band.video and election night.news. So it was
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:32.560]  clear to you that Joe Biden's son had told him about this business crystal clear crystal clear.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:37.600]  Tell us what the conversation that subsequently occur between you and Joe Biden. So the conversation
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:42.320]  as you're well aware, Tucker, I grew up the son of a career naval officer. So the president of
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:46.880]  the United States was always the commander in chief, whether they were a Democrat or Republican
[2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:52.400]  or other. And so I had the highest respect for Joe and the, you know, the office that he had held.
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:58.560]  And so I stood up and shook his hand and obviously we sat down and think ordered some drinks. I think
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:03.440]  Jim Biden was hungry and might have ordered some food. And, you know, Joe asked me to
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:09.280]  talk about my background, my family. He thanked me for my service. I'm obviously very proud of that
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:14.080]  proud of my brother's service and my grandfather's service. And then he walked through sort of his
[2:58:14.080 --> 2:58:19.920]  family. You know, obviously some of the tragedies they've dealt with his political career in a high
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:25.120]  level. You know, we didn't go into deep too much detail on business because Hunter prior
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:31.520]  to Joe showing up Hunter and Jim had coached me, listen, we won't go into too much detail here.
[2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:36.240]  So just a high level discussion and meeting. So it's not like I was drilling down with Joe
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:45.120]  about cap tables and details. So you said that they wanted you to meet Joe Biden as a way to
[2:58:45.120 --> 2:58:49.920]  induce you to participate in the steal. You were the actual business guy here who had management
[2:58:49.920 --> 2:58:55.440]  experience, deal experience. But it also sounds like Joe Biden was vetting you to some extent.
[2:58:55.440 --> 2:59:01.200]  Yes, of course. Like I didn't request to meet with Joe. They requested that I meet with Joe.
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:07.760]  And you know, he's putting his and Hunter says this in writing. It was referenced multiple times.
[2:59:08.480 --> 2:59:13.600]  They were putting their entire family legacy on the line. They knew exactly what they were doing.
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:21.120]  They were dealing with a Chinese owned enterprise run by Chairman Yi CFC that had strong financial
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:25.520]  support and political support from the Chinese Communist Party. That's how it was presented
[2:59:25.520 --> 2:59:29.840]  to me. That's not my own words. That's how they presented it to me and read me in on it.
[2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:35.760]  And they being Gilear and Hunter Biden. They being Hunter Biden, who was very proud of that and
[2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:41.040]  taking credit for it when I sat with him for two hours on the patio of the Chateau Marmont in LA.
[2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:43.600]  Proud that they were doing a deal with the Chinese Communist Party? Well,
[2:59:43.600 --> 2:59:50.400]  proud that they were that he had the relationship with Chairman Yi who was running CFC and the
[2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:56.640]  ability for them to get deals done around the world and stuff like that. You've seen a number of
[2:59:56.640 --> 3:00:01.680]  journalists, reporters covering the story, including some who should know better, declare
[3:00:01.680 --> 3:00:07.680]  triumphantly that no document you've released connects the former vice president to this deal.
[3:00:08.800 --> 3:00:14.240]  How do you react to that? What's your answer to it? So you can imagine what I've been through over
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:22.960]  the last couple months and knowing all this to be fact and watching Joe Biden and his family and
[3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:28.240]  their lawyers, a trout around the world stating that there was no involvement or even at the
[3:00:28.240 --> 3:00:34.080]  debate. Joe Biden referenced that you've seen my tax returns and there's no money from foreign,
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:39.120]  you know, enterprise in that. I want to simplify this for the American people as much as I can.
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:47.680]  On May 13th, that email was sent from James Gilear to me. I didn't generate that email.
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:53.680]  James Gilear generated that email. And in that email, James Gilear goes through intimate detail
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:01:00.560]  of what each individual's requests were from a compensation perspective and how the equity
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:06.640]  in the enterprise would be divvied up. Very important. May 13th, that email was generated
[3:01:06.640 --> 3:01:13.360]  by somebody else to me. In that email, there's a statement where they go through the equity.
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:19.760]  Jim Biden's referenced as, you know, 10% doesn't say Biden, it says Jim. And then it has 10% for
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:26.400]  the big guy held by H. I 1000% sit here and know that the big guy is referencing Joe Biden.
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:32.880]  It's that's crystal clear to me because I lived it. I met with the former vice president in person
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:40.080]  multiple times and I had been meeting and talking with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden and Rob Walker
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:46.560]  and James Gilear. Where the media has tried to hide, and I personally feel it's disgusting, is
[3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:53.920]  between that May 13th email and the final document that was executed called Onida Holdings, LLC.
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:02:02.640]  In Onida Holdings, LLC, the equity has broken up 20% Hunter Biden, 20% Jim Biden,
[3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:11.440]  well, there are LLCs that represented them, 20% James Gilear, 20% Rob Walker, and 20%
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:18.400]  me and my investment entity. What I'd ask the American people to read and look at is how from
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:26.240]  May 13th to the final Onida document that got executed, did Jim Biden go from a 10% owner to a 20%
[3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:33.040]  owner? That's not my question to answer. I'm sure there were discussions within the Biden family.
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:38.800]  I wasn't privy to that discussion. But this is Jim Biden, the brother of the potential future
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:44.720]  president of the United States. It's not a distant cousin. It's not an employee. It's his brother
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:50.800]  who in documents defines himself as a political advisor to his brother. And so I'll leave that
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:55.600]  to the American people to answer that. But I don't understand how the American journalist
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:58.400]  is allowing that gap to be even talked about and defined.
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:04.160]  So, and I should say, and I want to put the document on the screen, in his pitch
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:12.640]  to the Chinese in his bio, Jim Biden describes himself as an advisor, a current advisor to his
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:19.520]  brother. So was it clear to you from the beginning that what Jim Biden was bringing to this deal
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  was his relationship with Joe Biden?
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:28.480]  Yeah, 1000% crystal clear. After I met with Joe Biden the morning of May 3rd at the Milken
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:35.120]  Conference, and then was taken backstage after Joe had spoken, you know, we joked around for
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:40.800]  about 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And then I walked him out to his car. I think he was, I think they
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:44.880]  referenced he was off to see the lieutenant governor. This is Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Yes.
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:50.320]  And then after that, I went over to the Peninsula Hotel, and I sat with Jim Biden for two hours
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:57.520]  where Jim Biden walked through his history and his own words stating all the work and effort he
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:03.360]  did to get Joe Biden elected initially in Delaware and then through the family history
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:09.760]  and the role that he had played in it. And in that meeting, remember, I'm the son of a naval
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:14.640]  officer, I'm a naval officer, was a naval officer myself. And because I held a Q clearance, which
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:21.120]  is the equivalent of a top secret clearance, we're audited every year. So if you receive a gift, I
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:27.520]  think the barrier was $25, anything larger than $25, we had to disclose it to the government,
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:31.200]  because obviously anybody with the clearance, the government is watching closely that they're
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:37.200]  not influenced by the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese and stuff like that. So as I was
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:42.080]  listening to Jim walk through this, I have a big heart, if you talked to anybody who knows me,
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:49.360]  they would weigh in on that. I'm a kind person. And I'm thinking about the Biden family,
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:56.160]  like how are they doing this? I know Joe decided not to run in 2016, but what if he ran in the
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:02.080]  future? Aren't they taking political risk or headline risk? And I remember looking at Jim
[3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:07.280]  Biden and saying, how are you guys getting away with this? Like, aren't you concerned? And he
[3:05:07.280 --> 3:05:13.920]  sort of looked at me and he laughed a little bit and said, plausible deniability. He said that out
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:20.160]  loud. Yes, he said it directly to me one on one in a cabana at the Peninsula Hotel after about a
[3:05:20.160 --> 3:05:25.520]  you know, hour and a half, two hour meeting with me asking out of concern, how are you guys doing
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:29.920]  this? Aren't you concerned that you're going to put your brother's future presidential campaign at
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:36.960]  risk? You know, the Chinese, the stuff that you guys have been doing already in 2015 and 2016
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:42.720]  around the world. And I just what if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing

[3:06:12.320 --> 3:06:17.920]  crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies,
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:23.280]  after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health
[3:06:23.280 --> 3:06:28.000]  can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that,
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:32.800]  I certainly do. So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:38.880]  plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:44.240]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:49.440]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research

[3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:44.320]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments,
[3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:50.320]  Info Wars is many, many years ahead. And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today,
[3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:54.960]  but there's a blind spot that Info Wars has. I've noticed that really informed people
[3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:58.960]  have this as well. And I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most performable out there.
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:02.480]  So I want you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every
[3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:10.000]  day. This Hunter Byte laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him where he admits
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:16.160]  he works under the communist Chinese spy chief. He should be arrested right now. That is so huge.
[3:08:16.880 --> 3:08:22.880]  That is hiding in plain view and it's getting almost no attention. We have to get that information
[3:08:22.880 --> 3:08:29.520]  out to everybody. It's all posted on InfoWars.com, so many other major patriotic sites, but we need
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:34.320]  to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this. We knew it a long time ago.
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:37.760]  So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us that we didn't know. The point is,
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:42.400]  now it's documented, now it's proven. It's on record. It's not disputed. It was rolled out
[3:08:42.400 --> 3:08:46.320]  more than eight months ago in communist China. Now it's in Europe. Now it's the United States,
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:51.200]  Canada, and the most other industrial parts of the planet. Every restaurant you go into,
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:58.000]  even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly check their menu and they really
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course they have them. Now, what are they saying
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  there? Well, you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:10.240]  have a piece of paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading germs.
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:14.800]  It's absolutely asinine. They can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:20.160]  that. Now what this really is, is a contact tracing database. Again, this is admitted that
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:24.960]  everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of. So in the future, everywhere you go is
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:28.800]  tracked officially. Now, your cell phone is already tracking. You already have home assistants
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:32.720]  watching and listening to you in your house, but now this is officially rolling the sound
[3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:37.120]  where you won't buy or sell, have a job, get an airplane without it. And Bill Gates even admits
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:56.480]  it. So think about that, folks, and we'll look out. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:05.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show from your guest list for this past hour.
[3:10:05.680 --> 3:10:13.520]  Jay Dyer, Jason Ellison. You know, we tend to think of the world today as different than it was
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  in the ancient days, right? Or it's different than it was in the Bible times. But if you notice,
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:24.640]  the news that comes out, especially in the last four years relating to political scandals,
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:32.320]  cult scandals, sex cult scandals, it just seems more and more Old Testament, doesn't it? It seems
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:37.680]  like maybe we're even living in the days of some prophet, right? Jeremiah Ezekiel or something
[3:10:37.680 --> 3:10:43.280]  like that. Because we see that the political elite, the billionaire elite, the establishment elite,
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:49.840]  the technocratic elite, they are involved in some of the most heinous, unbelievable practices
[3:10:49.840 --> 3:10:55.920]  that you could imagine. And here you see ritual practices of forcing people to wear the cult
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:11:03.680]  mask to basically block the image of God, which is in a sense the face, right? All of that is
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:08.000]  significant. But I want to talk first about the Old Testament, right? If we think back to the time
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:15.360]  of Genesis, we think about the story of Abraham in Genesis 22 when we are told that Abraham was
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:22.400]  commanded to sacrifice. Isaac, a lot of people think of that as some kind of pagan notion that
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:28.560]  God was requiring a human sacrifice when really that treatise is an apologetic, an argument
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:33.600]  against human sacrifice. Because what God demonstrates as a result of that to Abraham is
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:40.160]  that that's not the kind of God that I am. I don't require the human blood offering to be satiated.
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:44.480]  Now, you might think, well, but what about Jesus? I'll get to that in a minute. But
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:50.320]  if we move up into the time of the kings, right, in the Old Testament, we think about the stories of
[3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:56.000]  the period when the northern kingdoms of Israel fell into human sacrifice. They got into this
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:00.640]  really degenerate type of worship. There's a story in Numbers 25 that actually precedes the kings,
[3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:05.520]  but it says the stage for the worship that will be normative in the northern kingdom. It's called
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:11.120]  the story of Baal Pior. And there, this practice that the Israelites are tempted with, it's called
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:16.000]  Baal Pior, which means the Lord of open holes. I'm not going to get too graphic, but you can
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:21.520]  guess what that's about. It's about bodily fluids. It's about the most degenerate type of stuff you
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:29.760]  could think of. That is carried into the worship and basically apostasy of the northern kingdom.
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:36.240]  And so you get this kind of secret cabal amongst the political elite of the northern kingdom of
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:40.960]  Israel. And then at times, even in the southern kingdom of Judah, they often fell into the same
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:46.240]  practice as well. You have some exceptions with King David and Josiah, but for the most part,
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:52.400]  the whole history of Israel pretty much demonstrates this pattern of falling into
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:59.760]  not just occultism, quote unquote, or not just secret societies, but rather the most wicked,
[3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:04.960]  the most degenerate imaginable stuff. If you think about Jeremiah in chapter seven,
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:11.200]  he says in chapter seven that the Israelites had gotten to the point of offering their sons and
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:18.880]  daughters as burnt offerings of fire in the valley of Topheth and Hennom. So human sacrifice had
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:24.560]  different periods become normative in the history of ancient Israel. And what we see from that,
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:30.560]  I want to mention too, Ezekiel, there's Ezekiel eight, right? You get this chapter where Ezekiel
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:38.800]  is taken into the spirit and he sees in a vision the worship of the 70 elders of Israel in secret.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:46.560]  There's a secret society that the 70 elders of Israel in Ezekiel's day had set up where under
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:52.960]  the guise of the public worship of God, they had a secret inner sanctum and inner cult that was
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:58.480]  engaged in what he calls unimaginable abominations, right? He says, I will show you greater abominations.
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:03.440]  Do you think that's bad? Let me show you something even greater. So the abominations get worse and
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:11.760]  worse and it's not just the king. It's not just some group of false prophets. It's basically all
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:17.120]  the leaders of Israel in Ezekiel's day. You get the same idea in Elijah's day, right? Elijah even
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:23.360]  says, am I the only one who's left not given into this crazy insane cult? So you can see that
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:29.360]  historically these practices are the norm and they're not exceptions. We just think in the modern
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:36.240]  world that, well, this doesn't go on. But in fact, numerous journalists, dozens of books of the last
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:43.040]  10, 20, 30 years, I have many of them. I have dozens of them myself. Journalists, doctors,
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:48.640]  psychologists, psychiatrists have been covering the experience of people, the claims of people,
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:54.960]  the actual cases, court cases as well, not just people's claims, about this going on at the highest
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:15:03.600]  levels. So the idea of bail pure, the idea of these secret degenerate cults, why is it a
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:09.920]  much weird sex cult? Why isn't it worshipping cheese? Why isn't it worshipping badminton, right?
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:14.800]  Why isn't it something innocuous? Why is it always the most degenerate thing? Well, that's
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:21.440]  because there's a reason. There's a reason why these kinds of practices have a specific effect
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:28.640]  in the human being. They traumatize. So traumatization is the key to why the elites do this.
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:35.520]  And yes, there is obviously a spiritual satanic component to this. But if you just look at it
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:42.640]  from the perspective of pragmatism, like what advantage do the elite have by participating
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:47.280]  in these kinds of things, doing these kinds of things, what do they get out of this? Well,
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:53.680]  if you think about it from the vantage point of control, the psychology, the psychiatry,
[3:15:53.680 --> 3:16:00.000]  all of the MDs and people that deal with trauma, they actually discuss this as well. And they discuss
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:08.560]  it as a way to ultimately traumatize on a mass scale human beings. Now, the media, the big events,
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:13.760]  the big 9-11 event, this kind of stuff, these kinds of events, even Charles Manson, I would argue,
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:18.720]  is a way to kind of mass traumatize the American psyche, to publicize these things.
[3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:23.680]  If you watched Oliver Stone's great film, Natural Born Killers, that was actually Oliver Stone's
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:29.280]  point, right? It was to say that it's actually the media that is propelling and pushing this idea
[3:16:29.280 --> 3:16:37.760]  of traumatization and sort of glamorizing serial killers, making them into these bad asses. And
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:43.040]  if you remember, what were they saying about, was the Dahmer, that Netflix documentary and the
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:50.880]  girls, oh, he's like so hot. Oh my gosh, Dahmer is so hot. Did you see the documentary where he
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:56.880]  was like, it was so hot? Right, so they were actually in the media promoting the serial killers
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:06.080]  as hotties, right, as freaking babes. And that's for a reason. That is to, was it Dahmer or was
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:13.120]  the other guy? Well, who's the other guy that they, Dahmer looks kind of like a soy male there,
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:16.560]  but the other guy, well, you know, I forget, I get them all mixed up, there's a laser and sort
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.960]  of goes, but the one that they did in Netflix documentary on there is he's so hot. I think
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:26.080]  you guys at InfoWars even had a clip where they were playing Alex making fun of that, but
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:31.920]  anyway, what I'm getting at is traumatization. And this was not speculation. There's a lot of
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:39.600]  evidence. There's a lot of proof about this. Yeah, there you go. And what this does is at a younger
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:46.080]  age, especially, it literally can fracture a person's psyche. You said, no, wow, that's very
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:50.640]  speculative. We don't know if it really does that. Well, there are actual, I mean, I believe he's been
[3:17:50.640 --> 3:17:57.040]  on with Alex in the past, but there's a doctor, Dr. Colin Ross, for example, have his book right
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:02.080]  here. Dr. Colin Ross has written many, many books about this phenomenon and he's not a Christian,
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:05.920]  so you can't say, oh, he's a Bible thumper and he just wants to prove this kind of stuff. Well,
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:13.680]  he's written many books about dealing with people who claim satanic ritual abuse. And he's written
[3:18:13.680 --> 3:18:18.160]  books that deal with dealing with people who have multiple personality dissociative identity
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:24.160]  disorder. And he noticed that in many of these cases, people have had significant, either traumatic
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:30.160]  or especially sexual abuse, especially in their youth. So this is definitely a real phenomenon
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:35.280]  and we have to understand that if we want to understand what's going on on the global scale.
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:41.280]  We'll be back in just a second. I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:48.240]  listen to you, whisper, and it's true. A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:54.320]  if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out. You know why I know that?
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:59.520]  Because I'm Alex Jones and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:04.560]  the New World Order and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, start the third
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:09.840]  world and then enslave the first world. So I've been really, really loud and really, really
[3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:15.680]  aggressive and we've had a big effect, but now it's time to think about every different angle
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:20.080]  and every different way we can get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:25.760]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:32.000]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon. So this is live and death.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:46.560]  Please share info wars.com and band our video and watch our live election coverage.
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:09.520]  and good old fashioned stupidity. No more pesky lawn order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:15.520]  safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:22.000]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:33.200]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:44.000]  In January and February of the year 2020, the communist super state China working through
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:50.160]  the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID permanent
[3:20:50.160 --> 3:20:56.800]  social distancing, permanent mask, apps to track everywhere we go and what we do contact
[3:20:56.800 --> 3:21:03.360]  tracers coming to our doors with the police and dragging us away. This is the authoritarian
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:09.520]  medical tyranny takeover and it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying no.
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:15.760]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns are
[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:22.960]  permanent. Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised. By then we'll
[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:29.120]  all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery and it will never end. This is the
[3:21:29.120 --> 3:21:46.800]  authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist, everyone must speak up, everyone must say no now.
[3:21:59.440 --> 3:22:06.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're talking about traumatization and how the elite
[3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:14.160]  basically view this as a means not just to mess with their own children you could say because
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:19.680]  there are generational cults or generational families that practice this kind of stuff but
[3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:26.560]  also you can expand that to the mass psyche to traumatize the mass psyche and I wanted to go
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:31.120]  into some of the people that we haven't covered in the past in terms of our global elite series.
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:35.600]  If you don't know what I do is I kind of go through these big fat geopolitical tomes of the
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:42.560]  elite such as tragedy and hope and I cover the areas that are kind of overlooked or maybe you
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:48.400]  don't have time to read a 1300 page book. Well, I will do that for you so you can go. I do your,
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:54.720]  I cheat for you, I do your homework for you so you can go subscribe and get all of my content
[3:22:54.720 --> 3:23:00.880]  that deals with summarizing this material. Now, towards the end of Quigley's book, for example,
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:07.200]  we have a discussion of where the West is going, what has happened to the West, the two world wars
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:12.240]  where it's going and there's a weird chapter where he even says that the elite especially the
[3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:18.880]  British elite had this tendency to send their children off to boarding school to pretty much
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:25.040]  make them traumatized and psychopathic. So the idea is the elite knew a long time ago, presumably
[3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:29.200]  amongst the nobility, that if they send their children off to boarding schools, they wouldn't
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:36.880]  develop an attachment to their mom. So they would lose the empathy, like they would get a pattern
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:42.720]  of learning empathy from their parents, especially the mom. And if you got rid of that mother figure,
[3:23:42.720 --> 3:23:50.000]  they would sort of not develop the empathic side of their persona and hence the generations of
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:56.320]  psychopathy. But what's really weird about this chapter right before he talks about the last
[3:23:56.320 --> 3:24:01.040]  couple chapters is that where the West is going, he says there's a figure that we have to understand
[3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:09.120]  is really important for this century. And perhaps he might even be the prophet of the new era, the
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:16.480]  new Aon. You think what? Who would that be? Well, it's a figure by the name of Tehard de Chardin.
[3:24:16.480 --> 3:24:22.480]  Now, Tehard is of course the great evangelist, as many know as a paleontologist and a Jesuit,
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:30.160]  of evolution. He's one of the key, that was his gospel basically, is the gospel of evolution.
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:34.720]  But he was also in the circles of and knew, I think he knew fairly well, another figure
[3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:40.960]  was also a Jesuit who left the Jesuit order by the name of Malachi Martin. Malachi Martin wrote
[3:24:40.960 --> 3:24:48.000]  many, many books talking about this cult, this secret inner cult at the highest levels of international
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:53.120]  power and specifically, of course, the Vatican. There's a couple quotes I want to show you in
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:59.200]  his book on the Jesuits when he says what has happened to this group and where they're leading
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:04.800]  things. He says that, let me tell you about the figure of Tehard de Chardin. He says,
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:09.840]  Tehard de Chardin has more or less a hermetic and occultic philosophy.
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:15.920]  Right? He says that you could say in a way that he adopted a form of Marxism. He says,
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:22.720]  but Tehard de Chardin is not a classical Marxist, rather, he has a notion that all of reality
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:31.440]  is the Christ consciousness and that all of reality is basically evolving into a one-world
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:38.400]  technocratic global order. He says this process philosophy and theology is what will lead to
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:46.080]  everybody accepting basically a new view of man, the view that man is God. That's the real meaning
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:52.800]  of Jesus becoming incarnate, he says, is rather not that God became man so that he might save us
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:56.880]  and lift us up or something like this. No, no, it's the other way around. It's in the inversion,
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:01.440]  which is always what these Luciferians do. It's the inversion that is the truth, he says, and in
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:08.560]  fact, the message is a secret Gnostic message that in fact man is God and that this evolutionary
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:16.480]  process will encompass all of reality and that the New Jerusalem, he says, in the future will be this
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:23.120]  kind of big glob, right, this big mass glob that everybody will be hooked into, this global brain,
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:31.040]  as Jacques Attili called it, and he says that he came to this conclusion after a supposed mystical
[3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:40.880]  experience where he talked to the force in the desert, and the force told him this and he said
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:47.440]  that when he went back and read Ignatius Loyola's spiritual exercise of the Jesuits, he says that
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:54.480]  he realized that ultimately man is God and that man is evolving into being a global technocratic
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:27:03.360]  transhumanist brain. And so basically he says Proleanism, okay, so the famous Satanist Alistair
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:09.520]  Crowley. Also, if you've heard Lawrence Krauss and some of the new atheists, right, what do they
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:16.240]  say? They say, we're all stardust, man, man is just a bunch of stardust, right, Timothy Leary said
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:21.440]  the exact same thing, man is just a bunch of stardust, man, and we're all evolving to become
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:29.120]  God and storm heaven, right. So one of the most famous Jesuits, they heard the Chardon,
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:33.920]  literally saying the exact same thing as Alistair Crowley, the famous Satanist Luciferian.
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:39.600]  And for another testimony, there's a big fat geopolitical book that Malachi Martin wrote,
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:47.600]  called Keys of this Blood, and there's a famous page here where I'm going to read just a brief
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:51.440]  quote from Malachi Martin. He says, the most frightening thing, now this was written back in
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:57.600]  the 90s, remember in the 90s. So this was out in the 90s, if you read these big fat geopolitical
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:02.720]  books. This is the most frightening thing about the papacy of John Paul is that he had come against
[3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:09.200]  a presence within his own Vatican and within his own bishops' chanceries. It was knowledgeable
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:15.280]  churchmen that called this a super force. Rumors were, and this was always difficult to verify,
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:23.200]  that it was tied to the installation of Pope Paul VI in 1963. Indeed, Paul VI himself had mentioned
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:29.120]  the smoke of Satan entering into the church, and this was an oblique reference to an enthronement
[3:28:29.120 --> 3:28:37.040]  ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican itself. Besides this, the incidents of satanic pedophilia
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:43.280]  within the church, that is, rites and practices already documented amongst bishops back then,
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:51.520]  they knew about this back then. This was as widespread as Turin, Italy to South Carolina
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:28:59.840]  in the United States. The cultic acts of satanic pedophilia are considered by these groups to be
[3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:06.640]  the culmination of the fallen angels' rites. So there it is on page 632. If you want to go read
[3:29:06.640 --> 3:29:13.920]  it in this book, he talks about the pedophilia as a traumatizing ritual. It infiltrated the highest
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:19.840]  levels of the Vatican, even into the 60s and 70s and 80s, that far back, and probably going all the
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:25.520]  way back to the Renaissance. I mean, they used to castrate boys to castrate. This is where the
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:32.880]  Pope castrates his personal singers so that they can sing in high-pitched tones. I think that's
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:39.040]  bizarre, but maybe it goes back even that far, right? But the point is not to just hammer on
[3:29:39.040 --> 3:29:46.080]  Catholicism here, because this is so society-wide is the point here, you see. It's these networks
[3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:51.600]  that are in all of these big institutions. That's how they get corrupted. So the purpose of this
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:58.880]  is to say that the corruption and blackmailing and secret society garbage going all the way back
[3:29:58.880 --> 3:30:05.680]  to Ezekiela in Jeremiah 7 is the exact same as today. It's the exact same in the Vatican. It's the
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:11.920]  same in the British government. Jimmy Savile, right? Who, by the way, John Paul II gave a
[3:30:11.920 --> 3:30:17.600]  knighthood to, papal knighthood to Jimmy Savile. Jimmy Savile is, of course, connected to all
[3:30:17.600 --> 3:30:22.000]  those British MPs and high-level government people in the British government that were all
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:31.120]  compromised via these compromised operations. So if you remember, the British had this whole
[3:30:31.120 --> 3:30:35.600]  whorehouse basically that they had fitted with cameras and whatnot, and they basically had been
[3:30:35.600 --> 3:30:39.920]  compromising all the politicians, high-level British intelligence people for a long time,
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:44.800]  right? So that's how they do this. So what I'm trying to get at is that it's not an isolated
[3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:49.680]  incident of, oh, Epstein was over there in that thing, right? Oh, Weinstein was over there,
[3:30:49.680 --> 3:30:55.600]  and he was doing this stuff over there. Oh, there's this laptop with Hunter Biden over here,
[3:30:55.600 --> 3:31:02.960]  right? It's the same model and the same tactics and the same degenerate elite practices for millennia.
[3:31:02.960 --> 3:31:08.720]  That's what I'm trying to say. So this doesn't disprove the Bible. This actually shows that the
[3:31:08.720 --> 3:31:13.920]  biblical testimony is accurate. The Bible's been saying this the whole time, even that crazy old
[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:21.040]  testament, right? Oh, that old testament, that's a bunch of crazy stories. Really? Well, the elite
[3:31:21.040 --> 3:31:26.400]  in that book were doing degenerate human sacrifice practices. I mean, look at that guy's eyes.
[3:31:27.200 --> 3:31:33.760]  That guy's not there. He's checked out. Something else has stepped in to that biological suit,
[3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:49.680]  right? This is Jay Dyer. We'll be back in just a minute. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:56.160]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[3:31:56.160 --> 3:32:07.360]  attacked, and threatened because we are effective. The great awakening is here.
[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:18.000]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share. Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:26.800]  and never give up the fight.
[3:32:36.960 --> 3:32:42.400]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks. Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke
[3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:50.880]  and all of Big Tech in concert from Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block
[3:32:50.880 --> 3:32:56.480]  it? They didn't deny that it was real. They just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the story
[3:32:56.480 --> 3:33:01.440]  or link to major newspapers or even the House and Senate committees that were looking at it.
[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:07.360]  Well, now fast forward as the fire hose of information comes out and more tapes get released
[3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:12.160]  and more audio with Hunter admitting he was a communist Chinese agent. We're not trying to
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:15.680]  censor it anymore. Not because they're good people, but because this trizan effect
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:22.160]  boomeranged on their traitorous butts last time just a few weeks ago. And so now they know they're
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:26.160]  trying to suppress it, only makes it bigger. It's just like they've done with Infowars
[3:33:26.160 --> 3:33:31.520]  in banned.video. It's truly amazing. So keep telling the truth. The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[3:33:31.520 --> 3:33:38.640]  Amazing things are happening and these communist Chinese agents are going to pay. Infowars has
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:45.120]  been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[3:33:45.120 --> 3:33:51.520]  It is why they attack us. And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[3:33:52.560 --> 3:33:56.560]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:03.520]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content across
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:10.560]  all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media. So go to

[3:35:50.480 --> 3:36:11.040]  You're listening. If you are enjoying this tape, you want to know more about this. I actually wrote
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:17.280]  two big fat books on the history of cults and Hollywood, how they're presented in film, how it
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:22.320]  works and all of this was written years prior to anything that's come out in the past couple of
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:28.080]  years. Those are collections of my best essays over the last 10 years and you go to jasonalsus.com
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:35.280]  and in the shop tab, you can get signed copies of my book there. I was reminded during the break of
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:41.600]  the Ted Gunderson talk and Alex has been mentioning this because he had interviewed
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:45.840]  Gunderson many years ago and that was one of the first things that I saw on this topic that kind
[3:36:45.840 --> 3:36:52.000]  of shook my assumptions back in 2002 and 2003. If you remember, there used to be Google video and I
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:57.680]  remember watching Ted Gunderson give a talk back then and I thought, this is insane. This guy used
[3:36:57.680 --> 3:37:03.200]  to be a high-level FBI guy and he's sitting here talking about the fact that the McMartin preschool
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:09.520]  case actually had some real evidence behind it. It wasn't just satanic panic. It was a real situation
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:16.720]  of high-level occultists that were connected to a preschool and he even says that this went up to
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:22.720]  famous, he doesn't say who, but famous politicians. He says, you know, sports stars, famous sports
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:28.800]  stars who were involved in this kind of ritual abuse and satanism and at the time, of course,
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:34.240]  even I think that goes back to the 80s and 90s when he was giving that talk, but even in 2002,
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:40.800]  2003, if you talked about this stuff, it was crazy. That doesn't exist. That's crazy. Even though
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:45.360]  there's already at that time, all the way back to the 80s and 90s, there were already journalists
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:50.320]  and people writing books and accounts that dealt with this stuff, right? Representative Charles
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:54.960]  Key, there's the Franklin cover-up. There's a famous book that came out right around the early
[3:37:54.960 --> 3:38:01.120]  2000s by a journalist called Lucifer's Lodge and in Lucifer's Lodge, he detailed this stuff in
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:06.880]  the Vatican circles for decades, right? Going off of hundreds and hundreds of news articles,
[3:38:06.880 --> 3:38:11.680]  which are, of course, now buried. You can never find those old 2003, four, five articles. You'd
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:17.840]  have to dig for hours and that's by design to cover up the history of this stuff. But again,
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:22.080]  if you collected the books throughout that whole time period, as I did, then you know,
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:26.400]  you have, I haven't forgotten this stuff. I remember it all very clearly and isn't it
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:31.680]  fascinating that just a few months ago, the claims that were made by Ted Gunnerson about
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:39.680]  the Finders and the McMartin stuff was all true. The FBI declassifies their stuff relating to the
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:45.120]  McMartin case and, oh yeah, there really were tunnels, by the way. Sorry, that was all the
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:51.360]  media lying to you and telling you that it's all made up. So, known liars continuing to lie,
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:56.720]  why are we believing them at all? All they do is lie, right? When are we going to figure that out?
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:01.760]  I would add too that that's not an isolated case. This is a global thing. There have been
[3:39:02.400 --> 3:39:08.080]  years of operations and thanks to Trump, he's actually ramped this up, what 12-fold, 14-fold,
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:15.680]  of busting these networks of these human trafficking, satanic degenerate groups. But if you remember,
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:19.840]  Dave McGowan, many, many years ago, this goes back to the 2000s, he wrote a book,
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:25.520]  Program to Kill, where he detailed a lot of these cases of ritual murders. And one of those was the
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:30.080]  Dutro Affair. Have you heard of the Dutro Affair? If you don't know about Mark Dutro, who was the
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:37.440]  procurer, right, the Belgian procurer, going back to the 90s and early 2000s, this case was
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:42.560]  him going around and kidnapping women for the elite and they would then use the women in these
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:48.160]  rituals, you know, torture, sex, etc. This went all the way up to the highest levels of the Belgian
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:56.480]  government. They went up to high-level Vatican people in Belgium, pop stars in Europe, high-level
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:02.800]  EU officials all involved in these circles of doing this stuff. So it's not just a matter of, oh,
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:09.040]  yeah, politicians have visited houses of ill repute for a long time. No, no, no, this is beyond
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:16.080]  that. Okay, this is human trafficking to the extent of what the conspiracy theorists have said for
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:24.880]  years. People in cages, people bound, people being, you know, murdered or worse. And it's all coming
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.240]  out. And all the conspiracy theorists are basically quote, quote, the quote conspiracy, they were all
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:35.840]  vindicated. And all of the journalists who were real journalists who wrote real books telling the
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:40.800]  truth about this stuff for many decades are also now vindicated over and over and over.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:45.520]  And it always goes up to the highest levels, right, of the people in government. If you saw
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:49.920]  True Detective Season 1, by the way, did you happen to see that, right? Remember,
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:55.360]  a Mirrenbeau Rush Coal was talking about it. It always is like a flash circle. It just keeps
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:41:00.080]  coming around and around and around in a circle, right? You saw Matthew McConaughey on Joe Rogan
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:05.840]  the other day, four Alex Jones. That role that Matthew McConaughey is playing is like the normal
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:12.320]  guy who's kind of hardened to reality, the cop who stumbles on this stuff. And then he finds out
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:16.960]  that there's these networks of these, you know, satanic elite going all the way up to the highest
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:21.280]  levels of people in Louisiana, I think is where that takes place in Season 1. That was actually
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:28.000]  based on a true story. And if you recall, there are really rich people, senators. Yes, there's the
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:32.480]  fake evangelical minister who's behind or involved in this stuff, right? He's related to the
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:40.960]  Tuttles. And by the way, the Tuttles live, I think it's on Crowley Road, hello. There's a key symbol
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:46.640]  there, key indicator. I mean, this is all real. So we're tying it back to the Crowley stuff.
[3:41:46.640 --> 3:41:53.040]  This is what the elites are into. And they really believe that it's a way to not just traumatize
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:58.480]  people, but in a esoteric sense, they believe they're getting power from this, right? If you think
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:04.240]  of William Butler Yates, the famous poet, he was in the magical circles of Crowley. Yeah, there you
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:08.800]  go. There's the Tuttle guy who lives over on Crowley, Crowley Lane or whatever it is.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:16.240]  William Butler Yates wrote a poem about the Antichrist, and it's about the Second Coming. And
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:20.560]  he talks about the beach, the beast slouching towards Bethlehem, right? Now remember, he's in
[3:42:20.560 --> 3:42:25.280]  the circles of Crowley. That was one of the most famous poets of all time. And Yates says that
[3:42:25.280 --> 3:42:33.200]  that what this crew celebrates is the destruction of innocence. He's talking about what Crowley
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:37.440]  talked about. He's talking about what these people are talking about, that at that level,
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:43.840]  they get off on destroying innocence. That's the highest levels of this satanic elite that
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:50.400]  Malachi Martin was talking about. So what I'm trying to say is that this is a global phenomena.
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:57.200]  It's a global network of people involved in this degeneracy. And what have we seen in the last week,
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:04.240]  last two weeks? Oh, it also ties into foreign compromise operations, right? It's also intelligence
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:10.720]  agencies in other countries, right? Evil groups within our intelligence agencies, right? They
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:14.800]  get this information on people, and this is how they control them. And it's been going on for a
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:20.480]  long time, and it's completely wicked. It's completely evil. It's unbelievable, really. But it's,
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:24.800]  in a sense, they call it the art of human compromise, right? This is what you do to
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:30.240]  entrap people to get them to do what you want them to do. Yeah, exactly. There's a whole island
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:34.720]  based around doing this kind of stuff, right? That's come out, right? It's just laying in Maxwell's
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:41.600]  testimony or her deposition or whatever it was this week. It's, oh, yes. So it's all true. Yeah,
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:46.080]  they all came here. Yeah, but so what? We'll just ignore that. Oh, the laptop, it's all true, but
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:52.880]  we'll just ignore that because that's not real news. What's real news is Trump ordering two
[3:43:52.880 --> 3:43:58.720]  slices of ice cream, right? Trump saying bad hombres, right? That's the real news, not gigantic,
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:03.760]  global, satanic networks of pedophiles. But again, what I'm trying to tell you is that it's
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:08.800]  well documented, not just from, quote, conspiracy theorists, but from mainline journalists, people
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:13.920]  who didn't expect to run into this stuff. People like Ted Gunnerson, high up in the FBI, didn't
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:18.400]  expect to run into this stuff. They run into it. People even within religious circles don't expect
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:22.880]  to run into this stuff. They run into it. It's there all in front of them, right? At the highest
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:28.320]  levels. And that's the problem is that what do you do when it's at that highest level, right?
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:34.560]  Well, you have to oppose it, right? You can't go along with this because you're not going to get away
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:40.160]  with going along with total evil, right? And here we see this week, right? Oh, it's all admitted,
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:46.640]  yes. It was emails, messages, millions of dollars here, millions of dollars there. Yes, it's all
[3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:51.680]  foreign operations. Yes, it's all admitted. Where is the media on this? This alone shows you the
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:56.480]  media as your enemy. They don't tell you any of this stuff. This should be, I mean, this is bigger
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:01.760]  than Watergate. This is bigger than, you know, Russiagate even perhaps because Russiagate was
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:08.160]  just a made up thing to attack Trump lasted four years. This is like scandal, you know,
[3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:15.680]  nuclear level scandal. Where is any of the media on this? 40 news organizations now have
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:22.800]  this laptop and have this information. It's unbelievable. And it just, I have to say,
[3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:28.720]  you know, we should give props to the people who were brave enough back in the 70s, 80s,
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:33.280]  and 90s to talk about this when nobody would believe you. Nobody would listen. This was
[3:45:33.280 --> 3:45:38.960]  the craziest thing ever, right? Think about somebody like John Marks. John Marks wrote this book back
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:45.040]  in the late 70s. And he said that, you know, they're trying to traumatize people. They're
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:49.360]  dissociating people through trauma, creating dissociation states, and they're going to use
[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:55.120]  it on everyone, he says. He says in this last chapter of this book that ultimately this is about
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:46:03.840]  brain ships, human computer interface, and messing with everybody on a global scale. He said this
[3:46:03.840 --> 3:46:08.720]  in the late 70s, but that's what they were going to do. So I think that people who were courageous
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:13.120]  like that, people like Walter Billard who wrote books on the same type of stuff, right? They
[3:46:13.120 --> 3:46:18.560]  should be commended. People like Colin Ross, Dave McGowan. This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:25.840]  You've been watching The Alex Jones Show. Thank you for your time and please support my work.
