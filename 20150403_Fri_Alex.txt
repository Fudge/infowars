[00:00:01.337 --> 00:00:06.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this third day.
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.699]  It is Friday.
[00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.780]  Here's a special report by Paul Watson.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.502]  Then we're coming back with the Iran nuke deal, the latest on Jade Helm, and more straight ahead.
[00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:25.484]  Memories Pizza in Indiana has come under fire from irate liberals after the owners said they would refuse to cater for a gay wedding.
[00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:38.628]  It's the first test of Indiana's largely symbolic Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits state laws that substantially burden the right of a person, a religious institution, or a business to follow their religious beliefs.
[00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:46.390]  Other states have laws in place which force businesses not to discriminate against people based on race, sexuality, or gender.
[00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.593]  First off, this whole Memories Pizza story has been completely mischaracterized amidst the deluge of vitriol and outrage.
[00:00:54.593 --> 00:01:00.114]  Memories Pizza has never said that they would refuse to serve gay people.
[00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:11.478]  In fact, the owner said the very opposite, that they would be happy to serve gays and lesbians in their restaurant, just that they wouldn't cater for a gay wedding because it conflicts with their beliefs.
[00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:20.123]  That prompted one high school coach to post a tweet which tried to recruit others to, quote, burn down Memories Pizza.
[00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:24.166]  Another example of peaceful, liberal tolerance.
[00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.227]  Okay, let's get one thing clear.
[00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:40.196]  Any business owner that refuses to serve gay people because it conflicts with their, quote, religious beliefs clearly deserves to go out of business based off the back of their own stupidity alone.
[00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:48.963]  Selling a cake to a gay person is not the same as being forced into having gay sex with them.
[00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:52.106]  Treat others as you wish to be treated.
[00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:56.830]  You know, Jesus Christ hung around with prostitutes and criminals.
[00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.998]  Fraternizing or doing business with people who have lifestyles with which you disagree is not the same as condoning those lifestyles.
[00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.340]  So it would be monumentally idiotic
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:20.367]  for any business to refuse to serve gay people because of the reputation they'd accrue, but also because their reason for doing so makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:27.892]  But does that then mean that the government should have the right under law to force businesses to serve gay people?
[00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:32.395]  If you believe in a concept called individual freedom,
[00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.724]  The answer is clearly no.
[00:02:35.724 --> 00:02:44.247]  No one should have the right to invoke the power of the state to force anyone to provide a good or service.
[00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:50.509]  The same goes for forcing people into not providing a good or service.
[00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.051]  This is merely the mirror image of the Jim Crow laws.
[00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:57.772]  The government gun should not be involved
[00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:01.334]  With private, voluntary transactions.
[00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:05.897]  The market itself solves the problem of discrimination.
[00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:13.242]  You refuse to serve a gay person, a hundred other businesses are happy to serve them.
[00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:16.684]  They get the money, you go out of business.
[00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:19.486]  There's no need for government involvement.
[00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:21.488]  What's the bigger danger?
[00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:27.592]  Giving the government the power to enforce conduct and behaviour at the point of a gun.
[00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:38.199]  Within people's own private property, or a tiny, tiny percentage of gays not being served in restaurants.
[00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:48.466]  And if anyone, it's gay people that should understand how dangerous it is to give government the power to enforce societal standards.
[00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:52.389]  Given that those same powers were once used to oppress them,
[00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.193]  When homosexuality was illegal in the United States.
[00:03:57.193 --> 00:04:07.883]  They're essentially saying that the government should have the power to discriminate against religious Christians and force them into behaviors which they don't wish to do.
[00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:08.965]  How far will this go?
[00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:17.386]  Will wedding photographers be labelled intolerant and fined for refusing to work at gay weddings?
[00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:24.350]  Will conservative maids who refuse to work in gay households be hit with hate crime charges?
[00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.295]  Will parents be thrown in jail for not wanting to hire a gay babysitter or a gay private tutor?
[00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:38.679]  This is clearly another example of leftists getting irate about a scenario that will never happen.
[00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.800]  On any kind of significant basis.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.321]  Alright folks, you can see the full report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:54.643]  Bottom line, the globalists are taking all of our basic rights and then getting us to infight over a bunch of distractions as if they're the biggest thing in the world.
[00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:59.584]  Huge news on the Iran nuke deal, Jade Helm, the economy and more straight ahead.
[00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:00.864]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:05:00.864 --> 00:05:01.425]  Good, brother.
[00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:03.385]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:05.106]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:09.107]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:11.748]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:14.169]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.811]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using

[00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:36.929]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.112 --> 00:06:04.474]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:08.636]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:13.578]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:30.885]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:40.170]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.953]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:55.660]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:01.384]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:01.384 --> 00:07:06.366]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:06.366 --> 00:07:09.027]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:16.070]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.071]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.032]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:22.032 --> 00:07:24.033]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:26.874]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:32.676]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:36.198]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:39.279]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:46.602]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:07:56.206 --> 00:08:03.191]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.794]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:06.794 --> 00:08:10.917]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:49.846]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen, the third day already of April 2015.
[00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:54.088]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:54.088 --> 00:09:06.192]  Coming up in the third hour today, we are going to have open phones on whatever subject folks wish to discuss.
[00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:12.555]  Coming up in the second hour, we have Daniel H. Wilson coming on the broadcast.
[00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:34.265]  New York Times bestselling author of Robo Apocalypse, and of course this gentleman's book is being turned into a film by Steven Spielberg, and it ties in with the news we see today in the robotic near future, most will live off government provided income.
[00:09:35.663 --> 00:09:50.781]  That's the plan is computers and robots are being designed to displace a world run and designed by humans so the technocrats can control the development or quote evolution in their words of human society.
[00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:51.782]  So we'll be discussing that.
[00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:03.990]  And Nico has just popped in my head, popped in my ear, and told me, that's why I kind of took a double kick there.
[00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.751]  That's my bad, I put it on the wrong hour.
[00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:18.240]  Not a big deal, I just, for a week he was going to be on in the third hour, and then I opened the sheet up and it said the second hour, and so that's in the third hour of open phones in the second hour.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.102]  A train wreck of a start of the broadcast of there ever was one.
[00:10:23.277 --> 00:10:44.261]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, we're obviously going to be opening the phones up here today to get into the Iranian nuke deal, which Israel is very upset about, and that Iran is celebrating and saying that Western media is misrepresenting.
[00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:47.162]  But with that backdrop, I also want to get into
[00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:58.811]  A story that illustrates so much, not just the Second Amendment or the right to self-defense, but also media control and political correctness.
[00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:05.614]  We have militants, not radical Islamist terrorists.
[00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:08.796]  You notice Sky News and others are being politically correct.
[00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:15.379]  We're told to not call illegal aliens illegal aliens, then we're supposed to call them migrants, and now we're just supposed to call them citizens.
[00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:20.044]  Well now, militants kill 147 in Kenya University attack.
[00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:32.671]  An attack by mass terrorists who stormed a university in eastern Kenya has left at least 147 people dead.
[00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:44.055]  Around 80 more have been confirmed as wounded in the siege at the university, which has now ended after four attackers detonated their suicide vest.
[00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:53.018]  The gunmen hurled grenades and fired automatic rifles as students were sleeping, shooting dead dozens before setting Muslims free.
[00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:58.368]  And holding Christians and others hostage.
[00:11:58.368 --> 00:12:02.070]  So the university again was for Christians and Muslims.
[00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:07.232]  It was an open university, but it was a Christian university overall.
[00:12:07.232 --> 00:12:09.753]  And you now see what has happened.
[00:12:09.753 --> 00:12:16.737]  And there will be no apologies by even the mainline Islamic community.
[00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:23.500]  There will be nothing but criticism of how evil the Christians are in Kenya and basically how they deserved it.
[00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:28.697]  And that's what we're seeing in the media.
[00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:36.364]  And this very group is Wahhabist, Al-Qaeda based.
[00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:39.986]  And it's the same group that attacked the shopping mall in Kenya two years ago.
[00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:49.134]  And the head of Interpol came out and said that the answer
[00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:56.966]  to this problem is concealed carry like we have in areas of the US.
[00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:59.087]  But of course two years later that's not been done.
[00:12:59.087 --> 00:13:10.771]  Kenya has very strict gun control laws and of course the terrorists had illegal fully auto and hand grenades that you cannot get even here in the United States.
[00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:17.254]  So, a victim disarmament zone again is used by mad killers
[00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:27.495]  To kill non-military individuals in terroristic cold blood.
[00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:30.457]  And you're not going to hear a word out of the big Christian churches.
[00:13:30.457 --> 00:13:34.059]  You're not going to hear any solidarity by Christians being persecuted worldwide.
[00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:43.004]  You're not going to hear any calls to stop the Al-Qaeda, ISIS forces murdering Christians all over the Middle East or North Africa.
[00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:48.067]  All the way down into Nigeria on the West Coast of Africa, on the Gold Coast of Africa.
[00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:53.277]  And that's because there is an agenda behind all of this.
[00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:56.218]  I am not what you call an Islamophobe.
[00:13:56.218 --> 00:13:59.959]  I don't sit up here obsessing over Muslims all day.
[00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:06.462]  And I went to high school and college and have Muslim friends I've worked out with, lift weights, played soccer, you name it.
[00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:11.784]  Most Muslims that were in this country previously did not want to live under the oppression of the Middle East.
[00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.564]  That's why they came here.
[00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:31.765]  The new waves, though, being brought in from Somalia and other areas, are hardcore Islamists, and they hate Christians, and the statistics and the crime numbers show this, and they want to radical Islamify the West.
[00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:37.708]  And already, in many countries in Europe, half the births are Muslim.
[00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:42.450]  And the radical Muslims, being funded by Saudi Arabia predominantly, are being bullied.
[00:14:43.909 --> 00:15:03.027]  into radicalizing and so the radical is becoming the new mainstay the radical is becoming the new status quo and because it doesn't fit with the narrative of political correctness
[00:15:04.434 --> 00:15:15.898]  You notice it's not a big news story today even though CNN has the headline that will the Middle East now be Christian free as Christians are slaughtered and forced out of every country.
[00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:26.281]  And in every case the United States and the UN and other globalist combines like NATO are directly involved
[00:15:27.648 --> 00:15:39.558]  Very, very aggressively supporting economic and military, cultural and religious policies that destroy Christianity.
[00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:50.827]  Even the UN last year had to admit that the amount of Christian persecution had doubled in the last decade and that Christians were the most persecuted group in the world.
[00:15:54.645 --> 00:16:01.308]  And one big reason for that is Christians have been globalized.
[00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:19.015]  Christians have gone under the World Council of Churches, they're no longer Christians, at least their leaders aren't, and they won't stand up for themselves and they've been taught Romans 13, submit to the government, even though in the West, we the people and the law are the government.
[00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:22.857]  And so when the government's violating the law, they're violating God's Word.
[00:16:24.107 --> 00:16:26.769]  But see, they've inverted all of that.
[00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:31.113]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:16:31.113 --> 00:16:33.776]  George Washington.
[00:16:33.776 --> 00:16:34.957]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:41.923]  No one knows who originally said it because they all said it.
[00:16:41.923 --> 00:16:42.884]  We've already been conquered.
[00:16:42.884 --> 00:16:45.746]  We've killed 55 million babies in this country.
[00:16:45.746 --> 00:16:47.228]  Our borders are completely wide open.
[00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:53.951]  We allow the IRS to take people's houses and bank accounts with no charges, no evidence.
[00:16:53.951 --> 00:17:02.856]  We have allowed our government to sign us on to half of the global $2.2 quadrillion, $2,200 trillion.
[00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.097]  We are a conquered nation.
[00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:06.119]  And I don't say that to lower morale.
[00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.960]  I say that to admit where we're at.
[00:17:12.571 --> 00:17:22.521]  You've got a bully sitting on top of you, punching you in the face, and you've got to get angry to get him off of you.
[00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:27.225]  So do you want the globalists off our backs, or do you want to keep going down this road?
[00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:35.854]  Because submitting to it, laying down to it, rolling over to it, bending over to it, kneeling down to it, and licking the boots,
[00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:38.154]  Is only making it worse.
[00:17:38.154 --> 00:17:41.916]  In fact, will you guys print me Patrick Henry's give me liberty or give me death speech?
[00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:49.439]  I think I'm going to read that on air.
[00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:50.959]  But it shows the media control.
[00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:58.442]  Can you imagine if a Christian would have gone in a Muslim madrasa or school and killed 147 people and injured over 80?
[00:17:58.442 --> 00:17:58.662]  Wounded?
[00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:15.860]  It would be on every channel, every newspaper for three months, the evil of Christianity, the hatred, what do we do to prove that we're not bad, how do we feel guilty, how do we submit?
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.622]  It would be the end of the world.
[00:18:18.622 --> 00:18:28.129]  Can you imagine if a Christian went in a college in the United States and killed 147 secular people?
[00:18:28.129 --> 00:18:30.731]  It would be the biggest story of the decade.
[00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:31.711]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.497]  It is almost nowhere in the news now, the attacks in Kenya.
[00:18:37.497 --> 00:18:45.108]  And the FBI says that ISIS, same group, same Wahhabist Sunni group, has
[00:18:46.872 --> 00:18:50.354]  operatives in all 50 states and is set to attack.
[00:18:50.354 --> 00:18:54.677]  See, the FBI may not have to go out and find crazy people to wind them up this time.
[00:18:54.677 --> 00:19:15.250]  Our border's so wide open, they're allowing recruiting by ISIS all over the West, and for young people, ages 12 up to 30 or so, to go back and forth, they're allowing Saudi and other money to fund this, and this is the destabilization force that will be used, that we warned you of,
[00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:18.366]  To bring in the tyranny.
[00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:31.216]  And then we'll welcome the military on the streets after we've seen, in one day, 20, 30 primary schools hit, colleges hit, shopping malls hit, thousands dead.
[00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:36.219]  And you watch, logic will be ignored when this happens.
[00:19:36.219 --> 00:19:41.700]  They'll say the answer is taking our guns, and they'll claim that the radical Islamists got the guns at gun shows.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.260]  You can see them writing the script right now.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.580]  They let them in.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.781]  They send them to gun shows to get the weapons.
[00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:51.141]  They attack.
[00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:52.982]  You can see the whole plan being laid out.
[00:19:52.982 --> 00:19:54.062]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:57.983]  It's a question of not if, but when the next shoe drops.
[00:19:57.983 --> 00:19:59.163]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:02.006]  Hear that?
[00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:07.390]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.332]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:20:10.332 --> 00:20:13.875]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:21.440]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:21:00.123 --> 00:21:02.064]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:05.687]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:21:05.687 --> 00:21:07.048]  A pair of scissors.
[00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:12.851]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:17.775]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:18.755]  The phone line.
[00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:24.019]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:27.761]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:21:27.901 --> 00:21:31.225]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:38.489]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:39.289]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:45.454]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.454 --> 00:22:49.157]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.391]  We've all heard the news stories.
[00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:02.511]  Another shooting.
[00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:04.232]  And they're getting worse.

[00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:00.623]  Yeah.
[00:24:09.884 --> 00:24:14.768]  You know, right now might be a good time to actually read Patrick Henry's speech since we're coming in with this song.
[00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:15.989]  Alex Jones here, he just joined us.
[00:24:15.989 --> 00:24:19.432]  But I'm going to do this in the next segment because it'll take time to read his speech.
[00:24:19.432 --> 00:24:21.093]  If I try to hurry through it, I'll butcher it.
[00:24:39.184 --> 00:24:48.651]  David Knight is going to pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:56.357]  One of my children is going to go to a Bible camp this weekend, and so I want to see her before she goes.
[00:24:56.357 --> 00:24:58.478]  I didn't get to see her a lot this morning.
[00:24:58.478 --> 00:24:59.719]  So I'm going to have lunch with
[00:25:01.052 --> 00:25:10.784]  My children at 1230, and David Knight's going to come in here and do 30 minutes of the show, then I'll interview the author of Robo Apocalypse.
[00:25:10.784 --> 00:25:16.571]  I had surgery Wednesday, and I felt great Wednesday, great yesterday.
[00:25:16.571 --> 00:25:19.014]  I kind of feel out of it today, but I still came in.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.961]  So I seem a little bit dingy, a little bit out of it.
[00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:24.522]  That is what's going on.
[00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:26.643]  Had hernia surgery, went very well.
[00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:28.304]  People are surprised I'm here.
[00:25:28.304 --> 00:25:30.465]  This is better than sitting around home watching television.
[00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:39.268]  I mean, I just don't sit around and I'd rather just be active and deal with a little bit of pain I have than be inactive and not focus on the pain.
[00:25:39.268 --> 00:25:40.109]  So that's why I'm here.
[00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:42.530]  Appreciate all of your support out there.
[00:25:45.526 --> 00:25:56.248]  He's also going to be getting into the Kenyan situation and driverless cars and more when he comes in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:25:56.248 --> 00:25:57.849]  But my children are off school today.
[00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:06.010]  And so we're going to have lunch.
[00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.171]  I tell you, my head is spinning with the amount of news here to go over.
[00:26:12.128 --> 00:26:14.529]  Let's just talk about the facts.
[00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:33.197]  Radical Islamists and folks coming in from Saudi Arabia, they don't have to wear... They don't have to take off their burqas and their headdresses when they come through airport security because they, quote, have religious freedom and they won't put up with it.
[00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:44.989]  But American citizens have to take our shoes off, our belts off, and be treated like slaves, and walk through all the athlete's foot, and the flesh-eating bacteria, and the rest of it.
[00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:49.455]  Meanwhile, numbers show that the world will be majority Muslim
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:27:06.949]  By 2070, Pew studies suggest, and with Islam being accelerated in its radicalization, and with Christianity being henpecked and attacked by the political correct socialist movement, we're in trouble.
[00:27:06.949 --> 00:27:12.592]  There's the big comedian, David Cross, who put out a movie that just came out.
[00:27:12.592 --> 00:27:19.876]  In fact, I was on Netflix just last week, and there it was, the first movie that came up as new releases.
[00:27:21.437 --> 00:27:23.919]  And at the end of the movie, he goes, I love Alex Jones.
[00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:28.701]  I hate blacks, Jews, and Muslims.
[00:27:28.701 --> 00:27:33.484]  The name of the film is Hits.
[00:27:33.484 --> 00:27:37.587]  It didn't much of a hit on IMDb with a 5.6 rating, I'll tell you that.
[00:27:37.587 --> 00:27:44.231]  And the movie just ends with the fact that I hate Muslims.
[00:27:48.123 --> 00:28:07.029]  And see, what do you have a big, rich, liberal socialist like David Cross, who has bodyguards but doesn't want us to be harmed, and then he sees it as radical and right-wing and not embrace radical Islam,
[00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:19.775]  And then you'll never hear David Cross or any of these people criticize radical Islamists murdering Christians this year and last year by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:28:19.775 --> 00:28:24.597]  Just type in UN says Christians most persecuted group.
[00:28:24.597 --> 00:28:26.998]  And then even the UN admits that.
[00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:32.180]  Why do so-called liberals hate Christians so much?
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.460]  Unless
[00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:39.736]  They're liberal groups that have taken over major denominations of churches, like the Methodist Church.
[00:28:39.736 --> 00:28:46.160]  That here in Austin, the First Methodist Church is a collection agency for the illegals and for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.280]  And there's the headline.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.042]  Christians currently most persecuted religious group in the world.
[00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:54.024]  Holy See tells UN.
[00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:56.786]  Well, that's the Vatican.
[00:28:56.786 --> 00:29:00.528]  The UN report last year admitted that, as well.
[00:29:01.511 --> 00:29:04.714]  So I'm kind of not really beating a dead horse here today.
[00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:08.077]  It's just very upsetting.
[00:29:08.077 --> 00:29:09.298]  Yep, there's Reuters.
[00:29:09.298 --> 00:29:11.941]  About 100 million Christians persecuted around the world.
[00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:12.841]  Report.
[00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:18.767]  About 100 million Christians are persecuted around the world with conditions worsening for them most rapidly in Syria and Ethiopia.
[00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:24.004]  According to an annual report by a group supporting oppressed Christians worldwide.
[00:29:24.004 --> 00:29:31.189]  Open Doors, an undenominational Christian group, listed North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan as the three toughest countries for Christians last year.
[00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:37.253]  They topped 50 country ranking in 2011 as well.
[00:29:37.253 --> 00:29:39.455]  We're going to come back and I'm going to reset and get into all this.
[00:29:40.868 --> 00:29:47.073]  But the bigger issue is, look at how this massacre of Christians isn't even in the news.
[00:29:47.073 --> 00:29:48.294]  You'd think it never happened.
[00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:49.175]  Because they're Christians.
[00:29:49.175 --> 00:29:51.256]  They're just like veterans.
[00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:51.637]  Kill them.
[00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:52.717]  Don't give them healthcare.
[00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:54.219]  Nobody cares.
[00:29:54.219 --> 00:29:56.901]  Gun owners, veterans, Christians are the enemy.
[00:29:56.901 --> 00:29:58.042]  We are the listed enemy.
[00:30:00.223 --> 00:30:09.868]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:09.868 --> 00:30:19.793]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:19.793 --> 00:30:22.715]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:22.935 --> 00:30:23.555]  I think so.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.847]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:56.796]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:31:00.322 --> 00:31:01.643]  The experts are clear.
[00:31:01.643 --> 00:31:08.769]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:15.034]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:31:15.034 --> 00:31:18.617]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:22.959]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:28.281]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:31:28.281 --> 00:31:29.301]  Not our iodine.

[00:33:17.814 --> 00:33:21.855]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:21.855 --> 00:33:27.777]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:36.199]  I was just mentioning how gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, veterans are the trash to be taken out by the globalists.
[00:33:36.199 --> 00:33:37.060]  We are the enemy.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.020]  We are hated.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.460]  We better get together.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.101]  We better stand together.
[00:33:41.101 --> 00:33:45.202]  WorldNetDaily has an article, and this is what happens to former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs,
[00:33:46.081 --> 00:33:53.367]  More than 15 times, he told me, until he just stopped going.
[00:33:53.367 --> 00:34:01.973]  He's been here a year now, and Joe Biggs has shrapnel, bullet wounds, you name it.
[00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.054]  Highly decorated.
[00:34:03.054 --> 00:34:05.756]  He tries to go into the VA, coughing up blood.
[00:34:05.756 --> 00:34:10.360]  And just over and over and over again, they just keep saying, get this paperwork, get that paperwork.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.380]  He comes back each time.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.302]  They say, come back next week.
[00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:14.603]  He's on a no-treat list.
[00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:20.160]  And of course that came out last year that indeed they have that for about a third of the vets.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.503]  Well, VA makes vet-proof leg amputation with x-ray.
[00:34:25.503 --> 00:34:30.386]  A former 75th Ranger Regiment soldier who lost his leg during military service described the U.S.
[00:34:30.386 --> 00:34:42.872]  Department of Veterans Affairs as so inept and bureaucratic that the medical official at one affiliated facility insisted on an x-ray of his artificial limb as proof of his amputation.
[00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:45.334]  Instead of just looking at it and having it in the records.
[00:34:46.479 --> 00:34:47.660]  That's just how they deny the care.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.661]  They just keep saying, we don't have the records.
[00:34:50.661 --> 00:34:56.564]  Veteran Chad Fleming told Glenn Beck that the VA opted against reviewing his medical history.
[00:34:56.564 --> 00:34:57.085]  That's what they do.
[00:34:57.085 --> 00:34:58.305]  They just won't even review it.
[00:34:58.305 --> 00:35:07.470]  Or simply having an official look at the space on his body where his legs should have been in favor of taking a costly x-ray of the limb that doesn't exist, he said.
[00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.111]  And again, that's how they mess with you.
[00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:15.559]  And they make you do blood tests after blood tests after blood tests, or they'll say, oh, you want us to look at why you're coughing up blood?
[00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:16.600]  We're gonna do a colonoscopy.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.041]  You come back next week, we're gonna do another colonoscopy.
[00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.202]  Come back again, they go, we're doing it again.
[00:35:20.202 --> 00:35:22.463]  You go, you just did it, and you go, we don't have those records.
[00:35:22.463 --> 00:35:23.564]  Or we gotta give you all your vaccines.
[00:35:23.564 --> 00:35:24.484]  You just gave them to me last week.
[00:35:24.484 --> 00:35:25.945]  Do it again.
[00:35:25.945 --> 00:35:26.966]  They just laugh at you.
[00:35:26.966 --> 00:35:28.507]  It's all a big sick joke.
[00:35:28.507 --> 00:35:29.908]  Or they just give you bags of drugs.
[00:35:29.908 --> 00:35:30.848]  Here, take this.
[00:35:30.848 --> 00:35:31.829]  You like drugs, don't you?
[00:35:32.662 --> 00:35:39.805]  The doctor actually laughed when he said, the news site reported, and I told him, I said, you wonder why this country is in such a deficit?
[00:35:39.805 --> 00:35:43.326]  It's because you're wasting money taking x-rays of a level that doesn't exist.
[00:35:43.326 --> 00:35:46.207]  It's like, dude, I'm not a starfish.
[00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:49.889]  It isn't going to grow back.
[00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:56.912]  The VA has faced considerable fire for providing inadequate services to veterans and delaying necessary medical treatment.
[00:35:58.012 --> 00:35:59.652]  On purpose to meet budgets.
[00:35:59.652 --> 00:36:00.993]  They haven't been accused.
[00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:09.555]  They have the Watson computers from IBM denying the care.
[00:36:09.555 --> 00:36:10.215]  It came out.
[00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:12.516]  People blew the whistle and it got whitewashed.
[00:36:12.516 --> 00:36:19.078]  This is the criminal government we have running things.
[00:36:19.078 --> 00:36:21.818]  They've got plenty of money to take care of people, folks.
[00:36:21.818 --> 00:36:23.559]  They will give you the runaround forever.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.502]  Now the Pentagon can't account for $45 billion it spent in Afghanistan being paid to contractors.
[00:36:30.502 --> 00:36:31.943]  It's a giant scam.
[00:36:31.943 --> 00:36:33.324]  You ask why we don't win wars?
[00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:35.264]  Because we're not designed to win.
[00:36:35.264 --> 00:36:42.868]  They're designed to go on and on and on as a big black hole to pour money into since the day of Vietnam.
[00:36:42.868 --> 00:36:44.528]  It was always about money-making.
[00:36:44.528 --> 00:36:47.630]  Spendley Butler, two-time Gresham Medal Honor winner, exposed that.
[00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.491]  Commandant of the Marine Corps.
[00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:53.292]  Or he was up to be commandant and then wouldn't go along with a coup d'etat.
[00:36:55.216 --> 00:37:17.288]  But since Vietnam, where they wouldn't let them mine the northern harbors, wouldn't let them bomb the factories, wouldn't let them bomb the Russian ships coming in with the weapons, and the Chinese ships, wouldn't let them torpedo them, because they wanted to go on and on and on and on and on to sit on top of the opium and ship it out and make billions of dollars a month in contracts.
[00:37:18.957 --> 00:37:21.878]  LBJ went from being worth a few million dollars.
[00:37:21.878 --> 00:37:23.638]  He got in Congress with nothing.
[00:37:23.638 --> 00:37:26.679]  He was worth a few million dollars when Vietnam started.
[00:37:26.679 --> 00:37:32.660]  He was worth billions by the end of it.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.860]  His wife was as well.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.720]  Yes, his wife was as well, absolutely.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.721]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:37:38.721 --> 00:37:40.421]  They are absolutely sick.
[00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:41.702]  Good point, CJ.
[00:37:41.702 --> 00:37:46.963]  I mean, the Johnsons still own about a third of the buildings downtown.
[00:37:46.963 --> 00:37:48.003]  It makes me want to throw up.
[00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.266]  Absolutely makes me want to throw up.
[00:37:55.266 --> 00:38:04.516]  They wanted to put my show on 590 AM years ago when they still owned it, KLBJ.
[00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:09.641]  And they said, nope, it's come down from the family that we're not going to pick your show up.
[00:38:09.641 --> 00:38:13.185]  I've actually had the Johnsons try to keep me off radio stations.
[00:38:13.185 --> 00:38:15.007]  What a, what a group of crooks.
[00:38:16.874 --> 00:38:20.956]  Alright, I don't mean to digress off into that.
[00:38:20.956 --> 00:38:24.097]  Kansas will allow concealed carry of guns without a permit.
[00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:25.098]  That's certainly good news.
[00:38:25.098 --> 00:38:25.778]  Reuters.
[00:38:25.778 --> 00:38:31.861]  Kansas residents will be allowed to carry concealed weapons in the state without training or a permit starting July under a bill signed into law.
[00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:33.882]  It's just the Vermont Open Carry, folks.
[00:38:33.882 --> 00:38:35.763]  Thursday by Governor Sam Brownback.
[00:38:35.763 --> 00:38:37.284]  Good job, Sam.
[00:38:37.284 --> 00:38:41.846]  Said the new law will protect the rights of gun owners while opponents of the measure pose a safety risk.
[00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:52.315]  Reasonable gun owners, ladies and gentlemen, reasonable gun ownership for protection in sport is a right inherent in our Constitution, Brownback said in a statement.
[00:38:52.315 --> 00:38:59.882]  Alaska, Vermont, Arizona, Arkansas, Wyoming have similar laws and Texas has said try to pass it as well.
[00:38:59.882 --> 00:39:02.425]  So great job Kansas.
[00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:04.347]  Crime rates have dropped everywhere it happens.
[00:39:05.646 --> 00:39:07.586]  Criminals don't follow the law.
[00:39:07.586 --> 00:39:09.627]  They're going to get guns and commit crimes.
[00:39:09.627 --> 00:39:11.687]  More guns on the street means less crime.
[00:39:11.687 --> 00:39:16.528]  That's in major studies by Professor Lott and others.
[00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:18.029]  We ought to get Professor Lott back on the show.
[00:39:18.029 --> 00:39:21.750]  He hasn't probably been on in like six, seven years.
[00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.950]  And what did the head of Interpol say?
[00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.531]  Arm the general public.
[00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:26.931]  It was one British commando.
[00:39:27.967 --> 00:39:36.750]  Off-duty, licensed to carry firearms at that mall two years ago that cut the number of deaths that's estimated by the Kenyan government in half.
[00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:44.032]  One guy with a firearm held him down so the massacre could stop so they could surround him and then take him out.
[00:39:44.032 --> 00:39:52.135]  Imagine, I mean I guarantee you if you had five or six jihadis, it was four, did this yesterday in Kenya.
[00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:54.936]  Four guys try to come into a university
[00:39:56.383 --> 00:39:57.643]  If they had guns, it'd be over.
[00:39:57.643 --> 00:40:00.745]  But see, they know universities are gun-free areas.
[00:40:00.745 --> 00:40:03.306]  They always attack gun-free areas.
[00:40:03.306 --> 00:40:05.586]  Well, Kenya's a gun-free country.
[00:40:05.586 --> 00:40:09.028]  And now their government's calling for more police.
[00:40:09.028 --> 00:40:11.449]  No, the answer is not more police.
[00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:17.271]  Unless it was police training citizens how to use guns and creating a posse.
[00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:19.632]  That's all that is, is civil defense, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:19.632 --> 00:40:25.554]  If you don't trust the pilots to fly the planes and the good citizens with no criminal record to own guns, then you don't have a country.
[00:40:27.145 --> 00:40:32.688]  Then you turn everything loose to criminals.
[00:40:32.688 --> 00:40:35.530]  Now I want to get into the Iran situation now.
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.991]  I've been trying to read over the agreement.
[00:40:36.991 --> 00:40:43.255]  It looks like it's got a bunch of gray areas and quite frankly it is a victory for Iran.
[00:40:43.255 --> 00:40:45.436]  It will allow them to develop peaceful
[00:40:46.465 --> 00:41:04.105]  Reactors it will allow them to develop the oil refineries they need to become energy sufficient if Iran doesn't go the way of war This will allow them to become a first world nation the globalists don't want that So I don't know why they've done this deal I Talked to
[00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:21.837]  The owner of a security company in Los Angeles, who's a former highly decorated Israeli commando this weekend, when I was out in Los Angeles, and he agreed with me that this is all a bait and switch, some type of screw job, and that the Israeli government is in on it with the U.S.
[00:41:21.837 --> 00:41:25.898]  and Iran, and that it's more sophisticated than we're being told.
[00:41:25.898 --> 00:41:33.021]  Don't forget, Israel was involved in Iran-Contra doing backroom deals with Iran while acting like they were their enemy in 1980.
[00:41:33.021 --> 00:41:35.022]  So, we don't know what's really going on.
[00:41:36.124 --> 00:41:43.032]  And quite frankly, this is so foggy, I don't know what to make of it.
[00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:47.556]  But joyful Iranians dance into the night after nuclear breakthrough.
[00:41:47.556 --> 00:41:55.665]  AFP, Iran, world powers reach initial deal on reining in Tehran's nuclear program.
[00:41:55.665 --> 00:41:57.787]  It will put cameras in the reactors and inspectors.
[00:41:59.013 --> 00:42:02.735]  Obama, tentative Iran nuclear deal, best option for Israel.
[00:42:02.735 --> 00:42:03.296]  Here's the deal.
[00:42:03.296 --> 00:42:14.503]  Pakistan, it's well known, a decade ago transferred nukes to Saudi Arabia and Iran reportedly has been getting what it needs from Russia.
[00:42:14.503 --> 00:42:17.464]  And so that's why it's kind of a stalemate.
[00:42:17.464 --> 00:42:21.947]  Obama says tentative Iran nuke deal, best option for Israel.
[00:42:21.947 --> 00:42:22.808]  You know what, Obama?
[00:42:23.638 --> 00:42:24.158]  Here's the deal.
[00:42:24.158 --> 00:42:27.681]  I'm not against Israel, but I'm sick of hearing about Israel interest.
[00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:29.603]  How about what's best for U.S.
[00:42:29.603 --> 00:42:34.007]  national security?
[00:42:34.007 --> 00:42:35.968]  How about you be the president of the U.S.?
[00:42:35.968 --> 00:42:38.510]  No, you're a globalist selling the country out.
[00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.074]  And this whole Iran thing's a distraction while our borders are wide open and our economy goes into free fall.
[00:42:43.074 --> 00:42:43.955]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:42:44.997 --> 00:42:46.918]  Politico actually has a pretty good article.
[00:42:46.918 --> 00:42:53.740]  The gray areas in the Iran deal, how a pre-dawn meeting in Switzerland produced one of the Iran's deals, has many fuzzy areas.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.960]  Yeah, it's like Obamacare.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.122]  It's a blank check for both sides that just kind of kick the can down the road.
[00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:05.544]  Netanyahu sends a very blunt message to Obama following announcement on Iran deal.
[00:43:05.544 --> 00:43:08.405]  Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu sent a very blunt message to Obama
[00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:18.480]  Today, following an announcement of a tentative deal with Iran aimed at curbing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.702]  We're going to get to what he had to say in a moment, but first, here's an excerpt of Obama's speech as posted at USA Today.
[00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:25.562]  Here it is.
[00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:39.004]  Today, the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
[00:43:41.078 --> 00:43:43.700]  This has been a long time coming.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:49.104]  The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades.
[00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:58.011]  Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal.
[00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:00.252]  And it is a good deal.
[00:44:00.252 --> 00:44:02.674]  A deal that meets our core objectives.
[00:44:02.674 --> 00:44:04.075]  So is Obamacare?
[00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:08.839]  This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.
[00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:13.111]  So this deal is not based on trust.
[00:44:13.111 --> 00:44:18.574]  It's based on unprecedented verification.
[00:44:18.574 --> 00:44:21.977]  Many key details will be finalized over the next three months.
[00:44:21.977 --> 00:44:24.318]  And nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.
[00:44:24.318 --> 00:44:25.779]  Yeah, it's kind of like the FCC deal.
[00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:26.120]  You can't see it.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.843]  But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize.
[00:44:31.843 --> 00:44:39.629]  First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium because it will not develop weapons-grade plutonium.
[00:44:40.856 --> 00:44:45.459]  The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced.
[00:44:45.459 --> 00:44:51.403]  The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor.
[00:44:51.403 --> 00:44:55.226]  Iran will not build a new heavy water reactor.
[00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:59.889]  And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors.
[00:44:59.889 --> 00:45:02.230]  Ever.
[00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:07.254]  Second, this deal shuts down Iran's path to a bomb using enriched uranium.
[00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:13.017]  Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds.
[00:45:13.017 --> 00:45:14.618]  All right, let's go.
[00:45:14.618 --> 00:45:16.760]  That's enough of Obama.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.641]  Again, all of this is moot.
[00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:22.765]  Iran's got nuclear weapons and so does Saudi Arabia and so does South Africa and so many countries.
[00:45:22.765 --> 00:45:27.629]  Israel just finally admitted last week they've got nukes, as if I needed Israel to admit that.
[00:45:27.629 --> 00:45:32.333]  And Kurt Nemo has his perspective on it at Infowars.com.
[00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:36.176]  The hypocrisy behind the Iran nuclear agreement, few mention U.S.
[00:45:36.176 --> 00:45:36.696]  use of nukes.
[00:45:37.794 --> 00:45:42.519]  On civilians, talking about DU, and Israel's stockpile of bombs.
[00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:46.723]  Yeah, Israel's not part of the UN Weapons Convention.
[00:45:46.723 --> 00:45:54.831]  And again, I'm not even bashing Israel, but it's hypocritical to say that Israel doesn't have to follow any of these treaties or rules, but Iran does.
[00:45:54.831 --> 00:46:00.076]  And this sets the precedent under globalism where the UN controls sovereign countries.
[00:46:00.076 --> 00:46:01.978]  And now you notice under UN rules they're trying to ban
[00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:08.154]  Stoves and outside fireplaces and barbecue pits.
[00:46:08.154 --> 00:46:12.417]  I mean, that's now happening in California.
[00:46:12.417 --> 00:46:17.200]  So... No, they're trying to regulate local barbecue trailers here in Austin, Alex.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.041]  I was not aware of that.
[00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:18.642]  Yeah.
[00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:19.282]  Yeah.
[00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:19.903]  You're kidding.
[00:46:19.903 --> 00:46:20.683]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:46:20.683 --> 00:46:22.284]  There's some trailers out in Barton Springs.
[00:46:22.284 --> 00:46:23.345]  There's a couple on the east side.
[00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:26.568]  They're saying that the smoke is driving residents crazy when they open their windows.
[00:46:27.597 --> 00:46:33.359]  Yeah, so just normal human activity, shut down all human activity, but let GMO take place, all of it.
[00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:36.581]  Let, you know, chemtrailing go on, it's just insane.
[00:46:36.581 --> 00:46:41.983]  Let's go to Iran's foreign minister, Javed Zarif, on the so-called framework.
[00:46:41.983 --> 00:46:43.003]  Here it is.
[00:46:43.003 --> 00:46:46.525]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:46.525 --> 00:46:51.027]  Let me again thank you all for having followed our work.
[00:46:51.027 --> 00:46:54.948]  We've done significant work.
[00:46:54.948 --> 00:46:55.849]  If we look back,
[00:46:57.516 --> 00:47:11.048]  At recent history, and if we succeed, we've taken a major step, but we're still some time away from reaching where we want to be.
[00:47:12.435 --> 00:47:13.896]  I was about to say, no deals have been made.
[00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:20.120]  This would be one of the few cases where an issue is resolved through diplomatic means.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.261]  No, it's been a proxy war in Syria.
[00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:32.367]  And that would require an approach that would concentrate on a non-zero-sum outcome, a win-win outcome.
[00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:37.570]  And that was my country's approach to this from the very beginning.
[00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.112]  We appreciate the work that every delegation has put to this.
[00:47:41.181 --> 00:47:43.623]  We have done significant work.
[00:47:43.623 --> 00:47:45.584]  We have made achievements.
[00:47:45.584 --> 00:47:47.125]  We have made progress.
[00:47:47.125 --> 00:48:04.999]  We have decided to take steps for a period of time to assure anybody who had concern, which we thought those concerns were misplaced anyway, that our program is exclusively peaceful, has always been, and will always remain exclusively peaceful.
[00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:09.723]  Let's go to Benjamin Netanyahu, the newly re-elected Prime Minister of Israel.
[00:48:09.723 --> 00:48:11.645]  Let's get his take on it.
[00:48:11.645 --> 00:48:25.758]  The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran, would not destroy a single centrifuge in Iran, and will not stop R&D on Iran's advanced centrifuges.
[00:48:25.758 --> 00:48:30.263]  On the contrary, the deal would legitimize Iran's illegal nuclear program,
[00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:36.469]  It would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure.
[00:48:36.469 --> 00:48:40.492]  A vast nuclear infrastructure remains in place.
[00:48:40.492 --> 00:48:51.300]  The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately, and this at the very time that Iran is stepping up its aggression and terror in the region and beyond the region.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:55.664]  In a few years, the deal would remove the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.
[00:48:57.176 --> 00:49:06.865]  Enabling Iran to have a massive enrichment capacity that it could use to produce many nuclear bombs within a matter of months.
[00:49:06.865 --> 00:49:10.609]  Such a deal does not block Iran's path to the bomb.
[00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:12.911]  Such a deal paves Iran's path to the bomb.
[00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:14.772]  Alright, here's what's really going on, folks.
[00:49:15.848 --> 00:49:19.989]  There's a proxy war between Shiites and Sunnis.
[00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:36.792]  The West is allied with the most radical, largest group, the Saudi Arabian Jihadi Al Qaeda types, ISIS group, that just attacked the Kenyan university.
[00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:40.473]  And the West has been trying to take Iran down and they failed.
[00:49:41.198 --> 00:49:43.080]  And they fell because Russia backed them.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.262]  And our own military would not back Al-Qaeda against Syria.
[00:49:46.262 --> 00:49:51.586]  So now Saudi Arabia has gone crazy and launched attacks all over against Shiite areas.
[00:49:51.586 --> 00:49:53.828]  So the Shiites are striking back.
[00:49:53.828 --> 00:49:59.633]  Now Chinese troops, I forgot this, have landed in the Middle East.
[00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:01.614]  I mean, I'm going to be getting to that after the break.
[00:50:01.614 --> 00:50:07.579]  You cannot make up how crazy all of this has gotten.
[00:50:10.987 --> 00:50:13.889]  You cannot make it up.
[00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:16.050]  In fact, I'm having trouble finding my Chinese troop story.
[00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:20.052]  Maybe you guys can... It's on screen, there it is.
[00:50:20.052 --> 00:50:22.473]  Yeah, that's from... Chaos in Yemen.
[00:50:22.473 --> 00:50:23.994]  Chinese troops arrive as U.S.
[00:50:23.994 --> 00:50:28.896]  armed rebels set sights on Central Bank.
[00:50:28.896 --> 00:50:30.857]  Print me that article.
[00:50:30.857 --> 00:50:32.258]  Thank you.
[00:50:32.258 --> 00:50:34.879]  I mean, we're entering Twilight Zoneville here.
[00:50:34.879 --> 00:50:37.441]  The whole world is accelerating into confrontation.
[00:50:38.516 --> 00:50:50.127]  And so the West wants sanctions on Iran to try to cripple Hezbollah running guerrilla warfare operations in the Middle East against the Saudi Arabian takeover.
[00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:51.929]  Does that mean the Iran's the good guys?
[00:50:51.929 --> 00:50:52.750]  No.
[00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:57.114]  But they are the underdog and they're not the ones launching the terror attacks, okay?
[00:50:57.114 --> 00:50:57.775]  It's Saudi Arabia.
[00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.070]  This hour of GCN brought to you by LeSic.

[00:51:30.215 --> 00:51:31.375]  It's happening again.
[00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:34.996]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:34.996 --> 00:51:38.416]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:42.457]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and a higher body armor.
[00:51:42.457 --> 00:51:47.478]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.

[00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:02.334]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:02.334 --> 00:52:07.459]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:07.459 --> 00:52:15.306]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:20.110]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:24.073]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:24.073 --> 00:52:30.017]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:30.017 --> 00:52:33.200]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.344]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:38.544 --> 00:52:46.727]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:59.031 --> 00:53:00.912]  By now you heard about Bitcoins.
[00:53:00.912 --> 00:53:04.415]  But did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept Bitcoins?
[00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:10.679]  Listen, if you're already earning Bitcoins or trying to make money in the Bitcoin market, you've got to know BidBit.co.

[00:54:07.213 --> 00:54:12.472]  Woah-boom-bop-a-boom Woah-boom-bop-a-boom
[00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:21.822]  Victim, Cuban victim of Fidel Castro's roundup.
[00:54:21.822 --> 00:54:27.946]  She's horrified by Jade Helm and the footage that he's seen on the news of the military practicing to round up Floridians.
[00:54:27.946 --> 00:54:29.067]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:29.067 --> 00:54:31.409]  We're gonna be breaking that down in the next hour.
[00:54:31.409 --> 00:54:38.074]  Army is seeking crisis actors for Ohio military drill in June ahead of Jade Helm.
[00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:40.116]  That's out of Investment Watch.
[00:54:40.116 --> 00:54:44.959]  Opportunity begins May 19th to the 15th and runs for up to five years.
[00:54:45.936 --> 00:54:51.697]  To be part of these crises they want to play out.
[00:54:51.697 --> 00:54:53.497]  Isn't that just interesting?
[00:54:53.497 --> 00:55:02.439]  You can see the video at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the video report that breaks all of that down.
[00:55:02.439 --> 00:55:12.481]  Again, the Chinese troops reportedly are there evacuating Chinese citizens and infrastructure and are being fired on at the port of Aden in Yemen.
[00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:16.947]  That according to the London Guardian NRT.
[00:55:16.947 --> 00:55:20.371]  That's boiled down in a detailed article at Zero Hedge.
[00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:23.054]  We have it posted in full at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:23.054 --> 00:55:23.975]  Yemen.
[00:55:23.975 --> 00:55:27.959]  Fighters seize presidential palace in battle for Aden.
[00:55:27.959 --> 00:55:31.283]  This is the destabilization program spiraling out of control.
[00:55:34.105 --> 00:55:39.290]  Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif gets up there and says, we're coming to this agreement peacefully.
[00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.890]  No they're not.
[00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:52.963]  There's a huge proxy war going on and the Shiites in many areas are beating the Al-Qaeda forces because they're organized military units.
[00:55:52.963 --> 00:55:59.669]  The Al-Qaeda forces are a bunch of rich kids and punks from the West funded by Saudi Arabia to just run around and rape and kill.
[00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:03.715]  And I'm not lionizing the Iranians either.
[00:56:03.715 --> 00:56:09.219]  It's just a fact that they're military units and these other people aren't.
[00:56:09.219 --> 00:56:18.006]  I'll tell you this though, the Iranians are not cutting any Christians' heads off and aren't blowing up churches, and they don't do it in Iran either.
[00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:24.811]  And the Shiite-run, Alawite-minority-run, coalition government of Syria doesn't persecute Christians either.
[00:56:26.175 --> 00:56:37.019]  So remember, our government's backing the folks that chop Christians' heads off, and our media won't report on 147 dead Christians.
[00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:44.042]  You'd think it was a minor story about a Cessna crashing in Kenya, it'd have gotten more attention than this.
[00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:48.864]  There'd been a fire, two kids died, and you'd be hearing more about it.
[00:56:48.864 --> 00:56:55.927]  That's because Christians don't count, veterans don't count, gun owners don't count, because we're not compatible with the new socialist world government.
[00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:02.071]  Christians are being persecuted this Easter.
[00:57:02.071 --> 00:57:03.132]  Remember that.
[00:57:03.132 --> 00:57:12.459]  And ask your church when you go to it where you're going to get some government-delivered sermon about opening the borders up and being loving or turning your guns in.
[00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:17.002]  Disgusting that people put up with this.
[00:57:17.002 --> 00:57:18.343]  The economy's falling apart.
[00:57:18.343 --> 00:57:19.204]  We've already known this.
[00:57:19.204 --> 00:57:21.346]  They've been covering it up, but now the job numbers are in.
[00:57:21.346 --> 00:57:22.587]  We'll talk about that in the next hour.
[00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:41.239]  Before we go any further, briefly, your purchases of the high-quality water filters, books, videos, Patriot apparel, everything from Molon LaVe shirts to belt buckles at InfoWarsStore.com funds our operation, and we're going to have free shipping.
[00:57:41.239 --> 00:57:46.642]  It was going to end today, but I'm going to extend it through Easter.
[00:57:46.642 --> 00:57:49.624]  It will end Monday morning, and put that in the computer, folks.
[00:57:49.624 --> 00:57:51.506]  We're going to put that in our shopping cart.
[00:57:53.061 --> 00:57:56.167]  It will end at midnight Sunday.
[00:57:56.167 --> 00:57:56.968]  That's it.
[00:57:56.968 --> 00:58:00.134]  That is when it cuts off and the specials, a lot of the specials are over.
[00:58:00.134 --> 00:58:01.476]  This is the new special.
[00:58:01.476 --> 00:58:03.300]  It's going for another two and a half days.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.722]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:05.644]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.762]  It's a win, win, win.
[00:58:36.762 --> 00:58:37.643]  Shop with the good guys.
[00:58:37.643 --> 00:58:39.026]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:58:39.026 --> 00:58:40.368]  Back in just 70 seconds.
[00:58:40.368 --> 00:58:42.211]  Second hour, straight up.
[00:58:42.211 --> 00:58:44.614]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.966 --> 00:58:57.170]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:59:06.795 --> 00:59:14.820]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.

[00:59:44.603 --> 00:59:44.964]  Silver Bullet.
[00:59:44.964 --> 00:59:47.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:10.814]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.814 --> 01:00:12.396]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:13.937]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:18.141]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:22.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.918 --> 01:00:28.623]  The author of Robo-Apocalypse is joining us in the next hour.
[01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:35.750]  David Knight's going to come in and host for 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour with analysis on the Kenya situation and a preview of Robo-Apocalypse.
[01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.452]  I'll be back in the third hour.
[01:00:37.452 --> 01:00:39.434]  Apple co-founder on artificial intelligence.
[01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:40.795]  We mentioned this last week.
[01:00:40.795 --> 01:00:43.398]  The future is scary and very bad for people.
[01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:44.979]  That dovetails with this new article.
[01:00:45.914 --> 01:00:50.117]  In the robotic near future, most will live off government-provided income.
[01:00:50.117 --> 01:00:51.619]  That's the plan to domesticate us.
[01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:54.741]  In fact, will you guys print me, Bill Joyce, why the future doesn't need us?
[01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:55.021]  Thank you.
[01:00:55.021 --> 01:00:58.884]  Because we're going to look at the real crises we're facing.
[01:00:58.884 --> 01:01:05.890]  Also, how many people love to migrate out of California when all the water disappears?
[01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:14.697]  There's a video on Infowars.com of folks going into a Muslim bakery and them making cakes for gay folks.
[01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:32.217]  You know, we need to do that and show a Muslim bakery, refuse it, and then watch, there'll be no media coverage, because it's only Christians that have to be attacked and have to be demonized and have to be gone after and act like we're not tolerant, when it was Christians that ended slavery worldwide.
[01:01:32.217 --> 01:01:38.959]  It was Christians that ended up sending gunboats around the world to end slavery.
[01:01:38.959 --> 01:01:41.560]  It was first ended in the West and then ended all over the world.
[01:01:42.978 --> 01:01:44.319]  In fact, let's just give credit.
[01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:48.021]  Spain was the first country to start abolishing slavery.
[01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:50.362]  It's gotta be 600 years ago.
[01:01:50.362 --> 01:01:54.564]  And then it spread from there.
[01:01:54.564 --> 01:01:57.766]  But again, I'm almost cursed by knowing history.
[01:01:57.766 --> 01:01:59.387]  You'd think slavery started in the West.
[01:01:59.387 --> 01:02:00.908]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:00.908 --> 01:02:03.489]  But that's how they get us to all infight with each other.
[01:02:03.489 --> 01:02:07.131]  Also, deadly bird flu shows up in South Dakota.
[01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:08.252]  Fifth Minnesota farm
[01:02:12.073 --> 01:02:18.558]  Potent shatter marijuana showing up in Lancaster County.
[01:02:18.558 --> 01:02:28.566]  The marijuana concentrates six times stronger than the average bud was among drugs seized in March from the home of Samuel Shulbaker.
[01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:30.728]  He's behind bars charged with drug dealing.
[01:02:30.728 --> 01:02:31.469]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:02:31.469 --> 01:02:37.133]  I'm against the drug war, but it doesn't mean I endorse drugs.
[01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:38.194]  The drug war is a fraud.
[01:02:38.194 --> 01:02:39.775]  Asset forfeiture seizure is a fraud.
[01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:41.497]  We have more drugs on the street because of the drug war.
[01:02:42.503 --> 01:02:49.367]  But the way to attack the drug war is to point out that governments and major banks are laundering the money.
[01:02:49.367 --> 01:02:51.648]  And that we have a bigger prison population than ever.
[01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:56.311]  Not by endorsing the drug culture.
[01:02:56.311 --> 01:03:01.734]  I have experimented with marijuana when I was in high school and college and it made me sleepy and I didn't particularly like it.
[01:03:03.339 --> 01:03:07.441]  Willie Nelson will now launch his own brand of weed chain of marijuana stores in the U.S.
[01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:08.702]  That's a good business move.
[01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:18.327]  I have sat right there in his bus, at that table, on screen, if you're a TV viewer, and, well, quite frankly, I mean, when you're in Rome, you've got to do it.
[01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:20.909]  I've smoked pot with Willie.
[01:03:20.909 --> 01:03:26.012]  But again, I do it like a cop goes out and smokes marijuana just to see how strong it is.
[01:03:26.012 --> 01:03:26.532]  I don't like it.
[01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:28.013]  It makes me paranoid.
[01:03:29.496 --> 01:03:31.658]  Well, figure that.
[01:03:31.658 --> 01:03:33.739]  But I want to see what it's like.
[01:03:33.739 --> 01:03:43.945]  And I recently tested some at a pool party that was being vaped, and I took two hits off of it and really felt it.
[01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.586]  So here's my issue.
[01:03:45.586 --> 01:03:49.429]  Folks, it will end up making you live in your mother's basement for most people.
[01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:55.172]  An artist like Willie Nelson, you know, he can operate, probably helped him not have a heart attack by now.
[01:03:55.172 --> 01:03:57.153]  You know, look, he's 81 years old or whatever it is.
[01:03:57.153 --> 01:03:57.894]  How old is Willie now?
[01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:05.756]  The point is, is that it has some benefits, it has some problems.
[01:04:05.756 --> 01:04:06.456]  Like red wine.
[01:04:06.456 --> 01:04:07.416]  He is 81.
[01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.617]  He is 81.
[01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:12.559]  One glass of wine a day is probably good for you.
[01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:16.481]  But ten glasses of wine will give you liver cancer.
[01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:22.785]  So, again, I've been involved in the movement before it was so popular for 20 years to decriminalize drugs.
[01:04:23.962 --> 01:04:28.363]  But that doesn't mean we should then go to the extreme of promoting the culture and saying it's good.
[01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:35.166]  Because overall, marijuana is damaging a lot of people and ruining a lot of lives and turning people into vegetables.
[01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:36.746]  And that's why George Soros pushes it.
[01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:44.429]  And the marijuana today is, I gotta say, probably 10 times stronger on average than what I experimented with.
[01:04:45.618 --> 01:04:50.366]  And I've got an incredible tolerance, folks, and it knocks me in the ground.
[01:04:50.366 --> 01:04:55.916]  So I want to warn young people out there, if you can do it, it's best to never even test drugs.
[01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:57.358]  I know you want to experiment.
[01:04:57.358 --> 01:04:58.260]  I've done it for you.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:58.921]  You don't want to do it.
[01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:05.103]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:05:05.103 --> 01:05:11.205]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:05:11.205 --> 01:05:16.006]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:05:16.006 --> 01:05:19.567]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:21.148]  No needles, no injections.
[01:05:21.528 --> 01:05:26.951]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:28.411]  Alex Jones here.
[01:05:28.411 --> 01:05:39.797]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:05:40.077 --> 01:05:43.900]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:52.228]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:05:52.228 --> 01:05:54.530]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:55.571]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:02.050]  In the near future.
[01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:06.551]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:07.772]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.772 --> 01:06:09.772]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:09.772 --> 01:06:10.653]  Analysis.
[01:06:10.653 --> 01:06:11.373]  InfoWars.
[01:06:11.373 --> 01:06:13.354]  Building independent media operations.
[01:06:13.354 --> 01:06:18.356]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:18.356 --> 01:06:19.396]  Crime Directive.
[01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:20.937]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.937 --> 01:06:23.798]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.798 --> 01:06:27.039]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:29.200]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.861]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:33.702]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:33.702 --> 01:06:35.644]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:35.644 --> 01:06:39.706]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:39.706 --> 01:06:43.268]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:43.268 --> 01:06:46.630]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:47.631]  Imperative.
[01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:49.672]  Destroy RealPlanet TV.
[01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:54.194]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:54.194 --> 01:06:55.715]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:55.715 --> 01:06:56.436]  You can feel it.
[01:06:59.464 --> 01:07:01.425]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:07:01.425 --> 01:07:05.666]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:10.127]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:17.409]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:07:17.409 --> 01:07:24.391]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing
[01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:25.232]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.773 --> 01:07:55.798]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:55.798 --> 01:08:02.785]  DNA Force, from InfoWarsLife.
[01:08:02.785 --> 01:08:09.432]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.432 --> 01:08:12.416]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:34.178]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've talked a lot about doing this on air.
[01:08:34.178 --> 01:08:55.393]  I did it a few years ago, but I just want to air the audio from the Colonial Williamsburg Historical Society, Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death, that Patrick Henry basically wrote in a letter but also gave in speeches at the Virginia Convention on March 20th, 1775, inland and Richmond.
[01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:01.052]  Which is now called St.
[01:09:01.052 --> 01:09:04.074]  John's Church.
[01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:19.707]  Because when you look at the parallels of what Patrick Henry famously said, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you, we've now reached this point of total tyrannical takeover of every basic freedom.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:25.692]  There's an article on Infowars.com, leftist attempt to shut down fundraising for Memories Pizza.
[01:09:26.909 --> 01:09:31.992]  Remember they tried to shut down Chick-fil-A for being closed on Sunday?
[01:09:31.992 --> 01:09:39.636]  They tried to shut down Hobby Lobby for being Christian and not promoting abortion?
[01:09:39.636 --> 01:09:41.137]  This is totalitarianism.
[01:09:41.137 --> 01:09:43.658]  This is not tolerance.
[01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:49.902]  You have a right to not patronize a pizza place that doesn't want to cater to your event.
[01:09:52.088 --> 01:10:05.874]  I think it's stupid to not, as a business, just... I wouldn't ask what color you are, or who you have sex with, when you come in to get a pizza, if I had a pizza place, but at the same time, people have that right to do that.
[01:10:05.874 --> 01:10:10.696]  And they certainly don't have the right to then go and try to shut down fundraising.
[01:10:10.696 --> 01:10:12.457]  You know, Google.
[01:10:12.457 --> 01:10:13.177]  Stores.
[01:10:13.177 --> 01:10:14.438]  Six years ago.
[01:10:14.438 --> 01:10:15.838]  We started a Google shopping cart.
[01:10:15.838 --> 01:10:17.779]  They'd even approached us about it.
[01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:19.600]  They're always soliciting us for different services.
[01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:25.493]  And we put up my films on their shopping cart, and then they said, we're removing your shopping cart.
[01:10:25.493 --> 01:10:27.375]  Obama deception is racist.
[01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.677]  No judge, no jury.
[01:10:29.677 --> 01:10:36.023]  There's not one word of racism, but even if it was racist, shouldn't I be able to sell Mein Kampf?
[01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:44.491]  Even if you don't agree with Hitler, you should want to read the book written by Adolf Hitler, the guy that was one of the most important people of 20th century.
[01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.873]  I mean, I've read a book written by Julius Caesar.
[01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:52.243]  A compendium of his letters to the Senate?
[01:10:52.243 --> 01:10:54.024]  The battle for Gaul?
[01:10:54.024 --> 01:10:56.125]  Does that mean I endorse Julius Caesar?
[01:10:56.125 --> 01:11:08.212]  When I bought Mein Kampf when I was 16 years old, at the bookstore, at the mall, the woman freaked out and began hyperventilating.
[01:11:08.212 --> 01:11:12.695]  It had Hitler on the cover, and it said, Mein Kampf, my struggle.
[01:11:14.683 --> 01:11:23.910]  And she was looking at me very angrily, being politically correct, feeling holy, feeling like a Pharisee, and I said, why do you sell this book then?
[01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:24.550]  She goes, excuse me?
[01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:29.454]  She went, I just want to read what Hitler actually said.
[01:11:29.454 --> 01:11:31.415]  That doesn't mean I endorse Hitler.
[01:11:31.415 --> 01:11:32.076]  She went, oh really?
[01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:35.859]  I just, it's scary.
[01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:39.541]  No, what's scary is your ignorance.
[01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:40.182]  That's what's scary.
[01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:42.764]  That's what's scary.
[01:11:44.349 --> 01:11:45.850]  See, that's political correctness.
[01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:54.673]  Reading what a Iranian mullah said... Because I've read reading it put on government lists for just going to Iranian websites.
[01:11:54.673 --> 01:11:57.394]  Well, the government goes to Iranian websites to see what they're saying.
[01:11:57.394 --> 01:11:58.694]  We need to have an open debate.
[01:11:58.694 --> 01:12:01.715]  This is about chilling debate.
[01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.496]  Last week they announced major universities.
[01:12:03.496 --> 01:12:08.698]  You've got to get pre-authorization in California to even have a speech or hand out literature.
[01:12:08.698 --> 01:12:10.678]  You've got to get your speeches pre-approved.
[01:12:10.678 --> 01:12:12.379]  That is North Korea, folks.
[01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:17.676]  So we're not going into a police state.
[01:12:17.676 --> 01:12:19.559]  We're not going into a mine tyranny.
[01:12:19.559 --> 01:12:22.562]  We're in one.
[01:12:22.562 --> 01:12:28.068]  So let's air Richard Schuman
[01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:32.458]  Interprets the character of Patrick Henry for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.
[01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:37.981]  Listen as he recreates Patrick Henry's powerful words spoken March 23rd, 1775 at St.
[01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:40.902]  John's Horatio Parish Church in Richmond.
[01:12:40.902 --> 01:12:47.646]  Let's play this, then I'll get into the rest of the news we've not gotten to yet on the economy front.
[01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:51.231]  Record number of Americans not working.
[01:12:51.231 --> 01:12:54.977]  Very seriously bad numbers coming in, which we've known are there.
[01:12:54.977 --> 01:12:57.100]  Remember, these are whitewashed numbers as well.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.306]  But here is, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:13:01.218 --> 01:13:04.381]  It is in vain to extenuate the matter.
[01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.402]  Gentlemen may cry, Peace!
[01:13:06.402 --> 01:13:07.703]  Peace!
[01:13:07.703 --> 01:13:08.964]  But there is no peace.
[01:13:08.964 --> 01:13:11.546]  The war is actually begun.
[01:13:11.546 --> 01:13:17.731]  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
[01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:21.634]  Our brethren are already in the field.
[01:13:21.634 --> 01:13:25.217]  Why stand we here idle?
[01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:27.859]  What is it that gentlemen wish?
[01:13:27.859 --> 01:13:29.020]  What would they have?
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:38.925]  Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
[01:13:38.925 --> 01:13:42.227]  Forbid it, almighty God!
[01:13:42.227 --> 01:13:52.392]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!
[01:13:52.392 --> 01:13:53.833]  Now let me, that's the end of it.
[01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:55.334]  Let me read from the beginning.
[01:13:57.133 --> 01:14:05.240]  Mr. President, no man thinks more highly than I do of patriotism, as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have addressed the House.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.602]  But different men often see the same object in different lights.
[01:14:08.602 --> 01:14:22.054]  And therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining, as I do, opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve.
[01:14:22.881 --> 01:14:26.742]  That was because back then if you insulted one, they could legally demand you fight to the death with them.
[01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:29.442]  So you had to be very polite.
[01:14:29.442 --> 01:14:32.083]  This is no time for ceremony.
[01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:36.504]  The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country.
[01:14:36.504 --> 01:14:41.085]  For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery.
[01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:45.186]  And in proportion to the magnitude of the subject, ought to be the freedom of the debate.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.902]  It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth.
[01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.344]  See, they're trying to shut down debate now, folks.
[01:14:52.344 --> 01:14:57.047]  And fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country.
[01:14:57.047 --> 01:15:14.018]  Should I keep back my opinions at this time through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of fact of disloyalty towards the majesty of heaven which I revere above all earthly kings.
[01:15:14.018 --> 01:15:14.739]  Mr. President,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:24.366]  It is natural to man, speaking to the President of the Senate, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.
[01:15:24.366 --> 01:15:34.033]  We are apt to shut our eyes against the painful truth and listen to the song of the siren that till she transforms us into beast, which America has been transformed into.
[01:15:34.033 --> 01:15:35.434]  Servile, dumb beast.
[01:15:35.434 --> 01:15:37.015]  Sheep.
[01:15:37.015 --> 01:15:38.416]  Continuing, it is
[01:15:39.884 --> 01:15:44.527]  This part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty.
[01:15:44.527 --> 01:15:54.553]  Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes not see, having ears hear not, the things which so nearly concern the temporal salvation?
[01:15:54.553 --> 01:16:03.999]  For my part, whoever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:05.720]  Absolutely, this is where my heart stands.
[01:16:06.917 --> 01:16:13.040]  I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.942]  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.
[01:16:17.942 --> 01:16:21.064]  And we're following the past again into the arms of tyranny.
[01:16:21.064 --> 01:16:33.730]  And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes which gentlemen have been pleased to chalice themselves and the House.
[01:16:35.643 --> 01:16:41.248]  Is it the insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?
[01:16:41.248 --> 01:16:46.133]  Trust if not, sir, it will prove a snare to your feet.
[01:16:46.133 --> 01:16:49.416]  Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss.
[01:16:49.416 --> 01:16:58.505]  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with these warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land.
[01:16:58.505 --> 01:17:00.306]  The militarization of police, the NSA,
[01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:25.786]  The military, the license scanners, the citizens being turned into tattletales, the open borders, the lawlessness, the looting of the treasury, the poisoning of the population, the GMO takeovers, the corporations above the law, the IRS persecutions, on and on and on, the evidence of the preparation for war against these states and the individuals herein, I add to the speech.
[01:17:25.786 --> 01:17:27.728]  Are fleets and armies necessary?
[01:17:27.728 --> 01:17:30.310]  A work of love and reconciliation, Henry wrote.
[01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:37.918]  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?
[01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:40.241]  Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.
[01:17:40.241 --> 01:17:42.644]  These are the implements of war and subjugation.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.922]  That's what we see being prepared for us.
[01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:48.344]  That's what the TSA, Slave Training, all of it is.
[01:17:48.344 --> 01:17:51.306]  The last arguments to which Kings resort.
[01:17:51.306 --> 01:17:55.089]  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this Marshall Array?
[01:17:55.089 --> 01:17:58.332]  Is its purpose not to force us into submission?
[01:17:58.332 --> 01:18:02.295]  Can gentlemen assign any other possible move for it?
[01:18:02.295 --> 01:18:07.639]  Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?
[01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:08.300]  No, sir!
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.261]  She has none.
[01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:10.142]  They are meant for us.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.382]  They can be meant for no other.
[01:18:13.382 --> 01:18:15.964]  That's what Jade Helms is about.
[01:18:15.964 --> 01:18:26.331]  They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been for so long forging, and what we have to oppose them.
[01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:28.673]  Shall we try arguments, sir?
[01:18:28.673 --> 01:18:31.295]  We have been trying that for the last ten years.
[01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:34.037]  Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?
[01:18:34.037 --> 01:18:35.038]  Nothing!
[01:18:35.038 --> 01:18:39.581]  Have we held the subject up to the light of which it is capable, but in which
[01:18:40.546 --> 01:18:42.088]  have been all in vain.
[01:18:42.088 --> 01:18:48.155]  Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?
[01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:53.961]  What terms shall we find which have not already been exhausted?
[01:18:55.089 --> 01:18:58.371]  Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves, sir.
[01:18:58.371 --> 01:19:03.215]  We have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.
[01:19:03.215 --> 01:19:15.423]  We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the Ministry of Parliament.
[01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:22.613]  Our petitions have been slighted, our demonstrations have produced additional violence and insult.
[01:19:22.613 --> 01:19:30.056]  Our supplications have been disregarded and we have been spurned with contempt.
[01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:35.118]  From the foot of the throne, in vain, these are things.
[01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:39.180]  We indulge in the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.180]  There is no longer any room for hope.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:41.901]  If we wish to be free,
[01:19:43.248 --> 01:19:57.303]  If we mean to preserve and violate those inestimable privileges for which we have so long contending, if we mean to not basically abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, I'm going to finish up when we come back.
[01:19:57.303 --> 01:19:57.684]  Stay with us.

[01:23:10.356 --> 01:23:12.958]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:15.499]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.662]  MyPatriotSupply is here to help.

[01:23:29.009 --> 01:23:33.232]  Are you willing to rely on the government and FEMA in the event of an emergency?

[01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:48.906]  Call right now!
[01:24:06.687 --> 01:24:11.598]  We are back live, finishing up with the Patrick Henry speech.
[01:24:11.598 --> 01:24:13.401]  There is no longer any room for hope.
[01:24:13.401 --> 01:24:14.764]  If we wish to be free, if we...
[01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:33.144]  ...mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges which we have so long contending, if we mean not basically to abandon the noble struggle in which we have so long engaged, in which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained.
[01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:36.107]  We must fight, I repeat sir, we must fight!
[01:24:36.107 --> 01:24:40.431]  An appeal to arms and an appeal to God of the host is all that is left to us.
[01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:46.577]  They tell us, sir, that we are weak, unable to cope with formidable an adversary.
[01:24:46.577 --> 01:24:48.257]  But when shall we be stronger?
[01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:50.038]  Will it be next week or next year?
[01:24:50.038 --> 01:24:52.500]  Will it be when we are totally disarmed?
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.601]  And when the British Guard shall be stationed in every house?
[01:24:55.601 --> 01:24:59.944]  Shall we gather strength by irresolution in action?
[01:24:59.944 --> 01:25:11.090]  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supine on our backs and hugging the divisive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?
[01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:20.042]  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature has placed in our power.
[01:25:20.042 --> 01:25:24.646]  Three millions of people armed, now listen to this, three millions of people
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:36.939]  Armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as this, as we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
[01:25:36.939 --> 01:25:39.981]  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.
[01:25:39.981 --> 01:25:43.845]  There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations.
[01:25:43.845 --> 01:25:47.128]  And I've seen this in my life over and over again, folks, but you've got to take the step.
[01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:51.014]  And who will rise up friends to fight our battles for us.
[01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:53.659]  The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone.
[01:25:53.659 --> 01:25:56.004]  It is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.
[01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:57.767]  Besides, sir, we have no election.
[01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:05.348]  If we were base enough to deserve it, desire it, it is not too late to retire from the contest.
[01:26:05.348 --> 01:26:08.369]  There is no retreat but the submission and slavery.
[01:26:08.369 --> 01:26:09.709]  Our chains are forged.
[01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:12.150]  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston.
[01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:14.411]  There is war inevitable, and let it come.
[01:26:14.411 --> 01:26:16.251]  I repeat, sir, let it come.
[01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:18.892]  It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
[01:26:18.892 --> 01:26:21.713]  Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace.
[01:26:21.713 --> 01:26:23.193]  The war has actually begun.
[01:26:23.193 --> 01:26:25.374]  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring
[01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.196]  To our ears, the clash of resounding arms.
[01:26:28.196 --> 01:26:29.977]  Our brethren are already in the field.
[01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:32.078]  Why stand we here idle?
[01:26:32.078 --> 01:26:33.740]  What is it the gentlemen wish?
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.281]  What is it that they would have?
[01:26:35.281 --> 01:26:37.242]  Is life so dear and peace so sweet?
[01:26:37.242 --> 01:26:39.704]  Has it been purchased at the price of change and slavery?
[01:26:39.704 --> 01:26:41.305]  Forbid it, Almighty God!
[01:26:41.305 --> 01:26:45.548]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:26:47.856 --> 01:26:51.058]  And today, 90% of war is info war.
[01:26:51.058 --> 01:27:03.227]  We arm, we prepare to defend our families, but we engage in info war, waking up the police, waking up the military, that an alien, globalist force runs the federal government.
[01:27:03.227 --> 01:27:07.210]  They're publicly taking over countries like Italy and installing presidents now.
[01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:08.851]  from Goldman Sachs.
[01:27:08.851 --> 01:27:10.332]  I mean, it's open.
[01:27:10.332 --> 01:27:12.034]  At Davos, they admit they're technocrats.
[01:27:12.034 --> 01:27:15.537]  They have to hide the tyranny in plain view because it's here.
[01:27:15.537 --> 01:27:16.518]  They're doing it.
[01:27:16.518 --> 01:27:20.001]  Secret treaties that take over everything?
[01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:23.965]  A president ruling by Executive Fiat persecuting people?
[01:27:23.965 --> 01:27:25.647]  And Lois Learned that doesn't get in trouble?
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.260]  Admit it!
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.662]  No one's safe while this is going on.
[01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.843]  Prosperity is there because we had liberty.
[01:27:32.843 --> 01:27:35.324]  They've had QE Unlimited for five years.
[01:27:35.324 --> 01:27:36.825]  Unlimited money printing for the elite.
[01:27:36.825 --> 01:27:38.326]  They get the money, we don't.
[01:27:38.326 --> 01:27:40.487]  We get recession, depression, they get unlimited money.
[01:27:41.226 --> 01:27:42.868]  We get increased prices.
[01:27:42.868 --> 01:27:44.649]  Still, what does it do?
[01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:47.032]  March jobs, lame.
[01:27:47.032 --> 01:27:48.133]  Look at DrugsReport.com.
[01:27:48.133 --> 01:27:49.975]  We have the same news at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:49.975 --> 01:27:52.497]  Record, 93 million plus Americans not working.
[01:27:52.497 --> 01:27:55.099]  Record, 12 plus million blacks not in the labor force.
[01:27:55.099 --> 01:27:57.282]  That's double the number under when Obama got in.
[01:27:57.282 --> 01:28:00.044]  Record, 56 million women not working.
[01:28:00.044 --> 01:28:03.307]  January, February jobs numbers revised down drastically.
[01:28:03.307 --> 01:28:05.590]  Fed cuts growth forecast to zero.
[01:28:08.211 --> 01:28:09.957]  And those are with cooked numbers, folks.
[01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:13.509]  The economy is in free fall, except in certain globalist boom areas.
[01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.594]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:28:16.594 --> 01:28:18.435]  Now is the time to redouble your efforts.

[01:29:50.763 --> 01:29:53.305]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:59.761 --> 01:32:00.702]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:32:00.702 --> 01:32:01.262]  Good, brother.
[01:32:01.262 --> 01:32:02.984]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:04.946]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:04.946 --> 01:32:08.970]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:11.592]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:14.014]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:14.014 --> 01:32:21.922]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:22.182 --> 01:32:25.426]  We did it a super male and a super female vitality.
[01:32:25.426 --> 01:32:26.948]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:26.948 --> 01:32:29.991]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:31.653]  They've been a ton of money there.
[01:32:31.653 --> 01:32:37.019]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:32:37.039 --> 01:32:38.040]  We're good to go.
[01:33:06.789 --> 01:33:10.793]  I've got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:16.759]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:19.802]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:22.564]  If you break the law... Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Blankman.
[01:33:23.405 --> 01:33:25.488]  I'm going to be your host for the next half hour.
[01:33:25.488 --> 01:33:28.653]  Alex has got a daughter that's going to be going away to camp this weekend.
[01:33:28.653 --> 01:33:30.616]  He wanted to spend a few minutes with her for lunch.
[01:33:30.616 --> 01:33:32.479]  So I'm going to be doing this next half hour.
[01:33:32.479 --> 01:33:37.146]  And of course, in the next hour, we have the author of Robopocalypse coming on.
[01:33:37.972 --> 01:33:45.336]  If you're not familiar with that novel, I'm going to kind of give you some things that are happening right now that really very clearly tie into this.
[01:33:45.336 --> 01:33:57.482]  Of course, the basic premise of Robo-pocalypse, and it's told with a series of vignettes about the individuals in different places, different things that happened to them, it gradually pulls that together in retrospect.
[01:33:57.482 --> 01:34:06.047]  And it's very interesting because it's a kind of machines rise and take over humanity, attack humanity, but it's done in a different way than the Terminator.
[01:34:07.245 --> 01:34:15.305]  As the machine becomes self-aware and malevolent towards mankind, what it does is it starts activating all these automated systems.
[01:34:16.578 --> 01:34:24.281]  It's kind of a cautionary tale about how passive we become, but it's also a cautionary tale about centralized control, the way I see it.
[01:34:24.281 --> 01:34:34.004]  And of course, in RoboApocalypse, one of the key weapons that this system uses is not a new army of high-tech robots that look like humans or whatever, walk on two legs.
[01:34:34.004 --> 01:34:37.385]  No, it's using things like automobiles, for the most part.
[01:34:37.385 --> 01:34:42.507]  They do have some robots that are servants that have been set there to help people.
[01:34:43.087 --> 01:34:46.488]  But it also uses cars to attack people.
[01:34:46.488 --> 01:34:49.569]  It uses cars to patrol the streets.
[01:34:49.569 --> 01:35:01.133]  As we look at this driverless future that they're trying to present to us, and it is coming on, let me tell you, much, much faster than you probably realize.
[01:35:01.133 --> 01:35:08.836]  This is something that has been building for quite a long time, and we've just had a car that went from San Francisco to New York.
[01:35:10.598 --> 01:35:15.342]  Now this is reported in Wired Magazine as well as ABC News.
[01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:16.603]  Other outlets have this.
[01:35:16.603 --> 01:35:23.149]  Nine days it took it to go from San Francisco to New York City, went through 15 states, 3,400 miles, made history.
[01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:26.132]  It drove 99% of the time on its own.
[01:35:26.132 --> 01:35:28.674]  Now this is a vehicle that was done by Delphi.
[01:35:28.674 --> 01:35:33.959]  This is a company that makes subsystems for a lot of different car manufacturers.
[01:35:33.959 --> 01:35:34.419]  They said the
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.207]  And reporting about it in Wired Magazine, they said, of course, the interesting thing is that this isn't some special technology that just this company has.
[01:35:41.207 --> 01:35:43.709]  They said there's a lot of companies that could do this.
[01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:46.212]  Audi, Mercedes, Google could all make this journey.
[01:35:46.212 --> 01:35:55.702]  As a matter of fact, Tesla is going to have in just a couple of months, I think it's about a month ago, he said in 90 days, they were going to combine the navigation software and their computers with the subsystems.
[01:35:56.263 --> 01:35:59.025]  They control things like cruise control, steering.
[01:35:59.025 --> 01:36:09.053]  They've already had, with Mercedes and other cars, they've had for a long time, they've been building up to these sub-components, making sure that you don't drift across the lane, so they recognize where the lane markers are.
[01:36:09.053 --> 01:36:16.299]  They have forward and rear-facing radar, so they can tell if you're closing in too quickly on a car in front or in back of you.
[01:36:16.299 --> 01:36:18.801]  So these are the beginning steps.
[01:36:18.801 --> 01:36:20.162]  These are individual systems.
[01:36:20.162 --> 01:36:23.584]  They can tie all these together, tie it together with the navigation.
[01:36:23.584 --> 01:36:23.865]  Of course,
[01:36:24.505 --> 01:36:44.043]  We need to understand that it was just in the last week that we saw a couple in Chicago drive off of a bridge because they were following the computer's instructions, not paying attention to the physical warning signs, the multiple, the barriers that had been erected, the signs that said, road closed, bridge out.
[01:36:44.043 --> 01:36:46.346]  No, they passed through all of the real stuff.
[01:36:47.369 --> 01:36:52.432]  And they lived in this virtual reality, the wife died, the husband is in serious condition.
[01:36:52.432 --> 01:37:07.743]  But they point out in this article, and I've pointed this out before on the news, that the very first DARPA Grand Challenge, and of course DARPA is the real dark technology, the secretive technology, the high technology branch of the Defense Department.
[01:37:08.343 --> 01:37:12.548]  The Defense Advanced Research Projects, I think is part of the acronym.
[01:37:12.548 --> 01:37:23.602]  I just think of them as dark technology because the stuff that they are coming up with is absolutely horrendous and is really moving the edge of lethality far beyond what's necessary.
[01:37:24.242 --> 01:37:26.645]  I mean they're not responding to threats, they're creating threats.
[01:37:26.645 --> 01:37:30.811]  And of course that technology is going to be stolen, it's going to be copied, it's going to be imitated by others.
[01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:35.777]  So we're going to have to live with that technology that they're creating, the kind of killer robots that DARPA is doing.
[01:37:35.777 --> 01:37:39.843]  And of course it was last year that they culminated in this robot test.
[01:37:39.843 --> 01:37:40.604]  Now of course they were...
[01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:45.145]  Put it out there as this is going to be a robot that's going to help us in case we have some kind of a Fukushima event.
[01:37:45.145 --> 01:37:46.165]  We can't send workers in.
[01:37:46.165 --> 01:37:47.345]  We can send these robots in.
[01:37:47.345 --> 01:37:56.547]  So they need to be able to walk on two legs, navigate things that are in their path, be able to turn off different aspects, manipulate things with their hands.
[01:37:56.547 --> 01:37:59.847]  So they'd set up some parameters there for that contest.
[01:37:59.847 --> 01:38:07.429]  But of course if you've seen these robots and you understand that DARPA's mission is not about nuclear safety.
[01:38:07.429 --> 01:38:09.409]  It is about military weapons.
[01:38:09.989 --> 01:38:16.072]  When you look at those two things, it's very disconcerting to me as an engineer to see what they're going to.
[01:38:16.072 --> 01:38:28.259]  And of course, all those promising technology companies in that contest, all the promising robotics technology companies that were in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, those were all bought by Google.
[01:38:28.259 --> 01:38:30.180]  If they had any good technology, Google bought them.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.261]  It was like three or four or five companies that they bought.
[01:38:32.261 --> 01:38:36.664]  Of course, they went on a purchasing bench with artificial intelligence as well at Google.
[01:38:37.765 --> 01:38:45.209]  Now they point out, however, though, that the very first DARPA Challenge, think about this, 11 years ago, the very first DARPA Grand Challenge was not a robot.
[01:38:45.209 --> 01:38:47.331]  It wasn't artificial intelligence.
[01:38:47.331 --> 01:38:49.812]  It was an autonomous car.
[01:38:49.812 --> 01:38:59.538]  They say in this Wired article, just 11 years ago, the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge, the most advanced autonomous vehicles of the day attempted to complete a 150 mile course.
[01:38:59.538 --> 01:39:03.560]  The best any of them could do was 7.32 miles.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.682]  And that vehicle got stuck and caught fire.
[01:39:06.582 --> 01:39:13.485]  The next year, five vehicles completed the 132-mile course, but took seven hours to do it.
[01:39:13.485 --> 01:39:16.427]  So they're making very, very rapid progress.
[01:39:16.427 --> 01:39:23.130]  And they're making such rapid progress that it was just last spring, about March or April, Drudge covered the reports of it.
[01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:30.273]  There were massive changes and laws in both the United States and Europe to allow them to put these cars on the road.
[01:39:30.273 --> 01:39:37.576]  They wouldn't have been able to do this drive from San Francisco to New York legally last year, even though they may have had the technology largely in place.
[01:39:37.576 --> 01:39:41.298]  They would have been prohibited from doing that, but they changed those laws.
[01:39:41.298 --> 01:39:45.020]  And let me tell you, this is coming much, much faster than you realize.
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:51.743]  As I pointed out, Google, Wired rather, talks about propelling us towards the day that humans no longer hold the wheel.
[01:39:51.743 --> 01:39:52.443]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:52.443 --> 01:39:53.244]  Who's going to hold the wheel?
[01:39:54.431 --> 01:39:57.633]  Government is going to be holding the wheel.
[01:39:57.633 --> 01:40:01.876]  Government will be using the computers, will be doing the driving, but you know what?
[01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:07.700]  Government is going to use this to tax you, to follow you, to have complete control over you.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.962]  Before we leave this story about the autonomous car,
[01:40:11.448 --> 01:40:17.894]  I'll just point out one of the things that they were talking about in the AP article was the technological issues on it.
[01:40:17.894 --> 01:40:25.121]  They say the person sitting in the car's driver's seat only intervened once when in traffic, and that was when weaving around a construction zone.
[01:40:25.121 --> 01:40:30.706]  Again, when the car didn't want to move into a busy left lane to avoid police that were stopped on the right shoulder.
[01:40:30.706 --> 01:40:32.508]  So it did all of the interstate driving.
[01:40:32.508 --> 01:40:35.630]  They would, when they get off and get onto the streets, they don't have that yet.
[01:40:36.351 --> 01:40:37.652]  So they would have humans driving that.
[01:40:37.652 --> 01:40:42.714]  But on the road, on the highway, the car did 99% of the driving.
[01:40:42.714 --> 01:40:45.816]  Now listen to some of the technological challenges that came up to them.
[01:40:45.816 --> 01:40:49.718]  The variation in line markings across states, across communities.
[01:40:49.718 --> 01:40:52.279]  Some had wide stripes, others had narrow yellow ones.
[01:40:53.039 --> 01:40:58.843]  Some were new, some were faded, some were marked with raised bumps, so they had to be able to navigate all those different things.
[01:40:58.843 --> 01:41:02.725]  They said, of course, they're going to train their cameras to detect all kinds of lane markings.
[01:41:02.725 --> 01:41:10.890]  And they also looked at the fact that the cameras were a little bit blinded in bright sunlight or by rainy weather, but the radar systems provided backup.
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:16.273]  The radar systems, I said, worked well even on metal bridges that could have caused reflection and interference.
[01:41:16.273 --> 01:41:18.254]  And when I look at that, I thought, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[01:41:18.254 --> 01:41:20.676]  I started looking at the technology.
[01:41:20.676 --> 01:41:21.937]  We have to make sure that
[01:41:22.597 --> 01:41:27.438]  You know, I look at this, start looking at it from an engineer's eyes, and I can understand how these guys can get into it.
[01:41:27.438 --> 01:41:44.842]  It's a very fascinating challenge to come up with all of these different conditions, make sure that it's going to work in all the different kinds of lane designation markings, make sure that you've got something to guide off of even when there's some of the paint is missing, or where it's different colors, or different widths, or if you've got metal bridges.
[01:41:44.842 --> 01:41:49.423]  That's a very interesting technological challenge, and I understand that people can get caught up in that.
[01:41:50.163 --> 01:42:03.445]  But we need to understand, especially engineers, especially engineers, who are creating these tools, these pieces of technology that can very well be used for the worst kind of tyranny the world has ever seen.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.741]  That's what we're looking at.
[01:42:05.741 --> 01:42:13.124]  We're building the legal infrastructure and the technological infrastructure for the worst tyranny this world has ever seen.
[01:42:13.124 --> 01:42:20.047]  And you need to stop and move back from these fascinating technological tidbits and look at the bigger picture.
[01:42:20.047 --> 01:42:22.588]  You've got to understand where this is going.
[01:42:22.588 --> 01:42:24.949]  We've heard so many times the future doesn't need us.
[01:42:26.087 --> 01:42:28.568]  The future that they're designing doesn't need us.
[01:42:28.568 --> 01:42:32.890]  But the future that they're designing needs to control us.
[01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:34.851]  It needs to control us or it needs to kill us.
[01:42:34.851 --> 01:42:43.755]  That's the conclusion that the robot, that the central AI came to in Robopocalypse, in the book that Alex is going to be talking to the author about in the next hour.
[01:42:43.755 --> 01:42:49.018]  And that's exactly the conclusion I believe the elites have come to.
[01:42:49.018 --> 01:42:51.699]  Will they be able to control us completely or will they have to kill us?
[01:42:52.918 --> 01:43:01.226]  Now, as I said before, this car traveled from San Francisco to New York, 99% of the driving, most of that on the highway.
[01:43:01.226 --> 01:43:03.989]  We just had to make sure that it wasn't going to hit anybody, hit anything.
[01:43:03.989 --> 01:43:12.217]  One of the things I thought was interesting about this too, of course, they don't really care about your convenience or about the humans, it's all about the cars and the government's agenda.
[01:43:12.217 --> 01:43:15.340]  One of the things they pointed out was along the way it went
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:16.921]  Never went over the speed limit.
[01:43:16.921 --> 01:43:25.669]  As a matter of fact, most of the time they said it went well under the speed limit, to the point that it said, quote, a few hateful gestures were given from the human occupants of other cars.
[01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:32.015]  Yeah, I saw one of these reports talking about Google Car, where it would set at a stop sign for over four minutes.
[01:43:32.015 --> 01:43:38.500]  Finally, the guy behind it made a dangerous move to go around it and shot the guys in the car a bird, because
[01:43:39.471 --> 01:43:42.153]  You can't have these machines that get stuck.
[01:43:42.153 --> 01:43:43.474]  They're timid.
[01:43:43.474 --> 01:43:44.594]  Maybe they're going to be aggressive.
[01:43:44.594 --> 01:43:45.495]  That's one of the things they said.
[01:43:45.495 --> 01:43:48.277]  They have to program some aggressiveness into it.
[01:43:48.277 --> 01:43:51.178]  Well, they're also going to have to program in some ethics.
[01:43:51.178 --> 01:43:54.841]  That was what Warren Buffett talked about earlier in this week.
[01:43:54.841 --> 01:43:56.482]  Alex mentioned that a couple of days ago.
[01:43:56.482 --> 01:43:59.544]  The fact that you're going to have to make a very quick ethical decision.
[01:43:59.544 --> 01:44:00.204]  We all know that.
[01:44:00.204 --> 01:44:02.165]  It's been talked about in the technology magazines.
[01:44:02.165 --> 01:44:05.568]  Warren Buffett mentioned it and everybody paid attention when Warren Buffett said it.
[01:44:06.408 --> 01:44:07.849]  But of course that's an issue.
[01:44:07.849 --> 01:44:13.752]  You're going to have to make a quick decision as to whether or not you're going to hit a pedestrian or whether or not you're going to go into another car.
[01:44:13.752 --> 01:44:17.955]  And of course, they will know who's in the other car because the cars are talking to us.
[01:44:17.955 --> 01:44:26.360]  Do you realize that vehicle-to-vehicle communication, V-to-V communication, is going to be mandated into the cars in just a couple of years?
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.581]  We're not talking about five years.
[01:44:27.581 --> 01:44:29.042]  We're not talking about ten years.
[01:44:29.042 --> 01:44:30.823]  It's going to be mandated in a couple of years.
[01:44:31.843 --> 01:44:33.607]  Now, that'll probably be for new cars.
[01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:39.760]  I haven't read the details of the regulation yet, but they will grandfather that back into all of the cars.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.744]  But right now, the thing that is holding them back...
[01:44:42.922 --> 01:44:48.606]  It's not the legal issues, it's not really the technical issues so much on the highways that they're already done with that.
[01:44:48.606 --> 01:44:54.391]  What is going, what's holding them back is the ability to be able to drive in the city where there's a very challenging situation.
[01:44:54.391 --> 01:45:01.636]  And of course, Bloomberg pointed out yesterday that there's crash testing driverless cars are going to be used in a robot city.
[01:45:01.636 --> 01:45:04.399]  You can find this article up on the Drudge Report as well.
[01:45:04.399 --> 01:45:07.661]  And they're talking about a particular scenario.
[01:45:07.661 --> 01:45:10.843]  Let's say you got a mother pushing a baby carriage across a busy city street.
[01:45:11.787 --> 01:45:13.488]  And all of a sudden, will a car stop in time?
[01:45:13.488 --> 01:45:17.210]  Well, they say, this is going to be done in this city that they're building.
[01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:20.953]  The robot and the baby carriage will be robotic.
[01:45:20.953 --> 01:45:26.276]  There'll be programmed obstacles that will be thrown at these cars to see if they can navigate this.
[01:45:26.276 --> 01:45:31.199]  This is M-City, coming just outside of Detroit at the University of Michigan.
[01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:32.360]  It's soon to be open.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.441]  It's a 23-acre mini metropolis.
[01:45:34.441 --> 01:45:37.423]  It's going to open this summer, on July 20th.
[01:45:37.423 --> 01:45:38.564]  And they talk about the fact that
[01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:48.796]  This is where they are going to test navigating under all the different things that can happen in a city environment.
[01:45:48.796 --> 01:45:56.121]  Again, talking about Google's self-driving car, I don't know if you've seen this thing, but it's got like, instead of headlights, because it doesn't need headlights, it doesn't have a steering wheel.
[01:45:56.121 --> 01:45:57.482]  It doesn't have a brake.
[01:45:57.482 --> 01:45:58.963]  So it doesn't need headlights.
[01:45:58.963 --> 01:46:00.144]  You're just an occupant.
[01:46:00.144 --> 01:46:02.285]  You're just along for the ride.
[01:46:02.285 --> 01:46:06.028]  And so they paint this clown face on it nevertheless.
[01:46:06.028 --> 01:46:08.829]  The headlights are really kind of painted on eyes.
[01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:18.154]  And as I mentioned before, I would not only be afraid, there's a picture of it if you're watching this, I would not only be afraid to ride in that thing, I would be absolutely embarrassed.
[01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:27.878]  It's kind of like the automotive equivalent of the cone of shame, you know, when you put that on, that vet cone on the dog, you know, they're both apprehensive and they look very embarrassed.
[01:46:27.878 --> 01:46:30.800]  That's the way I would feel on one of these things because, you know, the future for me
[01:46:31.994 --> 01:46:34.096]  Would be absolute living hell.
[01:46:34.096 --> 01:46:42.863]  If I've got to go around as they describe this, Google's self-driving Priuses equipped with laser radar saucers on their roofs.
[01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:43.924]  Come on.
[01:46:43.924 --> 01:46:46.746]  I mean, one of the few real things I ever get to do anymore.
[01:46:46.746 --> 01:46:49.989]  I work so much on computers, sitting at a desk all the time.
[01:46:49.989 --> 01:47:00.557]  One of the few real things I get to do is to get out in the 3D world, not looking at a television screen, but the steering wheel in one hand, the stick shift in the other, both of my feet on the pedals, and go.
[01:47:00.557 --> 01:47:01.118]  I love that.
[01:47:01.778 --> 01:47:02.839]  That's real.
[01:47:02.839 --> 01:47:04.500]  That's being in the real world.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.742]  I don't want that taken away from me.
[01:47:05.742 --> 01:47:11.987]  But even more than that, I don't want to lose control of my ability to travel.
[01:47:11.987 --> 01:47:18.253]  And that goes back to why DARPA had their very first challenges were robotics challenges.
[01:47:18.253 --> 01:47:26.340]  Because from the very beginning, our government understands that in order to control us, they need the control point of transportation.
[01:47:27.267 --> 01:47:30.550]  It isn't just enough to watch everything that we're doing in the virtual world.
[01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:37.996]  They want to control where and when and know where we're going in the real world.
[01:47:37.996 --> 01:47:45.562]  We also need to look at this and ask who... Now this is a question that Warren Buffett was talking about because he owns a lot of insurance companies.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.182]  I may be out of the insurance business.
[01:47:49.182 --> 01:47:51.103]  Well, you know, maybe you will, maybe you won't.
[01:47:51.103 --> 01:48:07.575]  We started kicking that around and back and Joe Biggs and I were talking about the vaccine court where you don't get to sue the vaccine companies because there were so many people that were injured with vaccines that they took the public's right to sue to get compensation from these companies.
[01:48:07.575 --> 01:48:13.759]  They took that away and handed it over to this kangaroo court called the vaccine court that allocates judgments.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:23.519]  That is essentially what you're going to wind up having to do with these autonomous cars, because let me tell you, even though they want to say they're going to be perfectly safe, they're still going to have errors.
[01:48:23.519 --> 01:48:24.862]  They're still programmed by people.
[01:48:25.816 --> 01:48:28.097]  They're not going to be perfect.
[01:48:28.097 --> 01:48:32.739]  As a matter of fact, a lot of people may remember all of these different car manufacturers.
[01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:38.681]  You've had Audi and many other car manufacturers have issues with runaway cars, runaway acceleration.
[01:48:38.681 --> 01:48:39.441]  Remember that?
[01:48:39.441 --> 01:48:40.802]  Remember those lawsuits?
[01:48:40.802 --> 01:48:41.742]  They were kept pretty quiet.
[01:48:41.742 --> 01:48:49.665]  There were actually a lot of car manufacturers that were involved in that, and that's just one of the subsystems of an autonomous driving car.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.903]  There were a lot of lawsuits about that, but of course, that was kind of swept under the rug.
[01:48:53.903 --> 01:48:55.204]  You didn't hear too much about it.
[01:48:55.204 --> 01:48:58.707]  You're not hearing too much about this in the United States, although the BBC reported on this.
[01:48:58.707 --> 01:49:01.490]  Chrysler's just been ordered to pay $149 million for one death in a Jeep crash.
[01:49:06.534 --> 01:49:07.916]  Now, this is a U.S.
[01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:16.005]  jury has awarded $150 million to the family of a 4-year-old boy that died in a crash involving a Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2012.
[01:49:16.005 --> 01:49:19.930]  He died after the Jeep was struck from behind by a truck.
[01:49:19.930 --> 01:49:22.894]  It ruptured the rear fuel tank, caused it to ignite.
[01:49:23.514 --> 01:49:32.656]  In 2013, Chrysler recalled 1.5 million Jeep SUVs built between 1993 and 1998 with similar rear fuel tanks.
[01:49:32.656 --> 01:49:43.399]  And of course, those of you who are older will remember the Ford Pinto was notorious for having an exploding gas tank when hit from the rear.
[01:49:43.399 --> 01:49:51.041]  So when something like that happens, or when you've got the navigation system drives somebody off of a bridge or into a river and kills them,
[01:49:52.153 --> 01:49:59.496]  You're not going to be able to withstand, if you're the automotive companies, you're not going to be able to withstand multiple judgments of this size.
[01:49:59.496 --> 01:50:02.197]  So they're going to have to come up with something like the vaccine court.
[01:50:02.197 --> 01:50:04.418]  And let me tell you something, they absolutely will.
[01:50:04.418 --> 01:50:08.760]  Because the government wants this so badly.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.221]  They're always looking for a way to control us.
[01:50:11.221 --> 01:50:14.783]  And one of the key ways that they have to control us is to control our movement.
[01:50:16.135 --> 01:50:17.755]  That's what the TSA is about.
[01:50:17.755 --> 01:50:23.137]  The TSA is about getting us accustomed to living in a police state, in a Nazi state.
[01:50:23.137 --> 01:50:24.557]  You know, give me your identity papers.
[01:50:24.557 --> 01:50:25.358]  You know, stand over here.
[01:50:25.358 --> 01:50:31.959]  Even the Nazis didn't go into the pants of little children as far as I can tell looking at history.
[01:50:31.959 --> 01:50:33.140]  But of course the TSA does.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:41.982]  And that's what this is about, but it's also about establishing control points and making sure we don't move that easily.
[01:50:41.982 --> 01:50:49.684]  And again, we just learned that, remember it was a conspiracy theory that the DHS wanted to get everybody's license plates and set up a tracking system?
[01:50:49.684 --> 01:50:52.284]  We published that, they dropped it, now they're back.
[01:50:52.284 --> 01:50:54.305]  Washington Post reports, Drudge has linked up.
[01:50:54.305 --> 01:50:55.445]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:02.748 --> 01:51:04.529]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:04.529 --> 01:51:07.791]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:32.847 --> 01:51:33.848]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:33.848 --> 01:51:37.290]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.952]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:38.952 --> 01:51:40.913]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:40.913 --> 01:51:46.757]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:46.757 --> 01:51:47.577]  I know, right?
[01:51:47.577 --> 01:51:48.898]  You love it too!
[01:51:48.898 --> 01:51:50.339]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:50.339 --> 01:51:51.360]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.101]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.

[01:52:01.767 --> 01:52:04.609]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:09.731]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:52:09.731 --> 01:52:17.856]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:17.856 --> 01:52:22.378]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:52:22.378 --> 01:52:26.180]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:32.282]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:52:32.282 --> 01:52:35.443]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:52:35.443 --> 01:52:40.805]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:52:40.805 --> 01:52:48.989]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:52:48.989 --> 01:52:49.169]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:52:55.533 --> 01:52:58.156]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:52:58.156 --> 01:52:59.618]  BuyPatriotsupply.com
[01:53:01.833 --> 01:53:08.578]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:53:08.578 --> 01:53:12.982]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:53:12.982 --> 01:53:16.464]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:53:16.464 --> 01:53:17.605]  Not fun!
[01:53:17.605 --> 01:53:26.011]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:53:26.011 --> 01:53:30.775]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:32.256]  My name is Errol.
[01:53:32.256 --> 01:53:33.797]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:53:33.797 --> 01:53:36.379]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:53:36.379 --> 01:53:44.224]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:53:44.224 --> 01:53:50.529]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:53:50.529 --> 01:53:50.829]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:50.829 --> 01:53:51.209]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:51.209 --> 01:53:52.290]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:54:18.246 --> 01:54:18.767]  Welcome back.
[01:54:18.767 --> 01:54:20.169]  I'm David Knight on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.169 --> 01:54:23.394]  Alex is going to be back in the beginning of the next hour.
[01:54:23.394 --> 01:54:27.319]  And in the next hour, he's going to be talking to the author of Robo-Apocalypse.
[01:54:27.319 --> 01:54:31.625]  This is a story that's been eagerly awaited in movie form.
[01:54:31.625 --> 01:54:34.430]  The rights were sold to Steven Spielberg quite some time ago.
[01:54:35.230 --> 01:54:49.138]  A couple of times he's had it cast, and so I guess that's one of the things Alex will talk to him about, is to try to get some ideas, see if he's got any ideas to when this movie will be made, because it should be a very fascinating movie.
[01:54:49.138 --> 01:54:50.959]  I've read most of the book, not all of it.
[01:54:50.959 --> 01:54:59.124]  We were listening to it as an audio book with my family, and people started going separate ways, and so we were waiting for different people, so we didn't quite finish the end of it.
[01:54:59.124 --> 01:55:00.265]  But it's a fascinating book.
[01:55:01.145 --> 01:55:05.748]  I think, because it raises the issues that we're looking at on a daily basis now.
[01:55:05.748 --> 01:55:17.354]  It's no longer distant ideas that we're going to have all these subsystems that are automated and could become malevolent if connected together.
[01:55:17.354 --> 01:55:26.699]  Now, of course, in the book, the malevolent central control is from a piece of AI, from a computer that becomes self-aware and starts going after humans.
[01:55:28.237 --> 01:55:35.780]  What you need to understand is that we don't need to wait for the artificial intelligence to become self-aware, okay?
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:42.723]  We already have politicians and global elitists who are AI themselves, artificial integrity.
[01:55:42.723 --> 01:55:48.445]  They're telling us they take an oath to the Constitution, they say one thing in public, but they have an agenda.
[01:55:49.105 --> 01:55:51.525]  To basically control us, to take us down.
[01:55:51.525 --> 01:55:54.546]  As I said before, the future, they say, doesn't need us.
[01:55:54.546 --> 01:55:55.926]  They say this over and over again.
[01:55:55.926 --> 01:56:01.967]  But, in their future, they not only don't need us, but they must control us or eliminate us.
[01:56:01.967 --> 01:56:07.068]  That's the decision that the computer weighs and robopocalypse and decides to eliminate the people.
[01:56:07.068 --> 01:56:11.329]  And of course, there are many signs that that's what the elite choose to do.
[01:56:11.329 --> 01:56:15.190]  When you turn over all this information, when you give control of your movements,
[01:56:16.124 --> 01:56:21.986]  to the government, when they're allowed to track your movements, when they're allowed to deny you being able to move places.
[01:56:21.986 --> 01:56:25.547]  And don't, for a minute, think that they won't do this.
[01:56:25.547 --> 01:56:28.248]  They can instantly do an audit and see if you owe them any money.
[01:56:28.248 --> 01:56:32.450]  You're not going to go anywhere if you can't pay off all of your tax bills or if you're behind in your student loan.
[01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:39.772]  We've already seen jurisdictions threatening to take the licenses of professionals who haven't paid their student loan.
[01:56:39.772 --> 01:56:45.114]  You're not going to even be able to work if you don't pay your student loan off, if you get behind on your student loan.
[01:56:46.013 --> 01:56:49.838]  Well, they're going to use that for people who aren't professionals, who don't have licenses.
[01:56:49.838 --> 01:56:57.187]  If you're just flipping burgers and you owe the government some loan money or you owe them taxes, they're going to lock you down.
[01:56:57.187 --> 01:57:02.994]  It's going to be a high-tech debtor's prison without walls, essentially.
[01:57:04.485 --> 01:57:05.726]  And we can see that this is going to happen.
[01:57:05.726 --> 01:57:08.810]  We've got this story that's on Washington Post, it's on Drudge.
[01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:15.157]  A year after the firestorm, DHS wants access to license plate tracking systems.
[01:57:15.157 --> 01:57:23.987]  They say the Department of Homeland Security is seeking bids from companies that are able to provide law enforcement officials with access to a national license plate tracking system.
[01:57:24.708 --> 01:57:28.932]  A year after cancelling a similar solicitation over privacy issues.
[01:57:28.932 --> 01:57:29.253]  Remember?
[01:57:29.253 --> 01:57:30.754]  They said, oh, no, no, no.
[01:57:30.754 --> 01:57:32.496]  You just completely misunderstood.
[01:57:32.496 --> 01:57:34.858]  We have no interest in following you.
[01:57:34.858 --> 01:57:36.099]  You know, just like James Clapper.
[01:57:36.099 --> 01:57:39.462]  Remember when Ron Wyden said, are you doing dragnet surveillance?
[01:57:39.462 --> 01:57:40.403]  I'm paraphrasing it here.
[01:57:40.403 --> 01:57:43.887]  You know, Clapper says, oh, well, you know, he looked down, he rubbed his forehead.
[01:57:43.887 --> 01:57:45.648]  He could not look Ron Wyden in the eye.
[01:57:45.648 --> 01:57:46.810]  He couldn't look the staffers in the eye.
[01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:47.811]  They all knew that he was.
[01:57:48.612 --> 01:57:51.634]  It was classified information, so they couldn't say so.
[01:57:51.634 --> 01:57:56.298]  That's why he asked Clapper the question, so that he could put that out there.
[01:57:56.298 --> 01:58:00.402]  And of course, Clapper chose, again, not to tell us the truth.
[01:58:00.402 --> 01:58:02.803]  Artificial integrity.
[01:58:02.803 --> 01:58:14.933]  They say, if this goes forward, DHS will have warrantless access to location information going back at least five years about virtually every adult driver in the U.S., sometimes to their image as well.
[01:58:14.933 --> 01:58:15.334]  Now, look.
[01:58:15.974 --> 01:58:31.598]  License plate readers and accessing this database, that is very, very clunky technology compared to real-time monitoring, real-time tracking, being able to shut your car down because your car is computer-controlled and linked to the government.
[01:58:31.598 --> 01:58:33.539]  That is where we're headed.
[01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:34.759]  That's what we should be afraid of.
[01:58:34.759 --> 01:58:40.600]  Stay with us, we'll be right back and we'll be talking to the author of Robopocalypse with Alex Jones in the next hour.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:42.561]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:07.292]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.292 --> 02:00:09.054]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.054 --> 02:00:10.836]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:12.418]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.418 --> 02:00:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.146 --> 02:00:22.211]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.377 --> 02:00:28.299]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.299 --> 02:00:34.406]  Alex is going to be coming back to the show and interviewing the author of Robo-Apocalypse beginning in the next segment.
[02:00:34.406 --> 02:00:38.190]  There's just a couple more news article items that I want to go over first.
[02:00:38.190 --> 02:00:41.434]  Of course, there's the push in many, many states.
[02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:41.814]  I think it's
[02:00:43.355 --> 02:00:46.156]  I want to say 29, but I'm not sure of the exact count.
[02:00:46.156 --> 02:00:57.561]  But all across this country, we have movements in state legislatures that are pushing to take away our informed consent for vaccines because of measles, okay?
[02:00:57.561 --> 02:00:59.481]  This is a childhood disease that I had.
[02:00:59.481 --> 02:01:08.485]  As we've mentioned many times, parents would send their kids down to get measles because it was a very, very low mortality rate for measles.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:17.190]  Nevertheless, because of that, they're using that to push for mandatory vaccines, to take away our informed consent.
[02:01:19.710 --> 02:01:23.192]  This is, we've had several bills that have been pushed back on.
[02:01:23.192 --> 02:01:27.454]  North Carolina, they just had the sponsors take it down, and listen to what they said.
[02:01:27.454 --> 02:01:35.178]  I expected to get pushback, and I expected this bill to change, but unfortunately the pushback was so great that I lost control of it.
[02:01:35.178 --> 02:01:38.119]  This is someone who is trying to take away our informed consent.
[02:01:38.119 --> 02:01:48.225]  This is someone who is trying to force us to have things injected into our body regardless of whether we agreed with that, regardless of whether they had our consent.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:54.846]  That is a fundamental hallmark of tyranny if you take away people's informed consent for medical treatment.
[02:01:55.703 --> 02:01:58.165]  And of course, it was also taken off in Washington.
[02:01:58.165 --> 02:02:07.631]  And the Washington bill, the person who put this forward, who was a sponsor there, was a pro-choice, as many of these people call themselves, many of these Democrats who are sponsoring these bills.
[02:02:07.631 --> 02:02:12.794]  But of course, in North Carolina, it was joined by a couple of sponsors who are Republicans as well.
[02:02:12.794 --> 02:02:15.716]  But the people, for the most part, are calling themselves pro-choice.
[02:02:15.716 --> 02:02:20.920]  But they don't want you to have a choice about the medicine that you put into your child, or the medicine that you put into yourself.
[02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.561]  They're going to force that on you.
[02:02:23.561 --> 02:02:26.374]  The only choice you get is whether or not you're going to kill your child.
[02:02:28.092 --> 02:02:29.013]  How are you going to treat your child?
[02:02:29.013 --> 02:02:30.514]  How are you going to educate your child?
[02:02:30.514 --> 02:02:33.656]  None of that you get a choice in, if they had their way.
[02:02:33.656 --> 02:02:35.218]  But of course, people are pushing back on this.
[02:02:35.218 --> 02:02:42.703]  Now, it was interesting, too, in the Washington case, the senator was also a doctor who was pushing this bill.
[02:02:42.703 --> 02:02:45.265]  And she had exercised her informed choice.
[02:02:45.265 --> 02:02:47.147]  She is an MS patient.
[02:02:47.147 --> 02:02:48.528]  She was on interferon.
[02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:49.329]  She had a child.
[02:02:49.329 --> 02:02:50.590]  She wanted to breastfeed.
[02:02:50.590 --> 02:02:56.174]  And of course, the doctor and the pharmaceutical company both told her, you need to get off of that drug if you're going to be breastfeeding.
[02:02:57.139 --> 02:03:03.225]  She did research, she talked to people, she decided that it wasn't a threat, that it would be safe to do it.
[02:03:03.225 --> 02:03:10.132]  So she went against the advice of her doctor, she went against the advice of the pharmaceutical company, and she continued to take her medication.
[02:03:10.132 --> 02:03:14.736]  She exercised her informed consent, but she wants to deny that to others.
[02:03:14.736 --> 02:03:17.118]  She also had to pull back on this particular bill.
[02:03:17.859 --> 02:03:19.840]  And listen to what this lady in North Carolina said.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:29.986]  She said, parents, however, should talk to a medical professional about this because we do have a high opt-out rate in Buncombe County, and that does create cracks in the shield of protection that we have.
[02:03:29.986 --> 02:03:36.890]  In other words, that's this herd mentality that they've got, this herd immunity that they try to say is necessary.
[02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:39.771]  And we've debunked that whole idea of herd immunity many times.
[02:03:39.771 --> 02:03:43.954]  Quite simply, if you don't have it for individuals, you don't have it collectively either.
[02:03:44.794 --> 02:03:47.276]  And it's a safety as well as an efficacy issue.
[02:03:47.276 --> 02:03:52.040]  But she said, however, trying to mandate vaccines was a step too far.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.121]  Yeah.
[02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:55.183]  A step way too far.
[02:03:55.183 --> 02:03:57.945]  And there's some people there that are watching this closely who believe in it.
[02:03:57.945 --> 02:04:02.569]  If you're in North Carolina, or if you're in these other places, don't think for a minute that they're not going to come back.
[02:04:02.569 --> 02:04:09.936]  You may have defeated them right now, but the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, just as Patrick Henry said, as Alex was reading in the last hour.
[02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:25.733]  Some of the people in North Carolina said, well, we've talked to one of the sponsors, Senator Tartt, a Republican, and he has an open health care bill that can be amended with new language, and withdrawing his support of SB 346 is not the same as withdrawing the bill and its contents.
[02:04:25.733 --> 02:04:33.575]  When asked if he would pull the bill before its reading, he says, I have a recorded quote of him saying, that's not going to happen.
[02:04:33.575 --> 02:04:35.135]  The bill's not going to go away.
[02:04:36.266 --> 02:04:41.552]  I was just talking to Cliven Bundy last night on the Nightly News doing an interview.
[02:04:41.552 --> 02:04:45.976]  And as we were talking about, we saw the people stand up as a community to tyranny.
[02:04:45.976 --> 02:04:50.721]  And as Cliven Bundy points out, every time people do that, the government backs down.
[02:04:50.721 --> 02:04:51.982]  They did it with the vaccines.
[02:04:51.982 --> 02:04:53.344]  They will do it if you stand up.
[02:04:53.344 --> 02:04:55.226]  That's why the information war is so important.
[02:04:55.226 --> 02:04:55.726]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.726 --> 02:04:58.349]  Alex Jones will be right back talking to the author of Robo-pocalypse.
[02:04:59.961 --> 02:05:05.127]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:05:05.127 --> 02:05:11.234]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:05:11.234 --> 02:05:16.019]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:05:16.019 --> 02:05:19.603]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:05:19.603 --> 02:05:21.185]  No needles, no injections.
[02:05:21.545 --> 02:05:26.950]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:28.431]  Alex Jones here.
[02:05:28.431 --> 02:05:40.060]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:43.483]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:05:43.863 --> 02:05:52.189]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:54.491]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:54.491 --> 02:05:55.571]  That's Infowarslife.com
[02:05:59.514 --> 02:06:00.835]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:00.835 --> 02:06:07.962]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:07.962 --> 02:06:14.228]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:14.228 --> 02:06:17.832]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:17.952 --> 02:06:22.175]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:22.175 --> 02:06:27.479]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:28.500]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.322]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:32.322 --> 02:06:34.844]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:06:59.659 --> 02:07:00.920]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.902]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:05.902 --> 02:07:08.584]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:08.584 --> 02:07:15.627]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:18.609]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:18.609 --> 02:07:21.650]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:21.650 --> 02:07:23.591]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:23.591 --> 02:07:26.393]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:26.493 --> 02:07:32.239]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:32.239 --> 02:07:35.743]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:35.743 --> 02:07:38.847]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:38.847 --> 02:07:45.935]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:07:46.155 --> 02:07:49.356]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:07:49.356 --> 02:07:56.299]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:56.299 --> 02:07:58.460]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:08:15.698 --> 02:08:21.579]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:21.579 --> 02:08:34.522]  We live in a time of unparalleled change, of evolution, of accelerated developments that will alter the future course of humanity forever.
[02:08:34.522 --> 02:08:38.303]  Genetic engineering, robotics, accelerated computing,
[02:08:39.577 --> 02:08:54.313]  IBM, the same company that ran the machines in the death camps with the ID numbers on the Jews and others deciding how long to work them, how long to let them live, they now run the computers at the VA deciding who to put on the do not treat list.
[02:08:54.313 --> 02:08:58.597]  For me, we're already in a robo-crisis.
[02:08:58.597 --> 02:09:00.960]  We're already in the middle.
[02:09:03.442 --> 02:09:11.427]  of incredible change, and the architecture of this system is being built to where humans will be obsolete.
[02:09:11.427 --> 02:09:13.548]  And I didn't get that from my own perspectives.
[02:09:13.548 --> 02:09:14.389]  Look at these headlines.
[02:09:14.389 --> 02:09:22.854]  Washington Post, just a few days ago, Apple co-founder on artificial intelligence, the future is scary and very bad for people.
[02:09:22.854 --> 02:09:27.217]  Here's another headline, European killer robots pose danger to international stability.
[02:09:28.962 --> 02:09:30.564]  Autonomous drones.
[02:09:30.564 --> 02:09:31.504]  Skynet.
[02:09:31.504 --> 02:09:38.551]  In the robotic near future, most will, quote, live off government-provided income because robots will make humans obsolete.
[02:09:38.551 --> 02:09:44.797]  And that's, of course, what was written 15 years ago by Bill Joy in Wired Magazine, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[02:09:49.585 --> 02:09:53.488]  We have the author of Robopocalypse joining us via video Skype.
[02:09:53.488 --> 02:09:55.610]  That's being made by Steven Spielberg right now.
[02:09:55.610 --> 02:10:01.435]  His newest project is sci-fi survival script for Lionsgate, produced by Brad Pitt.
[02:10:01.435 --> 02:10:05.818]  He also, of course, has another popular app, Deep Space, a speech recognition gaming app.
[02:10:06.638 --> 02:10:15.321]  I've got a lot of questions I want to go over with him, but humans tend to understand that we're losing our humanity watching 10 hours of TV a day.
[02:10:15.321 --> 02:10:19.103]  It's linked to degeneration of our brains, early onset of Alzheimer's.
[02:10:19.103 --> 02:10:23.124]  We know that people can't do basic calculations now because of calculators.
[02:10:23.124 --> 02:10:27.626]  So much of this that has empowered us has also dehumanized us.
[02:10:27.626 --> 02:10:31.348]  You read Ray Kurzweil and others writings, they just say humans as we know it are obsolete.
[02:10:31.348 --> 02:10:33.328]  So it seems like that decision has already been made.
[02:10:35.249 --> 02:10:45.257]  Are these views that he puts in his books something that he's actually worried about, or is it just art for our guest, author Daniel H. Wilson?
[02:10:45.257 --> 02:10:46.938]  Thanks for coming on, Mr. Wilson.
[02:10:46.938 --> 02:10:48.299]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[02:10:48.299 --> 02:10:50.161]  There's so much to talk about.
[02:10:50.161 --> 02:10:54.884]  You're a pretty young guy, but you've written some best-selling books and are really good reads.
[02:10:54.884 --> 02:10:56.446]  What is your worldview on all this?
[02:10:56.446 --> 02:10:59.168]  Where does art intersect with life?
[02:11:00.162 --> 02:11:05.570]  Well, I think, first of all, it's worth mentioning that I started out as a scientist.
[02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:12.982]  When I was in my 20s, I earned a PhD in robotics and artificial intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University at the Robotics Institute.
[02:11:14.793 --> 02:11:23.261]  Now, it's been 10 years, I'm just a science fiction author, but I really come from what I'm writing about from kind of an informed perspective.
[02:11:23.261 --> 02:11:24.482]  A place of knowledge.
[02:11:24.482 --> 02:11:32.388]  Yeah, and so, you know, with Robo-pocalypse, I have to say first of all, I'm not worried about that actually occurring, but I did set out to depict
[02:11:33.329 --> 02:11:40.054]  What I consider to be the most likely possible robot uprising scenario that could occur.
[02:11:40.054 --> 02:11:42.935]  So, it's not robots that come from the future.
[02:11:42.935 --> 02:11:44.096]  There's no time travel.
[02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:47.138]  There's no, you know, aliens from outer space.
[02:11:47.138 --> 02:11:51.721]  It's about mass malfunctioning of autonomous vehicles.
[02:11:51.721 --> 02:12:02.248]  It's about, you know, an AI using our data against us, using our cell phones against us, the personal assistants that are on smartphones now.
[02:12:02.688 --> 02:12:12.608]  So stuff like that I was projecting out into the near future, but as it actually stands, I'm pretty much an optimist when it comes to all this technology and its impact on humankind.
[02:12:14.005 --> 02:12:18.610]  I personally am not worried about AI autonomous machines taking over.
[02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:22.675]  But if you look at the big corporations and governments, they're weaponizing them day one.
[02:12:22.675 --> 02:12:28.862]  And already through the smart technologies are social engineering, controlling, predicting mass movements.
[02:12:28.862 --> 02:12:32.586]  And so as a novice futurist myself has been talking about this for 20 years.
[02:12:33.467 --> 02:12:39.295]  We see the architecture of the NSA and the rest of it really creating a monopoly of information.
[02:12:39.295 --> 02:12:44.902]  That's my concern, is what humans will do with this digital web of the things of the Internet.
[02:12:45.748 --> 02:12:48.830]  Yeah, you know, I think, I think humans don't change.
[02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:53.454]  You know, human beings are, we have some fundamental things that are always going to be the same.
[02:12:53.454 --> 02:12:56.756]  We love our families, we eat, we sleep.
[02:12:56.756 --> 02:13:00.920]  But now we live more and more of our lives through our technology, right?
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:05.043]  So we're using our technology to kind of do the same stuff that we would always do.
[02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:07.505]  We're using it to communicate with other people.
[02:13:07.505 --> 02:13:08.505]  We're using it to
[02:13:09.346 --> 02:13:14.728]  You know, to transportation, we have these autonomous vehicles to get us from one place to another.
[02:13:14.728 --> 02:13:21.951]  Communication, utilities, all the stuff that we used to do slower and in person, you know, now we do it faster.
[02:13:21.951 --> 02:13:23.232]  We do it through technology.
[02:13:23.232 --> 02:13:30.434]  And I think that that creates a lot of potential, but it also creates, you know, a lot of potential for for misuse.
[02:13:30.434 --> 02:13:31.035]  Absolutely.
[02:13:31.035 --> 02:13:36.337]  I mean, because so much of our data is out there, so much of our daily lives, you know,
[02:13:37.017 --> 02:13:41.499]  There used to be sort of an equality and anonymity, right?
[02:13:41.499 --> 02:13:48.403]  You know, when I was a kid, if I left the house, I just was, I left the house, you know, I was, I was out there just anonymous like anybody.
[02:13:48.403 --> 02:13:51.265]  And these days, you know, well, those days are over, right?
[02:13:51.265 --> 02:14:02.171]  And, you know, now every, every move is tracked and for better or worse, we're constantly, each of us, just hemorrhaging a stream of data out into the universe.
[02:14:02.171 --> 02:14:05.913]  And other people are certainly going to use that data for, for various purposes.
[02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:20.725]  Well I hope humans just don't become some vestigial barnacle growing on the technological terror, to quote Darth Vader, that we're constructing because my grandfathers, especially my dad's dad, knew how to fix combines, fix trucks.
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:23.266]  They were designed so a human could fix them.
[02:14:23.266 --> 02:14:26.427]  Now it takes computers, it takes technicians.
[02:14:26.427 --> 02:14:33.529]  I mean we're having basically the world taken away from us and we're building a world where we're obsolete and that's what most of the
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:39.383]  Billionaire tech company owners have been saying for more than 15 years.
[02:14:39.383 --> 02:14:44.046]  Are you familiar with some of the warnings of Wozniak and Bill Joy and folks?
[02:14:44.046 --> 02:14:47.167]  And yeah, Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, I sure am.
[02:14:47.167 --> 02:14:50.249]  But I have to say, so I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:14:50.249 --> 02:14:53.911]  My dad ran a body shop that he inherited from my grandfather.
[02:14:53.911 --> 02:15:00.535]  So I grew up in a body shop where people were fixing cars, yanking them apart, you know, painting them.
[02:15:00.535 --> 02:15:01.816]  And I have to say that
[02:15:02.196 --> 02:15:07.662]  Over the years, I've also watched that process change where now you have to be a computer technician.
[02:15:07.662 --> 02:15:11.566]  You have to basically use different tools in order to fix the car.
[02:15:11.566 --> 02:15:15.811]  And I don't think that that is necessarily dehumanizing.
[02:15:15.811 --> 02:15:18.173]  I don't think that we're necessarily losing anything.
[02:15:18.173 --> 02:15:21.177]  I feel like it's just an evolution.
[02:15:21.177 --> 02:15:22.718]  It's a change, definitely.
[02:15:23.559 --> 02:15:27.680]  Sure, but I was thinking about you could fix a car in your own garage.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:33.481]  The average person doesn't own the $50,000 diagnostic equipment now, so that centralizes it to shops.
[02:15:33.481 --> 02:15:38.982]  Then it becomes even more centralized to where it won't be in the shops anymore, where they have robots working on the robots.
[02:15:38.982 --> 02:15:45.583]  The elite openly have stated that they want to create a system where human labor isn't just cheap, it's obsolete.
[02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:48.064]  They claim it'll be good for the earth to reduce world population.
[02:15:48.644 --> 02:15:51.608]  The so-called smart grids are already surveilling everything we do.
[02:15:51.608 --> 02:15:53.611]  I'm sure you know Google founded 16 years ago.
[02:15:53.611 --> 02:15:56.375]  Its founding documents were recently released last year.
[02:15:56.375 --> 02:15:59.700]  They said the plan was to build an AI to take over the world.
[02:16:01.198 --> 02:16:04.239]  Yeah, I mean, they're an information company.
[02:16:04.239 --> 02:16:05.980]  They want to collect all information.
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:20.247]  If you look at Uber, the ride-sharing service, they just started a partnership with Carnegie Mellon to build autonomous vehicles and their CEO has openly said, we want to eliminate human drivers because they take 75% of our money.
[02:16:22.348 --> 02:16:24.329]  Is paying the human drivers to drive people around.
[02:16:24.329 --> 02:16:30.353]  So we have to vote with our dollars and keep humans involved to make sure we build the architecture where we're not obsolete.
[02:16:30.353 --> 02:16:32.154]  I mean, this is a no brainer.
[02:16:32.154 --> 02:16:33.215]  Well, I don't know.
[02:16:33.215 --> 02:16:36.497]  I mean, is that is that just trying to, like, fight progress?
[02:16:36.497 --> 02:16:51.826]  I mean, is that so, for instance, if you if you look at the evolution of a lot of our a lot of our consumer goods, right, it used to be that they were built in a way not because, you know, not because the corporations had, you know, used to care about us more.
[02:16:51.946 --> 02:16:52.406]  We're good to go.
[02:17:10.219 --> 02:17:17.305]  Now, because they're more efficient about building these things, we get better products, they're cheaper, they can do amazing things.
[02:17:17.305 --> 02:17:20.968]  I mean, there's no human being that can build an iPhone.
[02:17:20.968 --> 02:17:24.952]  You know, that's got to be a robot, that's got to be aided by these machines.
[02:17:24.952 --> 02:17:27.394]  And so you've got to ask, is the trade-off worth it, right?
[02:17:27.754 --> 02:17:35.980]  Do I want to be able to field strip my iPhone and replace it with a piece of leather and some rubber bands and have it work like I'm on Gilligan's Island?
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:43.486]  Or do I want the most futuristic, potentially even disposable consumer good possible?
[02:17:43.486 --> 02:17:44.867]  And I'm not arguing for either side.
[02:17:44.867 --> 02:17:47.089]  I'm just saying there's a definite trade-off right there.
[02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:48.089]  Sure.
[02:17:48.089 --> 02:17:51.672]  Daniel H. Wilson, author of Robo-pocalypse, is our guest.
[02:17:51.672 --> 02:17:52.833]  Here's what I'm getting at.
[02:17:52.833 --> 02:17:56.436]  There are natural developments in innovation and free markets that are wonderful.
[02:17:57.276 --> 02:18:06.245]  I'm simply saying from reading the mass body of what the actual corporate chiefs are saying, they actually aren't just motivated by money.
[02:18:06.245 --> 02:18:08.827]  They control the central banks that issue the currency and credit.
[02:18:08.827 --> 02:18:13.372]  They're motivated by the idea of, quote, saving the earth by reducing world population.
[02:18:13.772 --> 02:18:19.216]  And they're maneuvering the population into a position where they are obsolete and will, quote, have all this leisure time.
[02:18:19.216 --> 02:18:21.538]  But that's really just so we're domesticated.
[02:18:21.538 --> 02:18:26.962]  And then basically you sell out your rights to be able to have children to be on welfare in the future.
[02:18:26.962 --> 02:18:33.426]  And then we're looking at a world where the elites merge with machines and they see a new creature on the planet.
[02:18:33.426 --> 02:18:41.192]  That decision from the compendium of writings I've seen, nonfiction, is the direction that's been chosen by the social engineers.
[02:18:41.972 --> 02:18:44.294]  And I don't see that as a better world.
[02:18:44.294 --> 02:18:50.539]  I mean, I've never watched House of Cards until I had surgery a few days ago, so I watched four or five episodes.
[02:18:50.539 --> 02:18:52.220]  The first season and the third season.
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:55.422]  Every episode is about getting rid of old people and how they're worthless.
[02:18:55.422 --> 02:18:56.883]  And everybody says, this is a cutting-edge show.
[02:18:56.883 --> 02:18:57.544]  No, it's not.
[02:18:57.544 --> 02:19:02.828]  We're being taught how to be predatory, and we're being taught it's innovation to go into the jaws of the machines.
[02:19:03.943 --> 02:19:06.565]  I'll tell you this.
[02:19:06.565 --> 02:19:11.290]  I think that's a leap that I'm not willing to take in terms of believing that.
[02:19:11.290 --> 02:19:14.534]  I think that corporations can be good or evil.
[02:19:14.534 --> 02:19:16.015]  I think they're motivated by money.
[02:19:16.015 --> 02:19:20.280]  But what I can speak to, in my own experience, is being a scientist.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:34.765]  You know, and being in a laboratory and actually building this, this stuff, you know, like autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, I built, I helped build autonomous boats for Northrop Grumman, you know, a big military contractor.
[02:19:34.765 --> 02:19:36.706]  But I have to say that at the end of the day,
[02:19:37.506 --> 02:19:49.769]  When you're in an academic setting, when you're in a university somewhere, and you're a 25-year-old kid, and you're getting a grant, you're trying to get money, usually from the government.
[02:19:49.769 --> 02:19:59.512]  The National Institute of Health, sometimes DARPA, yeah, with robotics, but often you're getting money from, like,
[02:20:00.572 --> 02:20:00.912]  Sure.
[02:20:18.847 --> 02:20:27.092]  Really rural areas, and she'd check on elderly people that are living independently in their own homes, and she'd just try to make sure that they're safe.
[02:20:27.092 --> 02:20:31.315]  But you can't just drive out to every place in Oklahoma and check on people.
[02:20:31.315 --> 02:20:32.916]  Robots will do that.
[02:20:32.916 --> 02:20:43.342]  So all my research is about using this technology to have smart homes so that people could live safely and independently as long as possible in their own homes without any
[02:20:43.422 --> 02:20:48.385]  Listen, I know there's a good end to it, and I know there's people that develop a lot of stuff for research with a good intent.
[02:20:48.385 --> 02:20:52.508]  I'm not an anti-technology Luddite here.
[02:20:52.508 --> 02:20:58.252]  What I'm getting at with you is that day one, the autonomous craft are for killing.
[02:20:58.252 --> 02:21:04.116]  Day one, they're building a system where the robots are meant to displace the labor force.
[02:21:04.116 --> 02:21:12.521]  And Bill Joy talked about going to that meeting in 1999 with 200 top technology owners, and they said, we're not going to let people play games and party all day.
[02:21:14.403 --> 02:21:19.006]  That's the part that I think is a leap.
[02:21:19.006 --> 02:21:25.771]  Because when I think about corporations, typically what they're doing is they're trying to maximize their profit.
[02:21:25.771 --> 02:21:31.175]  That's going to be a really interesting inflection point to watch.
[02:21:31.175 --> 02:21:34.658]  Money buys you the McMansion, to quote House of Cards.
[02:21:34.658 --> 02:21:37.560]  Money buys you the McMansion and the wife that divorces you.
[02:21:39.041 --> 02:21:43.363]  Okay, power builds the stone fortress that's there in 10,000 years.
[02:21:43.363 --> 02:21:57.127]  The elite are all about power and life extension, and selling the public that it's all sexy to give up their free will into this big combine, and it's all being sold by the different priests of this system right now.
[02:21:57.127 --> 02:22:04.570]  But when at the bottom of it is what I'm saying is, the Robo-pocalypse is here, surveilling, tracking, and then gaming the economy.
[02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:07.951]  I mean, the Robo-pocalypse is Goldman Sachs gaming the stock market.
[02:22:08.191 --> 02:22:11.474]  With high-frequency trading that is basically illegal?
[02:22:11.474 --> 02:22:18.521]  Yeah, no, that is just... definitely the high-frequency trading is bad news, I feel like.
[02:22:18.521 --> 02:22:20.423]  But listen, what do you think we can do?
[02:22:20.423 --> 02:22:21.183]  Here's my question.
[02:22:21.183 --> 02:22:28.810]  You're an engineer, really smart guy, been involved in a lot of this stuff, best-selling author, on the cutting edge of media, got a movie coming out with Brad Pitt as well.
[02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:29.831]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:22:30.692 --> 02:22:33.494]  Then how do you want to build a future for your family?
[02:22:33.494 --> 02:22:34.954]  Do you want to have children?
[02:22:34.954 --> 02:22:38.677]  Where do you see this going if it was good and empowering?
[02:22:38.677 --> 02:22:43.279]  Yeah, so I have a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son, and I'm 37.
[02:22:43.279 --> 02:22:45.260]  I don't know.
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:58.328]  So I'm getting close to 40, and I've got a family, and I'm actually excited about the future of technology and how it's going to affect my kids, because when you start seeing your kids,
[02:22:59.318 --> 02:23:03.621]  What happens is, as I've gotten a little bit older, the technology changes.
[02:23:03.621 --> 02:23:05.542]  I start getting kind of pissed off.
[02:23:05.542 --> 02:23:07.943]  I'm like, oh, it's always some new thing every day.
[02:23:07.943 --> 02:23:12.726]  I'm supposed to memorize it, and I'm just like, why can't things just stay the way they were?
[02:23:12.726 --> 02:23:18.810]  But then you start watching your kids and other children, and you see that they're adapting to this whole new world.
[02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:20.711]  All this stuff is totally normal for them.
[02:23:20.711 --> 02:23:26.015]  This is the scenery of their world, and they're able to do great stuff with all this technology.
[02:23:26.875 --> 02:23:28.956]  I mean, I'm excited about it.
[02:23:28.956 --> 02:23:36.921]  I don't sense that there's an ulterior motive out there to reduce the population or anything like that.
[02:23:36.921 --> 02:23:46.227]  I definitely want my kids to be aware that corporations aren't your friend and that you are simply a dollar sign walking around out there.
[02:23:46.767 --> 02:23:54.340]  But there's got to be a moment when these major corporations are realized that they've, you know, we can see it right now.
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:24:00.991]  I feel like with McDonald's and Walmart, how they just raised the income for their, you know, well, they're kind of.
[02:24:01.676 --> 02:24:03.317]  They're capitulating to demand.
[02:24:03.317 --> 02:24:06.839]  I was about to say, corporations aren't just doing it for the dollar.
[02:24:06.839 --> 02:24:16.824]  If they were smart, like Henry Ford, he doubled and tripled the average factory worker price knowing he had to create an economy for his cars.
[02:24:16.824 --> 02:24:20.786]  It's like McDonald's 50 years ago started saying, please throw your trash away.
[02:24:20.786 --> 02:24:24.808]  That just made it all filthy and got rid of a service economy and entry-level jobs.
[02:24:24.808 --> 02:24:29.351]  We need to build a better economy based on humanity and taking care of the old and
[02:24:29.611 --> 02:24:31.152]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:24:31.152 --> 02:24:33.092]  Dude, I completely agree with you right there.
[02:24:33.092 --> 02:24:33.893]  And that's exactly... Yeah.
[02:24:33.893 --> 02:24:34.353]  So, you know, like...
[02:24:50.299 --> 02:24:55.582]  I think sometimes people have this reaction that, you know, technology is too scary.
[02:24:55.582 --> 02:24:58.444]  We've got to, we've got to hit the brakes and it's impossible.
[02:24:58.444 --> 02:25:03.747]  You know, human beings as an animal, as a, as a creature, we build tools.
[02:25:03.747 --> 02:25:04.487]  That's what we do.
[02:25:04.487 --> 02:25:17.655]  If you put a human being naked in the woods, the first thing they'll do is they'll start building tools, you know, and we're, I feel like as a species, we're at this point in our development where our tools are starting to get really cool.
[02:25:18.035 --> 02:25:23.540]  I mean, I built InfoWars to fight tyranny, and I was just a nobody from Texas.
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:25.502]  There's only a million people a week now.
[02:25:25.502 --> 02:25:27.003]  Talk about being independent.
[02:25:27.003 --> 02:25:37.313]  I mean, what's more independent than modifying your body, you know, utilizing technology to modify your body if you want to upload your brain into a computer if you have that capability?
[02:25:37.313 --> 02:25:39.735]  What's more independent than striking out into outer space?
[02:25:39.735 --> 02:25:42.458]  I mean, that sounds like science fiction, but
[02:25:43.038 --> 02:25:46.820]  So did Amazon having drones delivering packages.
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:49.422]  So did sending colonists across the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:25:49.422 --> 02:25:50.422]  So did electricity.
[02:25:50.422 --> 02:25:55.425]  I mean, the stuff today is seen as magic a hundred years ago.
[02:25:55.425 --> 02:25:56.346]  It's really just science.
[02:25:57.130 --> 02:26:07.260]  Yeah, so, you know, I actually wrote another novel called Amped, which is all about people using neural implants to basically cure disability.
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:19.933]  But, you know, what ends up happening is the people that use the technology, they used to have a disability, but now they leapfrog normal ability, and now they're superhuman, and it's about how society reacts to that.
[02:26:20.553 --> 02:26:28.358]  And I think a lot of times people assume that, you know, the wealthy people are going to get the best technology, right?
[02:26:28.358 --> 02:26:29.018]  Well, guess what?
[02:26:29.018 --> 02:26:38.364]  Like, if you're really wealthy, you don't really have a lot of motivation to get a hole drilled in your head and get a neural implant or to upload your brain into a computer.
[02:26:38.604 --> 02:26:42.047]  You're not desperate, you're happy with the status quo, right?
[02:26:42.047 --> 02:26:45.210]  So I think it's actually a lot of times the opposite.
[02:26:45.210 --> 02:26:53.418]  The people who are most desperate, who have, if you've got a child with a disability, there's nothing that's going to stop you from getting the latest technology to help your child.
[02:26:53.418 --> 02:26:54.279]  Sure, sure.
[02:26:54.279 --> 02:26:57.101]  But expanding on that, I mean, if you look at it,
[02:26:57.822 --> 02:27:03.386]  There are legions of studies saying that screen time is actually impairing neurological development in children.
[02:27:03.386 --> 02:27:04.867]  It's brain damaging them.
[02:27:04.867 --> 02:27:10.051]  And the elites, when you go to Bilderberg, I've covered it, they are actually obsessed with life extension.
[02:27:10.051 --> 02:27:12.854]  They just don't want the general public to get it.
[02:27:12.854 --> 02:27:19.579]  In fact, there's the headline, Daily Beast, the immortality financiers, the billionaires who want to live forever.
[02:27:19.579 --> 02:27:26.364]  So I'm not disagreeing with you overall, but Page and others are completely obsessed with it.
[02:27:27.406 --> 02:27:32.810]  Yeah, but that's, I think life extension might be a, you know, sort of a unique scenario there.
[02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:34.652]  And it's also something that they want to do.
[02:27:34.652 --> 02:27:38.115]  I think they're imagining doing this stuff like on their deathbed.
[02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:48.042]  You know, what surprised me was looking at, was hearing about how, um, uh, oh geez, how am I blanking on, um, Steve Jobs.
[02:27:49.045 --> 02:27:52.286]  You know, Steve Jobs, his cancer snuck up on him.
[02:27:52.286 --> 02:27:59.367]  And you know, when I imagine a billionaire who's out there, I imagine, you know, they're getting the cutting-edge medical care.
[02:27:59.367 --> 02:28:07.928]  They're constantly, you know, getting their health, you know, checked on so that they're not going to die for as long as possible.
[02:28:07.928 --> 02:28:11.409]  But then, you know, you see that death comes for all of us, right?
[02:28:11.409 --> 02:28:12.649]  At some point.
[02:28:12.649 --> 02:28:13.769]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:28:13.769 --> 02:28:17.910]  How do we know it's not a con game that they claim merging ourselves with machines or uploading our brain?
[02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:22.031]  You know, Kurzweil says he's going to recreate his dad off of just papers he had.
[02:28:22.031 --> 02:28:26.472]  I mean, that doesn't really make sense.
[02:28:26.472 --> 02:28:37.074]  You know, the idea of uploading your brain into the machine, I never really understood that because, look, if you personally want to live forever as yourself, right?
[02:28:37.074 --> 02:28:39.634]  To me, that means you need to keep your body alive.
[02:28:39.634 --> 02:28:43.035]  If my brain dies and there's a perfect copy of me,
[02:28:43.795 --> 02:28:44.395]  I don't care.
[02:28:44.395 --> 02:28:45.656]  Congrats to the copy.
[02:28:45.656 --> 02:28:46.596]  I'm dead.
[02:28:46.596 --> 02:28:47.156]  Right?
[02:28:47.156 --> 02:28:52.179]  So then having a copy of yourself living forever, that's not about wanting to live forever.
[02:28:52.179 --> 02:28:55.100]  That's about erecting a monument to yourself.
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:29:00.582]  That's about having a talking gravestone that can tell people about how wonderful you were.
[02:29:00.582 --> 02:29:01.082]  Right?
[02:29:01.082 --> 02:29:03.583]  You know, to me, those are two totally different things.
[02:29:03.583 --> 02:29:07.025]  Making a copy of your brain in a computer and living forever.
[02:29:07.025 --> 02:29:08.405]  I don't think they're the same thing.
[02:29:08.405 --> 02:29:09.566]  What do you think?
[02:29:10.646 --> 02:29:19.912]  You know, I think that you're absolutely on target when it comes to that, but it goes beyond that at some levels, and I want to get your take on that when we come back from break.
[02:29:19.912 --> 02:29:22.974]  I want to talk about when is Robo Apocalypse coming out?
[02:29:22.974 --> 02:29:27.757]  When is the new sci-fi survival film of Brad Pitt coming out?
[02:29:27.757 --> 02:29:28.798]  I can't wait to see that.
[02:29:28.798 --> 02:29:33.420]  I want to talk about some of your other books, some of your short stories as well.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:37.783]  What do you feel about futurist predictions like Ray Kurzweil predicts a singularity around 2025 or earlier?
[02:29:39.344 --> 02:29:41.547]  We'll break it all down, and the moves.
[02:29:41.547 --> 02:29:47.153]  We've seen Time Magazine and others say, time for driverless cars, get rid of drivers, when the machines can do it better.
[02:29:47.153 --> 02:29:49.235]  Do we all go to prison, basically?
[02:29:49.235 --> 02:29:49.756]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.756 --> 02:29:50.777]  We're on march.
[02:29:50.777 --> 02:29:53.300]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:55.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.203 --> 02:30:02.145]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:02.145 --> 02:30:06.388]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:30:06.388 --> 02:30:10.852]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:10.852 --> 02:30:18.157]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:18.157 --> 02:30:25.623]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular
[02:30:25.623 --> 02:30:26.003]  We're good to go.
[02:30:52.486 --> 02:30:53.590]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:55.375]  DNA Force, from Infowars Life.
[02:31:00.271 --> 02:31:09.937]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:09.937 --> 02:31:19.862]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:19.862 --> 02:31:22.784]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:31:22.984 --> 02:31:23.605]  I think so.
[02:31:37.961 --> 02:31:38.201]  We're good.
[02:32:00.234 --> 02:32:07.440]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:33:17.106 --> 02:33:22.611]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.611 --> 02:33:28.416]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.416 --> 02:33:32.359]  Robo-apocalypse author Daniel H. Wilson joins us.
[02:33:32.359 --> 02:33:39.065]  Steven Spielberg's turning his best-selling book into a big mega-blockbuster.
[02:33:39.065 --> 02:33:43.249]  Another one's in production as well, being produced by Brad Pitt.
[02:33:44.201 --> 02:33:46.162]  The Project Sci-Fi Survival Script.
[02:33:46.162 --> 02:33:50.223]  We'll find out the specifics of that.
[02:33:50.223 --> 02:33:58.185]  I always marvel at the predatory nature of the social engineers, the eugenicists who founded the modern transhumanist movement.
[02:33:58.185 --> 02:33:59.786]  Most transhumanists mean well.
[02:33:59.786 --> 02:34:02.006]  They're what you call porch transhumanists.
[02:34:02.006 --> 02:34:04.447]  They're not in the inner engineer level.
[02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:18.618]  But when you get up into the big foundations and you get up into the big technocracy, just like Bill Gates has come out and said, Warren Buffett, machines will decide when you live and when you die, when you get medical care, when you don't.
[02:34:18.618 --> 02:34:28.864]  And so, according to their plan, and the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, as I love to say, and it is the best of times and worst of times to continue down that line.
[02:34:28.864 --> 02:34:29.725]  A tale of two cities.
[02:34:30.808 --> 02:34:39.015]  But the main push is for authoritarianism, is for totalitarianism, is for autocratic despotism.
[02:34:39.015 --> 02:34:43.779]  And that's too bad because machines, computers, computing could empower us.
[02:34:43.779 --> 02:34:51.326]  But look, we've got more information than ever, more choices than ever, and we're more unhealthy, we're more decadent, we're more slob-like.
[02:34:52.206 --> 02:34:57.710]  People are choosing false reality and actually buying fake Lamborghinis and Second Life and things like this.
[02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:59.091]  So I'm not being negative.
[02:34:59.091 --> 02:35:00.472]  I'm not a pessimist.
[02:35:00.472 --> 02:35:05.796]  But when I say join the resistance, it means really look at the choices that are being made now.
[02:35:05.796 --> 02:35:07.737]  Don't just be a spectator.
[02:35:07.737 --> 02:35:17.224]  And so I think it's healthy to have books like Robo Apocalypse and films, kind of a maximum overdrive meets your toaster.
[02:35:17.224 --> 02:35:18.645]  But at the same time,
[02:35:20.433 --> 02:35:29.682]  It almost cheapens it because it's then just a movie when the reality is it's a slow burn, a takeover of our soul.
[02:35:32.659 --> 02:35:38.384]  The current system empowering us, and that's my question for Daniel H. Wilson, it's almost like space travel.
[02:35:38.384 --> 02:35:48.952]  If you don't have gravity on your moon mission, or your Mars mission, and you go on a year-long mission to Mars, you're not going to be able to walk when you get to the surface.
[02:35:48.952 --> 02:35:54.097]  Well, humans in the last 50, 60 years have come in contact with all these tools we've developed.
[02:35:55.165 --> 02:36:08.692]  That are now driving us, and we're being told, and I knew this 20 years ago, and I'd say, they're gonna say that robots are better driving than computer cars, and they're gonna first have higher taxes and higher insurance, and then finally say, you can't drive your car.
[02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:09.993]  Well, that's where this is going.
[02:36:10.993 --> 02:36:13.996]  And so, humans need to be challenged.
[02:36:13.996 --> 02:36:16.839]  Humans need to be able to take risk and be in danger.
[02:36:16.839 --> 02:36:20.362]  And the nanny state is about ending human empowerment.
[02:36:20.362 --> 02:36:23.285]  And you can see us getting weaker and dumber and more feeble.
[02:36:23.285 --> 02:36:28.290]  I mean, if you're a scientist, Daniel, and a really smart guy, the data's pretty much in.
[02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:32.811]  That this is almost like losing gravity.
[02:36:32.811 --> 02:36:36.973]  That we're losing our strength, our vitality, our creativity.
[02:36:36.973 --> 02:36:45.976]  Really smart guys like you, or innovators like myself, I mean, we're going to be successful in the system no matter what.
[02:36:45.976 --> 02:36:56.120]  But for the mass of humanity, as Bill Joy wrote in Wire Magazine, I don't know if you've read this lengthy treatise, that the elite have decided that the general public is going to be basically done away with.
[02:36:57.824 --> 02:37:00.625]  Well, I gotta disagree.
[02:37:00.625 --> 02:37:07.707]  I think that every individual can use technology in whatever way they see fit.
[02:37:07.707 --> 02:37:12.288]  If you look at, for instance, watching 10 hours of television a day, yeah, that's terrible.
[02:37:12.288 --> 02:37:13.849]  Don't do it!
[02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:16.429]  The corporations are happy to make money off of you.
[02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:24.592]  They're happy to sell you an all-you-can-eat buffet, but it's up to each of us to use the technology appropriately.
[02:37:24.592 --> 02:37:25.072]  For instance,
[02:37:26.452 --> 02:37:29.813]  We limit screen time with our kids.
[02:37:29.813 --> 02:37:47.960]  My wife is a child psychologist and she actually advises people to collect cell phones from their kids if they have teenagers before bedtime and put them all in one place and charge them up all night or else kids will be up all night on the cell phones talking to each other and texting to each other.
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:53.227]  I mean, again, the technology is always a double-edged blade.
[02:37:53.227 --> 02:38:01.359]  There's always going to be negative potentials, but there's also, you know, positive outcomes that you can get from using the technology.
[02:38:02.213 --> 02:38:03.675]  But what about the numbers?
[02:38:03.675 --> 02:38:11.043]  Top scientists, medical doctors saying they're seeing neurological development problems in children with screen time.
[02:38:11.043 --> 02:38:14.867]  They're seeing clumsiness, almost autistic-like attributes.
[02:38:14.867 --> 02:38:17.570]  We're seeing neurological disorders off the chart.
[02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:23.096]  We're seeing just all sorts of... I mean, this... What is your answer to that?
[02:38:24.494 --> 02:38:30.038]  Yeah, I'm not sure that we have any kind of epidemic of neurological disorders from screen time.
[02:38:30.038 --> 02:38:35.883]  I mean, televisions have been around for, you know, what, 50 years or something?
[02:38:35.883 --> 02:38:37.984]  I mean, we had TV for a while.
[02:38:37.984 --> 02:38:42.128]  We now have access to a lot of different types of screens.
[02:38:42.128 --> 02:38:45.590]  You know, you see the parents tossing an iPad to their kid.
[02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:47.752]  Yeah, people are talking at the dinner table.
[02:38:47.752 --> 02:38:49.433]  Everybody's on their pad.
[02:38:49.433 --> 02:38:54.197]  Yeah, my wife has instituted a rule at our house, you know, no screens at dinnertime.
[02:38:54.437 --> 02:38:58.300]  What do you think of Steve Jobs banning his children from him, period?
[02:38:58.300 --> 02:39:00.181]  Yeah, I mean, that's smart, right?
[02:39:00.181 --> 02:39:04.564]  I mean, look, my wife's a child psychologist, but we're not above it.
[02:39:04.564 --> 02:39:12.349]  You know, if it's dinner, if we're out at a restaurant and the kids are being loud, then we're not above bringing out... It's the equivalent of a sugar tit, the 21st century.
[02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:13.350]  Sorry?
[02:39:13.350 --> 02:39:14.711]  It's the equivalent of a sugar tit.
[02:39:15.663 --> 02:39:18.885]  Yeah, you know, like if you, right, it's exactly the same thing.
[02:39:18.885 --> 02:39:23.588]  Sometimes society provides an overabundance of something that's not healthy for you.
[02:39:23.588 --> 02:39:24.629]  And yeah, guess what?
[02:39:24.629 --> 02:39:25.190]  You know what?
[02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:30.914]  It might be up to the individual to make a healthy decision for themselves or for their family.
[02:39:30.914 --> 02:39:34.296]  And I mean, I think that's the opposite of a nanny state, right?
[02:39:34.296 --> 02:39:38.839]  I mean, there's no, there's nobody higher up limiting exactly what you can do if you
[02:39:38.939 --> 02:39:45.754]  Sure, but that nanny state is the tablet watching and tracking, creating a psychological-detailed algorithm of everything you're doing.
[02:39:46.789 --> 02:39:56.074]  Yeah, you know, actually, have you noticed there's been a lot of new technology devoted to tracking your own health and tracking what you eat and what you drink?
[02:39:56.074 --> 02:39:57.715]  They're going to use that to tax us, yeah.
[02:39:57.715 --> 02:39:58.815]  Exercise.
[02:39:58.815 --> 02:40:00.676]  Yeah, I'm not super into it.
[02:40:00.676 --> 02:40:01.177]  Exactly!
[02:40:01.177 --> 02:40:07.880]  You get the new iPhone, you don't ask it to do it, and suddenly how far you walked, what you did, a whole database is tracking you.
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:09.341]  This is Big Brother on PCP.
[02:40:10.142 --> 02:40:12.605]  Let's shift into your amazing books themselves.
[02:40:12.605 --> 02:40:15.290]  How many books have you written?
[02:40:15.290 --> 02:40:18.535]  You've got several great websites, but which one should we direct people to?
[02:40:18.535 --> 02:40:19.897]  When are these movies coming out?
[02:40:20.771 --> 02:40:25.676]  So I'm at danielhwilson.com, and yeah, I started writing books about 10 years ago.
[02:40:25.676 --> 02:40:29.800]  I wrote a book called How to Survive a Robot Uprising, which was funny.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:36.727]  And then I wrote some non-fiction books like Where's My Jetpack?, looking at kind of the science fiction future that we were promised.
[02:40:36.727 --> 02:40:39.870]  But my, yeah, my biggest novel has been Robopocalypse.
[02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:49.018]  Um, and it has a sequel called Robogenesis and it was purchased by DreamWorks and Steven Spielberg's attached to direct it, but it's been in development forever.
[02:40:49.018 --> 02:40:54.963]  And, you know, at this point, they don't really even keep me informed about what's going on.
[02:40:54.963 --> 02:40:58.125]  So, you know, I'm hoping that they get to it, you know.
[02:40:58.125 --> 02:41:00.948]  In the meantime, I've transitioned into a
[02:41:01.368 --> 02:41:02.468]  You know, I just love writing.
[02:41:02.468 --> 02:41:03.409]  I love science fiction.
[02:41:03.409 --> 02:41:04.049]  I love writing.
[02:41:04.049 --> 02:41:06.310]  I've been writing for DC Comics.
[02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:10.051]  I'm writing the Earth 2 series for DC.
[02:41:10.051 --> 02:41:20.515]  And I'm writing, yes, this film for Lionsgate called Alpha, which is actually still under wraps, but it's a sci-fi survival tale that involves robots.
[02:41:21.235 --> 02:41:25.577]  And in this one I actually portray robots in a good light.
[02:41:25.577 --> 02:41:34.141]  I show basically a piece of survival equipment that's robotic and it's basically a survival tale in the Antarctic.
[02:41:34.141 --> 02:41:37.583]  And my latest kind of project is an app.
[02:41:37.583 --> 02:41:42.185]  It's actually for the iPhone or iPad and it's the first speech
[02:41:42.945 --> 02:41:43.406]  I'm good.
[02:41:55.549 --> 02:42:01.091]  In these games, in novels, in movies, it's always so kind of one-sided, you know?
[02:42:01.091 --> 02:42:03.912]  You don't get to interact with the characters.
[02:42:03.912 --> 02:42:21.059]  And so the idea was that I'd make a game where you literally answer a Mayday call, and you speak to this character, and you guide this character off of a derelict spaceship, and you save the guy's life by actually speaking to him over the radio.
[02:42:22.654 --> 02:42:27.996]  Amazing, you are a prolific fellow of powerful stuff.
[02:42:27.996 --> 02:42:33.558]  Do you consider your book Robo-Apocalypse to be a warning or just entertainment?
[02:42:33.558 --> 02:42:36.159]  You know, I think it's entertainment.
[02:42:36.159 --> 02:42:42.302]  I think that it's really, really interesting to think about these themes because they don't go away.
[02:42:42.302 --> 02:42:47.564]  You know, people have been afraid of what the next round of technology means for humanity.
[02:42:47.564 --> 02:42:50.565]  We've been afraid of that, you know, since there was new technology.
[02:42:51.505 --> 02:43:05.589]  So it's a really I think it's a really basic human thing to sort of imagine these potential scenarios and it's part of the reason why human beings are still around is that we sit around and we think about about every angle.
[02:43:05.589 --> 02:43:14.671]  Yeah, we think about every angle and we so that we're able to make good decisions, you know, moving forward and keep ourselves alive even as we build
[02:43:15.451 --> 02:43:17.193]  More and more powerful technology.
[02:43:17.193 --> 02:43:19.895]  And you know, I'm impressed with humanity.
[02:43:19.895 --> 02:43:22.837]  I'm impressed with people because I am too.
[02:43:22.837 --> 02:43:26.581]  The globalist arm is this tower, you know, of technology.
[02:43:26.581 --> 02:43:29.523]  Every time we come up with a new technology, we're more powerful.
[02:43:29.523 --> 02:43:31.705]  We're more capable of destroying ourselves.
[02:43:31.705 --> 02:43:32.606]  If that's the way it's going to go.
[02:43:33.366 --> 02:43:41.550]  And, and yet, you know, we just keep putting more chips on the table and making bigger and bigger bets and, and, you know, and winning and moving forward.
[02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:45.291]  And so I'm excited about what technology is going to bring.
[02:43:45.291 --> 02:43:47.092]  I mean, look at World War Two, it killed.
[02:43:48.689 --> 02:43:53.432]  It killed 100 million people or so, and we didn't have the atomic weapons until the very end.
[02:43:53.432 --> 02:43:55.974]  I mean, I do see us doubling down.
[02:43:55.974 --> 02:43:56.954]  I do see that happening.
[02:43:56.954 --> 02:44:00.297]  And I actually see the worst behavior out of the elites themselves.
[02:44:00.297 --> 02:44:05.700]  I see the grassroots actually trying to bring some sanity to all of this.
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:09.743]  How close is the Internet right now to becoming a complete global mainframe?
[02:44:10.964 --> 02:44:19.775]  Well, so, you know, that's the, that's, I think, one misconception about artificial intelligence is that, you know, somehow it sort of lives on the Internet.
[02:44:19.775 --> 02:44:25.802]  You know, the Internet is just a really basic set of protocols for swapping information, you know, between places.
[02:44:25.802 --> 02:44:29.507]  And so... Sure, but that's what communication grid and AI would have, though, into everything.
[02:44:30.563 --> 02:44:44.469]  Well, I guess an AI could could use the Internet in order to accumulate data, you know, but, um, you know, in reality, when you're building an artificial intelligence, you typically are trying to solve a very specific problem.
[02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:47.030]  And so getting a general level AI.
[02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:49.091]  Uh, it's very difficult.
[02:44:49.091 --> 02:45:03.877]  And so what happens is, yeah, you know, you can use the Internet to get a training corpus, you know, like, for instance, you can collect a whole lot of chat data, right, in order to teach a machine what it looks like when people talk to each other or type to each other online.
[02:45:03.877 --> 02:45:04.297]  But, um,
[02:45:05.794 --> 02:45:11.838]  But the idea that an AI by itself is going to go out seeking that stuff and just sort of pull in the whole...
[02:45:37.175 --> 02:45:45.739]  Yeah, no, I mean, that's absolutely, you know, you can model what's happening on the internet and then you can use the model to make predictions.
[02:45:45.739 --> 02:45:52.723]  Once you can model, if the public isn't aware of that, once you have modeling and tracking, you can have steering.
[02:45:52.723 --> 02:45:54.404]  And so it's about steering.
[02:45:54.404 --> 02:46:01.407]  I've talked to top, former director of technicals, NSA, you name it, you know, William Benny was here two weeks ago in studio.
[02:46:03.795 --> 02:46:06.657]  Basically, that's what it's all about is controlling the future.
[02:46:06.657 --> 02:46:14.001]  The big secret is they want all this data so humans can then know where the trends are before everybody else does.
[02:46:14.001 --> 02:46:21.266]  And then if you know that, then you know how to dominate everybody two, three steps ahead and it ends competition and really kind of ends free will.
[02:46:21.266 --> 02:46:22.927]  And I'm not being negative here.
[02:46:22.927 --> 02:46:27.510]  I'm bringing up the real problems that I and others see in this.
[02:46:28.584 --> 02:46:29.184]  Sure.
[02:46:29.184 --> 02:46:31.646]  I mean, I think that's absolutely a goal.
[02:46:31.646 --> 02:46:39.289]  There's an example of this maybe a year or two ago where Target was doing exactly what you're describing.
[02:46:39.289 --> 02:46:49.374]  They were modeling their customer base based on all the information they have in their stores about customer purchasing habits and when they bought it and who they were and where they bought it from.
[02:46:49.374 --> 02:46:56.038]  And they started targeting their advertising and they started being able to predict when people were pregnant.
[02:46:56.798 --> 02:47:18.685]  And they started sending ads for baby stuff to their customers and what happened was they sent a teenage girl a lot of advertising for newborn products and her dad found it and he got really mad until he found out that yes, she was pregnant.
[02:47:18.685 --> 02:47:23.907]  And so Target has actually started obfuscating their targeted advertising.
[02:47:24.827 --> 02:47:26.068]  Sure, we the enemy might not know.
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:45.021]  I don't think so.
[02:47:58.632 --> 02:48:00.594]  You know, you can know all this data, right?
[02:48:00.594 --> 02:48:04.017]  And I think this is actually something that happens a lot with scientists.
[02:48:04.017 --> 02:48:06.319]  You know, you want to solve the problem.
[02:48:06.319 --> 02:48:08.821]  Somebody says to you, we need to predict what consumers want.
[02:48:08.821 --> 02:48:10.823]  And you go, all right, let's solve it.
[02:48:10.823 --> 02:48:13.426]  But you don't really think about the social aspect.
[02:48:13.426 --> 02:48:14.407]  You don't really consider
[02:48:14.987 --> 02:48:16.908]  Oh wait, I'm gonna freak people out.
[02:48:16.908 --> 02:48:32.755]  Sure, Target and Walmart for 10 years have hidden retina scanners and voice print analysis to quote see what you're looking at down to each word but now it's jacked into the NSA and it's really a tracking grid for everyone and and of course they're getting the database from the feds and out of the DMVs and Facebook's involved.
[02:48:34.653 --> 02:48:36.394]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:48:36.394 --> 02:48:38.616]  I mean, there's a lot of data sources out there, and it's true.
[02:48:38.616 --> 02:48:48.103]  I think you have to think about where the trade-off is worth it, you know, as you go out there and use these technologies that are going to collect data about you.
[02:48:48.103 --> 02:48:49.224]  Sure, let me ask you this question.
[02:48:49.784 --> 02:48:51.725]  I think one thing that you and I agree on, I think, is that
[02:49:17.562 --> 02:49:23.066]  The mass number of people, not the small number of people who may have most of the money or the power.
[02:49:23.066 --> 02:49:29.029]  I think the vast population of people is really the big decider about what's going to happen for humanity.
[02:49:29.029 --> 02:49:33.432]  Because at the end of the day, you know, we really vote with our numbers.
[02:49:33.432 --> 02:49:35.514]  And so I think that the future of humanity
[02:49:36.394 --> 02:49:39.115]  It's not going to be human beings obsolete.
[02:49:39.115 --> 02:49:47.299]  I don't think it's going to be a bleak future where we're under the thumb of a robot AI that makes all of our decisions for us.
[02:49:47.299 --> 02:49:54.062]  I think that human beings are really adaptable creatures and we're really smart and we're really curious.
[02:49:54.062 --> 02:49:56.543]  And as a result of those really innate
[02:49:57.103 --> 02:50:05.914]  Aspects of human nature, I think we're going to take the technology and we're going to run with it and we're going to combine with it and we're going to use it in our bodies.
[02:50:05.914 --> 02:50:09.038]  We're going to use it to propel ourselves into space.
[02:50:09.038 --> 02:50:11.721]  I think we really are going to.
[02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:14.265]  Instead of competing against the robots.
[02:50:14.665 --> 02:50:22.934]  We're going to probably become more like the robots by integrating these technological advantages into our bodies and into our lives.
[02:50:22.934 --> 02:50:30.643]  But if that's all engineered by the big five globalist companies, they're going to have all their back doors in that like they have back doors in everything else today.
[02:50:32.725 --> 02:50:35.447]  Calm, really interesting.
[02:50:35.447 --> 02:50:36.947]  We've only got one short segment left.
[02:50:36.947 --> 02:50:40.769]  I want to come back and talk about any other films and what your new book is you're working on.
[02:50:40.769 --> 02:50:44.331]  Then we'll let you get out of here and have a great weekend here on Good Friday.
[02:50:44.331 --> 02:50:46.332]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:46.332 --> 02:50:50.375]  Central and back next Monday as well, 11 a.m.
[02:50:50.375 --> 02:50:51.395]  to 2 p.m.
[02:50:51.395 --> 02:50:52.536]  Central Standard Time.
[02:50:52.536 --> 02:50:53.596]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:53.596 --> 02:50:55.017]  My website's infowares.com.
[02:50:55.017 --> 02:50:57.839]  There's a lot of breaking news up there on the site right now.
[02:50:57.839 --> 02:50:58.239]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.783]  Music, one of life's greatest pleasures, has tremendous power.
[02:51:03.783 --> 02:51:07.185]  The power to bring a tear to the eye or to quiet a racing mind.
[02:51:07.185 --> 02:51:16.591]  Music also has the power to heal and has been used through the centuries to treat depression, create energy, induce sleep, relieve stress and chronic pain.
[02:51:16.591 --> 02:51:21.735]  Now, Michael Torello's created Whole Tones, the healing frequency music projects.
[02:51:21.735 --> 02:51:27.579]  These frequencies were uncovered in the music of King David and believed to have astounding healing effects.
[02:51:27.899 --> 02:51:35.767]  Now you can benefit from healing music therapy simply by listening daily to this music in the comfort of your own home or office.
[02:51:35.767 --> 02:51:36.668]  It's a new year.
[02:51:36.668 --> 02:51:39.410]  Give yourself the gift of healing and transformation.

[02:52:00.299 --> 02:52:09.886]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:11.468]  The answer is clear.
[02:52:11.468 --> 02:52:14.050]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:52:14.050 --> 02:52:16.611]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:52:17.492 --> 02:52:19.753]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[02:53:09.073 --> 02:53:10.334]  You think the news is real?
[02:53:10.334 --> 02:53:12.295]  You're living in a dream!
[02:53:12.295 --> 02:53:15.257]  Politicians don't run too deep to fight for you and me!
[02:53:15.257 --> 02:53:19.760]  They represent who cuts a chance to fulfill the corporate need!
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:24.403]  I can't stand this no more!
[02:53:24.403 --> 02:53:29.526]  I don't wanna give my freedom away!
[02:53:52.179 --> 02:53:55.109]  Available on iTunes or Amazon.com.
[02:54:12.594 --> 02:54:16.778]  Final segment with Robo-Apocalypse author Daniel H. Wilson.
[02:54:16.778 --> 02:54:23.505]  Tell us about any new projects you got coming up and any final comments without me trying to direct the interview or asking you all sorts of questions.
[02:54:23.505 --> 02:54:26.748]  I appreciate you coming on, Daniel, and best of luck with all your future endeavors.
[02:54:26.748 --> 02:54:29.010]  At least you get people thinking about what's happening.
[02:54:29.010 --> 02:54:35.556]  I mean, at the end of your Robo-Apocalypse, I don't want to give it away, but, you know, humans merging with the machines, I guess, is what defeats the original AI.
[02:54:37.257 --> 02:54:43.919]  I just hope my children have a chance to be human, if they want to be human.
[02:54:43.919 --> 02:54:46.780]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:52.461]  When you look at their sweet little faces, it's hard to imagine this kind of technology and what it would mean.
[02:54:52.461 --> 02:54:54.441]  My latest project is Robogenesis.
[02:54:54.441 --> 02:54:56.942]  It's the sequel to Robopocalypse.
[02:54:56.942 --> 02:55:00.243]  And it basically picks up right where Robopocalypse left off.
[02:55:00.243 --> 02:55:04.684]  What it kind of considers more is the impact of massive
[02:55:05.544 --> 02:55:10.469]  Massively intelligent artificial intelligences out there, but more than one.
[02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:17.315]  You know, what happens whenever we're kind of pawns caught in a bigger game when the A.I.s are battling each other?
[02:55:17.315 --> 02:55:21.038]  You know, and what does that mean for humanity and how do we survive?
[02:55:21.038 --> 02:55:22.960]  Well, the globalists might as well be A.I.s.
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:23.961]  They're totally ruthless.
[02:55:23.961 --> 02:55:25.683]  They want total power at any cost.
[02:55:26.283 --> 02:55:36.209]  I mean, look at history, and that's why I'm so pessimistic, is that they're already basically using what might as well be AI technology with these big aggregators to manipulate society.
[02:55:36.209 --> 02:55:40.651]  Well, yeah, you know, that's the difference between humans and machines, though, right?
[02:55:40.651 --> 02:55:44.754]  Is a human being is going to have some kind of understandable endgame, right?
[02:55:44.754 --> 02:55:53.719]  Whether they want money, or whether they want power, or both, or control, you know, those are all things that you can understand why a person... I want a future destiny in beauty!
[02:55:54.690 --> 02:56:02.032]  Yeah, well, and artificial intelligence could be anything, because this is coming from, essentially, it's a program, right?
[02:56:02.032 --> 02:56:07.953]  So, you know, in Robogenesis, I consider AI that doesn't even know human beings exist.
[02:56:07.953 --> 02:56:09.494]  It's not even aware of us.
[02:56:09.494 --> 02:56:13.435]  There are other AI that, you know, want to have more
[02:56:13.955 --> 02:56:16.276]  I would imagine AI that was truly sentient would want to just get out of here.
[02:56:29.775 --> 02:56:35.739]  Yeah, well, and just because it's sentient doesn't mean that it's sentient in a way that, you know, that we can understand.
[02:56:35.739 --> 02:56:38.621]  Yeah, it's not like a human sentient, I get it.
[02:56:38.621 --> 02:56:40.562]  I mean, can it recognize the beauty of a sunset?
[02:56:40.562 --> 02:56:45.425]  No, it's sentient that it can make its own decisions and has its own goal.
[02:56:45.425 --> 02:56:59.475]  Or it might recognize, understand the beauty of a sunset on a level that we can't even comprehend because it can see the sunset, you know, from satellites in space and it can analyze the, you know, the spectral contents of the, you know,
[02:57:00.375 --> 02:57:04.277]  You know, it's really impossible to predict because they don't use the same sensors that we use.
[02:57:04.277 --> 02:57:06.158]  They may not have the same thought process.
[02:57:06.158 --> 02:57:07.719]  But AI is being designed for war.
[02:57:07.719 --> 02:57:14.963]  There's the real Skynet danger of, because it's being designed for killing, that that be what it breaks.
[02:57:14.963 --> 02:57:16.184]  I mean, not even AI.
[02:57:16.184 --> 02:57:19.826]  What about a global malfunction or a global hack of these systems?
[02:57:20.700 --> 02:57:21.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:30.765]  I mean, I think that's, there's actually a buddy of mine named Peter Singer wrote Wired for War, and he's coming out with a new novel.
[02:57:30.765 --> 02:57:31.545]  You should talk to him.
[02:57:31.545 --> 02:57:44.251]  And he talks about exactly this, what the future of warfare would look like if you can just hack an entire drone fleet and then turn it around and attack the person who... You're talking about Professor Peter Singer at Princeton?
[02:57:45.508 --> 02:57:48.251]  He is, I think, a fellow at the Brookings Institute.
