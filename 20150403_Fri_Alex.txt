[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this third day.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  It is Friday.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  Here's a special report by Paul Watson that we're coming back with the Iran nuke deal,
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  the latest on Jade Helm, and more straight ahead.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  Memories pizza in Indiana has come under fire from irate liberals
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  after the owner said they would refuse to cater for a gay wedding.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  It's the first test of Indiana's largely symbolic Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  which prohibits state laws that substantially burden the right of a person or religious institution
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  or a business to follow their religious beliefs.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  Other states have laws in place which force businesses not to discriminate against people
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  based on race, sexuality, or gender.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  First off, this whole Memories Pizza story has been completely mischaracterized
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  amidst the deluge of vitriol and outrage.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  Memories Pizza has never said that they would refuse to serve gay people.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  In fact, the owner said the very opposite that they would be happy to serve gays and lesbians in their restaurant,
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  just that they wouldn't cater for a gay wedding because it conflicts with their beliefs.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  That prompted one high school coach to post a tweet which tried to recruit others to quote,
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  burn down Memories Pizza, another example of peaceful liberal tolerance.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Okay, let's get one thing clear.
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  Any business owner that refuses to serve gay people because it conflicts with their quote religious beliefs
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  clearly deserves to go out of business based off the back of their own stupidity alone.
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  Selling a cake to a gay person is not the same as being forced into having gay sex with them.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  Treat others as you wish to be treated.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  You know, Jesus Christ hung around with prostitutes and criminals,
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  fraternizing or doing business with people who have lifestyles with which you disagree
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  is not the same as condoning those lifestyles.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  So it would be monumentally idiotic for any business to refuse to serve gay people
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  because of the reputation they'd accrue, but also because their reason for doing so makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  But does that then mean that the government should have the right under law to force businesses to serve gay people?
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  If you believe in a concept called individual freedom, the answer is clearly no.
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  No one should have the right to invoke the power of the state to force anyone to provide a good or service.
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  The same goes for forcing people into not providing a good or service.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  This is merely the mirror image of the Jim Crow laws.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  The government gun should not be involved with private voluntary transactions.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  The market itself solves the problem of discrimination.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  You refuse to serve a gay person.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  A hundred other businesses are happy to serve them.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  They get the money, you go out of business.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  There's no need for government involvement.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  What's the bigger danger?
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  Giving the government the power to enforce conduct and behavior at the point of a gun
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  within people's own private property or a tiny, tiny percentage of gays not being served in restaurants.
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  And if anyone, it's gay people that should understand how dangerous it is to give government the power to enforce societal standards.
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  Given that those same powers were once used to oppress them when homosexuality was illegal in the United States,
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  they're essentially saying that the government should have the power to discriminate against religious Christians
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  and force them into behaviors which they don't wish to do.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  How far will this go?
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  Will wedding photographers be labelled intolerant and fined for refusing to work at gay weddings?
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  Will conservative maids who refuse to work in gay households be hit with hate crime charges?
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.000]  Will parents be thrown in jail for not wanting to hire a gay babysitter or a gay private tutor?
[04:32.000 --> 04:42.000]  This is clearly another example of leftist getting irate about a scenario that will never happen on any kind of significant basis.
[04:42.000 --> 04:54.000]  You can see the full report at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, bottom line, the globalists are taking all of our basic rights and then getting us to end fight over a bunch of distractions as if they're the biggest thing in the world.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  Huge news on the Iran nuke deal, Jade Helm, the economy and more.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Straight ahead.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Good brother.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  Well thank you brother, it's because it also funds our operation but doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big amount of money there.
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[07:09.000 --> 07:16.000]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe clean water.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household.

[08:19.000 --> 08:44.000]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen, the third day already of April 2015.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  Coming up in the third hour today, we are going to have open phones.
[09:02.000 --> 09:14.000]  Whenever subject folks wish to discuss, coming up in the second hour, we have Daniel H. Wilson coming on the broadcast.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  New York Times best-selling author of Rogo Robo Apocalypse.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  And of course, this gentleman's book is being turned into a film by Steven Spilsberg.
[09:25.000 --> 09:35.000]  And it ties in with the news we see today in the robotic near future. Most will live off government provided income.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  That's the plan is computers and robots are being designed to displace a world run and designed by humans.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  So the technocrats can control the development or quote evolution in their words of human society.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  So we'll be discussing that.
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  And Nico has just popped in my head, popped in my ear and told me that's why I kind of took a double kick there.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  That's my bad. I put it on the wrong hour.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  Not a big deal. I just for a week he was going to be on the third hour and then open the sheet up and it said the second hour.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  And so that's in the third hour of open phones in the second hour.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  A train wreck of a start of the broadcast of there ever was one.
[10:22.000 --> 10:35.000]  But that said, ladies and gentlemen, we're obviously going to be opening the phones up here today to get into the Iranian nuke deal,
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  which Israel is very upset about.
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  And then Iran is celebrating and saying that Western media is misrepresenting.
[10:44.000 --> 10:51.000]  But with that backdrop, I also want to get into a story that illustrates so much,
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  not just the Second Amendment or the right to self-defense, but also media control and political correctness.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  We have militants, not radical Islamists as terrorists.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  You notice Sky News and others are being politically correct.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  We're told to not call illegal aliens, illegal aliens.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  Then we're supposed to call them migrants, and now we're just supposed to call them citizens.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  Well, now militants kill 147 in Kenya University attack.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  An attack by mass terrorists who stormed a university in eastern Kenya has left at least 147 people dead.
[11:33.000 --> 11:44.000]  Around 80 more have been confirmed as wounded in the siege at the university, which has now ended after four attackers detonated their suicide vest.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  The gunman hurled grenades and fired automatic rifles as students were sleeping,
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  shooting dead dozens before setting Muslims free and holding Christians and others hostage.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  So the university, again, was for Christians and Muslims.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  It was an open university. It was a Christian university overall, and you now see what has happened.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  And there will be no apologies by even the mainline Islamic community.
[12:16.000 --> 12:24.000]  There will be nothing but criticism of how evil the Christians are in Kenya and basically how they deserved it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  And that's what we're seeing in the media.
[12:28.000 --> 12:43.000]  And this very group is Wahhabist al-Qaeda-based, and it's the same group that attacked the shopping mall in Kenya two years ago.
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.000]  And the head of Interpol came out and said that the answer to this problem is concealed carry,
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  like we have in areas of the U.S.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  But of course two years later, that's not been done.
[12:59.000 --> 13:10.000]  Kenya has very strict gun control laws, and of course the terrorists had illegal fully auto and hand grenades that you cannot get even here in the United States.
[13:10.000 --> 13:27.000]  So a victim disarmament zone, again, is used by mad killers to kill non-military individuals in terroristic cold blood.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  And you're not going to hear a word out of the big Christian churches.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  You're not going to hear any solidarity by Christians being persecuted worldwide.
[13:34.000 --> 13:43.000]  You're not going to hear any calls to stop the al-Qaeda, ISIS forces, murdering Christians all over the Middle East or North Africa,
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  all the way down into Nigeria on the west coast of Africa, on the gold coast of Africa.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  And that's because there is an agenda behind all of this.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  I am not what you call an Islamophobe.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  I don't sit up here obsessing over Muslims all day.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  And I went to high school and college and had Muslim friends of you and worked out with, lift weights, played soccer, you name it.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  Most Muslims that were in this country previously did not want to live under the oppression of the Middle East.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  That's why they came here.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  The new waves, though, being brought in from Somalia and other areas are hardcore Islamists,
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  and they hate Christians, and the statistics and the crime numbers show this.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  And they want to radical Islamify the West.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  And already in many countries in Europe, half the births are Muslim.
[14:37.000 --> 14:45.000]  And the radical Muslims, being fun about Saudi Arabia predominantly, are being bullied into radicalizing.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  And so the radical is becoming the new mainstay.
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  The radical is becoming the new status quo.
[14:54.000 --> 15:07.000]  And because it doesn't fit with the narrative of political correctness, you notice it's not a big news story today.
[15:07.000 --> 15:15.000]  Even though CNN has the headline that will the Middle East now be Christian-free as Christians are slaughtered and forced out of every country.
[15:15.000 --> 15:27.000]  And in every case, the United States and the UN and other globalist combines like NATO are directly involved,
[15:27.000 --> 15:39.000]  very, very aggressively, supporting economic and military, cultural and religious policies that destroy Christianity.
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  Even the UN last year had to admit that the amount of Christian persecution had doubled in the last decade,
[15:47.000 --> 15:54.000]  and that Christians were the most persecuted group in the world.
[15:54.000 --> 16:01.000]  And one big reason for that is Christians have been globalized.
[16:01.000 --> 16:07.000]  Christians have gone under the World Council of Churches, they're no longer Christians, at least their leaders aren't,
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  and they won't stand up for themselves, and they've been taught.
[16:12.000 --> 16:19.000]  Romans 13 submit to the government, even though in the West, we the people and the law are the government.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  And so when the government's violating the law, they're violating God's word.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  But see, they've inverted all of that.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[16:31.000 --> 16:42.000]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, no one knows who originally said it because they all said it.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  We've already been conquered. We've killed 55 million babies in this country.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  Our borders are completely wide open.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  We allow the IRS to take people's houses and bank accounts with no charges, no evidence.
[16:54.000 --> 17:03.000]  We have allowed our government to sign us on to half of the global 2.2 quadrillion, 2200 trillion.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  We are a concord nation, and I don't say that to lower morale.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  I say that to admit where we're at.
[17:09.000 --> 17:22.000]  Sometime, you've got a bully sitting on top of you, punching you in the face, and you've got to get angry to get him off of you.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  So do you want the globalist off our backs, or do you want to keep going down this road?
[17:27.000 --> 17:38.000]  Because submitting to it, laying down to it, rolling over to it, bending over to it, kneeling down to it, and licking the boots is only making it worse.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  In fact, when you guys print me, Patrick Henry's, give me liberty or give me death speech.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  I think I'm going to read that on there.
[17:49.000 --> 18:02.000]  But it shows the media control. Can you imagine if a Christian would have gone in a Muslim madrasa or school and killed 147 people and injured over 80?
[18:02.000 --> 18:10.000]  Wounded. It would be on every channel, every newspaper for three months, the evil of Christianity, the hatred.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  What do we do to prove that we're not bad? How do we feel guilty? How do we submit?
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  It would be the end of the world.
[18:18.000 --> 18:27.000]  Can you imagine if a Christian went in a college in the United States and killed 147 secular people?
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  It would be the biggest story of the decade.
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, it is almost nowhere in the news now the attacks in Kenya.
[18:37.000 --> 18:50.000]  And the FBI says that ISIS, same group, same Wahhabist Sunni group, has operatives in all 50 states and is set to attack.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  See, the FBI may not have to go out and find crazy people to wind them up this time.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  Our borders so wide open, they're allowing recruiting by ISIS all over the west.
[19:00.000 --> 19:11.000]  And for young people, ages 12 up to 30 or so, to go back and forth, they're allowing Saudi and other money to fund this.
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  And this is the destabilization force that will be used, that we've warned you of, to bring in the tyranny.
[19:18.000 --> 19:29.000]  And then we'll welcome the military on the streets after we've seen in one day, 20, 30 primary schools hit, colleges hit,
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  shopping malls hit, thousands dead.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  And you watch, logic will be ignored when this happens.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  They'll say the answer is taking our guns and they'll claim that the radical Islamists got the guns at gun shows.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  You can see them right in the script, right now.
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.000]  They let them in, they send them to gun shows to get the weapons, they attack.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  You can see the whole plan being laid out, it's unbelievable.
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  It's a question of not if but when the next shoe drops. I'm Alex Jones.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[20:14.000 --> 20:21.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[20:26.000 --> 20:51.000]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[20:51.000 --> 21:07.000]  It's very easy to be a criminal. All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  A phone line. You shell out 1500 bucks. Get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Simply safe home security is the smarter choice.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  Built by Harvard engineers, simply safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  Scissors can't cut it. And that means your home stays safe.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  Simply safe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  For half the cost, protect your home with the alarm you can trust.

[22:28.000 --> 22:38.000]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve us debt.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  This capitalism was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[22:45.000 --> 22:52.000]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[22:52.000 --> 22:59.000]  It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.

[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  David Knight is going to pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[24:29.000 --> 24:42.000]  One of my children is going to go to a Bible camp.
[24:42.000 --> 24:53.000]  This weekend. And so I want to see her before she goes. I didn't get to see her a lot this morning.
[24:53.000 --> 25:02.000]  So I'm going to have lunch with my children at 12.30. And David Knight is going to come in here and do 30 minutes of the show that I'll interview the author of Robo Apocalypse.
[25:02.000 --> 25:12.000]  I had surgery Wednesday. And I felt great Wednesday. Great yesterday. I kind of feel out of it today. But I still came in.
[25:12.000 --> 25:20.000]  So I seem a little bit dingy. A little bit out of it. That is what's going on. Had hernia surgery went very well. People are surprised I'm here.
[25:20.000 --> 25:28.000]  This is better than sitting around home watching television. I mean, I just don't sit around watching television.
[25:28.000 --> 25:39.000]  This is better than sitting around home watching television. I mean, I just don't sit around and I'd rather just be active and deal with a little bit of pain I have than be inactive than I focus on the pain.
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.000]  So that's why I'm here. Appreciate all of your support out there.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  He's also going to be getting into the Kenya situation and driverless cars and more when he comes in at the bottom of the hour.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  But my children are off school today.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  And so we're going to have lunch.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  I tell you, my head is spinning with the amount of news here to go over.
[26:12.000 --> 26:23.000]  Let's just talk about the facts. Radical Islamists and folks coming in from Saudi Arabia, they don't have to wear.
[26:23.000 --> 26:34.000]  They don't have to take off their burkas and their headdresses when they come through airport security because they quote have religious freedom and they won't put up with it.
[26:34.000 --> 26:45.000]  But American citizens have to take our shoes off our belts off and be treated like slaves and walk through all the athlete's foot and the flesh eating bacteria and the rest of it.
[26:45.000 --> 26:58.000]  Meanwhile, numbers show that the world will be majority Muslim by 2070 Pew studies suggest and with Islam being accelerated in its radicalization.
[26:58.000 --> 27:07.000]  And with Christianity being hin pecked and attacked by the political correct socialist movement, we're in trouble.
[27:07.000 --> 27:17.000]  There's the big comedian, David Cross, who put out a movie that just came out. In fact, I was on Netflix just last week.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  And there it was the first movie that came up as new releases.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  And at the end of the movie, he goes, I love Alex Jones. I hate blacks, Jews and Muslims.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  The film is hits. It didn't much of a hit on IMDB with a 5.6 rating, I'll tell you that.
[27:37.000 --> 27:48.000]  And the movie just ends with the fact that I hate Muslims.
[27:48.000 --> 28:01.000]  And see, what do you have a big, rich liberal socialist like David Cross who has bodyguards but doesn't want us to be harmed?
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  And then he sees it as radical and right wing and not embrace radical Islam.
[28:09.000 --> 28:20.000]  And then you'll never hear David Cross or any of these people criticize radical Islamists, murdering Christians this year and last year by the hundreds of thousands.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  Just type in, UN says Christians, most persecuted group.
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  And then even the UN admits that. Why do so-called liberals hate Christians so much?
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  Unless they're liberal groups that have taken over major denominations of churches like the Methodist Church.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  That here in Austin, the first Methodist Church is a collection agency for the illegals and for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[28:46.000 --> 28:53.000]  And there's the headline. Christians currently, most persecuted religious group in the world, Holy See tells UN.
[28:53.000 --> 29:01.000]  Well, that's the Vatican. The UN report last year admitted that as well.
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.000]  So I'm kind of not really beating a dead horse here today. It's just very upsetting.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  Yep, there's Reuters. About 100 million Christians persecuted around the world report.
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.000]  About 100 million Christians are persecuted around the world with conditions worsening for them most rapidly in Syria and Ethiopia.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  According to an annual report by a group supporting oppressed Christians worldwide.
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.000]  Open doors and other denominational Christian group listed North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan as the three toughest countries for Christians last year.
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  They topped 50 country ranking in 2011 as well.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  We're going to come back and I'm going to reset and get into all this.
[29:40.000 --> 29:47.000]  But the bigger issue is look at how this massacre of Christians isn't even in the news.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  You'd think it never happened because they're Christians.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  Just like veterans.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  The Empire.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  Kill them. Don't give them health care. Nobody cares.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  That's Jones and the GCN.
[29:54.000 --> 30:20.000]  Don owners, veterans, Christians are the enemy. We are the listed enemy.
[30:20.000 --> 30:26.000]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Oxipowder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.000]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.000]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and azanide technology.
[30:50.000 --> 30:56.000]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder.
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  The experts are clear.
[31:01.000 --> 31:08.000]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  But I go further with Supernation Iodine X2 from infowarsline.com.
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  Fifty percent stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula,
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[31:23.000 --> 31:28.000]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[40:03.000 --> 40:08.500]  Well, Kenya is a gun-free country, and now their government's calling for more police.
[40:08.500 --> 40:13.460]  No, the answer is not more police, unless it was police training citizens how to use
[40:13.460 --> 40:17.380]  guns and creating a posse.
[40:17.380 --> 40:19.660]  That's all that is, is civil defense, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:19.660 --> 40:23.500]  If you don't trust the pilots to fly the planes and the good citizens with no criminal record
[40:23.500 --> 40:27.260]  to own guns, then you don't have a country.
[40:27.260 --> 40:29.300]  Then you turn everything loose to criminals.
[40:29.300 --> 40:35.500]  Now, I want to get into the Iran situation now.
[40:35.500 --> 40:37.020]  I've been trying to read over the agreement.
[40:37.020 --> 40:43.300]  It looks like it's got a bunch of gray areas, and quite frankly, it is a victory for Iran.
[40:43.300 --> 40:47.900]  It will allow them to develop peaceful reactors.
[40:47.900 --> 40:51.740]  It will allow them to develop the old refineries that need to become energy-sufficient.
[40:51.740 --> 40:55.660]  If Iran doesn't go the way of war, this will allow them to become a first-world nation.
[40:55.660 --> 40:57.740]  The globalists don't want that.
[40:57.740 --> 41:03.300]  So I don't know why they've done this deal.
[41:03.300 --> 41:10.580]  I talked to the owner of a security company in Los Angeles, who's a former highly-decorated
[41:10.580 --> 41:15.140]  Israeli commando this weekend when I was out in Los Angeles, and he agreed with me that
[41:15.140 --> 41:20.420]  this is all a bait and switch, some type of screw job, and that the Israeli government
[41:20.420 --> 41:26.100]  is in on it with the U.S. and Iran, and that it's more sophisticated than we're being told.
[41:26.100 --> 41:30.860]  Don't forget, Israel was involved in Iran-Contra doing backroom deals with Iran while acting
[41:30.860 --> 41:36.220]  like they were their enemy in 1980, so we don't know what's really going on.
[41:36.220 --> 41:43.180]  And quite frankly, this is so foggy, I don't know what to make of it.
[41:43.180 --> 41:51.140]  But joyful Iranians dance into the night after nuclear breakthrough, AFP, Iran, World Powers
[41:51.140 --> 41:56.620]  reached initial deal on reigning in Tehran's nuclear program, it will put cameras in the
[41:56.620 --> 42:02.860]  reactors and inspectors, Obama, tentative Iran nuclear deal, best option for Israel.
[42:02.860 --> 42:03.860]  Here's the deal.
[42:03.860 --> 42:10.740]  Pakistan, it's well-known a decade ago, transferred nukes to Saudi Arabia, and Iran reportedly
[42:10.740 --> 42:17.820]  has been getting what it needs from Russia, and so that's why it's kind of a stalemate.
[42:17.820 --> 42:22.020]  Russia says tentative Iran nuclear deal, best option for Israel.
[42:22.020 --> 42:26.020]  You know what, Obama, here's the deal, I'm not against Israel, but I'm sick of hearing
[42:26.020 --> 42:27.740]  about Israel interest.
[42:27.740 --> 42:34.060]  How about what's best for U.S. national security?
[42:34.060 --> 42:35.820]  How about you be the president of the U.S.?
[42:35.820 --> 42:38.580]  No, you're a globalist, selling the country out.
[42:38.580 --> 42:42.380]  And this whole Iran thing's a distraction, all our borders are wide open, and our economy
[42:42.380 --> 42:45.380]  goes into free fall, we'll get to that in a moment.
[42:45.380 --> 42:49.220]  Israel actually has a pretty good article, the gray areas of the Iran deal, how a pre-dawn
[42:49.220 --> 42:54.020]  meeting in Switzerland produced one of Iran's deals, has many fuzzy areas, yeah, it's like
[42:54.020 --> 42:55.020]  Obamacare.
[42:55.020 --> 43:00.220]  It's a blank check for both sides that just kind of kicked the can down the road.
[43:00.220 --> 43:05.740]  Netanyahu sends a very blunt message to Obama following an announcement on Iran deal.
[43:05.740 --> 43:10.460]  Israel's prime minister Netanyahu sent a very blunt message to Obama today following an
[43:10.460 --> 43:16.260]  announcement of a tentative deal with Iran aimed at curbing the Islamic Republic's nuclear
[43:16.260 --> 43:17.260]  program.
[43:17.260 --> 43:22.140]  We're going to get to what he had to say in a moment, first, here's an excerpt of Obama's
[43:22.140 --> 43:24.780]  speech as posted at USA Today.
[43:24.780 --> 43:25.780]  Here it is.
[43:25.780 --> 43:32.820]  Today, the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached a historic
[43:32.820 --> 43:39.940]  understanding with Iran, which if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
[43:39.940 --> 43:43.780]  This has been a long time coming.
[43:43.780 --> 43:48.620]  The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades.
[43:48.620 --> 43:55.900]  Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework
[43:55.900 --> 43:58.100]  for that deal.
[43:58.100 --> 44:02.780]  And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.
[44:02.780 --> 44:04.180]  So is Obamacare?
[44:04.180 --> 44:08.500]  This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear
[44:08.500 --> 44:10.540]  weapon.
[44:10.540 --> 44:13.180]  So this deal is not based on trust.
[44:13.180 --> 44:18.700]  It's based on unprecedented verification.
[44:18.700 --> 44:22.060]  Many key details will be finalized over the next three months.
[44:22.060 --> 44:24.140]  And nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.
[44:24.140 --> 44:25.820]  Yeah, it's kind of like the FCC deal.
[44:25.820 --> 44:26.820]  You can't see it.
[44:26.820 --> 44:32.180]  But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize.
[44:32.180 --> 44:38.140]  First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium because it will not develop
[44:38.140 --> 44:40.900]  weapons-grade plutonium.
[44:40.900 --> 44:45.500]  The core of its reactor at Iraq will be dismantled and replaced.
[44:45.500 --> 44:51.620]  The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor.
[44:51.620 --> 44:55.300]  Iran will not build a new heavy-water reactor.
[44:55.300 --> 44:59.780]  And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors.
[44:59.780 --> 45:01.260]  Ever.
[45:01.260 --> 45:08.620]  Second, this deal shuts down Iran's path to a bomb using enriched uranium.
[45:08.620 --> 45:12.820]  Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds.
[45:12.820 --> 45:14.780]  All right, let's go.
[45:14.780 --> 45:16.220]  That's enough of Obama.
[45:16.220 --> 45:18.420]  Again, all of this is moot.
[45:18.420 --> 45:23.020]  Iran's got nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia and so does South Africa and so many countries.
[45:23.020 --> 45:26.540]  Israel just finally admitted last week they've got nukes, as if I needed Israel to admit
[45:26.540 --> 45:27.540]  that.
[45:27.540 --> 45:33.860]  And Kurt Nemo has his perspective on it at infowars.com, the hypocrisy behind the Iran
[45:33.860 --> 45:39.860]  nuclear agreement, few mentioned U.S. use of nukes, on civilians, talking about DU, and
[45:39.860 --> 45:42.060]  Israel's stockpile of bombs.
[45:42.060 --> 45:47.860]  Yeah, Israel's not part of the UN Weapons Convention, and again, I'm not even bashing
[45:47.860 --> 45:52.500]  Israel, but it's hypocritical to say that Israel doesn't have to follow any of these
[45:52.500 --> 45:54.900]  treaties or rules, but Iran does.
[45:54.900 --> 46:00.140]  And this sets the precedent under globalism where the UN controls sovereign countries,
[46:00.140 --> 46:06.180]  and now you notice under UN rules they're trying to ban stoves and outside fireplaces
[46:06.180 --> 46:08.180]  and barbecue pits.
[46:08.180 --> 46:12.500]  I mean, that's now happening in California.
[46:12.500 --> 46:17.140]  So they're trying to regulate local barbecue trailers here in Austin, Alex.
[46:17.140 --> 46:18.140]  I was not aware of that.
[46:18.140 --> 46:19.140]  Yeah.
[46:19.140 --> 46:20.140]  Yeah.
[46:20.140 --> 46:21.140]  You're kidding.
[46:21.140 --> 46:22.140]  No, I'm not kidding.
[46:22.140 --> 46:23.140]  There's some trailers out in Barton Springs.
[46:23.140 --> 46:24.140]  There's a couple on the east side.
[46:24.140 --> 46:26.860]  The hook is driving residents crazy when they open their windows.
[46:26.860 --> 46:27.860]  Yeah.
[46:27.860 --> 46:32.540]  So just normal human activity, shut down all human activity, but let GMO take place, all
[46:32.540 --> 46:33.540]  of it.
[46:33.540 --> 46:36.700]  Let, you know, Tim trailing go on is just insane.
[46:36.700 --> 46:42.060]  Let's go to Iran's foreign minister, Javed Zarif, on the so-called framework.
[46:42.060 --> 46:43.060]  Here it is.
[46:43.060 --> 46:46.580]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:46.580 --> 46:51.100]  Let me again thank you all for having followed our work.
[46:51.100 --> 46:54.940]  We've done significant work.
[46:54.940 --> 47:05.340]  If we look back at recent history and if we succeed, we've taken a major step.
[47:05.340 --> 47:11.500]  But we're still sometime away from reaching where we want to be.
[47:11.500 --> 47:13.900]  That's not to say no deals are made.
[47:13.900 --> 47:19.620]  This would be one of the few cases where an issue is resolved through diplomatic means.
[47:19.620 --> 47:22.340]  No, it's been a proxy war in Syria.
[47:22.340 --> 47:31.460]  And that would require an approach that would concentrate on a non-zero sum outcome, a win-win
[47:31.460 --> 47:32.460]  outcome.
[47:32.460 --> 47:37.580]  And that was my country's approach to this from the very beginning.
[47:37.580 --> 47:41.220]  We appreciate the work that every delegation has put to this.
[47:41.220 --> 47:43.620]  We have done significant work.
[47:43.620 --> 47:45.620]  We have made achievements.
[47:45.620 --> 47:47.140]  We have made progress.
[47:47.140 --> 47:55.500]  We have decided to take steps for a period of time to assure anybody who had concern,
[47:55.500 --> 48:01.700]  which we thought those concerns were misplaced anyway, that our program is exclusively peaceful,
[48:01.700 --> 48:04.860]  has always been and will always remain exclusively peaceful.
[48:04.860 --> 48:05.860]  All right.
[48:05.860 --> 48:09.820]  Let's go to Benjamin Netanyahu, the newly re-elected prime minister of Israel.
[48:09.820 --> 48:11.660]  Let's get his take on it.
[48:11.660 --> 48:18.500]  The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran, would not destroy a single
[48:18.500 --> 48:25.780]  centrifuge in Iran, and will not stop R&D on Iran's advanced centrifuges.
[48:25.780 --> 48:32.460]  On the contrary, the deal would legitimize Iran's illegal nuclear program.
[48:32.460 --> 48:36.420]  It would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure.
[48:36.420 --> 48:40.540]  A vast nuclear infrastructure remains in place.
[48:40.540 --> 48:45.860]  The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately, and this at the very time that Iran is stepping
[48:45.860 --> 48:50.460]  up its aggression and terror in the region and beyond the region.
[48:50.460 --> 48:57.540]  In a few years, the deal would remove the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, enabling
[48:57.540 --> 49:03.340]  Iran to have a massive enrichment capacity that it could use to produce many nuclear
[49:03.340 --> 49:06.980]  bombs within a matter of months.
[49:06.980 --> 49:12.780]  Such a deal does not block Iran's path through the bomb, such a deal paves Iran's path through
[49:12.780 --> 49:13.780]  the bomb.
[49:13.780 --> 49:14.780]  All right.
[49:14.780 --> 49:15.780]  Here's what's really going on, folks.
[49:15.780 --> 49:20.020]  There's a proxy war between Shiites and Sunnis.
[49:20.020 --> 49:27.620]  The West is allied with the most radical, largest group, the Saudi Arabian jihadi al-Qaeda
[49:27.620 --> 49:39.100]  types, ISIS group that just attacked the Kenyan University, and the West has been trying to
[49:39.100 --> 49:43.980]  take Iran down, and they fail, and they fail because Russia backed them, and our own military
[49:43.980 --> 49:46.340]  would not back al-Qaeda against Syria.
[49:46.340 --> 49:51.660]  So now Saudi Arabia has gone crazy and launched attacks all over against Shiite areas.
[49:51.660 --> 49:53.900]  So the Shiites are striking back.
[49:53.900 --> 49:58.300]  Now Chinese troops, I forgot this, have landed in the Middle East.
[49:58.300 --> 50:01.660]  I mean, I'm going to be getting to that after the break.
[50:01.660 --> 50:11.060]  You cannot make up how crazy all of this has gotten.
[50:11.060 --> 50:12.700]  You cannot make it up.
[50:12.700 --> 50:16.420]  In fact, I'm having trouble finding my Chinese troops story.
[50:16.420 --> 50:19.300]  Maybe you guys can – it's on screen.
[50:19.300 --> 50:20.300]  There it is.
[50:20.300 --> 50:26.300]  That's from chaos in Yemen, Chinese troops arrive as U.S. armed rebels set sights on
[50:26.300 --> 50:29.020]  Central Bank.
[50:29.020 --> 50:31.020]  Print me that article.
[50:31.020 --> 50:32.020]  Thank you.
[50:32.020 --> 50:34.860]  I mean, we're entering Twilight Zoneville here.
[50:34.860 --> 50:42.220]  The whole world is accelerating into confrontation, and so the West wants sanctions on Iran to
[50:42.220 --> 50:48.260]  try to cripple Hezbollah running guerrilla warfare operations in the Middle East against
[50:48.260 --> 50:49.780]  the Saudi Arabian takeover.
[50:49.780 --> 50:52.300]  Does that mean the Iran's the good guys?
[50:52.300 --> 50:53.300]  No.
[50:53.300 --> 50:57.100]  But they are the underdog, and they're not the ones launching the terror attacks, okay?
[50:57.100 --> 50:59.100]  It's Saudi Arabia.
[50:59.100 --> 51:03.220]  This hour of GCN, brought to you by Lysik.

[51:17.420 --> 51:22.220]  Is it time to convert paper 401Ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[51:25.020 --> 51:26.020]  That's 800-686-2237.
[51:26.020 --> 51:27.020]  It's happening again.
[51:27.020 --> 51:35.020]  The feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[51:35.020 --> 51:40.780]  In January, a newly introduced bill, HR 378, will take away your right to buy level three
[51:40.780 --> 51:42.540]  in a higher body armor.
[51:42.540 --> 51:48.340]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level three body armor packages on the market today.
[51:48.340 --> 51:49.340]  Protect yourself.

[51:52.060 --> 51:56.260]  Go to katiearmor.com and catiearmor.com.
[51:56.260 --> 51:59.500]  Come and take it.
[51:59.500 --> 52:00.500]  Hi, folks.
[52:00.500 --> 52:02.260]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[52:02.260 --> 52:07.700]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[52:07.700 --> 52:11.060]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[52:11.060 --> 52:15.020]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[52:15.020 --> 52:16.020]  buck.
[52:16.020 --> 52:20.140]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:20.140 --> 52:24.140]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:24.140 --> 52:29.420]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[52:29.420 --> 52:30.420]  and women.
[52:30.420 --> 52:33.300]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[52:33.300 --> 52:38.620]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot with high quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[52:38.620 --> 52:43.820]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food
[52:43.820 --> 52:50.220]  storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[52:50.220 --> 52:53.300]  That's 866-229-0927.
[52:53.300 --> 52:55.940]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[52:55.940 --> 52:59.100]  MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[52:59.100 --> 53:03.660]  By now, you've heard about bitcoins, but did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept
[53:03.660 --> 53:04.660]  bitcoins?
[53:04.660 --> 53:08.380]  Listen, if you're already earning bitcoins or trying to make money in the bitcoin market,
[53:08.380 --> 53:14.740]  you've got to know bitbit.co because at bitbit.co, you can receive bitcoin by selling your personal
[53:14.740 --> 53:16.500]  items or business products.
[53:16.500 --> 53:21.260]  You heard right, whether personal or business, you can now buy, sell and auction your products
[53:21.260 --> 53:24.780]  quickly, easily and securely at bitbit.co.
[53:24.780 --> 53:28.580]  That's B-I-D, B-I-T.co, bitbit.co.
[53:28.580 --> 53:31.980]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the
[53:31.980 --> 53:35.860]  astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented one silver solution.
[53:35.860 --> 53:40.180]  Boost your immune system at a great price with our SilverSolution Liquid in regular and
[53:40.180 --> 53:41.180]  extra strength.

[53:55.540 --> 54:18.900]  There is only one silver solution.
[54:18.900 --> 54:24.420]  Victim, Cuban victim of Fidel Castro's roundups is horrified by Jade Helm in the footage that
[54:24.420 --> 54:28.100]  he's seen on the news at the military practicing to round up Floridians.
[54:28.100 --> 54:29.100]  That's up on infowars.com.
[54:29.100 --> 54:31.540]  We're going to be breaking that down in the next hour.
[54:31.540 --> 54:38.220]  Army is seeking crisis actors for Ohio military drill in June ahead of Jade Helm.
[54:38.220 --> 54:40.460]  That's out of investment watch.
[54:40.460 --> 54:47.860]  Opportunity begins May 19th to the 15th and runs for up to five years to be part of these
[54:47.860 --> 54:51.900]  crises they want to play out.
[54:51.900 --> 54:53.540]  Isn't that just interesting?
[54:53.540 --> 54:59.380]  You can see the video at infowars.com and prismplanet.com, the video report that breaks
[54:59.380 --> 55:01.620]  all of that down.
[55:01.620 --> 55:08.220]  Again, the Chinese troops reportedly are there evacuating Chinese citizens in infrastructure
[55:08.220 --> 55:13.780]  and are being fired on at the port of Aden in Yemen.
[55:13.780 --> 55:19.060]  That according to the London Guardian NRT, that's boiled down in a detailed article at
[55:19.060 --> 55:22.820]  Zero Hedge, and we have it posted in full at infowars.com.
[55:22.820 --> 55:28.100]  Yemen, fighters cease presidential palace in battle for Aden.
[55:28.100 --> 55:31.940]  This is the destabilization program spiraling out of control.
[55:31.940 --> 55:38.380]  So the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, gets up there and says, we're coming to this
[55:38.380 --> 55:39.380]  agreement peacefully.
[55:39.380 --> 55:40.380]  No, they're not.
[55:40.380 --> 55:49.100]  There's a huge proxy war going on, and the Shiites in many areas are beating the al-Qaida
[55:49.100 --> 55:55.100]  forces because their organized military units, the al-Qaida forces are a bunch of rich kids
[55:55.100 --> 56:01.620]  and punks from the west funded by Saudi Arabia to just run around and rape and kill.
[56:01.620 --> 56:04.780]  And I'm not lionizing the Iranians either.
[56:04.780 --> 56:08.660]  It's just a fact that their military units and these other people aren't.
[56:08.660 --> 56:13.220]  I'll tell you this though, the Iranians are not cutting any Christians heads off and aren't
[56:13.220 --> 56:18.140]  blowing up churches, and they don't do it in Iran either.
[56:18.140 --> 56:24.580]  And the Shiite run, Alawite minority run, coalition government of Syria doesn't persecute Christians
[56:24.580 --> 56:25.580]  either.
[56:25.580 --> 56:30.460]  So remember, our government's backing the folks that chop Christians heads off, and our
[56:30.460 --> 56:37.100]  media won't report on 147 dead Christians.
[56:37.100 --> 56:42.100]  You'd think it was a minor story about a Cessna crashing in Kenya, it had got more attention
[56:42.100 --> 56:43.100]  than this.
[56:43.100 --> 56:48.980]  There'd been a fire and two kids died and you'd be hearing more about it.
[56:48.980 --> 56:53.140]  That's because Christians don't count, veterans don't count, gun owners don't count, because
[56:53.140 --> 57:00.300]  we're not compatible with the new socialist world government.
[57:00.300 --> 57:02.380]  Christians are being persecuted this Easter.
[57:02.380 --> 57:03.380]  Remember that.
[57:03.380 --> 57:06.300]  And ask your church, when you go to it, where you're going to get some government delivered
[57:06.300 --> 57:12.620]  sermon about opening the borders up and being loving or turning your guns in.
[57:12.620 --> 57:17.060]  It's exhausting that people put up with this.
[57:17.060 --> 57:18.420]  The economy's falling apart.
[57:18.420 --> 57:19.420]  We've already known this.
[57:19.420 --> 57:21.380]  They've been covering it up, but now the job numbers are in.
[57:21.380 --> 57:23.020]  We'll talk about that in the next hour.
[57:23.020 --> 57:32.340]  Before we go any further, briefly, your purchases of the high quality water filters, books, videos,
[57:32.340 --> 57:38.580]  Patriot apparel, everything from Molan Lave's shirts to belt buckles, and infowarstore.com
[57:38.580 --> 57:40.020]  funds our operation.
[57:40.020 --> 57:41.020]  And we're going to have free shipping.
[57:41.020 --> 57:46.660]  It was going to end today, but I'm going to extend it through Easter.
[57:46.660 --> 57:50.060]  It will end Monday morning, and put that in the computer, folks.
[57:50.060 --> 57:53.100]  We're going to put that in our shopping cart.
[57:53.100 --> 57:56.420]  It will end at midnight Sunday.
[57:56.420 --> 57:57.420]  That's it.
[57:57.420 --> 57:58.420]  That is when it cuts off.
[57:58.420 --> 58:00.220]  And the specials, a lot of the specials are over.
[58:00.220 --> 58:01.220]  This is the new special.
[58:01.220 --> 58:03.780]  It's going for another two and a half days.
[58:03.780 --> 58:11.900]  That's it, folks.
[58:11.900 --> 58:16.080]  The new special.
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.380]  It's going to cut off the entire day.
[58:20.380 --> 58:23.740]  I'm going to put that in the computer.
[58:23.740 --> 58:24.740]  That's it.
[58:24.740 --> 58:25.740]  That's it.
[58:25.740 --> 58:26.740]  That's it.
[58:26.740 --> 58:27.740]  That's it.
[58:27.740 --> 58:28.740]  That's it.
[58:28.740 --> 58:29.740]  That's it.
[58:29.740 --> 58:31.240]  That's it.
[58:31.240 --> 58:32.240]  That's it.

[59:48.560 --> 59:55.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:13.200]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:22.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.520]  The author of Robo Apocalypse is joining us in the next hour. David Knight is going to come in
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.040]  and host for 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour with analysis on the Kenya situation
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.880]  and a preview of Robo Apocalypse. I'll be back in the third hour. Apple co-founder on artificial
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.200]  intelligence. We mentioned this last week. The future is scary and very bad for people.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.640]  That dovetails with this new article. In the robotic near future, most will live off government
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.360]  provided income. That's the plan to domesticate us. In fact, you guys print me, Bill Joyce,
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.720]  why the future doesn't need us. Thank you. We're going to look at the real crises we're facing.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.440]  Also, how many people love to migrate out of California when all the water disappears?
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:13.280]  There's a video on infowars.com of folks going into a Muslim bakery and them making cakes for
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.800]  gay folks. You know, we need to do that and show a Muslim bakery, refuse it,
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.600]  and then watch. There'll be no media coverage because it's only Christians that have to be
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.760]  attacked and have to be demonized and have to be gone after an act like we're not tolerant
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:35.360]  when it was Christians that ended slavery worldwide. It was Christians that ended up
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.960]  sending gunboats around the world to end slavery. It was first ended in the West and then ended all
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.720]  over the world. In fact, let's just give credit. Spain was the first country to start abolishing
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.440]  slavery. It's got to be 600 years ago and then it spread from there.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:59.360]  But again, I'm almost cursed by knowing history. You'd think slavery started in the West. It's
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.680]  just unbelievable, but that's how they get us to all in-flight with each other. Also,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.240]  deadly bird flu shows up in South Dakota, 5th Minnesota farm,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.600]  potent shatter marijuana showing up in Lancaster County.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:24.400]  The marijuana concentrates six times stronger than the average bud was among drugs seized in
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.480]  March from the home of Samuel Shulbaker. He's behind bars charged with drug dealing.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.560]  You know, here's the deal. I'm against the drug war, but it doesn't mean I endorse drugs.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.880]  The drug war is a fraud. Acetophoresis is a fraud. We have more drugs on the street because
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.520]  the drug war. But the way to attack the drug war is to point out that governments and major
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.440]  banks are laundering the money and that we have a bigger prison population than ever,
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:58.080]  not by endorsing the drug culture. I have experimented with marijuana when I was in
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.680]  high school and college and it made me sleepy. I didn't particularly like it.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.280]  William Elson will now launch his own brand of weed chain of marijuana stores in the U.S.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.360]  That's a good business move. I have sat right there in his bus at that table
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.680]  on screen of your TV viewer and, well, frankly, I mean, when you're in Rome,
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.200]  you got to do it. I smoke pot with Willie. But again, I do it like a cop goes out and
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.000]  smokes marijuana just to see how strong it is. I don't like it. Makes me paranoid.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:39.040]  Wow, figure that. But I want to see what it's like. And I recently tested some at a pool party
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.440]  that was being vaped and I took two hits off of it and really felt it. So here's my issue.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.480]  Folks, it will end up making you live in your mother's basement for most people.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.120]  An artist like Willie Nelson, you know, he can operate, probably helped him not have a heart
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.920]  attack by now. You know, look, he's 81 years old or whatever it is that holds Willie now.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.560]  The point is, is that
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.400]  it has some benefits. It has some problems like red wine. He is 81. He is 81.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:14.800]  One glass of wine a day is probably good for you. But 10 glasses of wine will give you liver cancer.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.840]  So again, I've been involved in the movement before it was so popular for 20 years to decriminalize
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.440]  drugs. But that doesn't mean we should then go to the extreme of promoting the culture
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.520]  and saying it's good because overall, marijuana is damaging a lot of people and ruining a lot
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.720]  of lives and turning people into vegetables. And that's why George Soros pushes it. And the
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:44.400]  marijuana today is I got to say probably 10 times stronger on average than what I experimented with.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.200]  And I've got an incredible tolerance, folks, and it knocks me in the ground.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.760]  So I want to warn young people out there, if you can do it, it's best to never even test drugs.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.880]  I know you want to experiment. I've done it for you. You don't want to do it.

[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.720]  become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.480]  scientific discoveries. During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial

[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:34.800]  network ladies and gentlemen. I've talked a lot about doing this on air. I did a few years
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:42.000]  ago but I just want to air the audio from the colonial Williamsburg historical society. Give
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.320]  me liberty or give me death. That Patrick Henry basically wrote in a letter but also gave in
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:09:00.640]  speeches at the Virginia convention on March 20th 1775 inland and Richmond. Which is now called
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:09.200]  St. John's church because when you look at the parallels of what Patrick Henry famously said
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.160]  crouched down and lick the hand that feeds you we've now reached this point of total tyrannical
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.880]  takeover of every basic freedom. There's an article on info wars.com left us attempt to
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:30.480]  shut down fundraising for memories pizza. Remember they tried to shut down Chick-fil-A for being closed
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:38.720]  on Sunday. They tried to shut down Hobby Lobby for being Christian and not promoting abortion.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.560]  This is totalitarianism. This is not tolerance. You have a right to not patronize a pizza place
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.960]  that doesn't want to cater to your event. I think it's stupid to not as a business just
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.160]  I wouldn't ask what color you are or what do you have sex with when you come in to get a pizza if
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:06.720]  I had a pizza place but at the same time people have that right to do that and they certainly
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.520]  don't have the right to then go and try to shut down fundraising. You know Google stores six years
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.000]  ago we started a Google shopping cart they'd even approached us about it. They're always
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.760]  soliciting us for different services and we put up my films on their shopping cart and then they
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.760]  said we're removing your shopping cart. Obama deception is racist. No judge no jury. There's
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:36.160]  not one word of racism but even if it was racist shouldn't I be able to sell mine comp? Even if
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.720]  you don't agree with Hitler you should want to read the book written by Adolf Hitler the guy
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.400]  that was one of the most important people of 20th century. I mean I've read a book written by Julius
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:55.120]  Caesar a compendium of his letters to the Senate the battle for Gaul. Does that mean I endorse Julius
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:03.600]  Caesar? When I bought mine comp when I was 16 years old at the bookstore at the mall the woman
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:12.640]  freaked out and began hyperventilating. It had Hitler on the cover and it said mine comp my struggle
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.400]  and and and she was looking and I said she was looking at me very angrily being politically
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.000]  correct feeling holy feeling like a Pharisee and I said why don't you sell this book then she was
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.200]  excuse me she went I just want to read what Hitler actually said that doesn't mean I endorse Hitler
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:39.760]  she went oh really I just it's it's it's scary. No what's scary is your ignorance that's what's
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:48.320]  scary that's what's scary see that's political correctness reading what a Iranian Mula said
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.920]  because I've read you put on government lists for just going to Iranian websites
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.000]  well the government goes to Iranian websites see what they're saying we need to have an
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.360]  open debate this is about chilling debate. Last week they announced major universities
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.560]  you've got to get pre-authorization in California to even have a speech or handout literature
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.320]  you've got to get your speeches pre-approved that is North Korea folks
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.080]  so we're not going into a police state we're not going into a mine tyranny we're in one
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.280]  so let's air
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.600]  Richard Schumann interprets the character of Patrick Henry for the Colonial Williamsburg
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.800]  Foundation listen as he recreates Patrick Henry's powerful words spoken March 23rd,
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:43.520]  1775 at St. John's Horatio Parish Church in Richmond let's play this then I'll get into
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.920]  the rest of the news we've not gotten to yet on the economy front record a number of Americans
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.360]  not working very seriously bad numbers coming in which we've known are there remember these are
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.240]  whitewash numbers as well but here is give me liberty or give me death it is in vain to
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:11.440]  extenuate the matter gentlemen may cry peace peace but there is no peace the war is actually begun
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.520]  the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:26.800]  our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentleman wish
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:36.880]  what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:46.080]  and slavery forbid it almighty god I know not what course others may take but as for me
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:55.280]  give me liberty or give me death now let me that's the end of it let me read from the beginning
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.720]  mr president no man thinks more highly than I do a patriotism as well as abilities of the very
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.360]  worthy gentlemen who have addressed the house but different men often see the same object in
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.280]  different lights and therefore I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.680]  entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs I shall speak forth
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.720]  my sentiments freely and without reserve I was because back then if you insulted one they could
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.720]  legally demand you fight to the death with them she had to be very polite this is no time for
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:37.200]  ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part I
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.240]  consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.400]  magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.240]  hope to arrive at truth see trying to shut down debate now folks and fulfill the great responsibility
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:01.200]  which we hold to God and our country should I keep back my opinions at this time through fear of
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:07.120]  giving offense I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and the fact of
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:14.640]  disloyalty towards the majesty of heaven which I revere above all earthly kings mr president
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.160]  it is natural to man being the president of the of the senate it is natural to man to indulge in
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:28.400]  the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against the painful truth and listen to the song
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.840]  of the siren that till she transforms us into beast which america's been transformed into
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:42.960]  servile dumb beast sheep continuing it is this part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:49.200]  struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes not see having
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:56.160]  ears here not the things which so nearly concern the temporal salvation for my part whoever anguish
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:04.400]  of spirit it may cost I am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.560]  absolutely this is where my heart stands I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that

[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:47.760]  a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.800]  going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and i love it visit info wars life
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:58.400]  dot com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from info wars life
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:13.920]  i got a star on my car and one on my chest a gun from the info wars dot com studios
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:20.480]  it's alex jones so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way if you break the
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:27.360]  door i'm going to be your host for the next half hour alex has got a daughter that's going to be
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.360]  going away to camp this weekend you want to spend a few minutes with her for lunch so i'm going to
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.560]  be doing this next half hour of course in the next hour we have the author of robo apocalypse
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.600]  coming on if you're not familiar with that novel i'm going to kind of give you some things that
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.480]  are happening right now that really very clearly tie into this course a basic premise of robo
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:53.120]  apocalypse and it's told with a series of vignettes about the individuals uh in different places
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:56.560]  different things that happen to them it gradually pulls that together in retrospect
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.240]  and it's very interesting because it's a kind of machines rise and take over humanity attack
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.480]  humanity but it's done in a different way than the terminator as the machine becomes
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.800]  self-aware and malevolent towards mankind what it does is it starts activating all these automated
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:20.240]  systems it's kind of a cautionary tale about how passive we become but it's also a cautionary
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:26.160]  tale about centralized control the way i see it and of course in robo apocalypse one of the key
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:32.800]  weapons that the system uses is not a new army of high-tech robots that look like humans or whatever
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.400]  walk on two legs no it's using things like automobiles for the most part they do have some robots
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:46.320]  that are servants that have been set there to help people but that also uses cars to attack people
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:53.840]  it uses cars to patrol the streets as we look at this driverless future that they're trying to
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.280]  present to us and it is coming on let me tell you much much faster than you probably realize
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.800]  this is something that has been building for quite a long time and we've just had a car that
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:13.440]  went from san francisco to new york now this is reported in a wired magazine as well as
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.200]  abc news other outlets have this nine days it took it to go from san francisco to new york city
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:26.240]  went through 15 states 3400 miles made history it drove 99 percent of the time on its own and this
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.840]  is a vehicle that was done by delphi this is a company that makes subsystems for a lot of
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.720]  different car manufacturers and they said the and reporting about it in wired magazine they said of
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.880]  course the interesting thing is that this isn't some special technology that just this company
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.360]  has they said there's a lot of companies that could do this outie mercedes google could all
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.760]  make this journey as a matter of fact tesla is going to have in just a couple months i think it's
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.080]  about a month ago he said in 90 days they were going to combine the navigation software and
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.360]  their computers with the subsystems that control things like cruise control steering they've already
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.280]  had with mercedes and other cars they've had for a long time they've been building up to these
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.840]  subcomponents making sure that you don't drift across the lane so they recognize where the
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.680]  lane markers are they have forward and rear-facing radar so they can tell if you're closing in too
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.520]  quickly on a car in front or in back of you so these are the beginning steps these are individual
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.720]  systems they can tie all these together tie it together with the navigation of course we needed
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:31.440]  to understand that it was just in the last week that we saw a couple in chicago drive off of a
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:38.160]  bridge because they were following the computer's instructions not paying attention to the physical
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:43.600]  warning signs the multiple the barriers that have been erected the signs that said road closed bridge
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:49.840]  out no they passed through all of the real stuff and they lived in this virtual reality the wife
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.800]  died the husband is in serious condition but they point out in this article and i've i've pointed
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:00.960]  this out before on the news that the very first DARPA grand challenge and of course DARPA is the
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.040]  the real dark technology the secretive technology the high technology
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.960]  branch of the defense department the defense advanced research projects i think is part of
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.560]  the acronym i just think of them as dark technology because the stuff that they're coming up with is
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:24.000]  absolutely horrendous and is really moving the edge of lethality far beyond what's necessary
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.520]  i mean they're not responding to threats they're creating threats and of course that technology
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.880]  is going to be stolen it's going to be copied it's going to be imitated by others so we're
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.720]  going to have to live with that technology that they're creating the kind of killer robots that
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.080]  DARPA is doing and of course it was last year that they culminated in this robot test now of
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.680]  course they were put it out there is this is going to be a robot that's going to help us in case we
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.760]  have some kind of a Fukushima event we can't send workers in we can send these robots in so we
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.920]  they need to be able to walk on two legs navigate things that are in their path be able to turn
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.080]  off different aspects manipulate things with their hands so they'd set up some parameters
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.480]  there for that contest but of course if you've seen these robots and you understand that DARPA's
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:11.360]  mission is not about nuclear safety it is about military weapons when you look at those two things
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.480]  it's very disconcerting to me as an engineer to see what they're going to and of course
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  all those promising technology companies in that contest all the promising robotics technology
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.560]  companies that were in the DARPA robotics challenge those were all bought by google if they had any
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.320]  good technology google bottom it was like three or four or five companies that they bought of course
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.080]  they went on a purchasing bench with artificial intelligence as well at google now they point
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.560]  out however though that the very first DARPA challenge think about this 11 years ago the very
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.640]  first DARPA grand challenge was not a robot it was an artificial intelligence it was an autonomous
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.160]  car they say in this wired article just 11 years ago the 2004 DARPA grand challenge the most advanced
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:01.280]  autonomous vehicles of the day attempted to complete a 150 mile course the best any of them could do
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:08.800]  was 7.32 miles and that vehicle got stuck and caught fire the next year five vehicles completed
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:16.240]  the 132 mile course but took seven hours to do it so they're making very very rapid progress
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:21.040]  and they're making such rapid progress that it was just last spring what about march or april there
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.960]  were uh drudge covered the reports of it there were massive changes in laws in both the united
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.200]  states and europe to allow them to put these cars on the road they wouldn't have been able to do this
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.680]  drive from san francisco to new york legally last year even though they may have had the
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:40.320]  technology largely in place they would have been prohibited from doing that but they changed those
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.520]  laws and let me tell you this is coming much much faster than you realize as i pointed out
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.280]  google wired rather talks about propelling us towards a day that humans no longer hold the
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.320]  wheel well you know what who's going to hold the wheel government is going to be holding the wheel
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.120]  government will be using the the computers will be doing the the driving but you know what
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.800]  government is going to use this to tax you to follow you to have complete control over you
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.480]  uh before we leave this story about the autonomous car only just point one of the things that they
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.240]  were talking about in the ap article was the technology technological issues on it they say
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.600]  the person sitting in the car's driver seat only intervened once when in traffic and that was when
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.920]  weaving around a construction zone again when the car didn't want to move into a busy left lane to
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.800]  avoid police that were stopped on the right shoulder so it did all of the interstate driving they would
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.120]  when they get off and get onto the streets they don't have that yet so they would have humans
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.040]  driving that but on the road on the highway the car did 99 percent of the driving now listen to
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.320]  some of the technological challenges that came up to them the variation in line markings across
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.440]  states across communities some had wide stripes others had narrow yellow ones uh some were new
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.840]  some were faded some were marked with raised bumps so they had to be able to navigate all those
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.200]  different things they said of course they're going to train their cameras to detect all kinds of
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.160]  lane markings and they also looked at the fact that the cameras were a little bit blinded and
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.760]  bright sunlight or by rainy weather but the radar systems provided backup the radar systems I said
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.640]  worked well even on metal bridges that could have caused reflection and interference and when I look
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.960]  at that I thought yeah that's kind of interesting I started looking at the technology we have to
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.480]  make sure I look at this start looking at it from an engineer's eyes and I can understand how these
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:31.040]  guys can get into it it's a very fascinating challenge to come up with all of these different
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.880]  conditions make sure that it's going to work in all the different kinds of lane designation
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.440]  markings make sure that you've got something to guide off of even when there's some of the paint
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.000]  is missing or where it's different colors or different widths or if you've got metal bridges
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.200]  that's a very interesting technological challenge and I understand that people can get caught up in
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:56.560]  that but we need to understand especially engineers especially engineers who are creating these tools
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:02.880]  these pieces of technology that can very well be used for the worst kind of tyranny the world has
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.640]  ever seen that's what we're looking at we're building the legal infrastructure and the
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.920]  technological infrastructure for the worst tyranny this world has ever seen and you need to stop
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.000]  and move back from these fascinating technological tidbits and look at the bigger picture you've
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.160]  got to understand where this is going we've heard so many times the future doesn't need us the future
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.760]  that they're designing doesn't need us but the future that they're designing needs to control us
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.360]  it needs to control us or it needs to kill us that's the conclusion that the robot that the
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.600]  central ai came to in robo apocalypse and the book that alex is going to be talking to the
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.680]  author about the next hour and that's exactly the conclusion i believe the elites have come to
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.480]  will they be able to control us completely or will they have to kill us now as i said before this
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.040]  this car traveled from san francisco to new york 99 percent of the driving most of that on the highway
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.480]  where it just had to make sure that it wasn't going to hit anybody hit anything one of the things
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.720]  i thought was interesting about this too of course they don't really care about your convenience or
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.640]  about the humans it's all about the cars and the government's agenda one of the things they
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.520]  pointed out was along the way it went never went over the speed limit as a matter of fact most
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.400]  of the time they said it went well under the speed limit to the point that it said quote a few
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.400]  hateful gestures were given from the human occupants of other cars yeah i saw one of these
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:32.400]  reports talking about google car where it would set at a stop sign for over four minutes finally the
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:38.080]  guy behind it made a dangerous move to go around it and shot the guys in the car a bird
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.760]  because you can't have these machines that get stuck they're they're timid maybe they're going
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.840]  to be aggressive that's one of the things they said they have to program some aggressiveness
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.600]  into it well they're also going to have to program in some ethics that was what warm buffett talked
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.280]  about earlier in this week alex mentioned that a couple of days ago the fact that you're going to
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.880]  have to make a very quick ethical decision we all know that that's been talked about in the
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.200]  technology magazines warm buffett mentioned it and everybody paid attention when warm buffett
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.680]  said it but of course that's an issue you're going to have to make a quick decision as to
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.440]  whether or not you're going to hit a pedestrian or whether or not you're going to go into another
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.680]  car and of course they will know who's in the other car because the cars are talking to us
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.800]  you don't really do you realize that vehicle to vehicle communication v2v communication is going
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.680]  to be mandated into the cars in just a couple of years we're not talking about five years we're not
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.800]  talking about 10 years it's going to be mandated in a couple of years now that'll probably be for
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.000]  new cars i haven't read the details of the regulation yet but they will grandfather that back into
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.320]  all of the cars but right now the thing that is holding them back is not the legal issues it's not
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.400]  really the technical issues so much on the highways that they're already done with that
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.560]  what is going what's holding them back is the ability to be able to drive in the city where
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.800]  there's a very challenging situation and of course bloomberg pointed out yesterday that there's
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.720]  crash testing driverless cars are going to be used in a robot city you can find this article
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.760]  up on the drudge report as well and they're talking about a particular scenario let's say
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.720]  you got a mother pushing a baby carriage across a busy city street and all of a sudden will a car
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.840]  stop in time while they say this is going to be done in this city that they're building the robot
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:23.920]  and the baby carriage will be a robotic there'll be programmed obstacles that will be thrown at
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:29.920]  these cars to see if they can navigate this this is m city coming just outside of detroit at
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:35.360]  university of michigan it's soon to be open it's a 23 acre mini metropolis it's going to open this
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:42.880]  summer in july 20th and they talk about the fact that this is where they are going to test
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.680]  navigating under all the different things that can happen in a city environment
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.840]  again talking about google's self-driving car i don't know if you've seen this thing but it's
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.600]  got like instead of headlights it's because it doesn't need headlights it doesn't have a steering
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.000]  wheel it doesn't have a brake so it doesn't need headlights you're not you're just an occupant
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.320]  you're just along for the ride and so they paint this clown face on it nevertheless
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:12.000]  the headlights are really kind of painted on eyes as i mentioned before i would not only
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.560]  be afraid there's a picture of it if you're watching this i would not only be afraid to ride in that
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.800]  thing i would be absolutely embarrassed it's kind of like the automotive equivalent of the cone of
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.440]  shame you know when you put that on that vet cone on the dog you know they're both apprehensive
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.520]  and they look very embarrassed that's the way i would feel on one of these things because you
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.760]  know the future for me would be absolute living hell if i've got to go around as they describe
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:43.120]  this google's self-driving Priuses equipped with laid our laser radar saucers on their roofs come on
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.840]  i mean one of the few real things i ever get to do anymore i work so much on computers
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:53.360]  uh setting at a desk all the time one of the few real things i get to do is to get out in the 3d
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.080]  world not looking at a television screen but the steering wheel in one hand the stick shift in
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.680]  the other both of my feet on the pedals and go i love that that's real that's being in the real
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.360]  world i don't want that taken away from me but even more than that i don't want to lose control
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:15.760]  of my ability to travel and that goes back to why DARPA had their very first challenges were
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.480]  robotics challenges because from the very beginning our government understands that in
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:28.720]  order to control us they need the control point of transportation it isn't just enough to watch
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.520]  everything that we're doing in the virtual world they want to control where and when and know where
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:42.080]  we're going in the real world we also need to look at this and ask who now this is a question
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:45.840]  that warren buffet was talking about because he owns a lot of insurance companies he says
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.360]  i may be out of the insurance business well you know maybe you will maybe you want we started
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:57.360]  kicking that around in back and and joe bigs and i were talking about the vaccine court where you
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.400]  don't get to sue the vaccine companies because there were so many people that were injured with
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:07.760]  vaccines that they took the public's right to sue to get compensation from these companies they took
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.280]  that away and handed it over to this kangaroo court called the vaccine court that allocates
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.520]  judgments that is essentially what you're going to wind up having to do with these autonomous
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.640]  cars because let me tell you even though they want to say that they're going to be perfectly safe
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.360]  they're still going to have errors they're still programmed by people they're not going to be perfect
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.800]  as a matter of fact a lot of people may remember all of these different car manufacturers you've
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.560]  had Audi and many other car manufacturers have issues with runaway cars runaway acceleration
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.560]  remember that remember those lawsuits they were kept pretty quiet there were actually
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.160]  a lot of car manufacturers that were involved in that and that's just one of the subsystems
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.640]  of an autonomous driving car there were a lot of lawsuits about that but of course that was kind
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.480]  of swept under the rug you didn't hear too much about it you're not hearing too much about this
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.400]  in the united states although the bbc reported on this chrisler has just been ordered to pay
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:09.360]  149 million dollars for one death and a jeep crash now this is a us jury has awarded 150 million
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.560]  dollars to the family of a four-year-old boy that died in a crash involving a jeep grand
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:21.200]  Cherokee in 2012 he died after the jeep was struck from behind by a truck it ruptured the rear fuel
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:28.320]  tank caused it to ignite in 2013 chrisler recalled one and a half million jeep suv's built between
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:35.360]  1993 and 98 with similar real rear fuel tanks and of course those of you who are older or
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.080]  will remember the ford pinto was notorious for having an exploding gas tank when hit from the
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.840]  rear so when something like that happens or when you've got the navigation system drives somebody
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:54.000]  off of a bridge or into a river and kills them you're not going to be able to withstand if you're
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.480]  the automotive companies you're not going to be able to stand multiple judgments of this size
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:02.640]  so they're going to have to come up with something like the vaccine court and let me tell you
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:09.280]  something they absolutely will because the government wants this so badly they're always
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:14.160]  looking for a way to control us and one of the key ways that they have to control us is to control
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:20.560]  our movement that's what the tsa is about the tsa is about getting us accustomed to living
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.280]  in a police state in a nazi state you know give me your identity papers you know stand over here
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.760]  even the nazis didn't go into the pants of little children as far as i can tell looking at history
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:37.920]  but of course the tsa does and that's what this is about but it's also about establishing control
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:44.560]  points and making sure we don't move that easily and again we just learned that remember it was a
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.560]  conspiracy theory that the dhs wanted to get everybody's license plates instead of a tracking
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:53.760]  system we published that they dropped it now they're back washington post reports drudge has
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:03.600]  linked up stay with us we'll be right back communist china freely allows the sale of
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:08.960]  bulletproof armor plates while our us politicians argue from banning americans from owning body armor

[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:22.000]  welcome back i'm david night and the alex john show alex is going to be back in the beginning of
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.680]  the next hour and in the next hour he's going to be talking to the author of robo apocalypse this is
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:33.840]  a story that's been eagerly awaited in movie form the rights were sold to steven spielberg quite
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.680]  some time ago a couple of times he's had it cast and i guess that's one of the things alex will
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.680]  talk to him about is to try to get some ideas if you see if he's got any ideas to when this
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:50.320]  movie will be made because it should be a very fascinating movie i've read most of the book
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.360]  not all of it we're listening to it as an audio book with my family and people started going
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.960]  separate ways and so we're waiting for different people so we didn't quite finish the end of it
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.800]  but it's a fascinating book i think because it raises the issues that we're looking at on a
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:10.640]  daily basis now it's no longer distant ideas that we're going to have all these subsystems
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:18.800]  that are automated and could become malevolent if connected together now of course in the book the
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:25.360]  malevolent central control is from a piece of ai's from a computer that becomes self-aware
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:31.600]  and starts going after humans what you need to understand is that we don't need to wait
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:37.680]  for the artificial intelligence to become self-aware okay we already have politicians and
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:44.160]  global elitists who are ai themselves artificial integrity they're telling us they take an oath
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:50.880]  to the constitution they say one thing in public but they have an agenda to basically control us
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.520]  to take us down as i said before the future they say doesn't need us they say this over and over
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:01.280]  again but in their future they not only don't need us but they must control us or eliminate us
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.960]  that's the decision that the computer weighs and robo apocalypse and decides to eliminate the people
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:12.400]  and of course there are many signs that that's what the elite choose to do when you turn over all
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.360]  this information when you give control of your movements to the government when they're allowed
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.160]  to track your movements when they're allowed to deny you being able to move places and don't
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.920]  for a minute think that they won't do this they can instantly do an audit see if you owe them any
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:31.360]  money you're not going to go anywhere if you can't pay off all of your tax bills or if you're
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:36.720]  behind in your student loan we've already seen jurisdictions threatening to take the licenses
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:41.840]  of professionals who haven't paid their student loan you're not going to even be able to work if
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:46.480]  you don't pay your student loan off if you get behind on your student loan well they're going
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.720]  to use that for people who aren't professionals who don't have licenses if you're just flipping
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:56.160]  flipping burgers and you owe the government some loan money or you owe them taxes they're going to
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:02.960]  lock you down it's going to be a high-tech debtors prison without walls essentially
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:08.000]  and we can see that this is going to happen when you got this story that is on Washington Post
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.880]  it's on drudge a year after the firestorm DHS wants to access to license plate tracking systems
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:18.880]  and they say the Department of Homeland Security is seeking bids from companies that are able to
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:23.920]  provide law enforcement officials with access to a national license plate tracking system
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:30.640]  a year after canceling a similar solicitation over privacy issues remember they said oh no no no
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.200]  you just completely misunderstood we have no interest in uh and following you you know just
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.000]  like James Clapper remember when Ron Wyden said uh are you doing dragnet surveillance I'm paraphrasing
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.320]  it here you know Clapper says oh well uh you know he looked down he rubbed his forehead he could not
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:47.760]  look Ron Wyden in the eye he couldn't look the staffers in the eye they all knew that he was
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:54.640]  it was classified information so they couldn't say so that's why he asked Clapper the uh the
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.720]  question so that he could put that out there and of course Clapper chose again not to tell us the
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.840]  truth artificial integrity uh they say if this goes forward DHS will have warrantless access
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:11.920]  to location information going back at least five years about virtually every adult driver in the
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:18.560]  U.S sometimes to their image as well now look license plate readers and accessing this database
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:25.200]  that is very very clunky technology compared to real-time monitoring real-time tracking being
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:30.720]  able to shut your car down because your car is computer controlled and linked to the government
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:36.240]  that is where we're headed that's what we should be afraid of stay with us we'll be right back
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:41.040]  and we'll be talking to the author of robopocalypse with alex jones the next hour thank you for

[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:28.480]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show alex is
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:33.040]  going to be coming back to the show and interviewing the author of robo apocalypse beginning in the
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:38.560]  next segment there's just a couple more news article items that i want to go over first of
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.920]  course there is the push in many many states i think it's a 20 something i think i want to say
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.280]  29 but i'm not sure of the exact count but all across this country we have movements in state
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:56.640]  legislatures that are pushing to take away our informed consent for vaccines because of measles
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:02.480]  okay this is a childhood disease that i had as as we've mentioned many times parents would
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:08.480]  send their kids down to get measles because it was a very very low mortality rate for measles
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:16.000]  nevertheless because of that they're using that to push for mandatory vaccines to take away our
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  informed consent and this is we've had several bills that have been pushed back on north carolina
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.880]  they just had the sponsors take it down and listen to what they said i expected to get pushback
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:32.560]  and i expected this bill to change but unfortunately the pushback was so great
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.920]  that i lost control of it this is someone who is trying to take away our informed consent
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:44.320]  this is someone who is trying to force us to have things injected into our body regardless of
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:51.520]  whether we agreed with that regardless of whether they had our consent that is a fundamental hallmark
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.080]  of tyranny if you take away people's informed consent for medical treatment and of course it
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.720]  was also taken off in washington and the washington bill the person who put this forward who was a
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:06.400]  sponsor there was a pro-choice as many of these people call themselves many of these uh democrats
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.200]  who are sponsoring these bills but of course in north carolina it was joined by a couple of sponsors
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.520]  who are republicans as well but the people for the most part are calling themselves pro-choice
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.520]  but they don't want you to have a choice about the medicine that you put into your child or the
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.640]  medicine that you put into yourself they're going to force that on you the only choice you get is
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.120]  whether or not you're going to kill your child but how you're going to treat your child how you're
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.920]  going to educate your child none of that you get a choice in if they had their way but of course
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:39.360]  people are pushing back on this now it was interesting too in the washington case the senator
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:45.760]  was also a doctor who was pushing this bill and she had exercised her informed choice she is an
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.680]  ms patient she was on interferon she had a child she wanted to breastfeed and of course the doctor
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.600]  and the pharmaceutical company both told her you need to get off of that drug if you're going to be
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.320]  breastfeeding she did research she talked to people she decided that it wasn't a threat that it would
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:06.080]  be safe to do it so she went against the advice of her doctor she went against the advice of the
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:12.160]  pharmaceutical company and she continued to take her medication she exercised her informed consent
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:18.080]  but she wants to deny that to others she also had to pull back on this particular bill and listen
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:21.840]  to what this lady in north carolina said she said parents however should talk to a medical
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.520]  professional about this because we do have a high opt-out rate in bunkham county and that does create
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:32.800]  cracks in the shield of protection that we have in other words that's this heard mentality that
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.240]  they've got this herd immunity that they try to say is necessary and we've debunked that whole idea
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:42.800]  of herd immunity many times quite simply if you don't have it for individuals you don't have it
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:48.320]  collectively either and it's a safety as well as an efficacy issue but she said however trying
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:56.240]  to mandate vaccines was a step too far yeah a step way too far and there's some people there that
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.920]  are watching this closely who believe in if you're north carolina or if you're in these other places
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.080]  don't think for a minute that they're not going to come back you may have defeated them right now
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:09.120]  but the price of liberty is eternal vigilance just as patrick henry uh said as alex was reading in
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:14.560]  the last hour some of the people in north carolina said well we've talked to one of the sponsors
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:19.280]  senator tart a republican and he has an open healthcare bill that can be amended with new
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:25.200]  language and withdrawing his support of sb 346 is not the same as withdrawing the bill and its
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.520]  contents when asked if he would pull the bill before it's reading he says i have a record
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:36.560]  recorded quote of him saying that's not going to happen the bill's not going to go away i was just
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:42.320]  talking to clavin bundy last night on the nightly news doing an interview and as we're talking about
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.440]  we saw the people stand up as a community to tyranny and as clavin bundy points out every
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:52.560]  time people do that the government backs down they did it with the vaccines they will do it if
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.400]  you stand up that's why the information war is so important say with us alex jones will be right

[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.280]  long to let them live they now run the computers at the VA deciding who to put on the do not treat
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:04.080]  list for me we're already in a robo crisis we're already in the middle of incredible
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:11.360]  change and the architecture of this system is being built to where humans will be obsolete and
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.160]  i didn't get that from my own perspectives look at these headlines washington post uh just a few
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.680]  days ago apple co-founder on artificial intelligence the future is scary and very bad for people
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.200]  here's another headline european killer robots pose danger to international stability
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:34.960]  autonomous drones skynet in the robotic near future most will quote live off government
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.920]  provided income because robots will make humans obsolete and that's of course what was written
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:44.720]  15 years ago by bill joy in wired magazine why the future doesn't need us
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:54.400]  we have the author of robo apocalypse joining us via video skype that's being made by stevens
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:59.520]  billberg right now his newest project is sci-fi survival script for lion's gate produced by
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:05.760]  brad pit he also of course is another popular app deep space a speech recognition gaming app
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:11.920]  i've got a lot of questions i want to go over with him but humans tend to understand that
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.640]  we're losing our humanity watching 10 hours of tv a day it's linked to degeneration of
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:21.760]  our brains early onset of Alzheimer's we know that people can't do basic calculations now
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:27.360]  because of calculators so much of this that has empowered us has also dehumanized us
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:31.360]  and you read ray Kurzweil and others writings they just say humans as we know it are obsolete so
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:37.200]  it seems like that decision has already been made now are are these views that he puts in his books
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:45.120]  something that he's actually worried about or is it just art for our guest author daniel h wilson
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:50.000]  thanks for coming on mr wilson okay thanks for having me there's so much to talk about
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.680]  you're a pretty young guy but you've written some best-selling books and are really good reads
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:11:00.800]  what is your world view on all this where does art intersect with life well i think
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.080]  first of all it's worth mentioning that i started out as a scientist so
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:10.080]  when i was in my 20s i earned a phd in in robotics and artificial intelligence from
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:17.360]  Carnegie Mellon university at the robotics institute so now it's been 10 years i'm just a
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:22.320]  i'm just a science fiction author but i really come from what i'm writing about from kind of an
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:27.280]  informed perspective slice of knowledge yeah and so you know with rubble apocalypse i have to say
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:33.520]  first of all i'm not worried about that actually occurring but i did set out to depict what i
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:41.040]  considered to be the most likely possible robot uprising scenario that could occur so it's not
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.960]  robots that come from the future there's no time travel there's no you know as aliens from outer space
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:55.280]  it's about mass malfunctioning of autonomous vehicles it's about you know and a and ai using
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:02.000]  our data against us using our cell phones against us the personal assistants that are on smartphones
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.200]  now so stuff like that i was projecting out into the near future but um but as it as it actually
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.560]  stands i'm pretty much an optimist when it comes to all this technology and its impact on humankind
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:19.200]  i personally am not worried about ai autonomous machines taking over but if you look at the big
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:24.400]  corporations and governments they're weaponizing them day one and already through the smart technologies
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:31.120]  our social engineering controlling predicting mass movements and so as a novice futurist myself
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:36.160]  has been talking about this for 20 years we see the architecture of the nsa and the rest of it
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:42.960]  really creating a monopoly of information that's my concern is what humans will do with this digital
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:49.600]  web of the things of the internet yeah you know i think i think humans don't change you know human
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.640]  beings are we have some fundamental things that are always going to be the same we love our families
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:13:01.200]  we eat we sleep uh but now we live more and more of our lives through our technology right so we're
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.240]  using our technology to kind of do the same stuff that we would always do we're using it to communicate
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:12.320]  with other people we're using it to uh you know to transportation and we have these autonomous
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.440]  vehicles to get us from one place to another communication utilities all the stuff that we
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:23.600]  used to do slower and in person you know now we do it faster we do it through technology and i think
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:29.280]  that that creates a lot of potential but it also creates you know a lot of potential for uh for
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:36.000]  misuse absolutely i mean sure because so much of our data is out there so much of our daily lives
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  you know there used to be sort of an equality and an anonymity right um you know when i was a
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.720]  kid if i left the house i just was i left the house you know i was i was out there just anonymous
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:52.640]  like anybody um and these days you know the well those days are over right and you know now every
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:58.880]  every move is tracked and for better or worse we're constantly each of us just hemorrhaging
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:04.800]  a stream of data out into the universe and other people are certainly going to use that data for
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:11.280]  for various purposes well i hope humans just don't become some vestigial barnacle growing on the
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:18.000]  technological terror to quote Darth Vader that we're constructing because my grandfathers especially
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.360]  my dad's dad knew how to fix combines fix trucks they were designed so a human could fix them now
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:29.520]  it takes computers it takes technicians yeah i mean we're having basically the world taken away
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  from us and we're building a world where we're obsolete and that's what most of the billionaire
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:40.720]  tech company owners have been saying for more than 15 years are you familiar with some of the
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:47.360]  warnings of wasniac and and and build joy in folks and yeah elon musk steven hawking i sure am but
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:53.760]  i have to say so i grew up in tulsa oklahoma my dad ran a body shop that he inherited from my grandfather
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.320]  so i grew up in a body shop where people were fixing cars yanking them apart you know painting them
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:05.760]  and and i have to say that over the years i've also watched that that process changed where
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.320]  now you have to be a computer technician you have to basically use different tools
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.160]  in order to fix the car and i don't think that that is necessarily dehumanizing i don't think
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:22.080]  that we're necessarily losing anything i feel like it's just an evolution it's it's a change
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:27.920]  definitely sure but i was thinking about you could fix a car in your own garage that the average
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.280]  person doesn't own the $50,000 diagnostic equipment now so that centralizes it to shops
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.280]  then it becomes even more centralized where it won't be in the shops anymore where they have
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.480]  robots working on the robots the elite openly have stated that they want to create a system
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.040]  where human labor isn't just cheap it's obsolete they claim it'll be good for the earth to reduce
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.760]  world population the so-called smart grids are already surveilling everything we do i'm sure
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.720]  you know google founded 16 years ago its founding documents were recently released last year they
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:03.200]  said the plan was to build an ai to take over the world yeah i mean they want to they're an
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.840]  information company they want to collect all information if you look at uber the ride-sharing
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.640]  service they uh just started a partnership with Carnegie Mellon to build autonomous vehicles
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:19.280]  and they their ceo has openly said we want to eliminate human drivers because they cut they
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.720]  take 75 of our money is paying the human drivers to drive people around so we have to
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:28.960]  vote with our dollars and keep humans involved to make sure we build the architecture where
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.880]  we're not obsolete i mean this is a no-brainer well i don't know i mean is that is that just
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:40.240]  trying to like fight progress i mean is that so for instance if you if you look at the the evolution
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:47.280]  of a lot of our a lot of our consumer goods right it used to be that they were built in a way not
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.240]  because you know the not because the corporations had you know used to care about us more planned
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.320]  obsolescence about us but and they never will because they're motivated by economic forces but
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.000]  they used to only be able to build these these consumer goods in ways that we could actually
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.640]  as consumers take them apart and fix them you know you used to be able to fix a tv right um now
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:15.680]  because they're more efficient about building these things we get better products they're cheaper
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:21.360]  they can do amazing things i mean there's no human being that can build an iphone you know that's
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:26.640]  got to be a robot that's got to be aided by these machines and so you got to ask is the trade-off
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:31.600]  worth it right do i want to be able to field strip my iphone and replace it with a piece of
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.200]  leather and some rubber bands and and have it work like i'm on gilligan's island or or you know do i
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:43.520]  want the the most futuristic potentially even disposable sure consumer good possible and i'm
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:47.920]  not arguing for either side i'm just saying there's a definite trade-off right there sure
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:53.520]  daniel h wilson author of rubo apocalypse is our guest here's what i'm getting at there are natural
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:59.200]  developments and innovation free markets that are wonderful i'm simply saying from reading the mass
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:06.080]  body of what the actual corporate chiefs are saying they actually aren't just motivated by money
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.240]  they control the central banks the issue of the currency and credit they're motivated by the idea
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:15.120]  of quote saving the earth by reducing world population and they're maneuvering the population
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:19.600]  into a position where they are obsolete and will quote have all this leisure time but that's really
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:24.800]  just so we're domesticated and then basically you sell out your rights to be able to have children
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:29.040]  to be on welfare in the future and then we're looking in a world where the elites merge with
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:35.840]  machines and they see a new uh creature on the planet that decision from the compendium of writings
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:42.880]  i've seen non-fiction is the direction that's been chosen by the social engineers and i don't see
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:48.080]  that as a better world i mean i've never watched house of cards until i had surgery a few days
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:53.040]  ago so i watched four or five episodes uh the first season and the third season every episode is
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:56.320]  about getting rid of old people and how they're worthless and everybody says this is cutting
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:01.280]  at show no it's not we're being taught how to be predatory and we're being taught it's innovation
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:07.200]  to go into the jaws of the machines i'll tell you i'll tell you this so i don't uh i think that's a
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.480]  that's a leap that i'm not willing to to take in terms of believing that i i think that corporations
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:19.120]  can be uh good or evil i think they're motivated by money but what i can speak to in my own experience
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.160]  is being a scientist you know and being in a laboratory and actually building this this stuff
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:32.000]  you know like autonomous vehicles speech recognition i built uh i helped build uh autonomous boats for
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.520]  north of grumman you know a big military contractor but i have to say that at the end of the day when
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:44.080]  you're in an academic you know setting when you're in a university somewhere and you're a 25-year-old
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:49.040]  kid and you're getting a grant you know you're trying to get money from usually from the government
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:56.000]  military industrial complex DARPA in the national institute of health um sometimes DARPA yeah with
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:03.600]  with robotics but often you're getting uh money from like uh health you know related sources so
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:09.760]  but look these kids that are out there building this stuff they're not evil they're choosing projects
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:15.840]  because they want to help people so in fact all of my research was uh about well my mom was a case
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:21.840]  manager in oklahoma she'd go out and visit really rural areas and she'd check on elderly people
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:26.960]  that are living independently in their own homes and she just try to make sure that they're safe
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:32.160]  but you can't just drive out to every place in oklahoma and check on people and this will do that
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:38.000]  right so all my research is about using this technology to uh to have the smart homes so
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.960]  that uh people could live safely and independently as long as possible in their own homes without
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:46.560]  oh listen i know there's a good end to it and i know there's people that develop a lot of stuff
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:53.920]  for research with a good intent i'm not a anti technology uh lot i hear what i'm getting at
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:21:00.720]  with you is that day one the autonomous craft are for killing day one they're building a system
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:06.000]  where the robots are meant to displace the labor force and bill joy talked about going to that
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.360]  meeting in in 1999 with 200 top technology owners and they said we're not gonna let people play
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:16.080]  games and party all day we're gonna get rid of everybody i mean that's wired magazine see that's
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:21.280]  the part that's the part that i think is a leap you know because when i think about these sessions
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.840]  typically what they're doing is they're trying to maximize their profit and that's that that's
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:32.000]  going to be a really interesting uh sort of inflection point to watch right money buys you
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.840]  the McMansion to quote house of cards money buys you the McMansion and the wife that divorces you
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:45.040]  okay and okay power builds the stone fortress it's there in 10 000 years the the elite are all about
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:50.960]  power and life extension and selling the public that it's all sexy to give up their free will
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:56.960]  into this big combine and it's all being sold by the different priests of this system right now
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:01.040]  but when at the bottom of it is what i'm saying is the robo apocalypse is here
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:07.200]  surveilling tracking and then gaming the economy i mean the robo apocalypse is goldman sacks gaming
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:12.560]  the stock market with a high frequency trading that that is basically illegal yeah no that is
[02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:19.120]  that is just uh definitely the high frequency trading is is bad news i feel like but listen
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:23.600]  what do you think we can do here's my question you're an engineer really smart guy been involved in
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.680]  a lot of the stuff best selling author uh on the cutting edge of media got a movie come out with
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:32.960]  Brad Pitt as well let me ask you this question then how do you want to build a future for your
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:38.000]  family do you want to have children where do you see this going if it was good and empowering
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:45.680]  yeah so i have a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son and uh i'm 37 i i don't know so
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:52.800]  i'm getting close to 40 and you know i've got a family and uh and i'm really i'm actually excited
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:57.680]  about the future of technology and how it's going to affect my kids because when you start seeing
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:04.080]  your kids what happens is as you as i've gotten a little bit older the technology changes i start
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.800]  getting kind of pissed off i'm like oh it's always some new thing every day i'm supposed to memorize
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:13.840]  it and i'm just like why can't things just stay the way they were but then you start watching
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:19.040]  your kids and other children and you see that they're adapting to this whole new world all this
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:24.000]  stuff is totally normal for them this is the scenery of their world and they're able to do
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:31.440]  great stuff with all this technology so i mean i'm excited about it i i don't uh i don't sense
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:36.480]  that there's a that there's an ulterior motive out there to reduce the population or anything like
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:42.640]  that i definitely want my kids to be aware that corporations aren't your friend and that you know
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:48.960]  you are simply a dollar sign walking around out there but there's gotta be a moment when these
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:54.800]  major corporations are realized that they've you know we can see it right now i feel like with
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:24:00.800]  mcdonalds and walmart how they just raised the uh the income for their uh you know well they're kind
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:06.000]  of they're capitulating to to demand a lot about to say i mean corporations aren't just doing it
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:12.240]  for the dollar if they were smart like henry ford he doubled and tripled the average factory worker
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:18.720]  price knowing he had to create an economy for his cars it's like mcdonalds 50 years ago started
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:23.600]  saying please throw your trash away that just made it all filthy and got rid of a service economy
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:28.880]  and entry-level jobs we need to build a better economy based on humanity and taking care of the
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:34.480]  old and and and and then building space bases and if people want to merge with talking about if people
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.240]  want to merge with machines they can go with this colony if they want to have a slower development
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.120]  go with this colony i mean i think really space off world needs to be the place where the real
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:49.040]  cowboy stuff goes on dude i completely agree with you right there and and that's exactly yeah so
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:55.440]  you know like i think sometimes people have this reaction that uh you know technology is too scary
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:00.640]  we've gotta we've gotta hit the brakes and it's impossible you know human beings as an animal
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:06.800]  as a as a creature we build tools that's what we do if you put a human being naked in the woods
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.840]  the first thing they'll do is they'll start building tools you know and we're i feel like
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:17.840]  as a species we're at this point in our development where our tools are starting to get really cool
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:23.520]  right i mean we're i built info wars to fight tyranny and i was just a nobody from texas the
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:28.400]  research 20 million people a week now it talks about being independent i mean what's more independent
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.840]  than than modifying your body you know utilizing technology to modify your body if you want to
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:38.080]  upload your brain into a computer if you have that capability what's more independent than
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:44.480]  striking out into outer space i mean i mean that sounds like science fiction but so did amazon having
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:50.720]  drones delivering packages so did sitting in colonists across the atlantic ocean so did electricity
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:56.320]  i mean the stuff today is seen as you know magic a hundred years ago it's really just science
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:03.280]  yeah so you know i actually i wrote another novel called amped which is all about uh people using
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:09.280]  neural implants to basically to cure disability um but you know what ends up happening is those the
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:15.840]  people that use the technology they used to have a disability but now they leapfrog uh normal ability
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:21.200]  and now they're kind of they're superhuman and it's about how society reacts to that and i think a
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.600]  lot of times people assume that you know the wealthy people are going to get the best technology
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:33.200]  right well guess what like if you're really wealthy you don't really have a lot of motivation to get
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:38.480]  a hole drilled in your head and get a neural implant or to upload your brain into a computer
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:43.600]  you're not desperate you're happy with the status quo right so i think it's actually in a lot of
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:49.760]  times the opposite the people who are most desperate who have if you've got a child with a disability
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.320]  there's nothing that's going to stop you from getting the latest technology sure your child but
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:00.640]  expanding on that i mean if you look at it there are legions of studies saying that screen time is
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:05.600]  actually impairing neurological development in children it's brain damaging them and the elites
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.920]  when you go to boulderburg i've covered it they are actually obsessed with life extension
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:14.800]  they just don't want the general public to get it in fact there's the headline daily beast the
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:20.480]  immortal the immortality financiers the billionaires who want to live forever so i'm not disagreeing
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:27.840]  with you uh overall but uh page and others are completely obsessed with it yeah but that's
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:33.280]  that i think life extension might be a you know sort of a unique scenario there and it's also
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.760]  something that they want to do i think they're imagining doing this stuff like on their death
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:45.120]  bed you know what surprised me was looking at was hearing about how um uh oh geez how am i blanking
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:53.520]  on um steve jobs you know steve jobs his cancer snuck up on him and you you know when i imagine
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:59.200]  a billionaire who's out there i imagine you know they're getting the cutting edge medical care
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:04.720]  they're constantly you know getting their their health you know checked on so that they're so
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:08.960]  that they don't get a they're not going to die for as long as possible but then you know you see
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:14.080]  that that that comes for all of us right at some point um that's what i'm saying how do we know
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:18.240]  it's not a con game that they claim merging ourselves with machines or uploading our brain
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:22.720]  you know Kurzweil says he's going to recreate his dad off of just papers he had i mean that
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:29.440]  doesn't really make sense you know i you know the idea of uh uploading your brain into the machine
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:35.920]  i i never really understood that because look if you personally want to live forever as yourself
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:42.640]  right to me that means you need to keep your body alive if my brain dies and there's a perfect copy
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:49.280]  of me i don't care congrats to the copy i'm dead right so then having a copy of yourself living
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:54.960]  forever that's not about wanting to live forever that's about erecting a monument to yourself
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:29:00.480]  that's about having a talking gravestone that can tell people about how wonderful you were
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.880]  right you know to me those are two totally different things making a copy of your brain
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:11.040]  in a computer and living forever i don't think they're the same thing what do you think you know i
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:17.520]  think that you're absolutely on target when it comes to that um but it goes beyond that at some
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:20.640]  levels and i want to get your take on that when we come back from break i want to talk about
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:27.040]  when is robo apocalypse coming out when is the new uh sci-fi survival uh film of brad pit coming
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:30.720]  out i can't wait to see that i want to talk about some of your other books some of your
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:36.560]  short stories as well um what do you feel about uh futures predictions like ray Kurzweil predicts
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:42.320]  a singularity around 2025 or earlier and we'll break it all down and the moves we've seen time
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:47.760]  magazine and others say time for driverless cars get rid of drivers when the machines can do it better
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:55.520]  do we all go to prison basically stay with us the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:39.760]  stevens billberg's turning his best-selling book into a big mega blockbuster another one's
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:46.560]  in production as well being produced by brad pit the project sci-fi survival script we'll find out
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:54.080]  the specifics of that i always marvel at the predatory nature of the social engineers the
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:59.840]  eugenicist who founded the modern transhumanist movement most transhumanists mean well they're
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:06.720]  what you call porch transhumanist they're not in the inner engineer level but when you get up into
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:12.960]  the big foundations and you get up into the big technocracy just like bill gaich has come out and
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:17.120]  said warren buffett machines will decide when you live and when you die when you get medical care
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.520]  when you don't and so according to their plan and the best laid plans of mice and men often go
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:28.640]  awry as i love to say and it is the best of times and worst of times to continue down that line
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:36.320]  a tale of two cities but the main push is for authoritarianism is for totalitarianism is for
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:43.840]  autocratic despotism and that's too bad because machines computers computing could empower us but
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:49.120]  look we've got more information than ever more choices than ever and we're more unhealthy we're
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:54.880]  more decadent we're more slob like people are choosing false reality and actually buying fake
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.320]  Lamborghinis and second life and things like this so i'm not being negative i'm not a pessimist
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:05.680]  but when i say join the resistance it means really look at the choices that are being made now
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:12.880]  don't just be a spectator and so i think it's healthy to have books like robo apocalypse and
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:21.600]  films kind of a maximum overdrive meets your toaster but at the same time it almost cheapens
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:30.320]  it because it's then just a movie when the reality is it's a slow burn a takeover of our soul i don't
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:37.120]  see the current system empowering us and that's my question for daniel h wilson it's almost like
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:43.520]  space travel if you don't have gravity on your moon mission or your mars mission and you go
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:48.800]  on a year-long mission to mars you're not going to be able to walk when you get to the surface
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:54.000]  well humans in the last 50 60 years have come in contact with all these tools we've developed
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  that are now driving us and we're being told i knew this 20 years ago and i'd say
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:04.240]  they're gonna say that robots are better driving you know computer cars and they're gonna first
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:09.040]  have higher taxes and higher insurance and then finally say you can't drive your car well that's
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:15.600]  where this is going and so we humans need to be challenged humans need to be able to take risk and
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:21.760]  be in danger and the nanny state is about ending human empowerment and you can see us getting weaker
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:27.200]  and dumber and more feeble that i mean if you're a scientist daniel and a really smart guy the data
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:34.240]  is pretty much in that that that that this is almost like losing gravity that that we're losing our
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:43.200]  strength our vitality our creativity really smart guys like you or innovators like myself uh i mean
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:47.600]  we're going to be successful in the system no matter what but for the massive humanity as bill
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:52.880]  joy wrote in wire magazine i don't know if you read this lengthy treatise uh that the elite have
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:59.680]  decided that the general public's going to be basically done away with well you know i gotta
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:06.000]  i gotta disagree i think that you know every individual can use technology in the end whatever
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.280]  way they see fit you know if you if you look at for instance watching 10 hours of television a day
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:16.320]  yeah that's terrible don't do it you know the corporations are happy to make money off of you
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.440]  they're happy to sell you as all you can eat buffet but you know it's each it's up to each
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.960]  of us to uh to use the technology appropriately you know for instance um you know we limit
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:33.840]  screen time with our kids uh my wife is a child psychologist and she actually you know advises
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:40.160]  people to um to collect cell phones from their kids if they have teenagers uh before bedtime and put
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:44.800]  them all in one place and charge them up all night or else kids will be up all night on on the cell
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:51.840]  phones talking to each other and texting to each other so i mean again the technology is always a
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:58.000]  double edged blade there's always going to be uh negative potentials but there's also uh you know
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.840]  positive uh outcomes that you can get from using the technology but what about the numbers top
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:08.960]  scientists medical doctors saying they're seeing neurological development problems in children with
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:15.760]  screen time uh they're seeing clumsiness almost autistic like attributes uh we're seeing neurological
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:23.040]  disorders off the chart uh we're seeing just all sorts of i mean this what is your answer to that
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:29.120]  yeah i'm not sure that that we have any kind of epidemic of neurological disorders from
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:36.000]  screen time i mean televisions have been around for uh you know what 50 years or something i mean
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.880]  we had tv for a while we now have uh access to a lot of different types of screens you know you see
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:48.240]  the parents tossing an ipad to their kid yeah people aren't talking at the dinner table everybody's
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:54.320]  on their pad yeah no my wife has instituted a rule at our house you know no screens at dinnertime
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:59.840]  what do you think of um steve jobs abandoning his children from him period yeah i mean that's smart
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:05.520]  right i mean look my wife's a child psychologist but we're not above it you know we'll if it's
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:09.520]  dinner if we're out at a restaurant and the kids are being loud then we're not above bring
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:15.840]  the equivalent of a sugar tit the 21st century sorry it's the equivalent of a sugar tit yeah you
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:21.600]  know like if you right it's exactly the same thing sometimes society provides an overabundance of
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:26.080]  something that's not healthy for you and yeah guess what you know what it might be up to the
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:32.000]  individual to make a healthy decision for themselves or for their family and i mean i think that's the
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:37.920]  opposite of a nanny state right i mean there's no uh there's nobody higher up limiting exactly
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.880]  what you can do it sure but that nanny state is the tablet watching and tracking creating a
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.080]  psychological detailed algorithm of everything you're doing yeah you know actually have you
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:54.160]  noticed there's been a lot of new technology devoted to uh like tracking your own health and
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:59.600]  tracking what you eat and what you drink they're gonna use that to taxes yeah exercise yeah i'm not
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:04.400]  super into it exactly you get the new iphone you don't ask you to do it and suddenly how far you
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:10.720]  walked what you did a whole database it's tracking you this is big brother on pcp let's shift into
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.080]  your amazing books themselves how many books have you written uh what's the we've got several great
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.360]  websites but which one should we direct people to when are these movies coming out so i'm at
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:26.320]  danielhwilson.com and uh yeah i started writing books about 10 years ago i wrote a book called
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:31.920]  how to survive a robot uprising which was funny and then i wrote some non-fiction books like uh
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.560]  where's my jetpack um looking at kind of the science fiction future that we were promised
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.000]  but my yeah my my biggest novel has been robo apocalypse um and it has a sequel called robo
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.360]  genesis and it was purchased by dreamworks and uh steven spilberg's attached to direct it but it's
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:53.600]  been in development forever and you know at this point uh they don't really even keep me informed
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:59.120]  about what's going on so you know i'm hoping that that they get to it you know in the meantime
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.080]  i've transitioned into uh you know i just love writing i love science fiction i love writing i've
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:11.600]  been writing for dc comics i'm writing uh the earth two series for dc and uh and i'm writing yes this
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:17.920]  film for lion's gate called alpha which is a actually still under wraps but it's a it's a
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:23.680]  sci-fi survival tale that involves robots and and you know and in this one i actually portray robots
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:29.920]  in a good light um i show basically a piece of survival equipment that's a that's robotic and
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:37.200]  and it's basically a survival tale in the anardic um and my latest kind of project is uh is an app
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:43.600]  it's it's actually the it's for the iphone or ipad and it's the first um speech activated
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:50.000]  uh game that you can get it's called mayday deep space and you can find it at maydayapps.com
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:59.200]  and really what i was going for is like you know in these games in novels in in movies it's always
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:04.640]  so kind of one sided you know you don't get to interact with the the characters and so the idea
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:11.760]  was that uh i'd make a game where you literally answer a mayday call and you you speak to this
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:17.280]  character and you guide this this character uh off of a derelict spaceship and you save the guy's
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:26.000]  life uh by actually speaking to him over the radio amazing you are prolific fellow powerful stuff
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:34.320]  do you consider your book robo apocalypse to be a warning or just entertainment you know i think
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:40.320]  it's entertainment um i think that it's really really interesting to think about these themes
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:46.160]  because they don't go away you know people have been afraid of of what the next round of technology
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.800]  means for humanity we've been afraid of that you know since there was new technology uh
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:58.080]  so it's a really i think it's a really basic human thing to sort of imagine these potential
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:03.200]  scenarios and it's part of the reason why human beings are still around is that we sit around
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:08.080]  and we think about think about every angle yeah we think about every angle and we so that we're
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:14.640]  able to make good decisions you know moving forward and keep ourselves alive even as we build
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:21.040]  more and more powerful technology and you know i'm impressed with humanity i'm impressed with
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:27.520]  people because i am too the global star this tower you know of technology every time we come up with
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:31.920]  a new technology we're more powerful we're more capable of destroying ourselves if that's the
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:37.360]  way it's going to go and and yet you know we just keep putting more chips on the table and making
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:43.760]  bigger and bigger bets and and you know and winning and moving forward and so i'm excited about
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:49.600]  what technology is going to bring i mean look at world war two it killed it killed 100 million
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:55.520]  people or so and we didn't have the atomic weapons until the very end uh i mean i do see us doubling
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:00.080]  down i do see that happening and i actually see the worst behavior out of the elites themselves
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:06.960]  i see the grassroots actually trying to bring some sanity to all of this um how close is the
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:13.440]  internet right now to becoming a complete global mainframe well so you know that's the that's i
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:19.200]  think one misconception about artificial intelligence is that you know somehow it sort of lives on the
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.480]  internet you know the internet is just a a really basic set of protocols for swapping information
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:28.800]  you know between places and so sure but that's a communication grid and ai would have though
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:37.280]  into everything well i guess an ai could could use the internet in order to accumulate data you know
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:41.600]  but um you know in reality when you're building an artificial intelligence you typically are trying
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:49.600]  to solve a very specific problem and so getting a general level ai uh is very difficult and so
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:54.320]  what happens is yeah you know you can use the internet to to get a training corpus you know
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:45:00.000]  like for instance you can collect a whole lot of chat data right in order to teach a machine
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:04.160]  what it looks like when people talk to each other or type to each other online but um
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:10.960]  but the idea that a that an ai by itself is going to go out seeking that stuff and just sort of
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:17.120]  sure well here's what google says as you i'm sure you know all of us billions of us on google with
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:23.600]  our decisions we make the ai merging with the computers and the data and then they're able
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:29.040]  to kind of peer into the crystal ball that is the group collective consciousness through that web
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.320]  and now as they have smart dust and the internet of things that expands out to a 3d model where
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:40.000]  they're able to predict the future yeah no i mean that that's that that's absolutely you know you
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:45.280]  can model what's happening uh on the internet and then you can use the model to make predictions
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:51.120]  about once you can model if the public isn't aware of that once you have modeling and tracking you
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:58.960]  can have steering and so it's about steering i've talked to top former director of technicals nsa
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:04.640]  you name it you know william betty was here two weeks ago in studio and basically that's what
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:10.640]  it's all about is controlling the future the big secret is they want all this data so humans can
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:15.680]  then know where the trends are before everybody else does and then if you know that then you
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.240]  know how to dominate everybody two three steps ahead and it ends competition and really kind of
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:27.040]  ends free will and i'm not being negative here i'm bringing up the real problems that i another see
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:34.560]  in this sure i mean uh i think that's absolutely a goal there's an example of this uh uh maybe a
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:40.160]  year or two ago where target was doing exactly what you're describing they were modeling their
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.400]  customer base based on all the information they have about in their stores about customer
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:49.200]  purchasing habits and when they bought it and who they were and where they bought it from
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:54.480]  and they started targeting their advertising and they started sending they started being able to
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:47:03.120]  predict when people were pregnant and they started sending ads for baby stuff to uh to their customers
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:12.880]  and what happened was they sent a teenage girl um a lot of advertising for for newborn products
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:18.560]  and her dad found it and he got really mad until he found out that yes she was pregnant
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:25.760]  and so target has actually started obfuscating their uh their targeted advertising so it's they
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:30.800]  throw in a couple of random things just so that it's not too creepy um which is a kind of an
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:35.840]  interesting example of that backfiring right sure they're three steps ahead of us they know exactly
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:42.080]  what we need before we need it but if they if they're too obvious about that sure we get sure
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.360]  where the enemy might not know kind of like uh the new film based on a true story about the
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.080]  imitation game yeah you can't let the Nazis know you got their code you got to lose some of the
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:59.200]  battles exactly exactly what they're doing um so you know at the end of the day you know you can
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:03.920]  know all this data right and i think this is actually something that happens a lot with scientists
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:07.920]  you know you you want to solve the problem somebody says to you we need to predict what
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.560]  consumers want and you go all right let's solve it but you don't really think about the social
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:18.240]  aspect you don't really consider oh wait i'm going to freak people out sure target wal-mart for 10
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.640]  years have hidden retina scanners and voice print analysis to quote see what you're looking at down
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:27.280]  to each word but now it's jacked into the nsa and it's really a tracking grid for everyone and
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:32.720]  and of course they're getting the database uh from the feds and out of the dmvs and facebook's involved
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:38.960]  yeah i don't i don't know i mean there's a lot of data sources out there and it's true i think you
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:45.200]  have to think about where the trade-off is worth it you know as you uh as you go out there and use
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.760]  these technologies that are going to collect data about sure let me ask you this question we have the
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.160]  best-selling author a rogo pocket lips author daniel ace wilson you can go to his website
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:57.840]  we'll put it up on screen for tv viewers and we'll give it out before he leaves us here in a few
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:03.280]  minutes in your gut where do you think humanity will be in a hundred years what will we look like
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:08.880]  or will if humanity split off into a hundred different uh you know development grips and will
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:15.920]  there be a galactic renaissance i think one thing that you and i agree on i think is that um
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:22.400]  the the mass number of people not the small number of people who may have most of the money or the
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:28.000]  power i think the vast population of people is really the big decider about what's going to
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.360]  happen for humanity because at the end of the day you know we really vote with our numbers and and
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:39.360]  so i think that the future of humanity is not going to be human beings obsolete i don't think
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:45.200]  it's going to be a bleak future where where we're under the thumb of a of a robot ai that that you
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:50.880]  know makes all of our decisions for us i think that human beings are really adaptable creatures
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:57.440]  and we're really smart and we're really curious and as a result of those really innate aspects
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.160]  of human nature i think we're going to take the technology and we're going to run with it and
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.800]  we're going to combine with it and we're going to use it in our bodies we're going to use it to
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:14.480]  propel ourselves into space i think we really are going to instead of competing against the robots
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:19.840]  we're we're going to probably become more like the robots by integrating this these technological
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:24.800]  advantages into our bodies and into our lives but if that's all engineered by the big five
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:28.880]  globalist companies they're going to have all their backdoors in that like they have backdoors
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:36.640]  everything else today danielhwillson.com really interesting we've only got one short segment

[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:30.000]  endeavors at least you get people thinking about what's happening i mean at the end of your robo
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.520]  apocalypse i don't want to give it away but you know humans merging with the machines i guess is
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:41.120]  what defeats the the original ai uh i just um i just hope my children have a chance to be human
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:48.240]  and if they want to be human yeah yeah i agree uh when you look at their sweet little faces it's
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.880]  hard to imagine this kind of technology you know and and what it would mean but you know my latest
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:58.240]  project is robo genesis it's the sequel to robo apocalypse and it basically picks up right where
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:04.560]  robo apocalypse left off and what it kind of considers more is the impact of massive
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:11.200]  massively intelligent artificial intelligences out there but more than one you know what happens
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:17.520]  whenever we're kind of pawns caught in a bigger game when the ai's are battling each other you
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:22.080]  know and what does that mean for humanity and how do we survive so well the globalist might as well
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:27.440]  be ai's they're totally ruthless they want total power at any cost i mean look at history and that's
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:32.880]  why i'm so pessimistic is that they're already basically using what might as well be ai technology
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.160]  with these big aggregators to manipulate society well yeah you know that's the difference between
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:42.800]  between humans and machines though right is is a human being is going to have some kind of
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:49.120]  understandable in game right whether they want money or whether they want power or both or control
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:53.680]  you know those are all things that you can understand why i want a future destiny and beauty
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:56:00.880]  yeah well and artificial intelligence could be anything because this is coming from essentially
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:07.280]  it's a program right so you know in robo genesis i consider ai that doesn't even know human beings
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:14.240]  exist it's not even aware of us there are other ai that you know want to have more traditional
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:19.520]  goals of controlling human beings or exploiting them but then there are other ai that just want
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:23.760]  to leave you know they want to get out of there and you know you it's it's a really interesting
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:27.680]  to consider all the different facets because i would imagine ai that was truly sent here but
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:33.120]  want to just get out of here yeah well and just because it's sentient doesn't mean that it's sentient
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:38.400]  in a way that you know that we can understand uh yeah it's not like a human sentient i get it
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:43.360]  i mean can it recognize the beauty of a sunset no it's it's it's sentient that it can make its own
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:48.880]  decisions it has its own goal or it might recognize understand the beauty of a sunset on a level that
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:55.040]  we can't even comprehend because it can see the sunset you know from satellites in space and it can
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:01.040]  analyze the you know the cut the spectral content and that you know you know it's it's really
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:05.440]  impossible to predict because they don't use the same sensors that we use they may not have the same
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:11.200]  thought but ai is being designed for war there's the real skynet danger of because it's being
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:17.520]  designed for killing that that be what it breaks i mean not even ai what about a global malfunction
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:24.160]  or a global hack of these systems yeah absolutely i mean and i i think that's there's a there's
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:30.000]  actually a buddy of mine named peter singer wrote wired for war and he's coming out with a new um
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:35.440]  a new novel you should talk to him uh and he talks about exactly this what the future of warfare
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:40.880]  would look like if you can just hack an entire drone fleet and then turn it around and attack
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:46.480]  the person who you're talking about peter professor peter singer at princeton uh he is i think a
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:51.600]  fellow at the brookings institute so he knows about you know political state move he might have
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:55.200]  always been here since i read his writings with the same peter singer well listen very impressive
