[00:00.000 --> 00:12.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.760 --> 00:22.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.800 --> 00:28.120]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen I will tell you what's coming
[00:28.120 --> 00:34.840]  up with our guest and important news after the break that we interrupt the
[00:34.840 --> 00:41.840]  regular kickoff of this radio broadcast to let you know that we are tracking and
[00:41.840 --> 00:47.800]  recording we are recording correct and I'm sure other Austinites and other
[00:47.800 --> 00:55.040]  listeners in the last hour and a half have been recording we are recording
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.280]  okay good just I was saying we are recording and no one was responding
[01:00.280 --> 01:07.320]  that's why I said it five times or whatever a airplane has slammed into a
[01:07.320 --> 01:18.880]  government building first they said the FBI was housed there then they said the
[01:18.880 --> 01:25.120]  IRS was housed there what we know is that federal government parasite
[01:25.120 --> 01:34.120]  operations are going on out of that building that ups the probability that
[01:34.120 --> 01:38.360]  this could be a staged event we don't know airplanes crash into government
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.920]  building sometimes by accident and because I guess a third of the buildings
[01:42.920 --> 01:48.280]  in the country now our government so statistically it's soon it'll be half the
[01:48.280 --> 01:55.000]  buildings then all the buildings they'll have us in slave camps and loin cloths
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.120]  like planted of the apes I guess and so statistically this is suspicious that
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.760]  it's a government building witnesses are saying the plane was it full-throttled
[02:05.760 --> 02:13.600]  different descriptions of the plane but a single engine type aircraft here let's
[02:13.600 --> 02:20.680]  go ahead and fade up KVUE so this was a really hard impact and we're just
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.800]  hoping right now that everyone pulls through thank you so much Noel Newton
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.880]  live from the scene there just recapping those were employees who were in the
[02:30.880 --> 02:34.520]  building at the time they said it felt like an earthquake so you have to imagine
[02:34.520 --> 02:41.600]  that kind of impact with a small plane crashes into a seven-story building we
[02:41.600 --> 02:46.080]  have one point of correction we understand it was a Piper Cherokee 140 not a
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.560]  150 I'm not a plane expert so I'm not sure the difference but we'll be
[02:50.560 --> 02:55.720]  determining the the exact model year etc ownership etc etc as this
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.040]  investigation it really gets rolling it's just starting now again if you're
[03:00.040 --> 03:05.480]  just joining us it was about one hour ago just moments before 10 a.m. when a
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.080]  small single-engine plane crashed into the building that you're looking there
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.600]  live it is the echelon I've lost track of the number though it's building three I
[03:14.600 --> 03:21.760]  think there are federal offices in that complex but not impacted directly by this
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.440]  crash as you just saw though there are quite a few people from occupants from
[03:26.440 --> 03:31.320]  that building that are now just just kind of standing stranded along the road
[03:31.320 --> 03:36.440]  they're waiting for word no doubt okay we'll continue to pop in and monitor the
[03:36.440 --> 03:42.920]  local news channels here they're seeing eyewitnesses are seeing a Piper Cherokee
[03:42.920 --> 03:50.080]  a few of the witnesses this happened about an hour and ten minutes ago here in
[03:50.080 --> 04:00.040]  Austin Texas and there was another small plane crash up in the Panhandle in
[04:00.040 --> 04:06.960]  Amarillo yesterday in Texas so sometimes when it rains it pours and we
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.560]  certainly want to pray for anybody that got hurt or killed and hope that
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.600]  everybody got out of the building safely it shattered it looks like more than a
[04:15.600 --> 04:21.640]  third of the windows out of this medium-sized high-rise building what is
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.840]  that building about 10 stories or so it's the echelon complex there's four
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.320]  buildings and they're saying it's a four-story building looks bigger than
[04:30.320 --> 04:37.400]  that so we will continue to report on this we've got info wars.com reporters
[04:37.400 --> 04:42.400]  being dispatched out to the scene right now in fact they just left so we're gonna
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.840]  be breaking that down and I'm gonna open the phones up when we come back in the
[04:45.840 --> 04:51.400]  next segment specifically to Austinites who are witnesses of this or who have
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.920]  anything to add who've worked in this building or have any other details one

[08:13.960 --> 08:20.000]  decelerator or break pull the throttle in any sort of fashion that it seemed
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.720]  like it was going full throttle one hit the building no but we do hear from FBI
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.600]  that all indications initial indications are this was accidental it may be that
[08:29.600 --> 08:33.920]  the pilot became incapacitated because of a medical condition so we just don't
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.240]  know it's then they may have air traffic control reports to back that up do you
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.360]  know just haven't got those yet but from our raw video you see ladies and
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.040]  gentlemen we are tuning in to some of the local television stations for you
[08:46.040 --> 08:51.800]  across the country this is KVUE the ABC affiliate and we're gonna go over and
[08:51.800 --> 08:58.880]  see what CBS and NBC and Fox are saying giving a little samples of what's their
[08:58.880 --> 09:14.320]  reporting is going on at this building complex in north Austin off of 183 at the
[09:14.320 --> 09:21.840]  echelon complex the building got struck right before 10 o'clock central
[09:21.840 --> 09:36.600]  standard time by a larger single engine plane a lot bigger than a Cessna and
[09:36.600 --> 09:39.840]  we're going to be breaking this down and analyzing it of course off and on
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.640]  throughout the broadcast the building has now burst into flames several floors
[09:45.640 --> 09:53.920]  of the five-story building we've now gotten its actual actual height it was
[09:53.920 --> 09:59.200]  not burning intensely earlier it it has fires much bigger than what we're in
[09:59.200 --> 10:04.440]  building seven on 9-11 the 47-story building that was not hit by an
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.400]  aircraft that a few windows broken out later in the day got fires in it and
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.080]  then collapsed into its own footprint the media reported it had fallen into its
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.200]  own footprint an hour before and then again 25 minutes before on to BBC
[10:18.200 --> 10:27.000]  channels BBC world and of course also on CNN with Aaron Brown and so now the
[10:27.000 --> 10:36.080]  building is almost completely engulfed in black smoke and flames are shooting
[10:36.080 --> 10:42.760]  out of at least three floors that I can see most of the building is obscured the
[10:42.760 --> 10:49.400]  aircraft slamming into the building just caused massive massive amounts of
[10:49.400 --> 10:54.800]  windows from the top floor all the way down to the bottom to be shattered on at
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.200]  least two sides of the building and witnesses reported that the single
[11:00.200 --> 11:07.120]  engine aircraft was it full throttle and so we're going to be opening the phones
[11:07.120 --> 11:15.720]  up for eyewitnesses in Austin Texas that would like to give us more
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.920]  information on this the complex the media's reporting is filled with IRS
[11:21.920 --> 11:28.960]  offices FBI offices they they tend to nest in amongst themselves but there's
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.680]  also a lot of private business in there but whether people work for the IRS the
[11:32.680 --> 11:39.680]  FBI or for a plumbing company we want to pray for everybody inside of the
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.160]  structure when it was hit apparently most people got out to say if we don't
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.120]  have any numbers yet on dead or injured here in Austin Texas but you just heard
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.200]  the FBI saying preliminary investigation is beginning to look like
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.880]  because obviously they've they've been calling the Waco Airport they think the
[11:59.880 --> 12:05.800]  aircraft came from Waco they're running I guess background checks on whoever owns
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.960]  the aircraft or rented the aircraft of course the larger issue here is this
[12:11.960 --> 12:15.920]  building was struck by an aircraft and has flames shooting out of it and we'll
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.000]  see if it collapses of course no modern steel buildings had ever collapsed from
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.800]  fire until 9 11 September 11 2001 and then three of them totally collapsed into
[12:26.800 --> 12:34.760]  their own footprints building seven not hit by an aircraft in Amarillo
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.920]  yesterday another small aircraft slammed into a neighborhood and terrorism has
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.000]  been ruled out there we did have the individual when Clinton was in office
[12:45.000 --> 12:53.440]  fly a Cessna into the front lawn no one was killed or injured but the
[12:53.440 --> 12:59.840]  individual that did it thank God and we have to understand that there's been a
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.240]  big push to take over general aviation people that own their own planes or
[13:05.240 --> 13:13.440]  lease planes or hire pilots and private planes to fly them around general
[13:13.440 --> 13:16.680]  aviation of course is extremely popular in the US and Europe and around the
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.840]  world and there's moves to make you go through airport type body scanners and
[13:21.840 --> 13:29.760]  type security to be able to even fly small aircraft from small airports which
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.560]  of course will create so much cost it will cripple general aviation so we
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.040]  need to resist that we can't give up all of our liberties and freedoms even if
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.800]  there are real terrorists and in almost every case we look at it comes out the
[13:43.800 --> 13:48.080]  government stages the attacks or provocateurs them or opens the door for
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.680]  terrorist in the case of the underwear bomber it's now admitted state
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.200]  department was ordered by an unnamed intelligence agency that's what the
[13:56.200 --> 14:03.320]  undersecretary of the state department has said on record they were ordered to
[14:03.320 --> 14:06.400]  let the underwear bomber get on board the plane and quote helped him get on
[14:06.400 --> 14:09.760]  board then of course you have a smart rest man who can leading past security
[14:09.760 --> 14:16.440]  onto the aircraft without a passport without an ID without anything in one
[14:16.440 --> 14:21.720]  of the tightest secure airports in the country in the world in Europe Amsterdam
[14:21.720 --> 14:27.520]  on that Christmas Day flight into Detroit Michigan so we will continue to
[14:27.520 --> 14:36.080]  follow this and take your phone calls now I know we have a lot of listeners in
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.320]  Austin are you an eyewitness to the aircraft flying into the building or
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.440]  are you an eyewitness other than the new shots we see from driving past it on
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.360]  busy 183 do you know anyone that works in the building there's four buildings in
[14:51.360 --> 14:55.360]  the complex the news is said it's building two and three it doesn't seem
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.680]  that the news knows we've got two of our reporters on the way there now they
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.000]  should get there in the next 20 minutes or so though some of the traffic is
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.720]  backed up so we're gonna learn more being here on the ground in Austin Texas
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.280]  it's just this is somewhat suspicious so we are keeping an eye on these
[15:13.280 --> 15:23.480]  developments right now again there is a four building office complex off of
[15:23.480 --> 15:34.760]  183 or research as it's known in Austin Texas and an aircraft about an hour and
[15:34.760 --> 15:40.280]  15 minutes ago slammed in the building and the building is burning will the
[15:40.280 --> 15:45.680]  building collapse symmetrically into its own footprint according to popular
[15:45.680 --> 15:54.080]  mechanics and NIST a big lighter can burn down a skyscraper any flame and
[15:54.080 --> 15:59.600]  they come right down so we're waiting for this building to fall it was hit by
[15:59.600 --> 16:04.840]  an aircraft building seven was not of course they tried to blow up a large
[16:04.840 --> 16:09.880]  building that they started building back in the late 90s it's gonna be the
[16:09.880 --> 16:16.040]  Intel building and then the dot-com bubble burst and they never finished the
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.360]  what was it 20-story building they built the superstructure and then when they
[16:20.360 --> 16:28.120]  tried to demolish it a few years ago down off of 5th Street and 6th Street
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.560]  they couldn't it didn't fall when they tried to implode it and about 10% of
[16:34.560 --> 16:38.080]  the time even when you have controlled demolition expert companies trying to
[16:38.080 --> 16:40.840]  burn down buildings they can't but if they would have just gone in with a big
[16:40.840 --> 16:44.560]  lighter and put it up against the concrete or the pillars it would have
[16:44.560 --> 16:49.760]  fallen and so we're expecting this building to completely collapse so we
[16:49.760 --> 16:53.600]  hope everyone has gotten out of the building because according to popular
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.400]  mechanics and NIST and the government it should fall in fact the media should be
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.240]  able to report an hour before it falls how it's going to fall and then if the
[17:03.240 --> 17:06.600]  media does report it's gonna fall and then it magically does fall we shouldn't
[17:06.600 --> 17:13.160]  think anything of that because again building 7 is no big deal now we've got
[17:13.160 --> 17:16.880]  callers calling in from Texas and other areas but I specifically want to hear
[17:16.880 --> 17:19.640]  from people that have driven by know someone that works in the buildings
[17:19.640 --> 17:35.840]  someone who witnessed the aircraft flying in 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and
[17:35.840 --> 17:39.320]  we'll open it up to general calls about this issue and any of your concerns or
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.680]  any of the early reporting you saw let's talk to Jason in Texas Jason you're on
[17:43.680 --> 17:45.960]  the air
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.120]  okay what I'm gonna do is since we're going to break is we're gonna go ahead
[17:53.120 --> 17:58.360]  and go to break and then come back because I specifically I specifically want
[17:58.360 --> 18:05.040]  to hear from people who drove by who were early witnesses to the damage of the
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.840]  building before it was completely shrouded in black smoke we could see
[18:09.840 --> 18:17.840]  through some of the smoke and see flames shooting out of several floors 1-800-259-9231
[18:17.840 --> 18:30.360]  I'll also open up the local number 512-646-1776 512-646-1776 or 888-2012244
[18:30.360 --> 18:41.880]  now I am not just going to cover this today we have Rush Limbaugh Bill O'Reilly
[18:41.880 --> 18:51.400]  Sean Hannity slimeball Chris Matthews all of them right now saying basically the
[18:51.400 --> 18:59.040]  truth that there is a fight for who will steer the general direction of the Tea
[18:59.040 --> 19:04.400]  Party movement in this country and in Nevada and California and Texas and many
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.600]  other states I have big stacks of news here all of these big official real tea
[19:09.600 --> 19:13.240]  tea parties are saying we're not working with the Republican Party we're not

[23:58.560 --> 24:07.140]  smoking gun heard around the world they're reporting that a piper
[24:07.140 --> 24:14.520]  Cherokee slammed into a office building in Austin Texas the building is on fire
[24:14.520 --> 24:21.120]  the five-story structure there are a lot of government offices in the building
[24:21.120 --> 24:26.680]  but this is probably just somebody that had a heart attack and press down on the
[24:26.680 --> 24:41.640]  throttle today Tesla motors out in California got hit by another airplane
[24:41.640 --> 24:52.840]  that took off in fog hit a power pole power is out to much of the city says
[24:52.840 --> 24:57.600]  electricity was cut across Palo Alto affecting 28,000 customers enforcing
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.680]  Stanford Hospital and other emergency center crews are out there trying to
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.640]  restore power but again cut the power off of the hospital the plane was taking
[25:06.640 --> 25:14.520]  off struck a power tower said Palo Alto police captain John Chalmers and the
[25:14.520 --> 25:20.120]  bottom line is this I've seen different statistics but it's in some cases 20
[25:20.120 --> 25:27.760]  times safer to travel in an airplane statistically than it is to travel in
[25:27.760 --> 25:32.560]  cars cars the number one cause of death until you go past the age of 55 on
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.720]  average and it's hard to tax and cancer but cars are the most dangerous thing
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.240]  out there but people see car wrecks all the time so it's not big news when a
[25:41.240 --> 25:48.480]  plane crashes it is we're a country of 300 million people there are how many
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.320]  tens of thousands of different flights every day so you're gonna have a plane
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.960]  crash every few days sometimes you won't have one for a week sometimes there'll
[25:55.960 --> 26:02.640]  be four or five in one day but this is particularly bad because it slammed into
[26:02.640 --> 26:06.600]  a building full of people and the Southern aircraft on takeoff slammed into
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.760]  a power pole and that had executives on it that clearly wasn't some some al-qaeda
[26:11.760 --> 26:19.280]  operation but the public has been so conditioned to be scared of this that it
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.560]  is obviously big news so I've said that I mean I've you know put out the basics
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.040]  on that front let's take a few calls from Austinites that are witnesses on
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.840]  this and I'm gonna get into other news we'll continue to touch on this as
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.560]  things develop we're waiting for the building to fully collapse due to fires
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.040]  in the building according to the government if you have fires in a
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.480]  building it will collapse it's totally normal after 2001 the laws of physics
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.480]  changed let's talk to Francis in Austin Francis you're on the air hey
[26:45.480 --> 26:51.040]  Alex how's it going it's actually Ram this like Egyptian yeah I work in the
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.240]  I work in the building next to the FBI building which is next to the building
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.440]  that got hit by the plane basically we heard we heard what sounded like an
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.320]  explosion but it felt like earthquake for about two seconds maybe and we just
[27:07.320 --> 27:12.080]  all ran out to go see go see what had happened and we see that you know the
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.760]  entire side of the building is on fire and this was within maybe two minutes of
[27:16.760 --> 27:21.480]  the plane having crashed into it and already there were feds out there there
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.480]  were you know the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force was already there and I guess
[27:25.480 --> 27:29.320]  it's because you know the building's right next door to them but what was
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.520]  odd is that they were one one of the FBI agents was filming the building and the
[27:35.520 --> 27:39.840]  other the other Fed was just filming everybody in the crowd I'm not exactly
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.040]  sure what that even does but yeah that's what he was doing and there were
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.640]  cars up front and the cars that had been driving by they had stopped dead their
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.240]  windows were blown out people were shocked it was terrible now again let's
[27:55.240 --> 28:00.840]  get your name straight how do I pronounce it it's a Ramzes okay Ramzes
[28:00.840 --> 28:07.840]  Farrell Ramzes is a planet member correct okay well you're you're live with
[28:07.840 --> 28:12.160]  us right now on air and I appreciate you calling in you go back to the last thing
[28:12.160 --> 28:16.560]  you said there were windows blown out did you see any injured people I mean
[28:16.560 --> 28:22.640]  break it down for us I didn't see anybody injured you know aside from the
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.160]  people that had been driving right in front of the building basically their
[28:26.160 --> 28:32.280]  cars were you know just pelted and their windows were blown out one lady just got
[28:32.280 --> 28:37.520]  out was in shock immediately and I took a good look at the building up close we
[28:37.520 --> 28:40.760]  walked right up to it before even you know the police fire department showed
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.160]  up I took a good look at the side of the building and you know you can it doesn't
[28:46.160 --> 28:50.280]  look like a plane went in it but you know I believe that it did but as far as
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.960]  the building collapsing there there is no way that it is going to collapse I mean
[28:55.960 --> 28:59.760]  no wait a minute I mean no plane hit building seven and it fell perfectly
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.160]  into its own footprint at freefall speeds so I mean this building is
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.160]  probably according to the government it should completely collapse I know right
[29:09.160 --> 29:14.800]  I mean the damage to this building here in Austin was from a plane and and I
[29:14.800 --> 29:18.240]  look at that and I don't see it collapsing still it looked the structure
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.640]  looks like it's gonna hold and they're saying building seven was taken down by
[29:21.640 --> 29:25.960]  just debris I can guarantee you that this small plane did more damage than the
[29:25.960 --> 29:30.200]  debris from the World Trade Center said the building seven and I'll stay there
[29:30.200 --> 29:34.000]  stay there ram charger I'm just gonna call you that well and we're gonna come
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.640]  right back and yet the gentleman from Austin to finish up any other key points
[29:39.640 --> 29:47.680]  he wants to make and we'll talk to Brian also calling in from Austin and we'll
[29:47.680 --> 29:51.320]  take a few other calls as well again I have stacks of news here in front of me

[31:12.120 --> 31:15.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous
[31:15.880 --> 31:20.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[31:20.920 --> 31:26.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[31:26.280 --> 31:31.200]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[31:31.200 --> 31:35.600]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[31:35.600 --> 31:39.360]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[31:39.360 --> 31:43.320]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[31:43.320 --> 31:48.960]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[32:00.840 --> 32:05.680]  Hi neighbor no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply every
[32:05.680 --> 32:09.680]  single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets even those who haven't
[32:09.680 --> 32:13.240]  wasted a single penny on Christmas birthdays and vacations in order to
[32:13.240 --> 32:17.520]  store all the food possible even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time
[32:17.520 --> 32:21.840]  jobs to buy food even those who have traded their gold while it will still
[32:21.840 --> 32:27.480]  buy food yes we will have been called stupid crazy and foolish when folks
[32:27.480 --> 32:31.320]  won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of
[32:31.320 --> 32:36.560]  money we will still have two regrets we will regret that we didn't get more
[32:36.560 --> 32:41.520]  serious about more food sooner we will deeply regret that we didn't get enough
[32:41.520 --> 32:45.840]  food putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous
[32:45.840 --> 32:53.560]  decision that some of us will ever make call 800 409 5633 on the web eFoods

[33:08.800 --> 33:12.720]  it appears that's where the plane entered the building again very preliminary
[33:12.720 --> 33:17.040]  information we are not exactly sure the exact impact point but it does appear on
[33:17.040 --> 33:20.120]  the north side of the building where the plane went in it is a small plane it's
[33:20.120 --> 33:23.800]  not a large commercial jet or anything like that is a small plane so we know
[33:23.800 --> 33:26.560]  who was in the airplane no not at this time that part is still under
[33:26.560 --> 33:37.960]  investigation that's all all that is under investigation we just all that
[33:37.960 --> 33:43.560]  ourselves we don't know what that's from any other questions
[33:43.560 --> 33:59.880]  you've been listening there to John Salazar we're gathering the news every
[33:59.880 --> 34:03.280]  way we can right now you see still pictures coming in we're getting updates
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.840]  through Twitter through Facebook that was John Salazar our photographer here at
[34:07.840 --> 34:11.680]  the station holding his cell phone up there at the news conference right
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.560]  outside that building that you see there where the plane went in this morning
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.000]  and a subsequent fire has okay that's more of the local news again I'm gonna
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.200]  break from this story here in a few minutes but I want to go through some
[34:23.200 --> 34:30.080]  more of your calls first from witnesses before we do that but going back to
[34:30.080 --> 34:38.200]  Ramses who is in the building next door to this echelon complex that has a whole
[34:38.200 --> 34:44.840]  bunch of different federal agencies in at the IRS the FBI you name it this is
[34:44.840 --> 34:50.680]  probably just somebody that had a heart attack that's even what the FBI is saying
[34:50.680 --> 34:56.480]  we hope that is the case but you never know we are watching this closely because
[34:56.480 --> 35:02.880]  it does have government offices in it like building seven and maybe maybe
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.800]  since this has feds in it and they have access to the pillars maybe it's gonna
[35:07.800 --> 35:12.480]  collapse in its own footprint like building seven did wowing all of the
[35:12.480 --> 35:20.280]  physicists and architects and engineers and in changing building science I mean
[35:20.280 --> 35:26.880]  will the echelon building five stories fall into its own footprint from fires
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.440]  everyone is watching the world is watching we were taught the new physics
[35:32.440 --> 35:41.520]  September 11 2001 we're all waiting watching will it collapse when will it
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.720]  collapse according to the government this is what's gonna happen going back
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.480]  to Ramses and then to others that are down there on the scene Ramses anything
[35:52.480 --> 35:57.280]  else you'd like to add yeah yeah I just like to add that you know I always had
[35:57.280 --> 36:01.240]  my doubts you know I thought maybe about the whole building seven things I thought
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.680]  maybe you know there's a chance it was you know debris that caused it you know
[36:05.680 --> 36:08.920]  I'd see the video and you like you know that far is not really burning that
[36:08.920 --> 36:12.760]  bright but who knows what the debris did but after seeing what happened to a
[36:12.760 --> 36:18.400]  seven-story building here often with an actual plane you know just ran into it
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.160]  full speed and it's obviously standing there and it looks the structure okay
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.720]  the new said five story because I'm so it's seven story I think it's a seven
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.760]  story building yeah more than five but yeah after seeing that after seeing a
[36:33.760 --> 36:39.880]  plane go into it and just I mean yeah it's damaged partially on one side it
[36:39.880 --> 36:43.320]  looks pretty bad but you can take one look at it and you know it's not gonna
[36:43.320 --> 36:47.440]  collapse and so that just makes me doubt the whole building seven things I mean
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.920]  from debris alone and then intense fires I just no way this is a this is a good
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.640]  you know this is a good example to look at here I know it's not an exact
[36:57.640 --> 37:01.600]  comparison but I mean this is a plane going in there's a small plane going
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.880]  into a small building and this building is doing just fine well Ramses if it's
[37:06.880 --> 37:11.440]  alright with you we'd like to get your number and have John get it if you don't
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.720]  want to that's fine and then perhaps you can come out and talk to our team that
[37:16.720 --> 37:23.520]  is almost there right now about to be on scene and I know they're listening to
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.480]  the radio right now as they drive there what do you think the best place for
[37:26.480 --> 37:33.120]  them to park is they have Jollyville Road which is where the building is on
[37:33.120 --> 37:36.320]  I'm actually living I live in the apartment complex across from this
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.240]  building as well and I work in the building next to it Jollyville it's
[37:41.240 --> 37:48.600]  still open just not directly in front of the building it is a Mopac 183
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.960]  intersection where Jollyville meets it that'd be a good place to park yeah I
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.280]  definitely tried to get to old Jollyville Road to park there and yeah I'm
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.040]  totally out I already gave him my phone number you know I'm prison plan a
[38:01.040 --> 38:03.880]  member I'm sure you look me up I've actually written a couple articles for
[38:03.880 --> 38:08.480]  it for tell you the truth well awesome awesome well listen it's great to have
[38:08.480 --> 38:11.920]  you calling in and I'm glad that you can be there and report for us call us back
[38:11.920 --> 38:14.680]  if anything else develops and the guys will be there in a few minutes
[38:14.680 --> 38:22.280]  definitely thanks thanks for the work you done and on a more serious note but
[38:22.280 --> 38:26.880]  it is serious the government says that small fires make 47 story buildings
[38:26.880 --> 38:32.360]  fall at freefall speed into their own footprint according to all the engineers
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.880]  impossible they've changed their story six times on building seven the fed
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.400]  said now they say they don't know what did it and so it is a joke because it's
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.400]  such a fraud and a lie to say that small fires make buildings fall in their own
[38:46.400 --> 38:54.000]  footprints and clearly building seven was a controlled demolition but it's not
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.440]  a joking matter because the government puts out these magnitude of lies with a
[38:57.440 --> 39:04.320]  straight face so we'll continue to cover this and follow this as it unfolds
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.520]  today let's go to Brian in Texas Brian what have you seen Brian just hung up
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.320]  five seconds before I went to him the callers are good at that let's talk to
[39:16.320 --> 39:23.080]  Tom in Indiana says he has news from Fox Tom what do you got for us hey Alex on
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.560]  the major Fox network they're saying that the guy said his own house on fire
[39:27.560 --> 39:37.960]  and and TSB is saying it may may have been an intentional act well that's bad
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.340]  news and the fact that this is a government building I had suspicions
[39:41.340 --> 39:45.960]  early on Jaren is nodding his head right as I went to your call he's was
[39:45.960 --> 39:52.280]  printing off articles about this and so Fox television National the problem is
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.920]  they're so deceptive you don't know but it is the direct Pentagon mouthpiece so
[39:56.920 --> 40:02.880]  what comes out of their mouth you've got to pay attention to their saying Tom in
[40:02.880 --> 40:10.600]  fact guys flip over to Fox cable news for me right now be specific Tom exactly
[40:10.600 --> 40:17.440]  what is Fox saying Fox is saying that the guy burn his own house down the pilot
[40:17.440 --> 40:23.120]  the plane burn his own house down they're also reporting and TSB that it
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.560]  may be an intentional act and that nor had took in what two F-16s up in the
[40:29.560 --> 40:34.840]  air but wait a minute hopper mechanics lied and said that they only launched
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.800]  one plane in the year before 9-11 their internal records of course showed over
[40:38.800 --> 40:45.760]  160 cases of F-16s being launched my dad's a private pilot didn't have a
[40:45.760 --> 40:50.200]  zest anymore but he flew years ago and I mean he knew well that if you got off
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.520]  track and didn't fly on your flight plan they always launch F-16s on people he
[40:54.520 --> 40:58.680]  knew people that had pilots that F-16s launched on them when they had plane
[40:58.680 --> 41:04.360]  trouble or when they had to fly around a storm and fly over restricted airspace
[41:04.360 --> 41:10.360]  but on 9-11 no no no they waited 40 something minutes to even launch them
[41:10.360 --> 41:15.480]  and then Cheney ordered they fly at the lowest speed that an F-16 can stay in
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.560]  the air with and this is just absolutely horrible news we'll try to double
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.920]  check that and confirm it go ahead I appreciate your call Tom this is getting
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.040]  worse by the second folks do you realize how this and yes it's confirmed Fox
[41:31.040 --> 41:39.000]  News NTSB pilot may have set house on fire before Austin crash nor had launched
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.880]  two F-16s in response to plane crash in response that means after the plane
[41:45.880 --> 41:55.640]  crashed update NTSB investigating Austin plane crash as an intentional act
[41:55.640 --> 42:01.000]  I'm sure Watson's already on this but I have him doing so much call Curtin ammo
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.280]  and Watson and make sure they're tuned in and already on top this NTSB pilot may
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.840]  have set home on fire before taking off Texas plane crash does not appear to be
[42:10.840 --> 42:22.280]  terrorism the FBI says Harris Falkner is reporting on Fox FBI office is close to
[42:22.280 --> 42:28.400]  crash site but not in same building that's part of the same complex but it
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.920]  can get confusing from the air if you're intentionally trying to fly in off of
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.880]  GPS and hit your target and you know when you got four buildings that all look
[42:38.880 --> 42:50.120]  the same in the same echelon complex this is just horrible NTSB official told
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.040]  Fox News they're investigating Austin Texas plane crash is an intentional act
[42:55.040 --> 43:00.080]  and so it appears the pilot set his home on fire and then got in his plane and
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.560]  flew into the building spokesman however told Fox News that we cannot confirm or
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.360]  deny that that's kind of like they said they caught the number two in the
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.680]  Taliban right as they were launching that military operation and we're running
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.760]  into resistance is kind of a PR stunt then days later they said well we can't
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.560]  confirm or deny that and turns out it was fake so you don't know I mean this
[43:21.560 --> 43:24.920]  could just be Fox News wanting to scare everybody to oh my gosh you better give
[43:24.920 --> 43:31.960]  all our rights up the point is we know 100% the underwear bombing attack on
[43:31.960 --> 43:37.200]  Christmas was staged that is a hundred percent documented we've done multiple
[43:37.200 --> 43:42.720]  articles and broadcast on that hands down absolute staged event I've told
[43:42.720 --> 43:49.800]  you that I believe they're gonna stage mass shootings that I believe they're
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.760]  gonna stage an attempt at assassination on Obama and I've even said I believe
[43:55.760 --> 43:58.840]  they're gonna use small planes to attack buildings as a pretext to shut down
[43:58.840 --> 44:03.760]  general aviation this is how it works somebody kills somebody with a car one
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.320]  old guy has a heart attack drives through a crowd of people kills a few people
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.680]  and they talk about banning people above 70 from driving cars in France a few
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.560]  people a year kill their husbands or wives
[44:21.320 --> 44:27.440]  and so they say well we may have social services visit all families now and make
[44:27.440 --> 44:30.800]  sure husband and wives don't raise their voices at each other or will arrest you
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.560]  in France or all parents are bad all parents have to have a camera in their
[44:35.560 --> 44:46.880]  home guilty until proven innocent to make sure you're not abusing your kids the
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.600]  drudge report has the headline and we've now got this all up on info wars
[44:50.600 --> 44:59.240]  calm and prison planet calm they've got the headline that the man attacked the
[44:59.240 --> 45:07.600]  IRS headline Austin fireball man targets IRS with plane man I was really
[45:07.600 --> 45:12.000]  hoping the FBI was right initially saying that all indications are this is
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.400]  not terrorism oh man they're they're never gonna give us a break government
[45:19.400 --> 45:31.360]  building has a good size Piper Cherokee flown into it it's like it's like a six
[45:31.360 --> 45:41.360]  seater one of those stretch single engines and it flies into the building
[45:41.360 --> 45:49.000]  and they're just gonna have a heyday with this by the way I meant to lead
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.520]  with this story today fourth amendment trash is airport tyranny hits the
[45:55.520 --> 46:02.320]  streets now I reported this in 2004 this is in my film martial law even though we
[46:02.320 --> 46:06.280]  have the Associated Press and photos of it people still don't believe it in Dallas
[46:06.280 --> 46:18.800]  in Houston in Boston in Miami in Tampa in Waco Texas in LA in New York
[46:18.800 --> 46:26.360]  they have TSA at bus stops and train stops and stations randomly searching
[46:26.360 --> 46:31.160]  people now they're putting in x-ray machines and it's on the news we have
[46:31.160 --> 46:35.640]  the article up on prison planet.com we have the video clips showing them Pat
[46:35.640 --> 46:40.800]  searches grabbing women's breasts it's always the same these are acts of
[46:40.800 --> 46:48.440]  submission acts of domestication I was watching a Nigerian execution videos
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.320]  that are all over the news last night where they capture these people and
[46:52.320 --> 46:55.880]  execute them in the streets and they just march them over by lines of dead
[46:55.880 --> 46:58.960]  bodies they tell them sit down and they shoot them in the back of the head I'm
[46:58.960 --> 47:07.400]  gonna at least fight or try to run but see this is learned helplessness just
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.120]  like the Jews in Nazi Germany running into the pits you know they run a line
[47:11.120 --> 47:14.320]  of people in they shoot them in the back of the head they run another line in the
[47:14.320 --> 47:17.600]  people say yes sir and are very polite holding hat in hand and run in to be
[47:17.600 --> 47:26.560]  killed not me okay not me no no sir and that's what the body scanners and the
[47:26.560 --> 47:29.880]  groping your wife's breast and recording your children's naked bodies is all
[47:29.880 --> 47:34.360]  about and wanting to ban general aviation and wanting to make you get a
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.520]  special psychological test to be able to have a car because somebody might do
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.280]  something what about the government doing something the number one killer of
[47:43.280 --> 47:54.200]  people after cars number one killer is cars unless you count government what
[47:54.200 --> 48:00.080]  about you people who've been caught staging stuff this stinks to high heaven
[48:00.080 --> 48:06.600]  they set the house on fire and wake up they've got total remote control and any
[48:06.600 --> 48:12.800]  aircraft they want they shoot him up or they could even kill him put his dead
[48:12.800 --> 48:17.640]  body in the plane have it take off and go fly into a building they've actually
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.760]  had false flags where governments have actually been caught doing those exact
[48:21.760 --> 48:25.760]  type of things they've caught in the Middle East different Western
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.160]  intelligence agencies killing somebody putting your body in a car remote
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.480]  controlling it with explosives or they'll just bomb buildings and just say a
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.960]  suicide bomber did it as Ray McGovern covered here on air witnesses for a
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.160]  half day watched us forces go into the golden mosque and wire it and blow it up
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.120]  and they said oh no suicide bomber did it they just give you a story and you
[48:45.120 --> 48:52.640]  buy it if this is terrorism I would give it preliminary 50-50 that it's
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.120]  government this may have been somebody mad the IRS may have ruined his life he
[48:57.120 --> 49:00.960]  may have said hey you're not getting my house I'm burning it down and I'm flying
[49:00.960 --> 49:08.520]  a plane into your building 50-50 this is real because people are fed up you
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.680]  don't take my rides because you push people up at the edge uh-uh I'd say
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.240]  50-50 this is a real if it's a terrorist attack on our godlike
[49:19.240 --> 49:25.320]  government that makes the sunshine makes the grass grow oh we praise you big
[49:25.320 --> 49:28.720]  government thank you for everything you do thank you for the sodium fluoride in
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.000]  the water thank you for the mercury in the shots thanks for the GMO corn that
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  makes the rats organs fail and makes our organs fail thank you for everything

[49:48.440 --> 49:55.520]  the point is you're not taking my rights away okay but if this is a terrorist
[49:55.520 --> 50:02.240]  attack and it's starting to look like there's a good chance it is 50-50 we
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.760]  don't know this could be a disgruntled angry person pushed too far because the
[50:06.760 --> 50:09.880]  more I think about it the burning down of the house would be you're not getting
[50:09.880 --> 50:18.840]  this either you're not getting anything scum in this guy's mind the issue here
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.640]  though is they don't care they just print the money up they just want your
[50:22.640 --> 50:27.880]  house to control you pal they're not actually funded off the money they take
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.840]  from you don't be confused by that that's only used to domesticate you in

[53:46.280 --> 53:50.720]  thanks for letting us help you get back to basics read all of the testimonials
[53:50.720 --> 53:55.920]  at ofthefield.com you can order online for you and your loved ones or call
[53:55.920 --> 54:08.600]  1-888-51 eat free to share in the secret
[54:08.600 --> 54:16.960]  you can do it very quickly however I would say you can also there are other
[54:16.960 --> 54:21.360]  parts in the airplane have numbers on them but you know with the fire you
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.160]  it's gonna be a while before they get that you know what they might do if I
[54:26.160 --> 54:30.280]  was running this thing I would find out there's information this guy said his
[54:30.280 --> 54:34.360]  house on fire I'd find out first of all who he is and I'd run the database from
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.720]  the FAA to see if he does on an airplane and if not see if he has a pilot's
[54:38.720 --> 54:41.760]  license and if he's got a pilot's license find out where he was trained and
[54:41.760 --> 54:44.640]  that's probably that's probably gonna be where he took off from. Alright Denny
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.960]  John has a question for you too when he is a pilot. Right yeah we're just getting
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.480]  some information from the NTSB that they are sending staff out of Dallas as
[54:53.480 --> 55:00.600]  well as out of Washington DC in DC they are saying they cannot confirm the
[55:00.600 --> 55:05.360]  possibility that this might be intentional but we are getting that from
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.640]  some of our people who are who are saying that that is the belief at this
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.880]  point from local NTSB authorities they believe that this was an intentional
[55:13.880 --> 55:18.880]  act and again for those of you who might be saying oh you know can't the FAA do
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.000]  a better job of keeping track of pilots and making sure that there aren't
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.520]  pilots with criminal intent out there you know bent on this kind of
[55:26.520 --> 55:31.280]  destruction. Worth pointing out that people do crazy things every day with
[55:31.280 --> 55:36.280]  whatever resources they have at their disposal and most people generally you
[55:36.280 --> 55:41.040]  know might use a car to do something like this. This is the aberration
[55:41.040 --> 55:46.120]  certainly that if this turns out to be a pilot who is is intentionally trying to
[55:46.120 --> 55:49.720]  inflict this kind of damage it is certainly. We're giving you samples of
[55:49.720 --> 55:54.360]  the national and local news coming to you live from Austin Texas it is the 18th
[55:54.360 --> 56:00.440]  day of February 2010 on this Thursday edition David Ike was already scheduled
[56:00.440 --> 56:03.520]  for the show today he'll be joining us at eight after in the next hour we'll
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.680]  sample cast two hours and 52 minutes of the four-hour radio broadcast live on
[56:08.680 --> 56:15.520]  television at prisonplanet.tv so again thank you for joining us today
[56:15.520 --> 56:20.160]  we'll continue throughout the broadcast to take your calls and monitor this CNN
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.720]  is reporting that they've talked to federal officials with the FBI who are
[56:25.720 --> 56:36.000]  confirming that he burned his house down intentionally and that stole the plane
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.760]  and then flew it in intentionally so that it was not his aircraft that he
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.920]  burned his house down and then stole the plane and flew it in intentionally you
[56:44.920 --> 56:55.000]  cannot believe one word these people say again if this is a terrorist attack as
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.640]  new info comes out it's gone from a 50-50 chance if it is a terrorist attack
[57:00.640 --> 57:06.720]  it's gone from a 50-50 chance that he was truly disgruntled and did this
[57:06.720 --> 57:18.200]  because that could really happen people are angry out there or or this could be
[57:18.200 --> 57:22.480]  staged and it's gone in the last 10 minutes from being 50-50 in my mind to
[57:22.480 --> 57:31.000]  being 45-55 55% chance in my dead reckoning brain that this is a
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.800]  staged event if it's terror and by the end of the show it may be an 80% as we
[57:35.800 --> 57:40.320]  learn more it took me a few weeks to figure out exactly what was going on
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.640]  with the underwear bomber and now it's admitted the government protected him
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.640]  let him on the plane for national security reasons other people on the
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.760]  plane somebody else with a bomb somebody helped him get on the plane on and on
[57:51.760 --> 57:57.080]  and on no doubt that staged notice we had the Fort Hood shooting where he
[57:57.080 --> 58:01.360]  specifically for years was talking to supposed al-qaeda operatives who are
[58:01.360 --> 58:06.360]  known triple agents who set up everybody who always handle the patsy's the one
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.440]  guy that always does it was his name and the CIA knew the FBI knew and won't give
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.440]  Congress the documents under national security notice that happened north of
[58:16.440 --> 58:22.160]  Austin and Fort Hood and what a perfect way to demonize the tea parties if this
[58:22.160 --> 58:31.400]  is an anti-fellow reserve anti-income tax guy this morning before this even
[58:31.400 --> 58:36.560]  happened from watching the news it became clear to me that they're gonna stage
[58:36.560 --> 58:39.440]  terror attacks and blame it on the tea parties well I've been saying that on the
[58:39.440 --> 58:41.960]  last two weeks

[59:53.560 --> 1:00:01.280]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:20.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:34.400]  Alex Jones here is the latest information the pilot of the plane had set
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:38.680]  his house on fire beforehand stole the plane and crashed it intentionally a
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:44.880]  federal official is told seeing in a few minutes before that federal officials
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.800]  said two F-16 fighter jets were launched as a precaution after the crash
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:55.240]  though terrorist intent was not indicated earlier than that they said
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:01:03.800]  preliminary information indicates the plane was a Cirrus SR-22 the news the
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:10.920]  FBI earlier had said it appeared to be a piper of some type a Cirrus SR-22 is a
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.120]  single-engine four-seat aircraft and guys pull up a photo we go live at
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:26.320]  prisonplanet.tv in the next segment of a Cirrus SR-22 aircraft please want to be
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:34.360]  able to show folks what a Cirrus SR-22 aircraft looks like again ladies and
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:38.240]  gentlemen this could just be an accident somebody that a heart attack as we
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:43.280]  said the start of the show but doesn't look like that now the feds normally
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:46.000]  won't come out and start saying that something's terrorist unless they're
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  gonna go with that whether it's true or not and the fact that he supposedly
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:01.920]  burned down his house and then stole this aircraft I would say it's a 45%
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:07.680]  chance if it is terror that he did this on his own 55% chance as of now with the
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:14.560]  info we have why do I say 55% chance it could be staged this is their ammo they
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:18.520]  burned somebody's house down take them shoot them up with drugs kill them put
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:23.840]  them in a remote control aircraft have a takeoff fly it into the building we know
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:28.400]  the underwear event was staged that's now admitted there's no doubting and the
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:31.560]  media swept it under the rug don't want to talk about it anymore there's all
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:34.760]  this resistance to naked body scanners they want to put them in not just
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:39.880]  airports but courthouses and all the major bus terminals and it train
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:43.200]  terminals it in fact they're going in now that was gonna be our big story
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:53.600]  today so if they come out if it comes out that this guy was a tea partier and
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:03:03.640]  was angry at the IRS and the Federal Reserve that would still be the MO of
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:08.960]  a lone individual who's angry at the government who would do this on their own
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:15.720]  so we'll have to look and see if he'd been in psychiatric care if he'd been in
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:21.680]  the military if he disappeared in the last few months because that was the
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.640]  main thrust of the MK hold for program was to just erase people's memories and
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:34.680]  just set them up as patsy's I don't know ladies and gentlemen I don't know we're
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.880]  gonna have to continue to ferret this out send your news tips to show tips and
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:44.840]  full wars calm send them to Kurt Nemo Paul Watson Steve Watson Aaron Dykes
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:49.440]  they're all working around the clock right now feverishly to break this down
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:54.600]  we are in Austin Texas we do have reporters now they're on the scene I'm
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:57.600]  gonna get a report from them coming up at the bottom of the hour after we start
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:05.240]  talking to David Ike obviously we'll get his take on this situation as well we've
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:10.400]  got Randy Thomas Andy and others that have comments on what's been developing
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:14.480]  I normally like to have David icon to get his view on the globalist operations
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:18.440]  and their brainwashing and the false reality they've invoked over the
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:21.600]  population but we'll obviously get him to respond to this as well and take

[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:19.840]  Jones on the GCN radio network okay for the next hour and a half former BBC
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:26.880]  reporter champion goalie best-selling author researcher David Ike is our guest
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:31.920]  and I had him scheduled to talk about basically the state of the planet what's
[1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:36.520]  going on one of other breaking issues we're going to be covering that but
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:40.920]  off and on will give you new developments on the burning building the
[1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:47.720]  echelon complex a small single engine plane slammed into it at about 955 this
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:53.720]  morning about two hours and ten minutes ago roughly and they're now
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:09:00.840]  reporting news radio 590 k lbj one of our affiliates as well as CNN that this
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:06.560]  individual burned down his house in some type of domestic dispute and then
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:10.760]  first they said stole a plane or now they're saying it's his plane and flew
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:19.920]  it into the building so this could be a angry crazy person that did this or it
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.960]  could be completely staged because this is the type of stuff governments do if
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.240]  they can actually connect into the tea party and the people that don't want to
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:31.280]  pay higher taxes oh you don't like going bankrupt you don't like that housing
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.960]  values are going down but we're raising your property taxes nationwide we're
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:39.200]  raising your business taxes as on average nationwide just the last year
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:44.680]  they've got a 14.2 percent that's the national average decline in sales tax
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:50.360]  revenue oh you don't like higher taxes you're a terrorist we know the feds
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:54.440]  bombed Oklahoma City that's completely proven we know they carried out the
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:57.720]  underwear bombing on Christmas that submitted the feds ordered him allowed
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:03.480]  on the plane protected him you know the whole story we know Joe Biden said two
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:07.400]  days ago I'm worried about lone nuts and terror attacks and yes I'm worried
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:11.920]  about assassination attempts on Obama in the past month Beck's been saying 911
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:16.520]  truthers and birthers and tea party people so now he's even going after
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:20.280]  mainline conservatives more than half of conservatives polled believe Obama's
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:24.760]  lying about his birth certificate covering enough now you are a terrorist you
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:31.040]  want to bomb buildings you want to kill Obama so it's the preparation and then
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:38.280]  being caught staging the underwear bombing that really brings this into
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:42.680]  full view that this is very suspicious it may be staged because this is the
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:46.960]  season of terror their whole agenda is stalling their swine flu hoax is falling
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:51.640]  apart their global warming hoax is falling apart their new wars are falling
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:55.960]  apart their whole agenda is stalling people are awakening and suddenly you
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:00.120]  see the Fort Hood event clearly staged it took us months to be able to get
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.520]  enough evidence of that but the government surely knew protected him he was
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:07.640]  being handled by this particular al-qaeda leader who handles all the other
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:11.760]  patsies it goes on and on and we'll talk about that with David right now then
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:17.640]  coming up I remember David 15 years ago really talking about this when many
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:22.520]  others weren't and since then it's come out in mainstream news that in France
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:27.280]  and England and the US we've had all these homeland security state heads and
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:31.800]  others and we've had that just thousands of cases we had the Texas Youth
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:38.000]  Commission where it turned out every major facility was raping children and
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.040]  the CPS and 3400 missing kids CNN reported in Florida that the government
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:47.440]  takes 3400 missing in one year of the hundreds of thousands that you know they
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:53.360]  take all over the country tens of thousands in Florida 3400 missing and
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:56.360]  they won't say where they are and there's no investigation they just take
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:00.920]  your kids and they disappear and Ted Gunderson if this was actually in the
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:06.440]  Washington Times got into the finders a fake charity and it was all this
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:09.800]  child porn and the CIA had warned them and they just gotten out with the kids
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.320]  and then they caught CIA with a van loaded naked kids and I mean just this
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:20.760]  is in the major news and the Franklin cover-up and the Bohemian Grove stuff
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:27.000]  this is the cement that brings them all together and I saw stories out of the
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.040]  press journal and other big Scottish publications sex abuse family legal
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.560]  advisor arrested the police are arresting their legal advisors in courts
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:41.840]  media people anyone that talks about it before there was even a gag order if you
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:45.800]  try to go give a public speaking engagement they arrest you and charge
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:49.520]  you with this orderly conduct because this woman and others are accusing police
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:55.960]  by name of running this pedophile ring now the whole issue is is there free
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:59.880]  speech in England is there free speech in the UK is there's free speech in
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:04.120]  Scotland and so there's this wider web so I just gave you some of the back story
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:10.200]  that's coming up David I good to have you with us so much is happening let's
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:15.200]  talk about the season of stage terror the Fort Hood the underwear bombing now
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:20.120]  what's happening in Austin what's your take on it well it's becoming blatant
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:26.240]  and it's becoming blatant not least because it's becoming desperate you know
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:33.480]  I've seen over the last 20 years three stages very clear in the uncovering of
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:37.640]  what's really happening in the world the first one was instant dismissal
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:43.120]  instant ridicule and also instant condemnation the second stage which
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:49.720]  really started to run after 9-11 and even more when when the the Iraq invasion
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:57.160]  hopes became very clearly exposed as a massive lie all along we went into the
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:02.160]  stage two which was people starting to say hold on a second the world is not
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:07.760]  like we thought it was now we're starting to enter we're on this cusp indeed
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:13.480]  we're beyond it this third stage where that awakening that awareness that the
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:19.200]  world is not like that we thought it was is starting to impact on events we
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.880]  demolished the fantastic work over the internet and many many people over the
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:31.480]  months of 2009 demolished this wine flu scam absolutely devastated it as you
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:38.840]  said earlier the climate change lie big lie is unraveling all the time and so
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:44.360]  they're starting to get desperate and what they're doing obviously is trying
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:52.400]  to target a target those people that are uncovering it and communicating this
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:58.640]  information and also in more and more desperate ways trying to put the lid on
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:04.960]  on society in general through more and more outrageous extreme methods of
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:11.920]  surveillance I mean what what can you do when what can you say when there are
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:17.360]  trials for these body scanners or only trials has anyone out there ever had a
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:21.640]  trial a government trial that wasn't actually widely introduced afterwards
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:26.000]  they're not trials at all and then suddenly while these trials are going on
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.360]  some guy sets his pants on fire over America oh my goodness me we've got to
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:35.480]  have these scanners in it lucky and it's fortunate we just having trials that's
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:40.480]  amazing so it's becoming blatant because it's becoming desperate on one level you
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.800]  know it's it's a challenge of course it is a challenge no one said it will be
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.080]  easy in what's happening at the moment but also it is a tremendous testament
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.360]  tremendous encouragement that we have started to get these people on the run
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:16:00.320]  and and every day more people awaken and their job gets harder so it's it's a
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:05.840]  challenge but it's a very very encouraging time well I agree with you
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:10.640]  David and that's why we're going to see more and more staged attacks more and
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:16.720]  more provocateur attacks and the awakening is accelerating because people
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:23.080]  are finding out government really never tells the truth exactly I mean you've
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:28.580]  got to start from that you've got to start from that foundation you know is he
[1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:32.600]  lying is he a politician well 99% of the time he's lying you know when the lips
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.480]  moving is lying because that's their job to tell the truth for the to tell lies
[1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:43.200]  and not the truth and for this reason if they tell the truth they say the
[1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:49.640]  terrorist we've named were responsible for 9-11 the guy says pants on fire with
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:53.440]  a set up patsy and so on and so forth that's what they have to do if they're
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:59.680]  telling the truth and therefore everything they say is a cover story to
[1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:05.960]  hide the real reason and origin of these world events and society changing
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:09.360]  events therefore because they're constantly parroting a cover story
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:13.960]  they're constantly lying by definition it goes with the job so if you start from
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:18.200]  the foundation if anyone is kind of new to this first of all if officialdom is
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:22.800]  telling you something it's either a lie or a half truth as I say about Tony Blair
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.480]  if there's ever a half truth in a Tony Blair speech it's a typing error same
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:32.200]  with Obama and the other thing that the foundation is governments are not there
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:38.520]  to serve the people they're there to serve and introduce an agenda to enslave
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.720]  the people once we move our point of perception our point of observation of
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:48.800]  world events to from from from what we thought it was to that then we start to
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.520]  filter the world and reality in a completely different way and we start
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.600]  to see what we couldn't see before we start to see behind the smoke screens and
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:01.520]  the the fake cover stories and that's what is happening to more and more
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:05.280]  people Alex and that's why it's becoming more and more difficult for these
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:11.280]  people to sell their agenda and sell their lies David going back over my
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:17.160]  research so much of the conclusions I come to are off the pre-programming of
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:21.920]  the establishment I mean it was obvious when chured off a year and a half ago
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:26.160]  ordered a couple billion dollars worth of these scanners and so did Europe and
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:30.880]  then right as they were set I mean I remember reporting in November that they
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:37.720]  were all set to go in January 1st in 214 airports that was in the news and then
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:44.000]  on December 25th I'm driving to the store to buy eggs on Christmas eat a
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.960]  Christmas day afternoon they report this guy has attacked by the time I get back
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.800]  on the car five minutes later they're saying don't worry we've now decided to
[1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:59.600]  put scanners in just now when they'd already ordered them and had them being
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:04.560]  delivered they said no now we're doing this because he attacked they had the
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:10.240]  whole thing staged and there's such hysteria they're trying to create that
[1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:15.400]  when a steam main blows up in New York everybody panics and starts evacuating
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:19.600]  that when a gas main blows up in New Jersey everybody panics there's now
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:23.680]  been a bomb threat put that back on screen they've diverted a plane with a
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:29.840]  supposed to flight 741 diverted to Utah after bomb threat and so we'll have
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:34.200]  more and more of this fake federal stuff before the anthrax attacks the feds
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:39.360]  did drills this was declassified where they mailed fake anthrax to hundreds of
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:44.640]  federal locations to create a system of mind control and fear in their own
[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:50.040]  minions before the feds themselves mail the most weaponized anthrax ever seen
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:54.880]  and then I said in the last year they're clearly prepping Austin four-stage
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.280]  terror attacks and then it turns out the feds were trying to get their
[1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:03.320]  operatives to fire bomb break new books we all know that the Berkey water

[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:22.080]  once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:26.000]  business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.480]  experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:33.880]  accountable to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose
[1:22:33.880 --> 1:22:37.880]  more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to

[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:28.120]  the point I was trying to make as we hit break is they had a federal informant
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:32.960]  tied to the Palestinian man that bound himself slit his throat cut his body
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:36.040]  open and threw himself in the river he was he was murdered the police said he
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:40.920]  committed suicide it's like up in the arkansides when people would cut their
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:44.600]  arms and legs off and blow their own heads off and bound their bodies and the
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:49.080]  police would say they killed themselves then the same informant who was running
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:58.240]  around with him reportedly and it's been confirmed it's just so much is
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:05.480]  happening tried to provocateur people at the RNC in 2008 to mall off cocktail and
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:09.680]  he admitted to that and then he reportedly tried to get local activist of
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:12.680]  firebomb brave new books one of my listeners started that's a patriot
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:18.160]  bookstore and with the firebombing of the governor's mansion that was clearly
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:21.520]  an inside job I've said I believe Austin's gonna be the target of the
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:26.880]  next false flag and they're now saying this was a terror attack they're
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:32.480]  almost sure against the IRS building and then meanwhile I knew if we saw a bunch
[1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:37.480]  of stuff happen this is staged united flight diverted to DIA after passenger
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:41.680]  attempts to open door in midair this just came out flying out of DC to Las
[1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:49.080]  Vegas tried to depressurize it that's a associated press and Huffington post and
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:53.440]  Denver post here's another one flight diverted to Salt Lake after bomb threat
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.640]  David it appears a massive psi-off is being launched there's no way all of and
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:06.000]  they had two airplanes crash yesterday one into the car manufacturing building
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:13.920]  the Tesla building a knocking out power to Paula Alto we now have other a plane
[1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:19.440]  crashed yesterday into a neighborhood in the panhandle of Texas Amarillo I
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:27.120]  mean what is going on David it's very simple what's been going on and he's
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:30.040]  now getting more extreme because they like I said earlier they're getting more
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:34.320]  desperate quite simply you've got an agenda which they've been trying to bring
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:39.480]  in step-by-step for a long long long long time but before what we call modern
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:43.360]  times it's been a long step-by-step process we're just seeing the the end
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.960]  game coming up to it now that the end that they want to bring about which is a
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:53.680]  global fascist dictatorship and a robotic mind-controlled microchipped
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:59.400]  machine-like humanity and world government and centralized control of
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:04.120]  everything etc etc so that's the agenda then running alongside that
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:10.920]  is what I've been calling for years the movie this is the manufactured view of
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.760]  the world including all the manufactured false flag events like what it seems that
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:21.960]  we're seeing here now it's getting ridiculous these are the movie to sell
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:28.200]  the agenda to the public and to justify its introduction and because of the
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:33.400]  public now in not in everybody or nearly everybody my goodness if only but
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:39.040]  increasingly vast numbers of people are starting to see the movie for what it is
[1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:45.320]  a movie something for public consumption and public public perception
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:49.240]  manipulation as a result they're getting more desperate oh my god we've got
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.360]  to up the ante at the ante at so and the other thing that happens as a result
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:58.880]  of Alex is that it becomes more and more blatant I mean they think it's it's
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:03.360]  something that is they need to do and something that's good and something
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:07.080]  that will advance their agenda quicker but the way they're doing it now in this
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.360]  this desperation is it's becoming more and more blatant so that more and more
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.280]  people are going to be asking questions more and more people aren't going to
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:18.840]  believe them I mean we're in a situation now after the last year I mean how many
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:22.600]  people believe that they're being told the truth about the climate change
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:27.600]  virtually no one what will happen the next time the pharmaceutical cartel big
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:31.440]  farmer and the World Health Organization tries to sell us a vaccine
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:37.320]  scale and let me stop you let me stop you it's falling apart for them a cornered
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:40.520]  rat so they're gonna really get more extreme and more desperate we're gonna
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:43.760]  we're gonna see a lot of desperate and extreme things as a result but it's
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:48.480]  falling apart for them well David I wanted to back you up not only did we
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.840]  have Wolfgang Wudarg the head of the EU Health Commission saying it's all a
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:59.800]  hoax a fraud dangerous vaccine was a lie staged they now the government
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:03.960]  admitted okay it turned out the swine flu vaccine didn't help you and it was
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:08.120]  fake that mean that came out yesterday like it was no big deal that it didn't
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:13.240]  even protect you we already knew that their health care takeovers falling
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:17.080]  apart it seems that corralling us like prisoners I want to ask you about this
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:22.080]  when we come back corralling us like prisoners these body scanners this act
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:26.360]  of supplication of submission of breaking us letting them know they're
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.760]  violating child porn laws to videotape children with these scanners their
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:35.120]  naked bodies that that then that sets the precedent now Homeland Security says
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:38.800]  they want to put shock bracelets on everyone they looked at it two years
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.560]  ago now they're saying if people are going crazy and trying to depressurize
[1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:46.440]  planes we've got to do this why are these body scanners so key to what
[1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:49.880]  they're doing and we're gonna have our reporters from the ground at the Kamikaze

[1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:16.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:21.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:37.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:41.560]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:44.280]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[1:33:05.400 --> 1:33:08.920]  David Ikes our guest for another hour
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:14.880]  we've got reporters out at the kamikaze attack site the government's saying the
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:20.200]  guy burned down his house crashed this plane into the building IRS slash FBI
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:25.480]  building complex the echelon complex talk about in your face the name of the
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:34.240]  big surveillance grid Joseph Andrew Stack named his plane crash pilot man sets
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:39.040]  house on fire crashes plane to Texas building report we reportedly Paul
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:43.920]  Watson has this is posting it now at prisonplanet.com it's being pulled off
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:49.080]  the reported places where he posted it we'll find out of the Providence is real
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:54.400]  but we're going to post it right now at prisonplanet.com his supposed
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:59.080]  suicide note of course the feds could write this up drug him put him in the
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:03.520]  plane remote control it and it's normally staged you have this person
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:07.440]  trying to open a plane door today you have somebody else with a bomb threat on
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:11.480]  a plane this is really looking like a massive Psyop last day but I was an
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:16.680]  expert on this why they want to create this feeling of hysteria and fear so we
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:20.360]  then go to the government begging them to keep us safe they're the big daddy he
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.920]  said no taxation with a representation reportedly I've spent total years of my
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:30.560]  adulthood unlearning the crap from only a few years of my childhood these days
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:34.000]  anyone who really stands up for principle is promptly labeled a crackpot
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.240]  trader or worse yet at the same time the joke we call America medical system
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:41.600]  including the drug and insurance companies are murdering tens of thousands
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:46.680]  people every year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple that's
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:56.000]  I'm reading over this right now it is it is lengthy David Ike again I
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.640]  apologize to David but I talked to David as a former top BBC reporter he
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:02.920]  understands this we have to cover it as it breaks I know he's got to leave in an
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:06.400]  hour I may twist his arm to stay longer but we'll see what happens I've got Paul
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:10.920]  Watson on the line briefly writing on this right now it's gonna I guess have
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:17.640]  the headline purported suicide letter of Austin kamikaze attacker or or or
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:20.840]  Austin plane attack Watson I know it's going up the next few minutes at
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:27.640]  prisonplanet.com tell us exactly where you got this reading over it the feds
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:30.680]  could have written this he could have it it looks like something someone would
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:37.080]  write where did you get this info Watson well all I've been doing is typing in
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:43.000]  Austin plane crashing to Google and then refreshing every few minutes and this
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:50.040]  came from a blog which carried the purported pilot's name as Joe Stack
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:58.680]  and now that's been confirmed by the authorities then get it up get it I'm
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:02.840]  gonna let you go then get it up with that basic breakdown that this same site
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:09.200]  said that yeah his one of his reported family members was on KLBJ confirming
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:12.520]  this as well about 30 minutes ago anything else Watson
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:19.000]  obviously in his screedy rants about totalitarian regimes and tax codes and
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.400]  everything that we talk about I wonder what the media is gonna do with this we
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.040]  need listeners because we don't have the staff to go back in the last two months
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:31.320]  it was actually December 8th is when I said they're gonna stage a terror
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:36.040]  attack in Austin and I even talked about planes flying into buildings I don't
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:40.760]  know how I know this stuff it's just incredible anything else Watson well it
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:44.280]  doesn't even matter if it's staged it's how they're gonna exploit it and that's
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:49.480]  obvious and they'll start tonight on the news shows but Watson you tie this in
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.760]  with a bomb threat on one plane diverted another passenger reportedly
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:58.280]  trying to open the door and depressurize and all this hysteria I mean and this
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:02.000]  looks bad this looks like it's staged on the heels of the underwear bomber
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.680]  anything else no that's this entire letter is gonna be posted now at
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:11.080]  prisonplanet.com all right write a basic analysis at the top and why we
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:15.640]  believe the Providence may be may be accurate in fact it's leaning towards
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:20.560]  being real because again this other blog was able to ascertain his name get it up
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:24.520]  give them credit as well thank you Paul Watson all right thanks Alex all right
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:28.360]  going back to David I again I apologize all that obviously this is happening
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:32.080]  David I want to get into the whole globalist pedophile scandal hearing this
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:38.400]  new info continue to break it down why they want this hysteria well it's been
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:43.720]  I've just finished a new book it'll be out in May it's just about two days from
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:48.680]  going to the printers and in there part of that is is saying that one of the
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:51.920]  biggest targets in the near future is going to be people that are putting
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:58.920]  this information out they want to discredit anyone that is exposing the
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:03.040]  agenda exposing what they're doing and you know I'm a great believer in just
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.400]  holding back before you make you know the decisions and assumptions to see the
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:12.680]  full picture but put it this way if the sort of stuff in that note is accurate
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:17.320]  and that note is accurate then it is again I keep using this word Alex all
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:24.000]  through this this chat blatant it's so blatantly obvious that you get someone
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.920]  to do this you link them to those nasty dangerous people and people like this
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:34.800]  what did they cast Sunstein while the Zars of Obama he's been targeting in the
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:41.920]  most extreme ways people or explosion the conspiracy no he says infiltrate 911
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:46.840]  truth groups and anti-global warming groups and commit violence to get them
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:51.360]  in trouble and to discredit them yeah I mean if the man had a brain salad it'd
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:54.120]  be even more dangerous I mean when you read some of the stuff that he's saying
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:58.520]  but it's getting it's so extreme because another word I keep using because
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:01.960]  it's applicable they're getting desperate so they get more extreme and
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:05.520]  they get over cooking and they're in very great danger and eventually they
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:09.200]  will they're overcooking what they're trying to sell to the public and it's
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:14.320]  getting more and more ludicrous they over overcooked massively the climate
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:19.840]  change lie and because they overcooked it it's falling apart and they'll do the
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.840]  same with this we're going to get a lot of aggravation we'll get a lot of
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:27.880]  criticism a lot of condemnation from these people or what pass for people but
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.560]  you know it's a sign of our desperate they are and and it will be very very
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:35.720]  interesting to see how this plays out in the next few hours the next few days
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:43.200]  because it's taking on all the signs of the most again blatant attempt to
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:47.480]  discredit the sole conspiracy research community let me break this down the
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:52.080]  globalist always stage terror attacks and it's a hundred percent Oklahoma City
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:57.280]  was a stage deal states rights movement was exploding the patriot movement was
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.360]  exploding the states were being taken back that's now happening they tried to
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:06.240]  marginalize the Tea Party they tried to have the Republicans take it over now
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:10.080]  the Patriots have taken it back Glenn Beck is even admitting this and panicking
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:16.800]  the exact same talking points in the last week by Beck O'Reilly Chris Matthews
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.240]  of supposed liberal have come out saying we're gonna be violent we're going to
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:25.960]  attack and then this guy's letter comes out from a blog that confirmed his name
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:30.080]  first this is going up at prisonplanet.com right now and we'll have my
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:34.640]  basic analysis there that we're going over right now and then he's basically a
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:40.560]  tea partier who is against the tax code and been part of anti IRS groups since
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:48.440]  the 80s and he I mean this is this is bad this is really bad David it is
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:54.720]  absolutely at the Oklahoma bombing revisited but in another kind of
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:59.640]  stage of the uncovering of the conspiracy an even more desperate stage
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.600]  than it then it was then so it's no surprise that this is coming it's
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:08.320]  bound to come including you know all the efforts to censor the internet which is
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:12.880]  the vehicle that's really unraveling this whole conspiracy and then putting it
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:17.280]  before people the reason people like Jay Rockefeller and all these people are
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:21.000]  trying to justify censorship of the internet is the same reason they're
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.240]  setting up these problem reaction solutions that we're seeing now my god
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:32.000]  I've got a read from this he says I can only hope that the numbers quickly get
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.280]  too big to be whitewash and ignored that the American zombies wake up and
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:40.440]  revolt it will take nothing less I would only hope that by striking a nerve
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:44.440]  that stimulates the inevitable double standard knee jerk government reaction
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:49.880]  that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:54.120]  see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:57.960]  sadly though I spent my entire life trying to believe that wasn't so but
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:02.160]  violence not only is the answer to the only answer the cruel joke is that the
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:07.680]  really big chunks of this bleep are at the top have known this all along and
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:12.680]  have been laughing at us using this awareness against us it goes fools like
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:16.480]  me for a long time I saw it written once the definition of insanity is
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:20.120]  repeating the same process over and over again expecting the outcome to suddenly
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:24.000]  be different I'm finally ready to stop this insanity well Mr. Big Brother
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  IRS man let's try something different take my pound of flesh and sleep well
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:36.400]  and then he this is reportedly the the kamikaze attacker the communist creed
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:39.360]  from each according to his ability to each according to his need the
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:42.720]  capitalist creed from each according to his gullibility to each according to his
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:49.560]  greed and I mean it just goes on and on purportedly written by this guy and and
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:54.760]  and that wasn't signed by cat cat Sunstein Alex was it well yeah that's
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:43:01.880]  what I'm saying should be all I can say is if this turns out to be real he says
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:06.600]  no taxation without representation he quotes the founding fathers now if you
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:11.400]  quote the founding fathers I mean look look David I saw them doing the
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:14.600]  preparation in the last month I was sure this was gonna happen I've been
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:19.840]  telling everybody this and they they singled out tea partiers Beck went
[1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:24.040]  further than just 9-11 truth in the last week they've said birthers who are more
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:29.480]  than half the tea partiers in polls so now you really see see it's the
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:34.320]  preparation for this and that Beck saying mark my words oh this is horrible
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.080]  David what we've got to do Alex if we've got to stay calm everyone's got to
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:43.160]  stay calm because they want hysteria they want panic and they they they want
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:46.760]  they want us to to run around like headless chickens oh my goodness what
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:51.920]  what's gonna happen what we just need to stay calm really calm we can see what's
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:55.840]  happening and we just keep communicating and communicating and communicating what
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.200]  people need to hear and no matter what's thrown at us you know in one ear out the
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:06.320]  other and we keep communicating and I'm not gonna go and defend what I've been
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:10.480]  doing and no need those should anyone else because obviously it's been so
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:14.600]  effective they're having to do this nonsense today and and David it's not
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:18.000]  your opinion we have cast Sunstein and all these other big White House people
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:22.400]  saying they want to provocateur things and criminal actions to set us up this
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:27.160]  guy needs to be indicted he needs to be investigated expanding on this the
[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:31.240]  person that shoots first loses we've always said they want to precipitate
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:35.480]  violence first so it looks like they have the moral authority and every time
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:39.240]  we're cresting this didn't happen randomly six months ago every time we're
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:43.600]  cresting at a new level of mass awakening they start staging the events
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:48.720]  yeah this is why you know I was writing articles a year ago something like that
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:56.440]  now saying or more please don't riot but the way to to meet this is through
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:02.440]  information and crucially through not mass mass non-cooperation with the
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:08.360]  system we're holding it together it's a house of cards and we are the flippin
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:14.840]  glue when we see to be so the house of cards falls look at a pyramid the power
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:19.520]  in the pyramid is at the base not the capstone we are manipulated to think the
[1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:24.360]  powers up there so we don't realize we are the power holding that up there by
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:29.720]  giving our power to that and our sense of where the power is to that we need to
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:36.400]  stop cooperating on a mass scale these guys can't run a system they can only
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:40.480]  manipulate this I agree the mass of the people that run the system we have to
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:46.640]  stop doing it and we have to stop having excuses for not doing it you know
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.800]  we've reached the point now where you know we're at a fork in the road and we
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:56.640]  don't have mass non-cooperation not just protest non-cooperation with the system
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:03.400]  and that will bring it down not violence not a rioting non-cooperation and we
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:08.680]  need to start getting this organized all over the world now organized non
[1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:15.160]  cooperation so the system cannot function David notice how right as income
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.840]  tax day comes up and they know there's record anger about taxes growing the
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:23.920]  country is in revolution I wanted to add this to you a revolution of
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:29.400]  awakening every c-span show every local radio show I'm not even tuning in to
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.640]  much media everybody's calling me every time I tune in there's random well-
[1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:37.760]  spoken callers about 9-11 being an inside job about the flu being a hoax
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:42.720]  about the carbon tax being a fraud our internet numbers and info wars dot com
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:45.520]  and present planet dot com are exploding our films are seen hundreds of
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:52.120]  millions of times a year free online your info is exploding and right on time
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:58.360]  this starts happening look at the timing look at the preparation the pre
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:04.440]  preparation for all of this I mean this is a desperation move and I don't think
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:08.640]  it's gonna work and and and the more I read this letter and the fact of the
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:12.520]  site that first reported his name correctly or the ones that had this and
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:18.080]  Paul Watts is doing a big article right now about this and I want him to keep
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:23.480]  adding to it is that I wouldn't be surprised if the feds aren't out posting
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:26.480]  this stuff and that he didn't even write this but that they'll probably turn
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:31.560]  out saying oh no he really did because the way this is written is it's meant
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:38.080]  to push and start a violent revolution we look at a violent revolution and a
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:43.520]  violent or a violent or a vociferous response against those communicating the
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:49.280]  truth about the world but look at this Mossad operation this week which was
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:54.800]  caught on on on on camera and you saw it all unfold over over the day and the
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.720]  guy was the Hamas guy was killed and stuff like that and the mainstream media
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:05.960]  guide oh my goodness oh my goodness this is a daily common occurrence these
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:09.680]  intelligence agencies or lack of intelligence agencies that's what they
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.520]  really are like the CIA British intelligence and Mossad they're taking
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:20.200]  people out there they're they're distrusting them with false information
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:25.640]  and setting them up or what have you that they're causing quote suicides I
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:29.520]  mean that's the big one when someone who knows something or could reveal
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:38.920]  something or dies in a very appropriate if you like ways for the the agenda when
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:46.040]  you see the word suicide I mean you know suicide suicide is a word that should
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:51.120]  be spelled M-u-r-d-e-r that's that's that's what suicide in those terms really
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:55.920]  is I mean we've got David Kelly this guy was at the ability to expose before the
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:00.280]  invasion of Iraq the fact that weapons of mass destruction were not there as
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:06.520]  they claimed the papers on his suicide have been shut down for 70 years because
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:10.840]  of what it would reveal if they came out so this is that this is a this is going
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.520]  on all the time and that there are peaks like likely things that we're
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:19.680]  experiencing today they're in there in Texas there were peaks like 9-11 what
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:23.200]  have you but it's that it's that it's actually every and every day occurrence
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:28.840]  so that that's going on all the time I agree Watson has posted the reported
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:33.320]  letter and I know he's adding to it the point of where we got it that this site
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:37.760]  first reported the Joe stack somebody may have gave it to them we need to talk
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.040]  to them we need to contact the site talk to Watson get their name right now get
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:47.640]  them on we need to investigate your site it says this this is this letter is now

[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:27.840]  notice this happened in Austin notice the Fort Hood massacre happened in Austin
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:35.720]  and when that Hassan guy supposedly shot these 13 people and killed himself we
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:42.080]  said maybe a crazy guy and he's a psychiatrist maybe then it turned out for
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:46.200]  years he said he was going to kill people would love suicide bombers was
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:51.680]  sending emails to the confirmed Al Qaeda mole who handles all the Patsy's
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:58.440]  Reeves all of them it's always this guy the Finsbury mosque it's always the same
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:02.400]  guy in the CIA for two years wouldn't let the military know and he'd walk
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:05.120]  around saying I'm gonna kill everybody and they weren't allowed to get him in
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:08.240]  trouble if you say something bad about the president and you're in the army
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:11.680]  like I think the president's bad you get arrested but he could walk around I'm
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:17.080]  gonna kill people I'm gonna murder I hate Christians blah blah blah and oh you
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:21.840]  get to stay there this isn't political correctness that was staged and now the
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:25.400]  statesman is saying it's confirmed internet note posted by man linked to
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:35.560]  plane crash and and it the statesman says it shows a domain that the note was
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.480]  posted on is registered to Joe Stack of San Marcos a man by the same name who's
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:44.360]  been addressed in both Austin and San Marcos has been linked to today's
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:48.520]  airplane crash into our office numbers we're getting people that newing
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:55.040]  neighbors are calling us we're gonna be perfectly positioned here in the middle
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:58.760]  of all this to really be able to report on it for you here in the next few hours
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:02.880]  and coming days and get ready for the media to come after us David now that
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:06.800]  they're confirming that this is his letter you were saying classic sigh
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:12.720]  during the break well yeah I mean I've been investigating for a long long time
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:21.520]  15 years now the mind control programs and the mind control operations in the
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:28.000]  North America and in the United Kingdom in Europe and understanding the extent
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:33.200]  to which you can literally take over someone's mind in the same way that I
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:37.560]  could sit here and tap some keys and program this computer in front of me
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:45.560]  to do what I'm asking it to do people are lacking an understanding often about
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:50.520]  what's actually happening because they don't realize what's actually possible
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:54.520]  they think that what they see in their everyday lives or what they see in the
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:58.920]  public arena is the limit of what is possible but when you get into the
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:02.680]  secret projects whether it's technology or whether it's mind control or
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:07.240]  genetics you're dealing with something that is like is beyond anything I was
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:12.640]  about to say they had remote control cockroaches 30 years ago they had robo
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:16.360]  rats 20 years ago now they tell the public about it they have with one
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:21.760]  microchip they can take a monkey a rat a human and remote control make you go to
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:27.640]  the bathroom make you talk make and what I've been told by top experts is they've
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:32.000]  gone away from the trauma-based programming they have yes they have yes to
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.960]  chemicals and electronics go ahead yes they have and the thing is that you know
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:39.720]  I've been writing in my books when I talk about the nature of reality I
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:42.920]  describe the body as a body computer you know when you look around the brain
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:46.920]  they say all that when this part of the brain lights up this is how you react
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:50.200]  this is what the body does this is what you think this is what your emotions are
[1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:56.880]  and so this is what the whole mass mind microchipping program is all about
[1:57:56.880 --> 1:58:02.360]  it's about internally accessing the body computer and then externally
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:08.360]  manipulating the way it works emotionally mentally and physically and
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:13.840]  so once they can not even microchip someone that's the easiest way but you
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:17.520]  can actually do it without microchips can actually do it by very very deep
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:22.440]  levels of what people call hypnosis but what I'm talking about is beyond any
[1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:27.400]  hypnosis you ever see in the public arena and basically what what they do is
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:33.080]  they they put in a program it could be a program I'm not saying this is this is
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.760]  what's happening stay there hold on gotta break gotta break David back in 70
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:41.240]  back in 70 seconds he posted this on his official website it's confirmed
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:46.200]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:54.960]  decade we are the GCN radio network hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:58.720]  tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:02.680]  endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:07.200]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:11.200]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs
[1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:14.360]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your
[1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:19.800]  self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:24.000]  instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:29.280]  sale of nanosilver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:34.040]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:40.480]  are provided making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today
[1:59:40.480 --> 1:59:44.160]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator

[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:44.160]  prismpana.tv we're gonna get a report a brief report from Rob do and Jason
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:48.080]  Douglas who were out there at the echelon building complex that had the
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:53.440]  reported kamikaze attack there was a company founded by Joe Stack the
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:01:04.440]  reported kamikaze attacker at embedded art.com and he created art firmware
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:09.720]  software development company and then it's his website registered by him that
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:17.000]  has the letter posted on it and it's got his phone number why but we talked to
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:21.440]  neighbors they said the FBI is there right now does that number work we talked
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.800]  to neighbors yep goes to voicemail let's let's call the voicemail right now on

[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:03.320]  be important that's coming up again we're in the middle of an investigation
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:07.280]  you're seeing the sausage being made here but David Ike if you had all these
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:10.940]  different pieces of evidence in you were finishing up with the robotic control
[2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:14.080]  we did find the mainstream news article I'm gonna cover in the next segment
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:19.680]  about the robotic controlled rats these are physical rats physical mammals that
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:23.360]  are remote controlled go ahead yeah I was saying before the break you know I'm
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.360]  not saying this is what happened to mr. Stack because we know it's a breaking
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.760]  story and we need to follow this up and get more information but I'm telling
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:35.640]  you what is possible and it's child's play by the level of mind control
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:40.640]  techniques that they're operating with it is possible to have put into this
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:47.600]  this man or anyone else a program which would lead to them behaving in this way
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:53.120]  they can put the program in in great great detail fine detail and then they
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:56.480]  close that part of the mind they close that part of the brain if you like it's
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:00.400]  called compartmentalization or or they they call these compartmentalized areas
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:08.520]  of the mind brain altars and then they program in it could be a sentence it
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:13.160]  could be a word could even be a you know it could be a color or sound anything
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:21.840]  and when that word trigger is given then that man suddenly starts to play out the
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:27.840]  programmed behavior that that within their waiting to be activated now I've
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:31.560]  come across so many different examples of this I'll give you a quick one there
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:36.320]  was a period in Britain when certain kinds of scientists I mean still going on
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.800]  now in many areas but in Britain a particular time when scientists were
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:46.000]  were doing very strange things and killing themselves one guy was sitting
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.160]  in his home in London I think he was and he was eating his meal and then he
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:57.120]  puts his knife and fork down walks out gets in his car drives to Bristol which
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:02.080]  is a good way yet no connections to Bristol whatsoever parks his car on the
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:06.960]  Clifton suspension bridge which is a massively high suspension bridge going
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:12.320]  over the river in Bristol it jumps off another guy he goes missing over a
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:18.080]  weekend he says he's going out to get some petrol gas and he's away for hours
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:22.600]  his wife gets worried calls the police eventually policemen there constables
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:28.160]  there when the guy comes back and I just needed I just needed time to on my
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:34.400]  bummer self on the Monday morning he's got in his car he's driven to work
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:40.440]  suddenly on the way to work he's driven off the the what you would call the
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:44.600]  freeway across the bridge to the other side gone down the other side of the
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:49.120]  freeway and then directed his car straight into a restaurant smashed
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:54.640]  himself to pieces and this is what can happen once the program has been put in
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:59.800]  there and then the trigger to access to activate the program is given stay there
[2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:02.680]  let's continue to discuss this we'll give you the latest from this cryptic
[2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:06.960]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:11.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:15.440]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:20.480]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:25.760]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:30.280]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:34.960]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:38.640]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[2:05:38.640 --> 2:05:42.160]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:47.400]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:53.400]  have seen a fall of the Republic in your copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at

[2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:13.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:20.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:29.560]  Alex Jones okay we've got David I joining us from the UK simultaneously we
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:35.480]  had Rob do and Jason Douglas info wars com videographers and reporters on the
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:43.320]  site at the echelon office building complex for the IRS FBI you name it the
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:47.520]  hostage rescue team was on the ground within minutes we've had callers calling
[2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:54.720]  in from Austin they've been on hold we haven't gone to them yet like Jake and
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:00.680]  others who were saying that they came in they're grabbing the videotapes out of
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:05.000]  the apartment complexes the surrounding buildings you know they would claim for
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:09.480]  evidence but we've seen so many cover-ups like with the Pentagon and other
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:13.280]  events where they come and grab up all the videos they never released them so
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:17.960]  this is looking worse and worse by the minute isn't it David
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:22.840]  obvious but by the minute and what's very important now is that we just
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:28.840]  concentrate on getting out this problem reaction solution scenario and
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:33.960]  presenting what has happened in the way that increasingly clearly it it
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:39.360]  happened rather than the the government version that is going to be bombarding
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:45.120]  the mainstream media and that is as we speak no doubt because that's the idea
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:52.080]  to to totally discredit this conspiracy exposure movement to stop it being ever
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:58.040]  more successful as it is and we within it have to stay calm people have to stay
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:02.760]  calm in general so we don't start reacting and and and and doing things we
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:08.600]  would regret stay calm and then look at it as it is and not not emotionally
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:14.840]  reacting and also we have to get this information out and present it in a
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.240]  calm way what's actually gone on here because you know they're going to be
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:26.520]  really targeting people like yourself in America now on the back of this also
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:31.000]  another big development Fox News is reporting that the FBI has told them
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:39.400]  that this suicide manifesto letter they're they're saying a plane attackers
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:48.000]  manifesto confirmed to be authentic posted on his official website so that's
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.280]  going to be going up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right now here's the
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:11:00.080]  headline officials theory is online manifesto written by stack but the
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:05.080]  statesman's confirmed we've confirmed this is registered to this same
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:12.000]  individual's name Joe Stack of San Marcos a suburb of southern Austin
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:18.800]  basically it's a bedroom community a college town just south of here and so
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:26.720]  this is reportedly his website and again you have their need to demonize us the
[2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:30.600]  fact that Beck and all the other talking heads said the tea parties have been
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:35.600]  infiltrated by terrorist they're going to attack now you're not a terrorist if
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.920]  you're a 9-11 truther you are now a terrorist if you are a birther which is
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:43.880]  more than half of the Republicans that have been surveyed in major polls and I
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:49.200]  saw this massive hype and bexing they're gonna hit soon I promise I promise you
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:53.800]  and I said that's it they're about to do something and so you add all of that in
[2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:58.240]  the fact that Coantel pros all over Austin reportedly trying to fire bomb
[2:11:58.240 --> 2:12:06.400]  one of our allied groups brave new books you've got so much happening we had
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:10.280]  weird Coantel probe people showing up right after the governor mansion attack
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:13.840]  trying to leave boxes with us saying we work at the mansion they think I'm
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:18.160]  involved and then we walked outside and they were off the run mark police cars
[2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:21.400]  and people casing and walking around like there was about to be some bust if
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:25.240]  we would have taken that box they who knows what it had in it they would have
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:30.960]  swarmed in on us it's just it's just for people that haven't experienced this
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:38.600]  David it's just so real well yeah I would say this you know to the Glenn
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:44.360]  Beck's and the people on the MSNBC and the Fox News people and all these
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:51.120]  prostitutes I would say you've got children and grandchildren and you are
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:55.280]  going to be looked on with absolute contempt by them because you're playing
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:01.920]  your part slavishly taking the box and reading and saying what you're told to
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:08.760]  say to to advance an agenda that is going to or is designed to enslave your
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:14.720]  children and grandchildren now that is a level of despicable behavior that takes
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.360]  my breath away and one day ladies and gentlemen you're gonna have to face that
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:24.040]  and that day far away David there's another big article up at prisonplanet.com
[2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:28.760]  before it had just been in a few cities here and there the last five years the
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.080]  feds going out setting up TSA checkpoints on highways bus stops train
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:38.680]  stops now they're saying no we're testing a nationwide rollout everywhere of
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:42.920]  body scanners metal detectors it shows them searching people on the street
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:48.840]  there's suddenly local police at any event at parks are coming up searching
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:52.520]  everyone's saying line up we're all being trained to just line up and be
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:57.480]  searched line up and get in patty wagons and the people are resisting and then
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:14:03.080]  right on time all these pretext to sell this develop and you have all these other
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:06.800]  plane events today with somebody reportedly trying to open a door on a
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.760]  big flight in the west another person supposed bomb threats shutting down
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:16.600]  flights I mean this all coming together at once and we know the underwear bomber
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:20.800]  was staged we know the Fort Hood thing has all the airmarks of being staged you
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:25.840]  add all this together with my prediction that they will start the false flags in
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:30.400]  Austin and because I've seen incredible activity here and they see this as the
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:33.720]  head resistance hub because obviously I've been here working hard all this
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:37.280]  time with great people and all these co-intel pro have moved into Austin
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:40.720]  constantly they don't fight the new world order all they do is constantly
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:45.600]  attack and lie about me I mean it is a and then we got internal source with Rick
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:49.840]  Perry that the neocons are mad at Debra Medina Alex Jones and Ron Paul we're
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:55.440]  quote under their skin and they want to target us we now see this unfolding well
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:02.160]  you know 20 years ago when I started this I went through incredible levels of
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:07.840]  ridicule in Britain I mean and abuse I mean just extraordinary levels and what
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:13.800]  I did was I kept putting one foot in front of the other and refusing to stop
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:18.920]  refusing to defend myself and I just kept walking towards the goal that I
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:22.260]  set myself which is understanding what's happening in the world and
[2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:27.400]  communicating it and that's what we need to do now we we don't need to defend
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:32.320]  ourselves from this manipulation we just need to keep on doing what we've
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:35.960]  been doing and what we've been doing increasingly successfully and that's
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:40.520]  communicate what's going on in a credible way and and that is including
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:46.640]  now communicating what this stuff is all about today and all the the problem
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:50.920]  reaction solutions connected to it we just need to keep calm keep focused on
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:56.280]  where we going which is a land of true freedom a world of true freedom where
[2:15:56.280 --> 2:16:00.480]  the few no longer to control the many where the people are no longer stuck
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:06.320]  dry energetically and through taxation and interest on money and all this stuff
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:13.080]  would keep our eye on that goal and toilets pulled from that by by by this
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:17.520]  nonsense and and and thinking we have to defend ourselves we don't the system has
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:21.800]  to defend itself because it's pathetic as well as evil we just need to keep on
[2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:26.560]  this goal and calmly keep banging it out and whatever they throw at us and
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:32.680]  and however uncomfortable they might make life sometimes and they plan to make it
[2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:37.760]  very uncomfortable in the end that incessant drip drip drip bigger drip
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:42.560]  bigger drip bigger drip of information he's going to swamp them and drown this
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:47.400]  whole system and by the way and it's coming down but so we need to stay
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:52.120]  strong we need to take on we need to stay keep eye on our goal and not be
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:55.480]  diverted from it because you know no one said it would be easy but it's coming
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.960]  down and by the way cast Sunstein those internal White House documents and in
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:05.200]  the letters and also the public papers he's written says 911 truth is killing
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:09.680]  them the conspiracy movement is killing them in a great danger so they're
[2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:15.240]  sitting around in their Death Star conference room saying that we're
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:18.880]  powerful and more dangerous than many of their own operatives realize they
[2:17:18.880 --> 2:17:23.000]  understand that we're coming for them I mean look Governor Ridge comes out last
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  year and admits the former head of Homeland Security they would issue terror
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.720]  alerts to scare the public into submission for political purposes we
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:35.480]  have all these neocons saying play the war card to get our new world order I
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:41.480]  mean we basically have them right out in the open now hey message to cast
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:46.240]  Sunstein and all people like it the genius out the bottle darling hey the
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:55.080]  genius out the bottle ain't going back get used to it business insider is
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:59.520]  reporting Joseph Andrew Stack revised his death letter 27 times before
[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:07.120]  settling on the final draft so this goes on and on and on we're going to
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:10.480]  continue to post all of this at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:13.800]  for stations out there this is our network right coming up I'm going to
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:18.760]  skip it so that we don't take time away from David we're going to go ahead as we
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:23.720]  get extra time we're going to now go to Rob do and Jason Douglas I'm not sure
[2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:28.400]  which one of them will talk to first Douglas Jason Douglas who worked for
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:31.960]  info wars dot com they've been out there at the site for an hour and a half or so
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:37.280]  now of this kamikaze attack as the media saying is now confirmed by a
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:45.120]  anti-taxing person Jason good to good to have you with us tell us what you've
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:49.680]  been seeing out there who you've talked to well we got here just about 45
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:53.480]  minutes ago I'm inside of building that's immediately adjacent to the one
[2:18:53.480 --> 2:19:01.920]  that was crashed into it's pretty much on police lockdown over here there's all
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:06.680]  different kinds of departments state police is here easy mobile command
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:13.960]  center is here FBI what does the building look like with your own eyes
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:18.120]  versus the television footage we've seen of it burning and smoking you know it's
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:23.200]  it's one of these black obelisk buildings that's got the mirrored tiling on the
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:31.200]  outside the window tiling basically your modern office building are the fires
[2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:36.600]  out the fires are still smoldering it's white smoke not black smoke so I assume
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:42.200]  that it's it is all the way out but I'm still smoldering what are people's
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:45.520]  what are people saying that you've talked to we've had callers holding for an
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:49.280]  hour I do mean to get to them who are saying that they were in the office
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:52.800]  buildings and people were coming in the FBI was coming in and grabbing all their
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:57.720]  surveillance footage you know we haven't even had a chance to talk to anyone as
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:02.320]  soon as I walked up to the press staging area they actually
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:08.320]  at the VEDO and lessing well and the fire chief came out and they were doing
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:13.440]  their second wave of statements so I basically just caught that and then
[2:20:13.440 --> 2:20:18.720]  walked around the other side while I do to the tripod shot of that where is that
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:23.160]  do right now he's standing right next to me let me talk to him real quick let's
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:31.360]  go to let's go to do okay I mean give us your basic
[2:20:31.360 --> 2:20:36.800]  breakdown of what you're seeing there okay well the the windows from this
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:40.640]  building are totally on that on that side where the plane hit pretty much all
[2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:46.800]  broken out you can see a window blinds and insulation you know black end
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:50.160]  insulation it's been burnt it's just kind of blowing in the wind they have a
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:53.400]  ladder truck up near there and I guess they're pumping water in that way and
[2:20:53.400 --> 2:20:58.360]  so we were talking with the spokesperson from the fire department said
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:01.600]  the fires pretty much contained they when they arrived there was flames
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:06.360]  everywhere she said and and she even mentioned that that they thought that
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:09.880]  the building might collapse could and she started saying how buildings have
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:13.320]  been known that they're structurally weakened in these fires so they thought
[2:21:13.320 --> 2:21:16.680]  it might collapse they pulled everybody out so they're even buying into the new
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:20.880]  propaganda since building seven that a small fire makes a big building collapse
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:25.960]  pretty much she seemed and everybody seemed to go along with that and in the
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:28.640]  press because somebody did ask that we heard there's a danger of the plane
[2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:34.800]  collapsing they also mentioned that the plane was not stolen as far as they know
[2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:38.000]  right this time so I don't know at first they said it was stolen now they're
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.240]  saying it wasn't I know you've been on the road but what do you think of the
[2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:45.880]  developments that he on his own website wrote a manifesto slash suicide letter
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:49.680]  and the last few months you've been producing here you've heard me because
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:53.880]  everybody kind of does multiple jobs he also does film work and editing that I've
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:57.080]  been saying I believe they're going to stage a false flag blaming on tea
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:00.520]  partyers and that the attack will probably come in Austin and they're
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:05.400]  also going to claim that that 911 truth slash birthers are going to try to kill
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:10.400]  Obama and now we see similar things not just from Beck but from others like
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:15.080]  Chris Matthews and now we're seeing Joe Biden saying cryptic things like this as
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:20.720]  they get the pre-story ready right and this guy's name is Joe Stack apparently
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:26.200]  the pilot that there's the name they release yes and I thought I didn't read
[2:22:26.200 --> 2:22:29.560]  the suicide notes I don't know what did it say what did you have oh it's
[2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:34.360]  basically you know the government scum and I'm tired of the corrupt government
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:39.680]  and the zombies and then the IRS and and the politics I mean it's a it's
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:43.720]  designed and I believe it wasn't I mean it looks like it was written by somebody
[2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:49.960]  else just looking at the MO tailored to demonize the widest swath of anybody
[2:22:49.960 --> 2:22:55.720]  that doesn't like the IRS of the federal government I mean it's it's it's not
[2:22:55.720 --> 2:22:59.960]  even anti-New World Order it's just anybody that doesn't like the government
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:04.240]  now again he could have just been alone nut but look at the season look at
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:08.800]  everything that's going on right now listen have they forced you guys into
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:11.520]  that building or are they keeping you back as I would just leave and go talk
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:15.240]  to people in apartment complexes nearby they are pretty much keeping everybody
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:18.720]  back away from it and that's the next day's we got some shots of what we
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:21.600]  could see from here Douglas is actually in the building that we're in now he's
[2:23:21.600 --> 2:23:26.520]  gone up to even get some shots from some windows up above and get a better
[2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:31.720]  bird's-eye view because this building is actually from when you get inside of it
[2:23:31.720 --> 2:23:35.320]  you can get closer than where we were at at the police line all right here's what
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:39.360]  I want you to do here's what I want you to do go up and shoot video the police
[2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:42.480]  and stuff they're doing but go out and talk to people in other businesses
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:45.960]  because we're the calls are flooding in we're gonna talk to some coming up the
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:49.960]  calls are flooding in saying they came into all the different buildings and
[2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:55.360]  we're seizing everybody's video tapes oh really okay okay we'll definitely we'll
[2:23:55.360 --> 2:23:58.800]  definitely look into that and get and get some know anything you can text us
[2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:03.400]  just text us names and numbers and we'll get on it okay thank you so much I
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:07.880]  appreciate you being out there reporting on this that's Rob do and Jason
[2:24:07.880 --> 2:24:12.520]  Douglas okay going back to David Ike we just got a live report from down there in
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:20.840]  north Austin now where this kamikaze attack reportedly took place David what's
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:25.760]  your gut you know from studying the wide spectrum of how these people operate in
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:29.560]  the preconditioning and everything that's going on what's your gut on this my
[2:24:29.560 --> 2:24:35.560]  gut tells me this is staged yeah exactly and but there'll be a cover story I
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:38.800]  mean you know they there's always a cover story so there'll be a cover story
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:44.760]  for this man to make it look as if he's done it from completely off his own
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:51.120]  bat and everything and you know the power of mind control means that anything
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:55.440]  could have been programmed into him to be triggered to to to play out this
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:58.880]  behavior pattern I'd also say this you know I mean I've said it in my books
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:02.400]  before that I would not I'm not saying this is going to happen I'm not saying
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:06.320]  that but I would not rule out at some point as Obama being assassinated
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:10.200]  because I'm he's totally expendable to them he's just a frontman does what
[2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:13.480]  it's what what the Emmanuel and Axel Rod tell him and all the rest of it and
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:19.320]  write the words on his order queue he's teleprompter and you know if he was
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:26.120]  taken out by some cover story along these lines or worse and then they
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:31.840]  would justify enormous changes in American society as a result so I'm
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:36.680]  not saying that's going to happen but I certainly wouldn't rule it out David let
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:39.400]  me break this down I don't know if you've seen our articles the last two
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:43.920]  weeks really it's the last three I've seen Glenn Beck and now all the other
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:49.000]  talking heads liberal and conservative saying first 9-11 truthers then tea
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.120]  partyers now birthers anybody that questions his birth certificate are
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  going to try to killing and and so of course that's out of left field and
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:02.920]  totally insane it does two things it introduces the idea the tens of millions
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:07.240]  of people who are unstable a form of light mind control of provocaturing of
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:12.840]  copycatting of introducing the idea I mean if they broadcast to a city of 5
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:16.000]  million is somebody going to go jump off the Empire States building today
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:19.760]  guaranteed some nut will go do it that's one thing they could be trying to
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:27.120]  fluster people giving them ideas that's a form of mind control or they are doing
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:31.440]  the preparatory phase for this yeah I said I certainly absolutely wouldn't
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:35.600]  rule it out like I said I've said it in previous books that that you said it you
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:41.040]  said it a year ago but but a bit now yeah it's it's it's certainly the land is
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:49.240]  being prepared as you say but of course they absolutely control the president's
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:54.440]  security I mean when you look at the Israeli Prime Minister who was
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:59.600]  assassinated some years ago what happened you could sit sit on the on the
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:05.640]  on the on the video he's walking towards the car and his security kind of
[2:27:05.640 --> 2:27:11.360]  line of people actually took a step back the killer was allowed forward he shot
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:15.080]  him I mean when you control someone security you control whether they live
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:18.440]  or die same thing with Reagan same thing with JFK
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:24.680]  same thing with Lee Harvey Oswald yes exactly yeah I mean you know that
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:28.720]  president this is something else that you know people new to this need to
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:33.040]  appreciate presidents are not in control of the country they are the vehicle
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:36.160]  through which those in control of the country introduced legislation and
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:40.520]  change in society the president himself is totally expendable you'll be another
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:46.600]  one along soon and it is their PR spokesman PR spoke well never more so
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:52.560]  Alex than with Barack Obama because of these such obvious obvious the obvious
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:57.160]  way that he's welded to that teleprompter which is written by someone else so he's
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:04.540]  a decent absolute extreme expression of this mouthpiece presidency that that
[2:28:04.540 --> 2:28:10.000]  we're looking at now so take him out bring someone in he'll read someone
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.400]  else's words in the same way the show goes on the president's not important
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:19.960]  people behind them so he's expendable and as I've said before if him staying
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:24.120]  alive and doing what he's doing now he's most effective for the agenda they'll
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:28.320]  don't don't leave it but if assassinating him and and creating the
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:33.600]  massive reaction to that and changes the result is is more expender you know
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.520]  more better for the agenda then they'll do that they're expendable they'll do
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:42.280]  what is best for the exactly expendable to that and you've got the Tea Party
[2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:47.520]  that's really libertarian Ron Paul Alex Jones anti-New World Order and it's the
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:50.960]  real threat to them they already tried to have the Republicans co-opted the Tea
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:54.560]  Parties are suddenly kicking Republicans out in states across the country saying
[2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:58.920]  no you're not gonna co-opt us it only worked for about a month suddenly now
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:02.440]  the demonization of the Tea Party I predict you're gonna have bombings
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:08.400]  shootings Tea Party people killing their kids you're just gonna suddenly see all
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:14.040]  this bad behavior from Tea Party people and this guy says in this in this letter
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:17.600]  they say is real now I'm sure it's fake I mean you can't trust the Providence is
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:22.800]  my point they now confirm though that they're saying it came from him that I
[2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:27.280]  mean this guy says from the 80s he's been in the anti-tax groups and so we're
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:32.640]  gonna learn all about this now and how bad and all the families and the and

[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:42.120]  they're going to try to kill Obama or stage an event to blame it on us and now

[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:21.880]  because of developing news when you leave us in about 14 minutes or less I
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:27.040]  will come back and recap all the latest developments on the kamikaze attack in
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:34.480]  Austin Texas the suicide letter this looks completely staged once you leave
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:39.600]  us but in the last 14 minutes we have with you you have the floor I'm sitting
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:43.200]  back in fact I'm even gonna go listen to you in the control room to control
[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:48.760]  myself and not but in you have the absolute full floor David Ike. Well one
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:52.840]  of the things that I was going to talk about tonight and maybe I want to talk
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:58.600]  about it at another time really connects into what's been happening today and 9
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:03.440]  11 and all the rest of it because one of the things that I've been trying to get
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:08.240]  across to people for years is don't judge what these people will do on the
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:13.640]  basis of what you will do because we fall into the trap it's easy to do but
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:17.480]  when we look through our eyes at the world we think that everyone else is
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:22.560]  seeing the world the way we do it's not like that and these this network of
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:27.200]  bloodlines these Illuminati bloodlines if we could see through their eyes and
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:32.400]  through their minds then we would be utterly shocked at how they see the world
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:38.280]  they have no empathy they have no conscience and they get a kick out of
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:45.240]  human suffering the more the merrier and over the last 20 years I've discovered
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:49.440]  many things but one thing is very relevant to what I'm talking about
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:56.560]  now and that is in every single country the word I've used on my
[2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:01.800]  website the cement that holds the establishment together the law enforcement
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:07.400]  political business banking establishment together is pedophilia and
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:13.600]  Satanism and those two networks are utterly utterly connected and all over
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.400]  the world these rings operate and they abuse children in the most staggering
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:26.960]  staggering way torture them rape them repeatedly force them to take part in
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:32.960]  human sacrifice ceremonies now when you when you start to appreciate that this
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:38.040]  is actually going on and these people have the mentality to do that to
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:45.360]  children then 3,000 people killed on 9 11 or a million people killed and maimed
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:51.200]  as a result of the fraudulent evasion of Iraq Afghanistan etc takes on a new
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:58.040]  understanding I'm exposing a story at the moment which is the microcosm of the
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:05.400]  macrocosm which is of a young down syndrome girl in Scotland she's not in
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:10.040]  Scotland now she's in England she's had to flee because of the threats and
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:14.440]  and the treatment that she's had when she tried to expose this with a mother
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:23.360]  but Holly Greg exposed the fact that she was repeatedly raped over 14 years by
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:30.520]  some of the big law enforcement sheriffs senior policemen social workers a
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:34.760]  solicitor a counter to fire officer lawyer vickers and police and all the
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  rest of it over 14 years and the police is a bit of place called Aberdeen in the
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:49.360]  north east of Scotland in an area called the Grampian region which is infamous
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:52.800]  for Satanism and Peter Feely I can tell you Scotland is you know Scotland is a
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:57.000]  major world center for all of this stuff it's not called the Scottish right of
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.200]  Freemasonry for nothing the biggest secret society in the world and this
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:08.520]  later this girl Holly Greg when she started to bring this out the Grampian
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:13.280]  police refused to investigate it the Procurator Fiscal the person that
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:19.320]  decides if a prosecution is going ahead a lady called Ellis Angelioni refused to
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:24.800]  take it forward she's now since become the law advocate of Scotland the top
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:30.360]  legal person in Scotland she has refused at that level to let the case go
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:35.160]  forward to court and be investigated and now we have had over the last few days
[2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:40.480]  a journalist called Robert Green who's been helping the family and exposing
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:46.600]  getting the evidence together who went up to Aberdeen late last week and he was
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:51.000]  going to stand for Parliament on this single issue of what has happened to
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:54.800]  Holly Greg and the way the establishment in Scotland is raped and
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:58.720]  treated her and incidentally this Scottish is the pedophile satanic
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:04.160]  establishment was served by a man called Thomas Hamilton who was the guy who
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.680]  killed 16 children when he took four guns into a gun-blame primary school many
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:13.520]  years ago and blew them away he was a freemasonic pedophile and procurer of
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:17.920]  children for this Scottish elite famous people you see on the news all the time
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:23.240]  and running courts and what have you and he was arrested when he went there last
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:29.720]  week just to talk about this case and the evidence he had he's he was held
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:35.280]  over the weekend putting court on Monday bailed on a charge of breach of the
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:40.520]  peace which in Scotland is much wider and basically if anyone's going to be
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:43.640]  upset that you're in the breach of the peace talk about political correctness
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:49.400]  as personified in a law and he's been bailed to appear again later and gagged
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:55.560]  from speaking about this case his video on YouTube is being taken down all
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.720]  different aspects of it very very very quickly and if people go into my website
[2:40:59.720 --> 2:41:06.960]  they can read the whole story and what I'm saying is that this pedophile satanic
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:12.120]  network is operating in Scotland and it goes out right into the Scottish
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:15.240]  government right into the Westminster government right into the British
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:19.640]  government and because these different rings these national pedophile satanic
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:23.880]  rings connect into other rings the same exactly the same thing is happening
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:28.600]  America in North America in Canada in the United States everywhere you go you
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:33.880]  see the same pattern Australia is a major major center of pedophilia and
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:38.880]  and satanism and you always find that the key people in the establishment
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:44.520]  whenever you investigate them Alex you go down down the down the road of one
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:50.080]  thing leads to another it always leads to pedophilia and satanism I'm sure
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:55.560]  father George Bush will confirm that so and again we have the mainstream news
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:01.400]  articles out of Scotland that that anyone that tries to even go speak in
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:07.200]  public is being arrested they're saying disturbing the peace I mean is there no
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:13.280]  free speech in the UK well what the best is a law firm called Levy and McCray in
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:17.600]  Edinburgh who's representing this law advocate of Scotland
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:22.760]  English Angelina Angelini and and why is a law firm representing her she's the
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:27.000]  top legal person in Scotland for goodness sake make a statement woman we
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:32.600]  have a situation where there's a classic murder involved in this Alex it did
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:36.920]  what we're talking about today in terms of cover-ups and everything and the
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:45.280]  Holy Griggs uncle her mother's brother he died in a ledge car fire in 1997 and
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:50.040]  and the authorities the same Grampian authorities that we're looking at they
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:54.720]  said oh we died of smoke inhalation because if we died in a car fire and
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:43:00.440]  probably suicide they've now got hold of the post-mortem report and found that
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:07.760]  he was severely around the skull before he died he'd got two broken ribs a
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:13.520]  broken breastbone he had whiskey forced down his throat and he hated whiskey
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:17.600]  he couldn't he wouldn't drink it and there were signs in the post-mortem the
[2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:22.760]  post-mortem said of a pickaxe shaft being used and the authorities in the
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:27.840]  Grampian said oh it was smoking elation we now know that's a lie and Holly Greg
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:33.320]  told her mother that her uncle this guy who was clearly murdered and covered up
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:38.000]  and actually walked in and found Holly's father and having sex with her and
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.200]  went crazy and shortly after this guy is up in a car fire and that wasn't the
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:46.840]  investigation by the police in Grampian or the law enforcement people in
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:44:00.200]  Grampian number of which have been named by Holly Greg so refuses so I mean that's
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:03.920]  why I don't understand because this is in some of the Scottish major newspapers
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:10.320]  that they're saying this and there have been these cases and then and then lawyers
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:14.400]  and people that are involved in supporters go into a city and it says
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:19.480]  they're arrested for no reason I mean exactly but you know the BBC they
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:26.520]  approached Holly Greg and her mother and they started to do a major documentary
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.800]  on BBC Scotland BBC Radio Scotland and one of the major current affairs
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:38.120]  strands in in Britain called a panorama and the BBC it was all going well they
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:42.440]  were getting their evidence together the the person who was running the
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:47.160]  documentary said we found a lot more evidence of pedophilia of other people
[2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:52.360]  in Scotland other people are being abused in the same way yeah the reporter
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:55.400]  said this is a report that's going to go around the world when this comes out
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:45:00.880]  suddenly out of nowhere the reporter calls Robert Green says we can't run the
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:05.080]  story because we've been threatened but if we do anything more on this or
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:09.120]  investigate any more pedophilia in Scotland by the establishment we're
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:14.280]  all going to be sacked so so there is a massive cover-up and you know when you
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:20.080]  look at the Franklin cover-up in Omaha, Nebraska which on W2 camp and all that
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:25.160]  story when you look at that it takes on exactly the same theme and background as
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:30.200]  what's being uncovered now in Scotland because you know it's a blueprint Alex
[2:45:30.200 --> 2:45:36.080]  and it operates everywhere and and it the scum needs to come to the top so we
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:40.960]  can see it and it is coming well David you're you're over in England you're
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:44.240]  over you know close to Scotland I don't really know anything about this case I
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:48.600]  just saw it in the news and then noticed that you'd been reporting and talking
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:54.240]  about it and overall though we do have the Washington Times and other
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:01.360]  publications about the hundreds of visits of top gay prostitutes madams we
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:06.640]  have reporters that turn out to be madams hundreds of midnight visits and
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:10.680]  it seems to be a Republican thing though Democrats seem to be involved we
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:15.040]  have all the orgies going on a bohemian grove that mainstream publications have
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:19.560]  reported you know Chad Savage the top gay porn star you know they hire porn
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:25.640]  stars for each person who are their quote valets and I mean it just shows I
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:32.920]  guess this is a guild of of people I mean is this like say an east side gang in
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:39.080]  Austin or south side gang in LA the meaner the gang or to get higher level
[2:46:39.080 --> 2:46:42.440]  you've got to mug somebody kill an old lady burn down a house it gets worse and
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:47.200]  worse and they say they do that so that you're compromised I mean is that what
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:51.160]  this is all about or I don't know if there's two reasons for it and by the
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:56.760]  way what what what what's in my mind you know I'm a holy greg is down syndrome
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:03.640]  now people will find it hard to believe but it's absolutely true raping and
[2:47:03.640 --> 2:47:12.360]  having sex with a down syndrome children is considered a kick a big kick a big
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:18.800]  thing to do within the pedophile satanic network so sick are they and there's
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:27.720]  actually a big underground porn video child porn video industry involving
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:33.040]  down syndrome people it's unbelievable there's two basic reasons for it was
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:38.200]  very deep it's to do with energy it's to do on one level with vampireing the
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:43.280]  energy of children there's something about the energy pre puberty that these
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:47.840]  people want and during the act of sex they're sucking the energy that
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:51.160]  prepubescent energy out of the child that's one level of it but there are
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:55.920]  many other reasons but one is as you say the first of all I use this word it's
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:00.880]  the cement that holds it together well what it is in two ways first of all it
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:04.840]  creates this everyone's dependent on everyone else because everyone knows
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:10.120]  about everyone else and then there's the fear if you want to get out and you
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:15.040]  don't want to do what they say in terms of political banking business decisions
[2:48:15.040 --> 2:48:20.360]  etc. that you ain't got a way out mate because if you want to get out okay fine
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:26.640]  but this will be in the post to somebody and so it this fear holds these
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:32.840]  people in servitude to the masters who run the operation so I'm not
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:36.840]  kidding you I think people think this is extreme the British government like the
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:43.400]  Scottish government is run by people who are in fear of exposure from some of
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:47.440]  this stuff honestly it and that's not just this country it's all over the
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:52.560]  world you get someone involved in this they are when they when yet when they
[2:48:52.560 --> 2:48:59.560]  say jump and do this and introduce this legislation change this and do that you
[2:48:59.560 --> 2:49:02.800]  break the Olympic high jump record because you know the consequences of
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:05.240]  not doing it
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:14.640]  well I've got the press and journal report out of out of the UK and it says
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:20.560]  sex abuse family legal advisor arrested campaigner was going to hand out leaflets
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.440]  and and they say that you're not allowed to do that in Scotland so I mean
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:31.080]  regard I mean they are sure acting like I mean don't they know that that's only
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:36.720]  gonna make this blow up that much bigger what Alex we've come back to what we
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:43.160]  were talking about earlier we're talking about how the the network the
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:47.800]  families the Illuminati are getting desperate because this stuff is coming
[2:49:47.800 --> 2:49:51.360]  out and people are opening their minds to it and so it's giving you a difficult
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.560]  for them so they're doing desperate things this Peter Files Titanic ring in
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:02.080]  Scotland is now in that same state of desperation because suddenly it's come
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:06.560]  across people I mean you know my website and this is one called the UK
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:11.760]  column which is followed this and he's very very good website to go to for
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:15.280]  this information people like Colin Green who's been right at the centre of it
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:21.320]  this journalist who was simply not going to bow to the intimidation and as they
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:26.720]  get more desperate they do desperate things and and and and as I said earlier
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:30.560]  about what was what is happening today when you do desperate things you do
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:34.080]  things more blatantly and even more people see what's going on and so this
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:37.720]  guy's gone up he's planning to stand for Parliament on this single issue like I
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.520]  say to hand out leaflets and tell people what's going on because the pathetic
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:49.640]  jelly boned Scottish media won't won't tell them David David I think to stop
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:54.360]  him David I really appreciate you joining us we'll continue to watch your

[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:57.360]  very confusing they're saying that he then got in an airplane and flew it into
[2:54:57.360 --> 2:55:05.920]  the building this morning in Austin then searching we found the website his
[2:55:05.920 --> 2:55:09.400]  website fact we actually broke this the statesman in about 20 minutes after
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:12.560]  confirmed it they went and checked the IP address the registration which we were
[2:55:12.560 --> 2:55:18.000]  already doing it was Joe stack the person that allegedly did this the
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:27.920]  kamikaze attack the terror attack it's his website it's embedded art.com and
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:34.560]  then linked off of that was his suicide supposed letter now we've got to find
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:38.720]  out where that was uploaded from the IP records the IP address records that
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:44.480]  somebody else upload that that's being looked into right now and of course he's
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:53.560]  an anti income tax person who says that he's being harassed and persecuted and
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:56:01.520]  after I take calls coming up the next hour I want to read over what's being
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:07.640]  called his manifesto now all the latest boil downs on this news is being posted
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:12.840]  and has been posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com you can read his
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:19.120]  manifesto there our comments here is voicemail message it's all up there at
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:30.000]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com but at first they were saying they didn't know
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  if it was done by design witnesses said that the plane accelerated straight into
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:39.560]  the building that it was leveled that it would look like it was focused is what
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:45.560]  pilots have told the news that witnessed it one pilot in particular but what we
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:57.840]  know what these government stories is you never know what the truth is and oh
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:57:06.400]  my gosh t35 hosting has taken his website down why would you do that I mean
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:09.520]  you've got his manifesto it doesn't name anybody it just talks about the
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:14.040]  government we need to find out how it was uploaded we need to find out the
[2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:20.120]  internet records of this but no now remember what happened last year in
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:28.240]  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania when this marine kills three cops and then the government
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:31.680]  and a guy that writes routinely for the adl and some of the law center he writes
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:35.680]  articles about how great they are one of their local guys there's thousands of
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:39.480]  IP addresses in his computer he's visited thousands of websites including
[2:57:39.480 --> 2:57:45.320]  Fox News and others that came out later CNN and he visited infowars.com and they
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:52.280]  had people on the street day one saying he was a fan of me then we go and find
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:57.840]  his actual comments on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and he hated me because
[2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:03.800]  I wasn't a white supremacist so within two hours of him killing three cops
[2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:10.560]  within two hours of them getting the computers the first thing that the
[2:58:10.560 --> 2:58:14.000]  individual writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Cosette and I went back and looked
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:17.200]  at his past articles he's one of the guys that you know demonizes the hate
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:22.840]  groups and praises the adl and southern primary law center they target Alex Jones
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:26.720]  and they later had to do a retraction and the Pittsburgh Post-Cosette showed a
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:31.920]  bunch of other publications because it came out he hated me so I've known that
[2:58:31.920 --> 2:58:35.240]  they're targeting us for a while along these lines now you have this guy

[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:30.280]  serious business they're trying to suppress our whole peaceful retaking of
[3:02:30.280 --> 3:02:33.920]  the stage to get our country back if we don't do this the banks are gonna suck
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:39.240]  us all dry we do lots of shows on symbolism but I'll check it out okay
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:44.120]  Heather in Indiana you're on the air go ahead I just wanted to call in and say
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  that I was watching Fox News we're not fans of Fox News but I figured it would
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:53.000]  be quite hilarious to watch what they were gonna be saying and listening to
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:57.120]  your show at the same time and how their stories have changed every two minutes
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:02.120]  and getting everyone's perspectives on this but we do recall listening to you
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:07.400]  and you talking about a stage attack in Austin and then I heard you say that and
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:11.840]  I just think it's it's a great thing what you do Alex you you tell the truth
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:16.400]  and and it's so much better than anybody watching Fox News and Glenn Beck and all
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:19.920]  these other crazy people that think that they're constitutionalists and they're
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:24.360]  not and we just applaud you and commend you we're David Ike fans he was great
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:29.200]  today and we just wanted to say thank you for you doing what you do to let
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:33.720]  everybody try to wake up in this country that we're living in that's so God
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:38.440]  awful everyone thinks it's just so great well God bless you Heather what we
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:41.280]  need listeners to do because all of my team is working their fingers of the
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:46.360]  bone and we don't mark down our predictions I have probably said 50
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:50.080]  times or more that they're gonna stage a terror attack in Austin and blame it
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:54.520]  on the anti-new world order truth tea party and I've told you they're gonna
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:59.160]  try to kill Obama or stage an attempt to come after us now I said that a while
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:06.760]  back now beckon them or following that as a pre-program point saying that and
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:10.200]  they've expanded it from not just 9-11 truthers in the tea parties now they're
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:17.000]  saying any Patriots anybody that thinks Obama wasn't born in the US I mean it's
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:23.640]  so obvious folks we've got co-and-tell pro stuff going on on so many facets on
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:31.160]  so many fronts in so many ways I mean that December 8th article that Aaron
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:35.400]  Dykes wrote from the NPR interview with the admitted federal informant and I
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:39.560]  told you that was the case back the year before last at the Republican National
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:44.520]  Convention in Minnesota where these people would not go firebomb and then he
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:47.440]  just kept pushing them and pushing them and then tried to set them up and then
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:51.480]  they arrested them and then the firebombing of the of the governor's
[3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:55.800]  mansion and then the firebomb and they tried and then the same person
[3:04:55.800 --> 3:04:59.040]  reportedly tried to get them to fire bomb brave new books then they tried to
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:03.320]  set me up I mean this is bad folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you

[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:07.800]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[3:08:07.800 --> 3:08:15.440]  information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network remember
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:21.040]  a week and a half ago this obama obsessed supporter this professor goes
[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:26.160]  and shoots and kills three people the media didn't make any big deal out of
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:32.280]  that is to complete nut because obama is the establishment person but the
[3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:37.880]  democratic operatives are everywhere on the democratic underground and the
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:42.120]  fox nation website i hope these sites follow the ip addresses back to the
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:47.280]  democrats are blaming the tea parties this article is up on prison planet
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:54.160]  dot com right now and i need listeners to go back to the audio files the
[3:08:54.160 --> 3:08:57.920]  youtube's everywhere because we can't do this but millions of you can find it
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:02.560]  quickly and email it to show tips and info wars dot com because you know i
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:06.680]  predict all this with total precision i don't even know how i do it we don't
[3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:10.240]  make a lot of predictions i think i made like five the last year and they
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:18.560]  basically all came true i see their pre-programming it's like asking somebody
[3:09:18.560 --> 3:09:22.840]  who could hit a baseball really good how do you do it well you just or you know
[3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:27.520]  a little bit of training research but you've just got the the right stuff or
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:31.800]  how does a high jumper do what they do or how does somebody paint a beautiful
[3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:37.040]  oil painting how does some children are naturals in music others aren't i mean
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:45.520]  i've got a lot of gifts all of us have gifts but the most important thing of
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:50.320]  thousands of pieces of info i collate to come up with my information kind of
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:54.640]  when the data card pops out is years of research on subjects and then it finally
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:09:58.520]  all comes together and then the data card kind of pops out and that's the
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:06.560]  answer and it looks easy but it's not but it's the gleam in their eye you know
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:14.400]  i taped this i had two employees at the time i would just with vhs tape you know
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:19.240]  those tv sets that the vhs player recorder on the bottom i would just
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:24.560]  record fox news seeing in and i would run on the treadmill in 2001 almost every
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:28.400]  day at like five o'clock and flip around on the channels and i would watch
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:32.680]  about an hour or two a day while i was doing research online and things of
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:37.240]  television on in the background i got to where it was so painful to watch and
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:40.640]  made me so upset and so angry that i pretty much have quit watching
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:45.320]  television except for little boil down youtube clips the listeners kind of
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:54.800]  collate that for everybody and an activist out there and i remember watching
[3:10:54.800 --> 3:11:02.120]  hardball with chris math use about three months before 9-11 i already had a lot
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:04.200]  of other evidence they were going to attack the world trade center again
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:13.320]  use bin laden but he had gary hart and warren rudman of the cfr commission kind
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:18.240]  of the twin of the
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:24.320]  peanut people project for new america century
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:27.160]  and i had just read peanut around that time how they needed a new pearl harbor
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:30.680]  event all this and i've seen rand corporation saying the same thing and i
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:35.760]  saw them having an evil celebration together rudman hart chris matthews and
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:40.240]  it was like three months before 9-11 so somebody go find those archives and i'm
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:45.600]  sitting there on the treadmill running and i've got headphones on to listen to
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:51.600]  it plugged into the tv across the room the old days it wasn't wireless it was
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:12:01.000]  low-tech you know string across the room wire and people always ask how i know
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:08.640]  this stuff is just one little snapshot example when it really hit me and they
[3:12:08.640 --> 3:12:11.840]  were saying life's about to change in america and chris matthews was getting
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:15.000]  excited saying i'm so honored thank you for revealing this and he was and they
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.120]  were acting they were all twittering around psychopaths like to do stuff in
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:22.400]  public in front of everyone this is why matthews hates my guts so much because
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:26.560]  he knows i've reported this a lot and they said yeah you're gonna have big
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:29.160]  things troops are gonna be on the streets in america things are gonna change
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:37.200]  you're gonna see different big things happen with tall buildings and i knew
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:40.280]  the feds had bombed the world trade center the first time cooked the bomb
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:43.160]  trained the driver provocateur it and i knew they were already starting to
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:47.160]  hype bin laden's gonna get us in the media and the Pentagon was saying once
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:50.400]  we get attacked life's gonna change we're gonna take over they were prepping
[3:12:50.400 --> 3:12:54.880]  the police and everybody for this they meant it hit the capital with one of the
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:12:58.080]  other planes the pennsylvania plane but it didn't thank god because the military
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:03.040]  didn't follow orders and did the right thing and shot the plane down and it all
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:05.960]  just hit me and i went on and i thought about it a few weeks and went on air and
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:11.840]  said you know specifically world trade center bin laden next two months and it's
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:19.200]  the same thing but a no-brainer with the flu it's a no-brainer we have
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:24.160]  emergency managers on in indiana we get bureau of prisons california new york
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:29.120]  other reports we get the actual secret documents you know don't distribute to
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:31.880]  the public the state of new york with homeland security once you get ready for
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:37.440]  hundreds of thousands dead per cemetery you know how many can you bury they're
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:40.800]  telling the emergency manager the same thing harden your police stations for
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:47.320]  martial law get ready the public's gonna attack you and it's gonna be flu
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:51.280]  based it's gonna be a flu pandemic the causes is so i went on air and said the
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:55.320]  feds are saying this is gonna happen we're not saying that but they're gonna
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:59.320]  try a martial law through this and then they tried the force in oculation in
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:03.200]  new york massachusetts and other states that actually happened remember and it's
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:11.000]  the same thing when we've got co until pro like cockroaches in a cheap restaurant
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:16.920]  at 3 a.m. or a cheap motel running around and they're trying to set us up on
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:21.160]  every front and they're coming out of the woodwork and they're trying to
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:26.480]  connect us somehow and cops are around my office to the bombing at the fire
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:32.160]  bombing at the mall off attack and then i learned a federal informant the same
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:37.640]  one that set people up with mall offs in minnesota and the same one connected
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:41.040]  hanging out with the palestinian that got murdered is trying to get brave new
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:44.720]  books fire bombed and i realize austin's the center of the resistance and
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:50.000]  literal people have all moved here just to attack me they come set up shop or
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:55.400]  patriots at that jones ah you know i mean it says whoa you know endless lies
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:00.080]  endless fraud and you can't it's not you i guess you could sue co until pro
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:04.120]  because then that's what they wanted it slows you down it ties you in but it's
[3:15:04.120 --> 3:15:06.760]  almost good they've been attacking me because it let me know what was going
[3:15:06.760 --> 3:15:12.480]  on and there was a lot of other data that came in and so i've been telling you
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:16.800]  for the last six months really but intensely since december they're gonna
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:26.840]  stage a terror attack and blame it on patriots in austin austin austin austin
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:32.640]  and i'm telling you that's in their card they it looks like they've played it
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:36.920]  other terror attacks
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.120]  kind of predicted all predicted attacks on airplanes in december like two weeks
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:45.800]  before because it's all the prepping and i'm predicting they're gonna try to kill
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:56.240]  or stage an attack that won't be real the president iraq san obama because
[3:15:56.240 --> 3:16:00.200]  that's how they get to play the part of victims and i'm telling you folks because
[3:16:00.200 --> 3:16:04.640]  we're kicking their butt they see us rising against them everything they do
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:11.520]  is falling apart they're gonna pull the stops out i'm telling you there's a lot
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:14.720]  more goes into it but that's basic scott and arizona you're on the air thanks
[3:16:14.720 --> 3:16:16.680]  for holding
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:21.600]  you bet uh... i regretfully congratulate you on the accuracy
[3:16:21.600 --> 3:16:24.640]  of uh... what's going on
[3:16:24.640 --> 3:16:26.960]  i'm not surprised at all to see this
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:31.080]  uh... i i think it's important that uh... in uh... despite
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:34.640]  having to deal with this and potentially uh...
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:39.240]  get the word out that you know this this looks like a uh... stage
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:41.920]  on the stage the currents
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:43.960]  focus remain on
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:46.760]  uh... continuing to support
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:50.480]  uh... deborah medina getting the word out what you're talking about regarding
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:53.920]  failing and parents all that's another thing now perry
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:57.240]  just like the hurricane got his approval rating up from twenty points he was
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:00.800]  done like twenty up to forty now it's back down the low thirties he'll now
[3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:04.240]  get to grandstand and he is grandstanding and again
[3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:08.040]  why would they stage something just for governor because if he goes down the
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:09.400]  states rights movement
[3:17:09.400 --> 3:17:10.880]  it's a huge boost
[3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:13.680]  which is the number one threat to the new world order
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:16.400]  absolutely and i think at this point of nothing else
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:18.800]  uh... because of the point that you made
[3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:22.800]  regarding that i told you yesterday they were about the stage something and
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:24.800]  come after us in austin
[3:17:24.800 --> 3:17:27.680]  absolutely and what needs to happen at this point of nothing else
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:29.680]  a pale needs to be in it
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:32.000]  paleon and perry ought to be tied in
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:33.680]  somehow with this
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:35.240]  and certainly
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:38.520]  put out there to say hey look you know what we do have pain when
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:41.480]  as a uh... supporter and if they're going to blame
[3:17:41.480 --> 3:17:44.360]  this whole thing on uh...
[3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:47.040]  uh... untruthers are you know it
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:49.240]  and it enters or what have you
[3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:52.000]  we've got paleon in support of
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:56.800]  a nine eleven nine eleven but see but see fox doesn't want to damage back
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:17:59.960]  so that's why the last month he's been positioning himself going
[3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:01.760]  we're the good tea party
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:03.400]  we're not violent
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:06.720]  but there are these burthers and truthers that want to bomb things and kill
[3:18:06.720 --> 3:18:07.880]  the president
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:10.320]  i promise you they're about to attack
[3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:13.000]  now i was already saying they were sending us up before
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:15.160]  but now he's pre-position to go
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:17.160]  we're the good tea party
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:19.200]  we're the republicans
[3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:21.200]  but we've got a clean house
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:24.760]  there's a fight happening for the soul of the tea party i mean it's totally
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:25.720]  clear
[3:18:25.720 --> 3:18:26.920]  it's staged
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:29.960]  mike how can people not see this
[3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:32.720]  and that's why it needs to be continued that
[3:18:32.720 --> 3:18:36.480]  we continue to share this with other people we continue to go to these radio
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:38.160]  stations and say hey look
[3:18:38.160 --> 3:18:42.040]  look how clear the path is and lay it out for you know spoon feed them the
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:43.080]  baby food
[3:18:43.080 --> 3:18:45.040]  because they're not going to see it on their own
[3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:48.480]  so that is the republicans and obama
[3:18:48.480 --> 3:18:52.760]  working together to suppress the rebellion and states rights
[3:18:52.760 --> 3:18:55.080]  uh... resistance
[3:18:55.080 --> 3:18:57.160]  they're all working in tandem
[3:18:57.160 --> 3:19:00.400]  together look at joe biden saying he's worried about loan nut
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:03.120]  terror attacks two days ago

[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:24.240]  by a anti irs protester against the irs oh boy
[3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:31.440]  as it all develops we're posting it at info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:34.240]  oh man
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:39.040]  this is just so bad it just confirms everything i already knew
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:44.160]  just gets worse and worse by the minute but the good news is
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:49.280]  not that many people were killed one is too many this guy supposedly died
[3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:52.800]  uh one of the persons missing a couple or hurt real bad
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:56.640]  and that's terrible but you know you have an 18-wheeler overturned and killed
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:24:59.920]  20 30 people on the highway and it doesn't even hardly make the news
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:05.120]  this is terrible though and they are going to really push it
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:08.000]  and you add all the other weird airplane stuff going on people supposedly
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:12.960]  trying to open the door on a big plane out west we got the flight numbers here
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:17.280]  uh somewhat another bomb threat grounding another plane it just goes on
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:23.120]  and on and on and then simultaneously the feds show up
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:27.280]  all over the country fourth amendment trashes airport tyranny hits the streets
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:31.200]  setting up airport style checkpoints everywhere i mean they are
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:36.160]  this is all coordinated once you learn how they operate it's so clear
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:40.800]  and pray for info wars dot com pray for me
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:44.960]  pray for my staff pray for my crew pray for all of us here because
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:49.520]  i just learned yesterday high levels you know inside the system directly in a
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:53.680]  meeting with rick perry that they are very upset
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:59.840]  about deborah medina leading the states rights charge myself and ron paul
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:06.880]  and it's kind of creepy being the center of attention of the new world order
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:15.040]  jc in ohio then william robert cameron blank and others jc go ahead
[3:26:15.040 --> 3:26:18.800]  uh first i would like you to know that you know your uh your show it's being
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:22.640]  censored um every time that you know you listen to it uh you know you can hear
[3:26:22.640 --> 3:26:25.920]  like a little blank going in and out of what you're saying so i'm you know what
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:29.040]  should be aware of that well how are you listening to us
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:32.320]  uh well i'm listening to you over the net and through my phone
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:35.920]  um and you know i look i listen to you over my net and you know i thought maybe
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:39.040]  it it must have been my skype because you know i got skype credit and listen to
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:43.200]  you do it but uh do the phone you know it's still blanks in and out so i mean
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:46.320]  you know it may be you know some a technical difficulty with uh maybe your
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:50.880]  media or something how often is that happening uh well it's happened for
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:54.160]  the last three days um ever since i've been listening to you
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:57.840]  uh you know it it blanks in and out you know of what you're saying
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:01.440]  uh you know i'm really not for sure you know about what's going on but you know
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:05.440]  sure that you are well i want to ask the listeners are other people having this
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:09.920]  let me ask matt one of the it guys hey matt are are you getting reports of the
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:14.320]  internet cutting in and out okay well we'll have to check into that i appreciate
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:20.880]  your call jc william in michigan you're on the air
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:25.120]  hello go ahead yeah actually it's marion
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:29.040]  um i'll have a copy of that guy's manifesto on my site i'm not going to
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:33.600]  plug it take it one five two two seven two that way you can get it
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:37.440]  secondly cell phone networks are highly
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:41.200]  regulated and censored they usually have very low data caps and
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:45.360]  and so anything that starts using bandwidth like your show
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:48.480]  they'll start chopping it so it's probably not urine it's probably him
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:52.320]  listening on his cell phone i'm on a keyboard i'm not having any problems
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:56.320]  check out that ticket you can get a copy of this guy's manifesto
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:00.880]  that's what i wanted to tell you yes sir we have a copy of his manifesto
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:04.080]  poll Watson actually found it first in the states when broke it
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:08.160]  in the mainstream media a couple hours ago yes yes we have his manifesto thank
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:12.800]  you william robert in west virginia you're on the air
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:17.200]  howdy this is robert how you doing good uh...
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:20.880]  i want to talk a little bit about this airplane attack
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:27.360]  yes um i'm going to hold off judgment for myself
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:31.280]  whether or not this is a false flag or not i believe it might be
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:37.280]  a real attack that's being twisted to fit their agenda and it just so happens
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:41.360]  to be austin like i predicted and it just so happens to be a
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:46.320]  anti globalist i don't know man i don't know but then again they can use it
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:49.360]  against you have you seen all this heating up have
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:52.960]  you seen all the preparation for this that's true
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:28:56.560]  that's true but at the same time i'm reading this guy's manifesto and he
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:28:59.760]  says that he's intentionally doing this to make him
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:03.360]  but we don't know listen listen let me explain something gary web who wrote the
[3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:08.720]  Pulitzer prize winning book and articles dark alliance on cia drug dealing
[3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:11.600]  they came in his house they shot him twice in the head and they had him
[3:29:11.600 --> 3:29:13.920]  before they killed him they said we're gonna kill your family that's how it
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:17.840]  works if you don't write this up now in that case
[3:29:17.840 --> 3:29:20.640]  we know he was being threatened and said he would never commit suicide same
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:25.360]  thing with the dc madam in this case we don't know who put this on his website
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:29.600]  we don't know he really wrote this do you see what i'm saying
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:33.440]  yeah i just i don't know i have a hard time
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:39.440]  with it because uh part of his manifesto sounds right part of it doesn't
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:43.760]  say what robert stay there i'm gonna come back to you exactly you read this
[3:29:43.760 --> 3:29:47.440]  it's like these fake al-qaeda letters the feds have been caught putting out
[3:29:47.440 --> 3:29:52.240]  they're always real twisted weird we'll be right back stay there
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:56.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:17.840]  americans at home we have tremendous influence
[3:31:17.840 --> 3:31:21.840]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:27.120]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:31:27.120 --> 3:31:30.320]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:31:30.320 --> 3:31:34.720]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:31:34.720 --> 3:31:37.200]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:41.040]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[3:31:41.040 --> 3:31:44.480]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:47.920]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:15.440]  they were telling the locals though our reporters rob do and jason duggles were
[3:33:15.440 --> 3:33:17.920]  out there though it's probably going to collapse because
[3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:20.800]  everybody knows when a plane crashes into a building it collapses building
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:23.920]  seven wasn't hit by a plane but it collapsed
[3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:27.920]  incredible now this is another story here i said
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:34.800]  hours and hours before they took the alleged kamikaze attacker the irs
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:39.520]  facility the irs office building
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:43.440]  in north austin i said we needed to get the internet records and a lot of good
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:46.080]  internet people know how to get into people's websites
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:50.320]  and i thought to myself if they take that website down there's no reason to do it
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:54.400]  they're trying to cover something up and they're grabbing all the video footage
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:33:59.760]  you'd think well that's for the investigation no so when you go to
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:04.880]  stack's website embedded art.com we have this all linked up on info wars.com
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:08.480]  and prismfunnet.com it says this website has been taken offline due to the
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:11.280]  sensitive nature of the events that transpired in texas
[3:34:11.280 --> 3:34:14.640]  this morning and in compliance with the request from the fbi
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:17.360]  if you want to see the original letter please see the archive version of the
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:20.320]  smoking gun and we have it of course
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:23.120]  watson first discovered this and the statesman picked it up in the smoking
[3:34:23.120 --> 3:34:26.080]  gun we have it saved up at prism planet.com
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:34.160]  and info wars.com so the fbi request they take the site down
[3:34:34.160 --> 3:34:43.920]  isn't there even danger of losing it if they do that but archive.org has it
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:47.280]  they already had it because they basically saved most the sites
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:50.480]  the way back machine i bet has it all these other sites that save
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:55.200]  sites this is very suspicious this gets worse
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:59.200]  by the minute i want to continue with robert dan cameron
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:02.800]  Blake and guy i was going to have this fell on for about 20 minutes today but
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:06.000]  because of the story we're focusing mainly on
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:09.760]  what could be a false flag attack could be a random nut
[3:35:09.760 --> 3:35:12.960]  but it doesn't look good with all the pre-preparation we've seen
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:15.840]  the new york times newsweek all these publications
[3:35:15.840 --> 3:35:20.800]  attacking me uh my crew all read the texas monthly cover story they did in
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:26.640]  fact you guys have that article is there a copy left around here
[3:35:26.640 --> 3:35:32.720]  it's one of the fairest pieces i've seen but still a hit piece still deceptive
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:36.080]  and i wanted to make issue take issue with it and go over some of the
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:39.520]  disinformation in it i'll do that later in the week tomorrow
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:42.720]  sunday or next week because all this is overshadowed
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:48.640]  but alex jones is about to explode uh is the article
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:53.120]  and scroll down and i don't know they have any of the other photos that are
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:36:04.560]  actually in the actual magazine but um
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:09.920]  oh it's just something else the point is all this media is covering us
[3:36:09.920 --> 3:36:13.920]  i wouldn't even call this a hit piece i i think blaxley the guy that wrote it
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:19.440]  is a nice guy and really believes what he wrote just some of it's wrong
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:26.000]  basic stuff like i said no we had the 9 11 truth conference in 2006 in
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:30.480]  los angeles and it says 2007 they didn't change that it says i said we would
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:34.480]  have martial law from the flu outbreak now i said the feds were preparing for
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:38.240]  it and we're going to try to test it i gave them the videos i gave them the
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:41.680]  evidence of where i said it didn't matter it's in the article stuff like that
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:45.120]  the point is is that media all over the place
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:50.080]  does isn't going to give us attention unless we're being built up to be
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:52.480]  destroyed
[3:36:53.280 --> 3:36:57.840]  and they're attacking the tea parties they're attacking
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:01.840]  the anti-fella reserve people because the the globalist are on the ropes
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:05.280]  they're in trouble let's go to anthony
[3:37:05.280 --> 3:37:13.920]  hyal from we are change ohio who in october of 2008
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:18.240]  at a campaign event got sarah palin to talk about she wants a new 9 11
[3:37:18.240 --> 3:37:23.040]  investigation now that's more than what deba madina said
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:26.080]  saying well i agree people have a right to their own opinions
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:30.000]  beck made a big deal out of that but here's his darling going further than
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:33.680]  her this story is getting out there to a lot of people to show the hypocrisy
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:36.480]  but now we're not really talking about that today because of the attack
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:39.920]  but i know you're a listener anthony have you not heard me break down all
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:42.800]  these different facets do you agree with me that this looks
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:47.040]  very suspicious or what's your take on this attack
[3:37:47.040 --> 3:37:50.560]  well alex it looks like a duck quacks like a duck
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:55.040]  and walks like a duck so i mean we don't have all the information right now
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:37:59.680]  but um as we saw before back uh over the summer the uh
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:04.080]  von brunfella uh right after this uh incident happened
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:08.640]  glenn beck was immediately saying oh look it's uh this guy's a hero to the 9
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:12.480]  11 truthers so the media is definitely going to use this to try and
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:16.080]  spin it in some way because we're seeing that the tea parties
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:20.400]  are failing the republican co-op of the tea parties are completely failing
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:25.120]  and by the way they are i mean i mean nevada arizona california texas
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:29.040]  major tea party original groups are saying we are not with the republicans
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:32.880]  get out of here right i mean the ron paul and the 9 11
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:38.480]  truth group started the tea party movement we started that in 2006 2007
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:43.280]  and now it's being hijacked by people like glenn beck and sarah palin and
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:46.160]  people aren't falling for it they're tired of democrats they're tired of
[3:38:46.160 --> 3:38:49.920]  republicans people are are hungry for a new solution
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:54.880]  and um and the controlled liberal media tried to label it as a right wing thing
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:38:59.200]  that's failing it's failing completely because if it's not a right wing thing
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:03.680]  it's a populist constitutional thing and we can get liberals and conservatives
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:07.520]  to agree on getting our country back exactly and they're
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:12.160]  definitely afraid of people like deborah medina who is a true
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:16.880]  constitutionalist candidate and that's why glenn beck uh he
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:20.560]  mentioned 9 11 just out of the blue just like in 2007
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:26.000]  just like in 2007 when ron paul uh they asked him during the primary debate
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:29.120]  they tried to group him in with 9 11 truthers he just said
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:31.440]  that's their free speech that's what they can do
[3:39:31.440 --> 3:39:35.920]  i'm not associated with i have my own views and it's happening again and it's
[3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:41.120]  just disgusting and i think this really shows uh glenn beck this really shows
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:45.680]  his true colors and who he's working for
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:54.080]  well i agree with you and i hope this isn't staged i hope
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:58.400]  this was just a nut or somebody who was really mad at the irs and did something
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:01.600]  terrible uh but they're already spinning it in the
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:05.280]  media headline right wing domestic terror attack
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:08.880]  austin playing crash labeled right wing domestic terror attack by obama
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:12.320]  supporters they're already out there with their
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:16.960]  talking points pushing this to now demonize the tea party
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:21.040]  and label it as right wing and extreme yeah it
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:25.040]  definitely looks like a co-op uh like i said before
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:28.960]  the co-op of the tea party movement the freedom movement the constitutional
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:32.800]  movement the neocons that are trying to co-op that it's completely
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:36.080]  failing in their faith and it maybe it just looks like they're getting
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:39.360]  desperate i mean like i said we don't know this just happened today
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:43.200]  but um hopefully it doesn't come out as being a as david i would say
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:48.400]  a problem reaction solution well they know that they immediately posted on his
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:50.800]  side and the way they would do this is they'd kill him
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.640]  stick him in a plane remote control into the building that's even better than
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:58.560]  classic mind control that's a classic op and there's a good chance that's what
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:00.800]  happened again i predicted exactly what would come out
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:04.000]  with the underwear bomber three or four days after it happened
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.800]  they let him on the plane they got him on somebody else was there they were
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:11.040]  videotaping it in the drill to make him think it was part of a drill
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:14.640]  they set him up they blocked him from being on watch list the government
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:17.840]  ordered uh the state department to let him on board as part of his
[3:41:17.840 --> 3:41:21.440]  of an intelligence operation same thing with the 9-11 hijackers
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:25.520]  we've had the former head of the embassy where they got through from Saudi Arabia
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:30.560]  here confirming that we've learned their fingerprints we've learned
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:34.400]  what makes them operate we've learned
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:40.560]  how they tick and so looking at this and looking at all the preparation and
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:45.760]  looking at everything that goes into it if it's a staged op
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:50.240]  look for them to find more and to find out he's a 9-11 truther
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:54.960]  and to find out he's a birther because again they'll give you something that's
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:41:58.800]  just kind of wider against the irs at first because they know if they come
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:02.080]  out with him being a 9-11 truther immediately
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:07.360]  people won't buy that but but look for them to get you hooked
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:12.240]  and to where it it's broadly demonizing anybody that doesn't like the irs
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:16.480]  and then expand it out from there boy we see that
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:20.880]  anything else anthony well uh yeah this event definitely needs to be
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:24.400]  investigated i mean look at the underwear bomber why did they
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:29.040]  let him into the country without even a passport
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:33.200]  so i mean uh but uh anyways what uh what i was going to talk about
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:36.000]  is uh when i talked to sarah paleon back in uh
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:40.160]  late 2008 i went to this event i was by myself
[3:42:40.160 --> 3:42:44.240]  i uh you know i didn't get good camera angle i didn't have anybody to come with
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:47.920]  me so it was very difficult to angle it but i asked her i said you know would
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:42:51.600]  you support the victims family members of first responders who were calling for
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:55.200]  a new investigation she said i do twice and she even asked me
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:42:58.400]  myself she said uh you know were you affected you have friends and i told her
[3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:02.720]  yeah i have friends i have uh i have friends and uh people that
[3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:06.960]  have been affected directly and um she said i do and uh
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:10.880]  this was bad like i said this was about two months after uh
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:15.120]  she uh john mccain had um this was two months after john mccain
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:19.440]  announced her as being vice president so it was just kind of uh on a whim i was
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:24.560]  by myself it was right in my hometown so i asked her and the question is Alex
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:28.160]  why is it that glenn back who glenn back who's been
[3:43:28.160 --> 3:43:32.720]  propping up sarah paleon she said more about 9 11 and supporting a new
[3:43:32.720 --> 3:43:36.880]  investigation than even deborah medina
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:43.680]  now you're absolutely right anthony and give us the ohio we are change website
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:48.400]  sure it's uh we are change ohio.org uh we've got we're gonna do a showing up

[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:38.400]  and as we say isn't an accident we hope it's an accident probably an accident
[3:44:38.400 --> 3:44:42.240]  as we then learned that the guy burned a house down supposedly stole the plane
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:46.320]  that he didn't steal the plane now the fbi's ordered his website taken down very
[3:44:46.320 --> 3:44:49.920]  suspicious you'll get to hear all that broken down i'm
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:54.880]  probably gonna pop back in in fact for sure later this evening i got to talk
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:44:58.240]  to my crew we'll we'll post it at info wars
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:01.680]  dot com and prison planet dot com this is too big too important it's like on
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:05.520]  9 11 when i ended up doing like 12 14 hours on
[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:10.080]  genesis um this is just too important so then of
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:13.760]  course we'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m to 3 p.m central standard time
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:16.800]  for all the am and fm global shortwave satellite listeners but
[3:45:16.800 --> 3:45:22.400]  now you understand why these subjects and these issues are so important
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:26.320]  false flag terror is the key to everything the new order does
[3:45:26.320 --> 3:45:30.480]  their stage crises their fake global warming their fake swine flu their
[3:45:30.480 --> 3:45:33.360]  fake terror this is how they get it done and it's
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:37.360]  been declassified this is how they get it done
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:42.480]  let's jam in some more phone calls right now uh who's up next here robert
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:45.360]  all right we're gonna go fail i i well what i told robert he's gonna be able
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:50.320]  to finish up go ahead robert uh yes uh
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:54.240]  one of the things that i wanted to talk about about this attack
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:58.480]  was how uh they use preemptive psychology
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:04.480]  um it's like um how do you explain it it's like they don't wait for people to
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:08.800]  get mad enough to do it themselves so they do it
[3:46:08.800 --> 3:46:12.800]  and clamp it down before people start doing it themselves well this is what
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:16.800]  they do this is what they do exactly i likened it to the way they put out an
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:21.440]  oil well fire by rolling up a big wheelbarrow full of dynamite the big
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:25.760]  explosion knocks it out and that's what they do but
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:28.560]  they're not really doing it to stop violence they're doing it to discredit
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:31.200]  a movement oh look you can't have states rights
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:35.040]  you can't have pro second amendment those people are tim mcvee
[3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:39.040]  oh look you don't like the irs you're not going to fly a plane into a building
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:41.440]  are you and then it also gets the government all
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:45.200]  in an us against them mentality hating the population even more
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:49.120]  putting in the naked body scanners to suppress us do you see what i'm saying
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:54.400]  yeah yeah it's like it's like uh it's not that i condone violence or any way
[3:46:54.400 --> 3:46:58.720]  shape or form uh but it's like okay if it got
[3:46:58.720 --> 3:47:02.480]  bad enough to people start doing this stuff they've done got your number
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:05.920]  they've done said that you're crazy long before
[3:47:05.920 --> 3:47:11.360]  you've done it so that you are exactly no no no no no exactly they stage lots of
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:15.040]  fake terror knowing that when they start fema camping and taking more people's
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:18.480]  children that peoples are going to defend themselves
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:22.400]  and then everybody's already labeled as terrorist very good point
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:26.720]  because they've already had all these senseless things against innocent people
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:31.440]  i agree with you anything else i think i think that this is going to be used
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:36.480]  against you personally i think that they chose austin
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:40.320]  to put a uh the the the the globalist
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:43.840]  uh what do you call it magnifying glass over austin and you're going to be the
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:46.800]  little ant right there beside that building
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:50.720]  and they're going to say you're the one that caused this
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:57.360]  it was your words your ideals and you are going to be made an example of
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:01.200]  because i agree with you i know i mean i agree with you uh if not this event
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:05.600]  others i they clearly did the
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:09.280]  event but their people have been identified by then
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:12.320]  so they couldn't blame me for the governor's mansion
[3:48:12.320 --> 3:48:18.560]  or one of my supporters and i mean they're clearly
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:23.200]  last night i woke up middle of the night realizing a lot of other pieces
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:26.320]  because when you're exhausted after doing four hours of radio
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:29.760]  it's really hard to be truly articulate but the middle of the night when you
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:33.200]  wake up with these epiphanies of understanding you already knew it
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:36.160]  subconsciously it's just becoming conscious now
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:43.280]  all these big interviews that fox cnn msnbc hbo i've discovered they're all
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:46.320]  in the last year but making documentaries about tea parties
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:51.200]  and how they're going to be violent extremists all to air in april
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:59.520]  and last night and this morning i was planning to come on air and say
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:02.160]  but no one will believe it now because i didn't make the prediction but you
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:07.040]  you know all the others i made that they're going to blow up irs buildings
[3:49:07.040 --> 3:49:13.280]  i think they're going to do lots of stuff lots of stuff and do it in april
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:19.360]  blow up irs buildings on april 15th or april 19th or try to blow them up
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:23.280]  and then they're going to have all these documentaries already made
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:27.920]  ready to come out and demonize us when this is the big top story
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:31.600]  kind of like they knew kennedy was going to die and they produced
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:35.760]  videos for all the tv stations six months before with his brain tumor
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:39.760]  kind of like us troops were already massing all around afghanistan in the
[3:49:39.760 --> 3:49:43.600]  three months before 9 11 i mean they have to
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:47.280]  preposition this stuff and so that's the key to intelligence before i ever
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:50.960]  studied the declassified manuals on military
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:54.960]  intelligence in the field how you gather it
[3:49:54.960 --> 3:49:59.600]  the government can keep what it's doing secret in the actual manuals
[3:49:59.600 --> 3:50:04.960]  but if you see an army massing across the line from you
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:07.600]  you know that's a basic form of intelligence they're getting ready for an
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:10.640]  attack and of course then they know other armies understand that so they
[3:50:10.640 --> 3:50:12.480]  constantly mass troops over and over again
[3:50:12.480 --> 3:50:16.160]  till you till you get conditioned to accept it this is all a military
[3:50:16.160 --> 3:50:20.880]  scientific mind people who say oh military intelligence that's an oxymoron
[3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:27.920]  oh yeah the military runs this country they got guys up there with 180 iqs
[3:50:27.920 --> 3:50:32.160]  running the entire show thousands of them they're all compartmentalized
[3:50:32.160 --> 3:50:35.520]  and they've got mega organizational geniuses over that
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:39.360]  and they sit this myth that government's wasteful and bad and
[3:50:39.360 --> 3:50:42.880]  screws up they always have stories about little things that are going on
[3:50:42.880 --> 3:50:47.040]  it's all designed to be wasteful it's all designed to bankrupt you
[3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:50.480]  i mean and and i got a good enough brain
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:53.040]  and i studied history to see their entire program let me tell you it's
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:55.680]  unbelievable i mean to be able to know what they know
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:50:59.440]  but i'm a good guy instead of a bad guy i could have easily been one of them

[3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:21.760]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:52:21.760 --> 3:52:26.960]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[3:52:37.840 --> 3:52:42.160]  Bernanke and arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[3:52:42.160 --> 3:52:45.520]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:04.960]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:08.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:53:08.960 --> 3:53:12.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:53:12.720 --> 3:53:16.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:20.560]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:53:20.560 --> 3:53:23.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[3:53:23.760 --> 3:53:26.400]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:30.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:53:30.320 --> 3:53:33.840]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:36.960]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:53:36.960 --> 3:53:39.600]  onages number five a solar power generator
[3:53:39.600 --> 3:53:43.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:46.720]  in the solar power generators offered by solution from science one of my old
[3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:50.800]  sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar
[3:53:50.800 --> 3:53:53.520]  backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:57.680]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com
[3:53:57.680 --> 3:54:17.360]  or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:21.360]  all right it's property taxes say andrew joes of stack
[3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:25.760]  he goes by joe stack
[3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:28.960]  and i've got to go on russia today live the two million viewers
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:32.320]  instantly when the show ends to talk about this they were going to have me
[3:54:32.320 --> 3:54:36.160]  on about the google censorship publicly of the obama deception fall the
[3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:38.400]  republic they they say you're not allowed to
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:41.840]  criticize obama because he's a racially protected group
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:46.320]  the film isn't racial but even if it was we supposedly have this free speech in
[3:54:46.320 --> 3:54:49.840]  this country it's unfair trade practices it's discriminatory
[3:54:49.840 --> 3:54:54.080]  that video is important it's up on our youtube channel and info wars dot com
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:57.280]  and prism planet dot com
[3:54:57.280 --> 3:55:01.360]  we've got teachers in other states shooting other people
[3:55:01.360 --> 3:55:04.720]  tennessee two principal shot by a teacher
[3:55:04.720 --> 3:55:11.600]  we've got um united flight diverted to di a
[3:55:11.600 --> 3:55:15.920]  after a passenger attempted to open an exterior door in midair denver post
[3:55:15.920 --> 3:55:18.800]  united flight diverted to di after passenger
[3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:23.440]  attempts to open door flight diverted to salt lake after bomb threat
[3:55:23.440 --> 3:55:26.240]  and this doesn't look good this just looks like a bunch of because see what
[3:55:26.240 --> 3:55:30.720]  they do is in the two years before the anthrax attacks
[3:55:30.720 --> 3:55:34.480]  they had a congressionally funded study for the cia of how to mail weaponized
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:38.240]  anthrax then the fbi said it wasn't weaponized anthrax then it
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:40.000]  turned out it was the most weaponized anthrax
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:43.840]  ever seen on earth made by the u.s government and was 20 years ahead of
[3:55:43.840 --> 3:55:47.360]  anything anybody thought they had the fbi said it was made in a bucket remember
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:51.840]  that and uh turned out the fbi and others did
[3:55:51.840 --> 3:55:57.600]  all these drills never telling federal office buildings and
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:02.400]  federal courthouses that it that it was part of a drill but it came out later
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:04.720]  it was drills remember all those stories about
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:08.320]  white powder saying this is anthrax it's a scyop
[3:56:08.320 --> 3:56:11.840]  just like all these anti-terror drills where they blow up a bus or part of a
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:14.400]  building in a town and then later announced it was just a drill
[3:56:14.400 --> 3:56:17.040]  is to create the perception that there's terrorism
[3:56:17.040 --> 3:56:20.880]  and they've got scyop experts watching because the subconscious mind
[3:56:20.880 --> 3:56:24.560]  takes a staged terror attack that's a drill
[3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:29.520]  on as if it's real so they really had thousands of terror attacks in the u.s
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:33.280]  they've also had real terror attacks the government staged that they tell local
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:36.640]  police to keep quiet about
[3:56:37.920 --> 3:56:41.440]  i mean there's a lot bigger control grid than you think the police are a lot
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:45.760]  more professional than you think i was driving back from port aransas
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:49.280]  last summer and i thought oh i want a shot of a refinery
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:53.280]  for my upcoming film on global warming being a fraud
[3:56:53.280 --> 3:56:56.160]  fall the republic
[3:56:56.720 --> 3:57:01.040]  and so i pulled off on the access road got out
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:05.440]  there's a giant refinery like two miles away i shoot video
[3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:10.240]  i see people in the refinery closer buildings about 300 yards away pointing
[3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:13.360]  at me i'm out there two minutes i get in my car
[3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:17.680]  and i get back on the access and here comes the state police guy hauling butt
[3:57:17.680 --> 3:57:20.640]  up on my hind end gets my driver's license
[3:57:20.640 --> 3:57:24.560]  peels off they just wanted to run me through their
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:29.280]  database system i mean they are on it okay they're watching
[3:57:29.280 --> 3:57:34.480]  everything ladies and gentlemen and come on police you're not stupid you know
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:37.920]  how to investigate stuff this is staged but they've blown up a bunch of
[3:57:37.920 --> 3:57:40.960]  refineries and then told the public it was an
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:44.160]  accident they've had a bunch of other staged terror attacks
[3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:47.840]  that were real but they were staged by the government
[3:57:47.840 --> 3:57:50.720]  and that's why the police and military are scared to death they're like
[3:57:50.720 --> 3:57:53.760]  there's been a lot of other attacks you don't know about alex and i'm like i
[3:57:53.760 --> 3:57:58.160]  know i know all about it and they've had them
[3:57:58.160 --> 3:58:04.320]  you know find nukes on the texas coast and missing nukes out of

[3:59:45.440 --> 4:00:11.440]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[4:00:18.880 --> 4:00:23.440]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen this is not our regular
[4:00:23.440 --> 4:00:27.280]  radio tv broadcast time we're normally live 11am
[4:00:27.280 --> 4:00:31.840]  to 3pm central standard time
[4:00:33.120 --> 4:00:40.160]  but at approximately 9.55 in the morning on the 18th
[4:00:40.160 --> 4:00:45.360]  of february 2010 here in austin texas the home of our operations in the
[4:00:45.360 --> 4:00:49.120]  capital city of the great state of texas a small
[4:00:49.120 --> 4:00:55.120]  single engine plane slammed into one of the buildings at the
[4:00:55.120 --> 4:01:02.960]  echelon building complex there's four buildings the fbi
[4:01:02.960 --> 4:01:11.920]  the irs the cia all reportedly have offices in those buildings
[4:01:11.920 --> 4:01:17.600]  and a good hour before the mainstream media began
[4:01:17.600 --> 4:01:21.440]  saying this may have been a terrorist attack or a criminal act
[4:01:21.440 --> 4:01:26.640]  i just simply said look this is a government
[4:01:26.640 --> 4:01:30.640]  complex a private office complex mainly filled
[4:01:30.640 --> 4:01:34.160]  with government offices similar to building seven
[4:01:34.160 --> 4:01:39.200]  on 9 11 eight plus years ago it was a private building but it had the fbi
[4:01:39.200 --> 4:01:42.960]  cia defense intelligence in it
[4:01:43.680 --> 4:01:49.680]  and i said because it is a government filled installation
[4:01:49.680 --> 4:01:54.720]  that ups the chances that this is a attack of some type and i said
[4:01:54.720 --> 4:01:59.280]  it could be i said this is the first hour it's on record
[4:01:59.280 --> 4:02:05.680]  the 18th of february 2010 and i noticed we got some emails and i saw some
[4:02:05.680 --> 4:02:08.640]  stories of people making fun of us saying oh there's alex
[4:02:08.640 --> 4:02:11.840]  jones again saying it could be a terror attack and saying
[4:02:11.840 --> 4:02:17.360]  it could be a false flag and i said 50 50 chance
[4:02:17.360 --> 4:02:20.800]  that if this is some type of deliberate event that it's either some
[4:02:20.800 --> 4:02:25.760]  disgruntled person or it's staged now i said that
[4:02:25.760 --> 4:02:29.280]  the first live show we did after christmas christmas is on a friday
[4:02:29.280 --> 4:02:33.760]  i do the sunday show the 27th of december i went live on air
[4:02:33.760 --> 4:02:37.440]  and i said if we find out he bypassed security someone helped him get on the
[4:02:37.440 --> 4:02:40.480]  plane if we find out there were people on the plane with him
[4:02:40.480 --> 4:02:44.800]  if we find things like that out this is probably an inside job
[4:02:44.800 --> 4:02:49.520]  then they simultaneously on christmas started promoting
[4:02:50.240 --> 4:02:53.360]  the naked body scanners that they'd already ordered a year before that were
[4:02:53.360 --> 4:02:58.160]  set to go in in january a few weeks later 2010
[4:02:58.160 --> 4:03:04.480]  this is late 2009 and since then it's come out that it's a complete
[4:03:04.480 --> 4:03:10.880]  false flag completely an absolute total inside
[4:03:10.880 --> 4:03:15.760]  operation the detroit news terror suspect kept visa to avoid
[4:03:15.760 --> 4:03:19.440]  tipping off larger investigation
[4:03:21.040 --> 4:03:24.960]  kennedy the undersecretary for management of the state department said an
[4:03:24.960 --> 4:03:29.760]  unnamed us intelligence agency told them to let him get on the plane
[4:03:29.760 --> 4:03:35.200]  without a passport without a visa but that wasn't enough
[4:03:35.200 --> 4:03:38.480]  they had to have the smart dress man lead him through security pass the
[4:03:38.480 --> 4:03:41.920]  naked body scanners that amsterdam already had to get him on the plane
[4:03:41.920 --> 4:03:46.400]  then somebody from four rows back is videotaping him throughout the entire
[4:03:46.400 --> 4:03:54.160]  16 hour flight from europe to michigan then the eyewitnesses said
[4:03:54.160 --> 4:03:57.280]  once they got him in customs the bond sniffing dog ran over
[4:03:57.280 --> 4:04:01.840]  to another man a black man's bag they said oh there's a bomb get out of here
[4:04:01.840 --> 4:04:04.560]  then the fbi lied and said there was no smart dress man
[4:04:04.560 --> 4:04:08.240]  nobody helped him get on the plane there was nobody videotaping him
[4:04:08.240 --> 4:04:12.400]  and no one else was arrested once we landed turned out that was all
[4:04:12.400 --> 4:04:17.680]  lies on record now i'm just giving you a little bit of background from one
[4:04:17.680 --> 4:04:20.960]  case before i get into all the new big developments
[4:04:20.960 --> 4:04:24.640]  i told you in the show ended at three that we wouldn't be back live until
[4:04:24.640 --> 4:04:27.840]  tomorrow unless there were big developments
[4:04:27.840 --> 4:04:33.920]  there have been gigantic developments in the attack in austin and i'm going to
[4:04:33.920 --> 4:04:37.760]  go over those in a moment we have been to the guy's
[4:04:37.760 --> 4:04:44.480]  house we've been to his neighbors i sent rob do and jason
[4:04:44.480 --> 4:04:49.520]  douglas they're going to be in studio with us coming up in 30 minutes
[4:04:49.520 --> 4:04:54.480]  i have talked to people i know in austin that live in apartments
[4:04:54.480 --> 4:04:58.880]  nearby they saw
[4:05:00.880 --> 4:05:05.040]  individuals from the fbi out there within seconds they heard the boom
[4:05:05.040 --> 4:05:08.960]  we have multiple witnesses by name i've talked to them on and off air
[4:05:08.960 --> 4:05:12.480]  they were out there with video cameras filming everything within seconds by
[4:05:12.480 --> 4:05:14.480]  the time they got to their windows to see the boom
[4:05:14.480 --> 4:05:18.960]  the fbi was outside with cameras they went down and talked to them and they
[4:05:18.960 --> 4:05:22.960]  said we are the terror response team
[4:05:22.960 --> 4:05:28.560]  local austin news in fact that's in paul watson's article pull that video up to
[4:05:28.560 --> 4:05:32.080]  it's up on youtube source fbi new austin attack was coming
[4:05:32.080 --> 4:05:39.040]  that's the breaking news coming up but in there paul has the link to the youtube
[4:05:39.040 --> 4:05:44.080]  of kxan that's nbc in austin a separate witness till kxan
[4:05:44.080 --> 4:05:47.680]  that there were hazmat teams and fire trucks in place across the street
[4:05:47.680 --> 4:05:55.600]  before the plane struck the building this is all coming up
[4:05:55.600 --> 4:06:00.000]  now let's go back to the start of the show
[4:06:00.000 --> 4:06:06.160]  today at 11 a.m i come on and i say i hope it's somebody that had a
[4:06:06.160 --> 4:06:10.000]  heart attack and fell on the stick but witnesses said the plane
[4:06:10.000 --> 4:06:14.640]  came low at about 150 feet accelerated and went down perfectly into the
[4:06:14.640 --> 4:06:20.720]  building
[4:06:20.800 --> 4:06:25.680]  and then i went back to yesterday's show where we had from a high level source
[4:06:25.680 --> 4:06:29.440]  who was with rick perry in a meeting that they're worried about states rights
[4:06:29.440 --> 4:06:33.760]  and deborah medina alex jones ron paul that we've got to be dealt with
[4:06:33.760 --> 4:06:36.160]  you've seen the dirty tricks against deborah medina
[4:06:36.160 --> 4:06:40.880]  limbeck was doing it again today because if she wins it sends shock waves
[4:06:40.880 --> 4:06:44.080]  across the country the states stand up when did the feds bomb
[4:06:44.080 --> 4:06:48.800]  oklahoma city and that's a proven case they bombed it
[4:06:48.800 --> 4:06:52.080]  when oklahoma and colorado were leading the charge
[4:06:52.080 --> 4:06:55.280]  with over 20 other states to declare tenth amendment powers
[4:06:55.280 --> 4:06:58.240]  and say we're not under federal control stop your
[4:06:58.240 --> 4:07:01.840]  unconstitutional taxation and control that's happening again
[4:07:01.840 --> 4:07:05.440]  every time this happens the government stages
[4:07:05.440 --> 4:07:10.240]  bombings mass shootings and terror attacks to demonize their opposition now
[4:07:10.240 --> 4:07:15.280]  what did i say at the start of the show i said if it turns out
[4:07:15.280 --> 4:07:19.600]  that this is a terror attack or deliberate event
[4:07:19.600 --> 4:07:24.320]  they're going to say it's a tea party person
[4:07:25.360 --> 4:07:29.680]  i said back on december 8th december 9th and on multiple occasions since then
[4:07:29.680 --> 4:07:32.080]  and we're digging through all the videos we don't just mark down these
[4:07:32.080 --> 4:07:36.240]  predictions they just come out of me from all my research
[4:07:36.240 --> 4:07:39.280]  when masking listeners to go through our youtube channel the audios posted
[4:07:39.280 --> 4:07:42.480]  everywhere help us we don't have the staff i don't have the staff to go back
[4:07:42.480 --> 4:07:47.440]  to the first hour of my tv show and radio show today
[4:07:47.440 --> 4:07:51.840]  and get the audio of where in the first hour
[4:07:51.840 --> 4:07:57.040]  i said this is probably going to end up being a so-called tea party person
[4:07:57.040 --> 4:08:02.320]  how do i know this because i saw the preparatory conditioning
[4:08:02.320 --> 4:08:06.240]  on chris matthew slime ball beck the
[4:08:06.240 --> 4:08:12.800]  ninny and all the other shows saying 9 11 truthers and it changed in the last
[4:08:12.800 --> 4:08:16.160]  week not 9 11 truthers 9 11 truthers the middle tray of the tea
[4:08:16.160 --> 4:08:18.880]  party they've got to be dealt with they've got to be taken out they want to
[4:08:18.880 --> 4:08:21.840]  kill the president they want to stage terror attacks mark my words
[4:08:21.840 --> 4:08:26.560]  beck said many others as a talking point i saw it simultaneously on other
[4:08:26.560 --> 4:08:31.360]  channels out of nowhere made no sense unless you understand
[4:08:31.360 --> 4:08:37.200]  then i saw him in the last two days we posted these videos start saying and
[4:08:37.200 --> 4:08:39.360]  putting government dean up on the shockboard
[4:08:39.360 --> 4:08:44.720]  and next to terrorist and saying
[4:08:45.520 --> 4:08:50.880]  next to weathermen bombers and now he put up phil burr i want to get phil
[4:08:50.880 --> 4:08:54.960]  burr gone the next few days i'm convenient to do that right a note
[4:08:54.960 --> 4:09:00.800]  and putting him up there with him and saying the burthers are dangerous and
[4:09:00.800 --> 4:09:03.760]  want violence tonight i wasn't even intending to
[4:09:03.760 --> 4:09:08.720]  tune in we had it on fox there he was saying the number one threat is the
[4:09:08.720 --> 4:09:11.520]  burthers over half of republicans and polls
[4:09:11.520 --> 4:09:15.440]  question obama's bursary tibia because he did have the name barris itaro
[4:09:15.440 --> 4:09:19.520]  people are now learning this he did have another fake name he did go to these
[4:09:19.520 --> 4:09:24.160]  mosque he he he he did get raised in islamic schools i mean you know the
[4:09:24.160 --> 4:09:27.680]  point is there's something going on here
[4:09:27.680 --> 4:09:33.840]  where does bet get it that they're going to be violent i saw him tonight
[4:09:33.840 --> 4:09:37.200]  say and i watched five minutes of it it was an hour show
[4:09:37.200 --> 4:09:41.200]  i was busy on the phone with witnesses and guys bringing in video from going to
[4:09:41.200 --> 4:09:46.880]  the supposed kamikaze attackers house who supposedly attacked austin i mean
[4:09:46.880 --> 4:09:50.560]  it's like a war room in here and there's bet on the tv in the studio
[4:09:50.560 --> 4:09:54.160]  control room saying here's deborah medina
[4:09:54.160 --> 4:09:59.520]  here's philburg of the burthers these people are dangerous
[4:09:59.520 --> 4:10:03.120]  and i heard him say the burthers are the most
[4:10:03.120 --> 4:10:09.520]  dangerous see he gets your confidence and then stabs you in the back
[4:10:09.520 --> 4:10:13.840]  that's what fox news is designed to do all right all right i gotta start going
[4:10:13.840 --> 4:10:17.120]  through the evidence now it's just i'm trying to give you a small picture of
[4:10:17.120 --> 4:10:21.440]  all the info i have and how i collated knowing how the globalist operate
[4:10:21.440 --> 4:10:25.600]  knowing what their past programs are knowing their modus operandi
[4:10:25.600 --> 4:10:29.760]  they are criminals and if you study criminal psychology
[4:10:29.760 --> 4:10:33.360]  these are genius criminals they repeat the same things in different variants
[4:10:33.360 --> 4:10:38.320]  over and over again they're very pathological very obsessive compulsive
[4:10:40.080 --> 4:10:42.320]  now
[4:10:42.320 --> 4:10:52.240]  i go on air and i say watch it's going to be a tea party person
[4:10:52.240 --> 4:10:58.320]  it's going to be some anti government anti irs person
[4:10:59.520 --> 4:11:05.600]  and then lo and behold hours later i'm proven right
[4:11:05.600 --> 4:11:09.680]  when are people going to start really listening to me
[4:11:09.680 --> 4:11:14.240]  i believe what i'm saying we have an incredibly accurate track record we know
[4:11:14.240 --> 4:11:17.920]  what we're doing when i tell you a high level source
[4:11:17.920 --> 4:11:21.360]  called me to warn me that perry says he's basically coming after me
[4:11:21.360 --> 4:11:25.200]  and the republicans understand what's happening because who else understands
[4:11:25.200 --> 4:11:28.720]  these people who else has done the studying i'm in danger
[4:11:28.720 --> 4:11:32.080]  ladies and gentlemen so is ron paul so is deborah medina
[4:11:32.080 --> 4:11:35.840]  these carl rove ran the dirty tricks for nixon
[4:11:35.840 --> 4:11:40.400]  carl rove ran all these other dirty puts innocent governor in alabama in prison
[4:11:40.400 --> 4:11:44.560]  that came out mainstream news he had to be released
[4:11:44.560 --> 4:11:48.080]  they don't play games
[4:11:48.720 --> 4:11:52.320]  texas is one of the wealthiest states the second most populated the second
[4:11:52.320 --> 4:11:55.680]  richest about to be the number one california is imploding
[4:11:55.680 --> 4:11:59.120]  they're getting hundreds of billions in roads they're taking over for toll roads
[4:11:59.120 --> 4:12:03.120]  tens of billions in energy scams they're running they want to control this state
[4:12:03.120 --> 4:12:09.040]  and they'll do whatever they have to to keep that phony rick perry in
[4:12:09.040 --> 4:12:11.760]  god forbid these people kill me or set me up
[4:12:11.760 --> 4:12:16.160]  please support me folks after that happens i mean
[4:12:16.160 --> 4:12:21.600]  this is so real what's happening this is so hardcore
[4:12:21.600 --> 4:12:25.760]  now continuing here
[4:12:26.240 --> 4:12:29.120]  i wrote some notes before we went live let me let let me just read you the
[4:12:29.120 --> 4:12:33.440]  notes i've got to understand what we're facing
[4:12:33.440 --> 4:12:39.520]  they have done this before i told you at 11am this morning
[4:12:39.520 --> 4:12:43.600]  we've been proven right they're now saying i said at 11
[4:12:43.600 --> 4:12:47.280]  they're gonna want to shut down small airports in general aviation
[4:12:47.280 --> 4:12:50.320]  that's now been announced you guys print me that article
[4:12:50.320 --> 4:12:56.720]  moves to quote shut shut down the loopholes of security at small airports
[4:12:56.720 --> 4:13:01.840]  now they're saying see we need body scanners everywhere and on the streets
[4:13:01.840 --> 4:13:07.040]  and they launched a nationwide program of of tsa on the streets of america
[4:13:07.040 --> 4:13:09.760]  running checkpoints that was on the news today we wrote an article about it this
[4:13:09.760 --> 4:13:14.640]  morning before this happened fourth amendment trash as airport tyranny hits
[4:13:14.640 --> 4:13:19.120]  the streets fbi ordered this guy's website taken
[4:13:19.120 --> 4:13:22.640]  down where he posted his manifesto
[4:13:22.640 --> 4:13:26.240]  i said before that even happened if they take it down it's because they know
[4:13:26.240 --> 4:13:29.840]  good computer people can get into his site and find out if somebody else
[4:13:29.840 --> 4:13:33.120]  posted this supposed suicide letter manifesto
[4:13:33.120 --> 4:13:38.560]  then we went and talked to the neighbors they've been told don't talk to anybody
[4:13:38.560 --> 4:13:41.840]  you'd have got here earlier they said we talked to you but we've already made a
[4:13:41.840 --> 4:13:44.800]  commitment not to talk to anybody who told you that well we're not going to
[4:13:44.800 --> 4:13:46.880]  tell you
[4:13:46.880 --> 4:13:48.880]  so we're going to talk to you
[4:13:48.880 --> 4:13:52.640]  body who told you that we're not going to tell you
[4:13:52.640 --> 4:13:55.920]  glenbeck's involved in more treason he went to this whole thing if we don't know
[4:13:55.920 --> 4:13:59.360]  who this guy is he showed a picture of just a blacked out silhouette is he a
[4:13:59.360 --> 4:14:02.640]  liberal is he a progressive is he a conservative is he a radical
[4:14:02.640 --> 4:14:09.440]  constitutionalist and then he went and put the image of the
[4:14:09.440 --> 4:14:13.920]  kamikaze attacker on the right wing side of the chalkboard the message was he's
[4:14:13.920 --> 4:14:16.720]  a constitutionalist and then he went in to say the number one
[4:14:16.720 --> 4:14:20.400]  threat is the birthers they want violence
[4:14:20.400 --> 4:14:23.840]  they're getting ready to set you up birthers and now i'm starting to think
[4:14:23.840 --> 4:14:27.600]  and i've kind of just investigated it said there's some evidence but i don't
[4:14:27.600 --> 4:14:30.960]  know now i'm pretty sure there there is
[4:14:30.960 --> 4:14:34.000]  something going on with obama because if they've got their operative beck
[4:14:34.000 --> 4:14:38.320]  defending obama this way we're in deep trouble
[4:14:38.320 --> 4:14:41.920]  what a bold move more than half of republicans not to mention tea party
[4:14:41.920 --> 4:14:44.640]  people are questioning his birth certificate and beck saying they're
[4:14:44.640 --> 4:14:49.200]  terrorist this is unbelievable i mean i i can't
[4:14:49.200 --> 4:14:53.920]  believe what i'm saying and he's a mouthpiece so what he says is important
[4:14:53.920 --> 4:14:57.200]  get a lot of intel from it
[4:14:57.600 --> 4:15:00.560]  time magazine
[4:15:01.280 --> 4:15:07.360]  time magazine runs the headline the austin playing incident an attack on the
[4:15:07.360 --> 4:15:11.280]  irs and attacks tea parties other headlines say this is a black eye for
[4:15:11.280 --> 4:15:14.880]  the tea parties it's everywhere the obama sites everywhere
[4:15:14.880 --> 4:15:18.160]  corporate media blames kamikaze attack on tea parties
[4:15:18.160 --> 4:15:23.760]  key article prison planet dot com now
[4:15:24.320 --> 4:15:28.480]  i want to go through
[4:15:31.600 --> 4:15:38.000]  this piece by piece why do i immediately when a plane crashes into a
[4:15:38.000 --> 4:15:41.440]  government-filled office park government installation
[4:15:41.440 --> 4:15:47.520]  government agency-filled area why do i immediately come out
[4:15:47.520 --> 4:15:50.480]  and say this may be staged well why did i say repeatedly in the last few months
[4:15:50.480 --> 4:15:54.640]  they're going to stage attacks on
[4:15:56.320 --> 4:16:00.960]  government installations in austin and blame it on
[4:16:00.960 --> 4:16:07.120]  the patriot movement because ladies and gentlemen when i tell you we have people
[4:16:07.120 --> 4:16:11.200]  showing up at our office after the governor's mansion was firebomb
[4:16:11.200 --> 4:16:14.720]  would police out in the parking lot trying to set us up and give us a box
[4:16:14.720 --> 4:16:17.120]  full of stuff and saying they worked at the mansion and
[4:16:17.120 --> 4:16:20.320]  they're a suspect but they're not involved and they're big fans then i
[4:16:20.320 --> 4:16:23.760]  find out the same federal informant that set up people with mall off cocktails
[4:16:23.760 --> 4:16:27.840]  of the rnc gives interviews the npr admitting it
[4:16:27.840 --> 4:16:32.400]  and then now activists in austin say he tried to get them to firebomb brave new
[4:16:32.400 --> 4:16:35.280]  books that my listeners started and it
[4:16:35.280 --> 4:16:39.760]  promotes what we do and then i find out the same informants hanging out with a
[4:16:39.760 --> 4:16:43.440]  palestinian professor who slit his own throat cut himself open
[4:16:43.440 --> 4:16:48.880]  tied his own arms and hands and duct tape and threw himself in the river
[4:16:51.440 --> 4:16:55.440]  when i find out from a high level person who's a household name that met with
[4:16:55.440 --> 4:16:58.400]  parry that they're coming after us and worried about ron paul
[4:16:58.400 --> 4:17:00.960]  alex jones and ebra medina and the state's rights movement they're getting

[4:17:17.280 --> 4:17:22.720]  understand how they operate this is what we do here

[4:18:08.160 --> 4:18:12.640]  there before the attack happened remember what happened on 9 11 and there's
[4:18:12.640 --> 4:18:14.880]  literally hundreds of other examples that's the problem there's too much
[4:18:14.880 --> 4:18:17.760]  proof see when you study this you have it all
[4:18:17.760 --> 4:18:21.360]  i'm trying to give it to you if you're not aware remember

[4:18:32.240 --> 4:18:34.320]  around the world trade center the night before
[4:18:34.320 --> 4:18:38.480]  on september 10 people said oh that's a misspoke and then
[4:18:38.480 --> 4:18:42.480]  juliani said oh that's a misspoke and then he turned out he'd done two
[4:18:42.480 --> 4:18:45.280]  interviews on 9 11 himself saying yeah they
[4:18:45.280 --> 4:18:49.200]  deployed for an anti-terror drill for an attack on the world trade centers
[4:18:49.200 --> 4:18:53.440]  the morning of 9 11 before it happened and it's now confirmed
[4:18:53.440 --> 4:18:58.160]  and declassified it was called tripod too so you got fire trucks and police
[4:18:58.160 --> 4:19:02.000]  and the fbi anti-terrorism squad out there
[4:19:02.000 --> 4:19:07.840]  before this happens and we're only

[4:19:45.360 --> 4:19:49.360]  and control grids and fema camps i wish this wasn't real

[4:24:16.800 --> 4:24:19.120]  it's good to be on the side of right it's good to be informed
[4:24:19.120 --> 4:24:22.720]  it's good to be detectives for the people really investigating what's
[4:24:22.720 --> 4:24:27.040]  happening source this is the big big breaking news
[4:24:27.040 --> 4:24:34.640]  source fbi knew austin attack was coming
[4:24:34.640 --> 4:24:38.640]  dallas office dispatched agents yesterday afternoon to be on the ground in
[4:24:38.640 --> 4:24:42.640]  austin a trusted source has told his office that the fbi
[4:24:42.640 --> 4:24:45.840]  knew austin was going to be attacked today
[4:24:45.840 --> 4:24:49.680]  and then dispatched officers from its dallas headquarters yesterday afternoon
[4:24:49.680 --> 4:24:55.200]  to be in place for today's incident the source claims and we know this source
[4:24:55.200 --> 4:24:57.920]  and they've done good work in the past that's what's scary i wish this wasn't
[4:24:57.920 --> 4:25:01.120]  true the source claims a confidential memo was circulated
[4:25:01.120 --> 4:25:04.720]  yesterday detailing that a building in austin was going to be the target of an
[4:25:04.720 --> 4:25:08.800]  attack today he was told this by an informant who works
[4:25:08.800 --> 4:25:15.120]  in the dallas fbi office remember we have informants that gave us the
[4:25:15.120 --> 4:25:18.400]  mayack and homeland security reports people didn't believe that for four or
[4:25:18.400 --> 4:25:22.560]  five days was real is it real is it real
[4:25:22.560 --> 4:25:26.080]  folks you can't believe the intel that comes across its oceans of it i can't
[4:25:26.080 --> 4:25:31.520]  even handle it anymore vetting it checking it just drowning in evidence
[4:25:31.520 --> 4:25:37.840]  we've got fema camp construction workers ready to come on i mean i just can't
[4:25:38.640 --> 4:25:43.120]  four fbi agents hurriedly left the dallas office yesterday to be ready
[4:25:43.120 --> 4:25:46.960]  and on the scene for the aftermath of the incident according to the informant
[4:25:46.960 --> 4:25:50.400]  who was shaken when he saw events unfolding today and put two and two
[4:25:50.400 --> 4:25:55.520]  together they called our source this morning
[4:25:55.520 --> 4:25:59.200]  we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim but the source is known to us
[4:25:59.200 --> 4:26:02.160]  and has no motivation for inventing the story
[4:26:02.160 --> 4:26:06.400]  the fact that the pilot joe stack changed his manifesto 27 times
[4:26:06.400 --> 4:26:10.400]  before the final version suggests that he had been waiting
[4:26:10.400 --> 4:26:13.920]  and been writing it for days and could have been
[4:26:13.920 --> 4:26:17.840]  what tipped off the fbi and the build-up to the attack
[4:26:17.840 --> 4:26:22.720]  this could be a strange coincidence that glenn beck and all these other people
[4:26:22.720 --> 4:26:26.240]  are putting out the talking points that tea party terrorists are about to
[4:26:26.240 --> 4:26:31.280]  strike but i'm glenn beck i'm benedict arnold you can trust me
[4:26:32.000 --> 4:26:36.080]  it could be it's all a coincidence it could be that we're wrong he could just
[4:26:36.080 --> 4:26:42.000]  be a lone nut could be could be but it's gone from 50 50
[4:26:42.000 --> 4:26:51.520]  that it's a lone nut or a staged event to 75 25 20 75 stage 25 not staged
[4:26:51.520 --> 4:26:57.040]  pretty soon it'll be 99.9 unfortunately if this evidence continues to go this way
[4:26:57.040 --> 4:27:00.720]  just like the underwear bomber is
[4:27:00.720 --> 4:27:07.760]  the fact that pilot joe stack changes manifesto at least 27 times before the final
[4:27:07.760 --> 4:27:10.240]  version suggests that he had been writing it for days
[4:27:10.240 --> 4:27:13.680]  and this could have been what tipped off the fbi and the build-up to the attack
[4:27:13.680 --> 4:27:17.760]  so they could have just responded to something real and
[4:27:17.760 --> 4:27:21.120]  they didn't know they knew it was an irs building there's several in austin and
[4:27:21.120 --> 4:27:24.640]  they had people standing by and he had his own private hangar
[4:27:24.640 --> 4:27:28.240]  why didn't they go there and stop him they knew that
[4:27:28.240 --> 4:27:31.520]  that kind of undermines them doesn't it that they knew he had a private hangar
[4:27:31.520 --> 4:27:37.120]  at least with some other folks he was there why didn't they go out to the hangar
[4:27:37.120 --> 4:27:42.640]  maybe he moved the plane before i mean it just doesn't look good for him
[4:27:44.480 --> 4:27:48.160]  oh this is i'm in a science fiction movie i'm living in a science fiction
[4:27:48.160 --> 4:27:53.920]  twilight zone event i am glenn beck tonight called himself a founding
[4:27:53.920 --> 4:27:57.520]  father i couldn't believe it he said i am your founding father you're either with
[4:27:57.520 --> 4:28:02.000]  george washington or with the terrorist he's copying me but twisting it i've
[4:28:02.000 --> 4:28:05.440]  said you're either with the spirit of 1776 and george washington or the new
[4:28:05.440 --> 4:28:09.840]  world order i can't handle it man
[4:28:13.200 --> 4:28:16.640]  the fact that joe stack changed his manifesto at least 27 times before the
[4:28:16.640 --> 4:28:19.520]  final version suggests that he had been writing it for days
[4:28:19.520 --> 4:28:23.920]  and this could have been what tipped off the fbi to build up to the attack
[4:28:23.920 --> 4:28:27.360]  the claim dovetails with reports we're receiving from austin residents
[4:28:27.360 --> 4:28:30.560]  we have their names here i even know one of them the fbi were immediately on the
[4:28:30.560 --> 4:28:33.280]  scene after the plane crash and we're filming both the building
[4:28:33.280 --> 4:28:39.760]  and eyewitnesses continuing a separate witness told kxan news and we're going
[4:28:39.760 --> 4:28:43.280]  to play that in a moment you have it ready correct
[4:28:43.600 --> 4:28:47.280]  that there were has met how long is that video
[4:28:47.280 --> 4:28:58.240]  okay good a separate witness told kxan news that there were has met teams and
[4:28:58.240 --> 4:29:01.440]  fire trucks in place across the street before the plane struck the building
[4:29:01.440 --> 4:29:04.800]  info wars reporters who spoke with neighbors at stacks house
[4:29:04.800 --> 4:29:08.400]  which he had burned to the ground before crashing the plane express surprise
[4:29:08.400 --> 4:29:12.480]  and how quick emergency services responded to the fire one neighbor named
[4:29:12.480 --> 4:29:17.120]  elbert said the emergency crews arrived five minutes ahead
[4:29:17.120 --> 4:29:21.840]  of him made the 911 call whether the attack was the work of a lone individual
[4:29:21.840 --> 4:29:25.040]  are part of a larger setup the aftermath is being exploited
[4:29:25.040 --> 4:29:28.240]  to the fullest by the corporate media and people like lindbeck who were
[4:29:28.240 --> 4:29:31.040]  blaming the incident on constitutionalist and the liberty movement
[4:29:31.040 --> 4:29:34.720]  we have a link to that implying that anyone who shares
[4:29:34.720 --> 4:29:37.920]  any of these grievances outlined in stacks lengthy manifesto
[4:29:37.920 --> 4:29:41.760]  are intent on crashing planes in the buildings of course
[4:29:41.760 --> 4:29:44.880]  the previous stage terror attack cryptus christmas day underwear bombing
[4:29:44.880 --> 4:29:48.240]  incident was proven to be a setup and the authorities repeatedly
[4:29:48.240 --> 4:29:52.400]  had to change their cover story after eyewitness kurt haskel and others
[4:29:52.400 --> 4:29:55.760]  who were initially derided by the media were eventually proven right and the
[4:29:55.760 --> 4:30:00.160]  fact that the bomber was allowed to board flight 253 by order of the state

[4:30:51.760 --> 4:30:55.760]  the tea party movement because it's the most vocal
[4:30:55.760 --> 4:30:59.600]  mobilized people against this tyranny we're going to play this local tv clip

[4:32:16.800 --> 4:32:20.160]  and she saw the plane fly from north to south
[4:32:20.160 --> 4:32:24.000]  she didn't see it hit the hit this building in fact but she saw the big
[4:32:24.000 --> 4:32:27.440]  explosion afterwards lots of people like that around
[4:32:27.440 --> 4:32:30.800]  here this morning uh we are if you're not familiar we also
[4:32:30.800 --> 4:32:34.720]  talked to a trained pilot who actually saw the the plane actually hit the
[4:32:34.720 --> 4:32:39.040]  building he said it was a Cherokee 140 he's actually flown that exact plane
[4:32:39.040 --> 4:32:42.560]  before he was he was visibly shaken and
[4:32:42.560 --> 4:32:47.120]  shaking this morning uh after seeing that amazing sight
[4:32:47.120 --> 4:32:52.160]  just wow just an amazing an amazing sight this morning
[4:32:52.160 --> 4:32:58.720]  uh and it shot right across the road was going really fast those aren't fast
[4:32:58.720 --> 4:33:03.600]  airplanes they cruise about 115 and he was it's not if the engine was
[4:33:03.600 --> 4:33:06.800]  on full blast of course i can't testify to that but
[4:33:06.800 --> 4:33:11.760]  it sure was hauling oh man it was a it was a really speedy dive
[4:33:11.760 --> 4:33:15.520]  and it whacked in the right between the first and second floor of echelon
[4:33:15.520 --> 4:33:19.440]  three can you show me exactly where can you show our viewers exactly where you
[4:33:19.440 --> 4:33:22.480]  believe that plane hit see the the white smoke yeah
[4:33:22.480 --> 4:33:26.960]  it's right there it's that hole breaking news federal investigators are at a
[4:33:26.960 --> 4:33:30.880]  fiery scene in austin texas where the pilot of a small plane
[4:33:30.880 --> 4:33:34.480]  slammed into a seven-story building which houses offices
[4:33:34.480 --> 4:33:39.760]  for the internal revenue service and the cia video from a traffic camera shows
[4:33:39.760 --> 4:33:42.160]  heavy smoke coming from the building
[4:33:42.160 --> 4:33:47.120]  investigators say the Cherokee 140 plane hit the building at 946 a.m central
[4:33:47.120 --> 4:33:50.800]  time the pilot has been identified as joseph andrew
[4:33:50.800 --> 4:33:55.680]  stack two people were injured and a third remains unaccounted for
[4:33:55.680 --> 4:34:00.320]  federal officials say the irs and the cia have offices in this complex it's
[4:34:00.320 --> 4:34:04.320]  the reason why f-16 jets scrambled to the scene
[4:34:04.320 --> 4:34:08.160]  in a strange twist austin firefighters were called to stacks home
[4:34:08.160 --> 4:34:11.680]  which he allegedly set on fire just before this
[4:34:11.680 --> 4:34:16.000]  for more on this breaking news story we turn to austin texas radio host alex
[4:34:16.000 --> 4:34:20.720]  jones alex you are in austin and all day we've been hearing about this and we've
[4:34:20.720 --> 4:34:24.160]  also been hearing some contradicting reports about whether or not this crash
[4:34:24.160 --> 4:34:27.200]  was intentional and repeated statements from the media
[4:34:27.200 --> 4:34:30.400]  from the media that this was not an act of terrorism
[4:34:30.400 --> 4:34:33.600]  but let's talk about this for a second this is a guy who was upset with the
[4:34:33.600 --> 4:34:37.760]  u.s government big brother taxes bailouts etc
[4:34:37.760 --> 4:34:41.920]  why isn't this a case of domestic terrorism
[4:34:41.920 --> 4:34:48.960]  well it's clear that this was intentional
[4:34:48.960 --> 4:34:54.640]  right now that's 95 chance he posted a manifesto on his own business site
[4:34:54.640 --> 4:34:59.760]  or someone did claiming to be him saying that he was going to go after the
[4:34:59.760 --> 4:35:03.440]  government and it was basically a manifesto slash
[4:35:03.440 --> 4:35:10.000]  suicide letter the fbi has ordered the internet service company that he had
[4:35:10.000 --> 4:35:13.920]  his servers with to take down his website we actually broke
[4:35:13.920 --> 4:35:18.240]  this news about four hours ago three and a half hours ago the austin american
[4:35:18.240 --> 4:35:23.600]  statesman then confirmed it and the fbi is saying that it was
[4:35:23.600 --> 4:35:27.520]  right now looks like an intentional act but they're not calling it terrorism
[4:35:27.520 --> 4:35:31.520]  they're calling it a criminal act but for the first
[4:35:31.520 --> 4:35:35.600]  few hours they weren't sure first they said that he had stolen the plane
[4:35:35.600 --> 4:35:40.160]  now they're saying that he didn't steal the plane
[4:35:40.160 --> 4:35:46.160]  the bigger issue here is that we've been aware of federal operations in texas
[4:35:46.160 --> 4:35:49.520]  to demonize the tea parties and the state's rights movement
[4:35:49.520 --> 4:35:53.520]  i've had this from the highest sources people that have talked directly to rick
[4:35:53.520 --> 4:35:57.200]  perry that he wants to target myself deborah medina running for governor
[4:35:57.200 --> 4:36:01.040]  and ron paul to try to demonize this we've seen talking points
[4:36:01.040 --> 4:36:05.360]  lately saying the tea parties are going to state some type of terror event
[4:36:05.360 --> 4:36:09.040]  and then you have this suspicious incident where the government facilities
[4:36:09.040 --> 4:36:13.280]  a government building with fbi and irs
[4:36:13.280 --> 4:36:16.960]  and other secretive agencies uh based in there
[4:36:16.960 --> 4:36:20.160]  you have this happen it is very very suspicious it may be
[4:36:20.160 --> 4:36:23.280]  a disgruntled angry person who was shaken down
[4:36:23.280 --> 4:36:26.720]  by the oppressive tax authorities our own treasury secretary doesn't even pay
[4:36:26.720 --> 4:36:29.280]  taxes but uh he makes everybody else pay them and they
[4:36:29.280 --> 4:36:32.880]  keep raising them as as we go into depression and people go bankrupt so it
[4:36:32.880 --> 4:36:36.640]  may be a real attack by someone that was angry at
[4:36:36.640 --> 4:36:38.720]  the government certainly that does happen sometimes
[4:36:38.720 --> 4:36:42.400]  or this may be a false flag staged event and we know
[4:36:42.400 --> 4:36:47.200]  the christmas event has now been confirmed that the cia ordered the
[4:36:47.200 --> 4:36:50.080]  state department to let the underwear bomber on the plane
[4:36:50.080 --> 4:36:54.240]  and protected him got him through security now that has now been confirmed
[4:36:54.240 --> 4:36:58.160]  after a month and a half of the fbi denying it and so
[4:36:58.160 --> 4:37:02.400]  we had vice president biden saying two days ago he's worried about
[4:37:02.400 --> 4:37:06.080]  loan nut terrorist uh these guys love to
[4:37:06.080 --> 4:37:09.760]  telegraph what they're going to do before they do it this may be another
[4:37:09.760 --> 4:37:14.880]  rice stagion false flag uh event because the entire system the controlled
[4:37:14.880 --> 4:37:19.280]  right wing the control left wing are panicking because populist
[4:37:19.280 --> 4:37:22.880]  are taking over the state state governments are passing resolutions
[4:37:22.880 --> 4:37:26.480]  saying no to the federal government that's been hijacked by foreign banks
[4:37:26.480 --> 4:37:30.240]  saying no to the oligarchs a last seven for a second here
[4:37:30.240 --> 4:37:34.880]  i i um i want to hear about what people are saying in austin i mean that's
[4:37:34.880 --> 4:37:38.880]  where you are is this frustration and anger with the irs
[4:37:38.880 --> 4:37:42.880]  more widespread than what we're actually hearing about
[4:37:42.880 --> 4:37:46.800]  it's absolutely widespread people are angry they are upset
[4:37:46.800 --> 4:37:50.800]  our property values on average have gone down by more than 30 in the u.s
[4:37:50.800 --> 4:37:55.680]  20 in austin but our property taxes go up there's more police more tickets more
[4:37:55.680 --> 4:38:00.160]  fines more bills more business taxes the people are being pushed
[4:38:00.160 --> 4:38:05.600]  into bankruptcy uh we've had uh nationwide sales tax receipts in the
[4:38:05.600 --> 4:38:09.520]  last year down by over 14 percent that's a us record
[4:38:09.520 --> 4:38:13.840]  and the banks continue to rob and to steal
[4:38:13.840 --> 4:38:17.200]  from the people and so yes there is massive anger
[4:38:17.200 --> 4:38:21.120]  at the irs the private collection agency for the private fellow reserve
[4:38:21.120 --> 4:38:24.480]  uh we didn't have the income tax until 1913 when the private fellow reserve
[4:38:24.480 --> 4:38:27.440]  took over most americans were exempt from income tax
[4:38:27.440 --> 4:38:32.720]  until 1951 and so yes there is major anger but it's being
[4:38:32.720 --> 4:38:36.000]  focused into peaceful takeover of the states
[4:38:36.000 --> 4:38:39.840]  via the legislatures and the last time the people were peacefully taking the
[4:38:39.840 --> 4:38:42.480]  states back which control the federal government
[4:38:42.480 --> 4:38:46.800]  the government states the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 to demonize
[4:38:46.800 --> 4:38:50.480]  the tea party movement uh under another name at that time
[4:38:50.480 --> 4:38:54.000]  and so yes there's major anger but people are constructively
[4:38:54.000 --> 4:38:57.920]  taking their cities their counties and their states back right now and that's
[4:38:57.920 --> 4:39:01.680]  why for the last two months i've been predicting a stage terror attack in
[4:39:01.680 --> 4:39:05.200]  austin because we had the intel the government was getting ready to do it
[4:39:05.200 --> 4:39:09.760]  all right alex jones radio host joining us from austin texas with that plane
[4:39:09.760 --> 4:39:14.960]  that crashed into the building that houses the irs thanks so much alex
[4:39:14.960 --> 4:39:24.400]  okay we're live at 612 central standard time 612 p.m and 27 seconds
[4:39:24.400 --> 4:39:28.960]  that was from uh 315 or so central today when i was in russia today
[4:39:28.960 --> 4:39:34.800]  now let's be clear here i heard micro vero just scanning through the dial on
[4:39:34.800 --> 4:39:40.240]  local austin radio jenesis talk show host he formally worked with big media
[4:39:40.240 --> 4:39:44.320]  news he started what really happened in like 95 exposed the government
[4:39:44.320 --> 4:39:48.560]  prevents foster and things lost its context but he said what i already knew
[4:39:48.560 --> 4:39:52.720]  and what has been in many journalistic publications
[4:39:52.720 --> 4:39:57.200]  there were over a thousand bombings and terror attacks in the 60s and 70s that
[4:39:57.200 --> 4:40:02.000]  were real some were staged by government most were real
[4:40:02.000 --> 4:40:06.720]  communist groups black panthers others and when you have a real terror attack
[4:40:06.720 --> 4:40:09.120]  the news has an agreement with the government
[4:40:09.120 --> 4:40:13.200]  and mike was talking about this to not cover it there have been massive attacks
[4:40:13.200 --> 4:40:17.040]  against irs buildings over the years but when you have a real attack they don't
[4:40:17.040 --> 4:40:21.360]  give attention to the terrorist when you have a staged attack
[4:40:21.360 --> 4:40:25.680]  you see a massive media blitzkrieg all over the world all over the u.s all over
[4:40:25.680 --> 4:40:32.000]  europe all you're seeing is this all your hearing is this now it's not

[4:43:07.840 --> 4:43:12.160]  they the the sharp the sharp dress guy i guess we'll call him that he said uh
[4:43:12.160 --> 4:43:16.000]  he said um it's morally and ethically um more
[4:43:16.000 --> 4:43:19.120]  morally and ethically objecting to talking to you right now and i was like
[4:43:19.120 --> 4:43:21.840]  what does that mean he goes well i'm gonna ask the questions because i'm not
[4:43:21.840 --> 4:43:25.360]  gonna answer any and i said well i can't answer questions and he said well if
[4:43:25.360 --> 4:43:27.360]  you would have got here earlier i would have
[4:43:27.360 --> 4:43:31.360]  answered some questions so i took that to mean somebody told him not to talk
[4:43:31.360 --> 4:43:35.840]  about uh mr stack and um
[4:43:35.840 --> 4:43:40.080]  and then before that we'd gone to the um to the building
[4:43:40.080 --> 4:43:42.800]  that he hit and why don't you talk about that jason because you actually saw
[4:43:42.800 --> 4:43:46.720]  that area a little bit before i did yeah well actually when we got there
[4:43:46.720 --> 4:43:49.920]  you know the police weren't being cooperative at all i just walked across
[4:43:49.920 --> 4:43:54.000]  we we were told by two you know regular police officers that as long as we
[4:43:54.000 --> 4:43:57.840]  we could approach the the caution tape as long as we didn't go on the other side
[4:43:57.840 --> 4:44:02.160]  we were cool and immediately you know i get swamped by
[4:44:02.160 --> 4:44:05.600]  the state police who's standing there telling me oh i can't be anywhere around
[4:44:05.600 --> 4:44:08.560]  here you know i let them know i'm with the media
[4:44:08.560 --> 4:44:12.480]  they don't tell me where the where the press tent is or or anything right at
[4:44:12.480 --> 4:44:14.960]  that moment there was a press conference going on
[4:44:14.960 --> 4:44:19.360]  so i take off walk down some stairs try to get into the back of the building
[4:44:19.360 --> 4:44:25.200]  and that's when uh lefting well comes out uh asavado and the that's the police
[4:44:25.200 --> 4:44:29.920]  chief and mayor right and then um also the the fire chief
[4:44:29.920 --> 4:44:35.120]  basically a adl employees yeah we actually split up from where we were he
[4:44:35.120 --> 4:44:37.840]  was gonna go around one direction i was gonna go around the other to see who
[4:44:37.840 --> 4:44:41.600]  could get the best view and i got blocked off at one point where they
[4:44:41.600 --> 4:44:44.960]  weren't let anybody walking so i turned around and went back and then i just i
[4:44:44.960 --> 4:44:47.920]  caught up with jason all right but let's go back first
[4:44:47.920 --> 4:44:52.000]  what did his house look like who was there what was going on
[4:44:52.000 --> 4:44:56.000]  it was uh i would say it it was an upper middle class but it was definitely a
[4:44:56.000 --> 4:44:59.360]  middle middle class type neighborhood neighborhood you know everybody's got
[4:44:59.360 --> 4:45:03.600]  nice lawns nice two-story houses mostly brick was his house burned down his
[4:45:03.600 --> 4:45:06.800]  house was completely burned down the only thing that's left is really the brick
[4:45:06.800 --> 4:45:10.160]  and from what i know this you know i know this guy he was smart he was a very
[4:45:10.160 --> 4:45:13.760]  smart guy he didn't i didn't really know him to be very political let's be
[4:45:13.760 --> 4:45:18.240]  clear you knew him break it all down yeah well uh the last house i lived in i had
[4:45:18.240 --> 4:45:20.480]  a neighbor who was a musician and we played a lot
[4:45:20.480 --> 4:45:24.320]  and and i would sub in for his band for when his bass player couldn't make it
[4:45:24.320 --> 4:45:27.280]  and joe stack was the keyboard player and i knew
[4:45:27.280 --> 4:45:30.400]  joe fairly well i knew he was a pilot and i didn't really put any of this
[4:45:30.400 --> 4:45:33.200]  together till i saw the picture that's what but remember we're driving around
[4:45:33.200 --> 4:45:37.280]  i'm like i know a joe stack it i want this can't be the same guy this is weird
[4:45:37.280 --> 4:45:39.600]  you know i but i know a joe stack that i know him
[4:45:39.600 --> 4:45:42.640]  in pennsylvania that i you know i just knew i played music with a guy named joe
[4:45:42.640 --> 4:45:45.840]  stack at some point in my life and then when i look at the pictures you know
[4:45:45.840 --> 4:45:49.280]  he's a short guy with glasses and gray hair and that's that's him
[4:45:49.280 --> 4:45:54.720]  and i'm i'm kind of amazed because um and i just talked i talked to uh my buddy
[4:45:54.720 --> 4:45:58.320]  who ran the band i'd called him up i said did you hear about joe and he's in
[4:45:58.320 --> 4:46:01.840]  houston he said yeah it's crazy he goes out of all the people in my band
[4:46:01.840 --> 4:46:05.520]  he always had his stuff together i never knew him to be
[4:46:05.520 --> 4:46:09.040]  you know he would be the last guy i would think to to take a plane and he'd
[4:46:09.040 --> 4:46:12.480]  flown in this plane with him he said he used to flash down to san antonio
[4:46:12.480 --> 4:46:16.320]  and um they would he was a software engineer recorded music
[4:46:16.320 --> 4:46:20.160]  and uh so basically his house was although you could see in the garage
[4:46:20.160 --> 4:46:23.280]  that wasn't totally destroyed but the upper floor was totally destroyed
[4:46:23.280 --> 4:46:27.680]  there was maybe a few parts of walls left up there
[4:46:27.680 --> 4:46:32.960]  and um from what we were gathering um there was a guy who's uh the neighbor
[4:46:32.960 --> 4:46:38.160]  elbert who said he called the cops or he called 911 at at about nine between
[4:46:38.160 --> 4:46:41.760]  915 and 930 he wasn't exactly sure but he said they arrived within five minutes
[4:46:41.760 --> 4:46:46.560]  the fire department i talked to a lady who didn't want to be on camera
[4:46:46.560 --> 4:46:50.800]  she was in there was another the two neighbors had directly next door
[4:46:50.800 --> 4:46:53.520]  they weren't answering the doors but the ones on the other sides
[4:46:53.520 --> 4:46:56.240]  the one guy's name was elbert and then there was this other lady who actually
[4:46:56.240 --> 4:46:59.760]  left for work at 845 in the morning and didn't see a fire
[4:46:59.760 --> 4:47:03.200]  but and then she was told well apparently it was going on when she left for
[4:47:03.200 --> 4:47:07.680]  work she just didn't notice this is today this is today the small how does he
[4:47:07.680 --> 4:47:12.160]  where is this in austin this is north in uh off of uh
[4:47:12.160 --> 4:47:15.920]  parmer lane which is north of where he hit and apparently he flew out of
[4:47:15.920 --> 4:47:19.200]  georgetown airport so it isn't on fire at eight
[4:47:19.200 --> 4:47:23.120]  eight when 845 845 he drives to georgetown during
[4:47:23.120 --> 4:47:26.320]  traffic that's gotta take an hour oh yeah yeah and then
[4:47:26.320 --> 4:47:29.760]  he hits it so 845 945 he gets in the plane
[4:47:29.760 --> 4:47:34.080]  i guess he could in 10 minutes fly down south at 955 and hit it
[4:47:34.080 --> 4:47:39.520]  yeah yeah and um the if he said it right at 945
[4:47:39.520 --> 4:47:43.520]  sure and well the neighbor when he went outside he saw flames pouring out of
[4:47:43.520 --> 4:47:46.880]  the place because they heard this as the sound that they were alerted to they
[4:47:46.880 --> 4:47:49.440]  heard this weird sound he walked outside he saw flames coming out of the
[4:47:49.440 --> 4:47:53.120]  windows called the fire department he didn't want to give the iris the house
[4:47:53.120 --> 4:47:57.440]  probably it yeah if he's just a crazy and not an
[4:47:57.440 --> 4:48:01.280]  listen operation north woods everyone should read it abc news
[4:48:01.280 --> 4:48:09.280]  uh library of congress um baltimore sun associated press

[4:51:18.480 --> 4:51:23.040]  i guess that'd be 524 mountain 424 pacific
[4:51:23.040 --> 4:51:26.160]  i want you guys any other comments you've got about today any other points
[4:51:26.160 --> 4:51:29.600]  you've got one more about the the i don't know if it was the fire chief or
[4:51:29.600 --> 4:51:33.360]  the spokesperson for the fire department was talking about how they were afraid
[4:51:33.360 --> 4:51:36.080]  the building was going to collapse they she mentioned that several somebody
[4:51:36.080 --> 4:51:39.600]  asked that question they said yes we were afraid of that because we've seen
[4:51:39.600 --> 4:51:43.360]  this happen in the past exactly until 9 11 they don't collapse
[4:51:43.360 --> 4:51:46.880]  now there's a little fire they go it will collapse where and she was talking
[4:51:46.880 --> 4:51:50.320]  about it as though it was plural this has happened many times before
[4:51:50.320 --> 4:51:53.280]  yes only on 9 11 but now all the science has changed
[4:51:53.280 --> 4:51:56.320]  they've changed insurance of buildings now they believe a big lighter burns
[4:51:56.320 --> 4:52:00.000]  down still buildings i mean we were we were joking that
[4:52:00.000 --> 4:52:04.640]  you know steel is softer than wood yeah but
[4:52:04.640 --> 4:52:08.960]  but i'm a maker point go ahead so you know so listening to her say that you
[4:52:08.960 --> 4:52:12.320]  know they they pulled ever and i guess they have some new procedure built in
[4:52:12.320 --> 4:52:16.560]  for that contingency because they pulled everybody back and they do a defensive
[4:52:16.560 --> 4:52:21.280]  uh fire when and especially if there's they didn't think people were inside and
[4:52:21.280 --> 4:52:24.960]  from the last report that i heard there's only one person that was unaccounted
[4:52:24.960 --> 4:52:28.400]  for and they weren't sure if that person even went into work that day
[4:52:28.400 --> 4:52:33.200]  guys i want you to put the article up on screen source fbi new austin attack was

[4:52:48.320 --> 4:52:53.040]  realize the magnitude of this piece of information we've got to get this out
[4:52:53.040 --> 4:52:57.600]  day one we've got to start investigation now we've got to have more witnesses
[4:52:57.600 --> 4:53:01.520]  we've got to follow this because they're in the news
[4:53:01.520 --> 4:53:04.960]  saying we're going to start shutting down the small airports you can't let people
[4:53:04.960 --> 4:53:08.400]  not go through body scanners to get their own planes you can't have slaves doing
[4:53:08.400 --> 4:53:12.560]  that after all major cities are saying band gardens people might grow pot
[4:53:12.560 --> 4:53:16.480]  you have slaves having their own gardens corporate media blames kamikaze
[4:53:16.480 --> 4:53:19.360]  attack on tea parties it's all over the news
[4:53:19.360 --> 4:53:25.120]  i said hour one that if it's big and promoted and if they're already ready
[4:53:25.120 --> 4:53:28.960]  and organize and say it's the tea parties get ready it's a staged event
[4:53:28.960 --> 4:53:31.920]  it was i got some email saw some websites oh look at
[4:53:31.920 --> 4:53:36.160]  jones saying it's austin it's a staged event ridiculous it's a heart attack
[4:53:36.160 --> 4:53:39.680]  and then well he's right about that but still screw him you know the governor
[4:53:39.680 --> 4:53:43.840]  written after him nobody knows who he is uh you know
[4:53:43.840 --> 4:53:48.240]  this is really going on i mean this is real folks this affects everybody
[4:53:48.240 --> 4:53:51.680]  they love to stage events against themselves not just to scare the public
[4:53:51.680 --> 4:53:55.760]  into submission but to create the culture of paranoia and the feds
[4:53:55.760 --> 4:53:59.360]  of the public's your enemy and you've got a i mean this is a scion
[4:53:59.360 --> 4:54:03.920]  and i'm pretty sure this is staged in my gut which is never wrong unfortunately
[4:54:03.920 --> 4:54:06.880]  but we've got to continue to follow the intellectual evidence and the scientific
[4:54:06.880 --> 4:54:11.360]  evidence and the journalistic evidence and i just go with the facts and he
[4:54:11.360 --> 4:54:14.640]  could be alone not but everything points towards it being staged
[4:54:14.640 --> 4:54:18.160]  and you see texas about to leave the country towards states rights
[4:54:18.160 --> 4:54:23.120]  you see the stage attacks on medina um jason douglas your comments on this i
[4:54:23.120 --> 4:54:26.160]  mean i want your real opinion give me your real opinion
[4:54:26.160 --> 4:54:30.720]  working here a year seeing all this seeing me say they're gonna attack austin
[4:54:30.720 --> 4:54:34.080]  you watch the next attack austin could be an attack on a building could be a
[4:54:34.080 --> 4:54:37.520]  plane it's confirmed federal informants are trying to provoke other people into
[4:54:37.520 --> 4:54:40.240]  bombing brave new books i mean this is real
[4:54:40.240 --> 4:54:44.080]  i mean all you can do really is there's so many different perspectives you have
[4:54:44.080 --> 4:54:47.200]  to have to look at the world in when you're looking through the info or
[4:54:47.200 --> 4:54:50.800]  info wars perspective but um the the thing that really
[4:54:50.800 --> 4:54:54.400]  struck me was and i was in the gaggle of journalists
[4:54:54.400 --> 4:54:58.080]  at the site and they just kept going i can't believe how fast this information
[4:54:58.080 --> 4:55:02.240]  is going is coming out i mean they they were perplexed as to you know
[4:55:02.240 --> 4:55:06.000]  how they came up with this information so fast and the last time i remember that
[4:55:06.000 --> 4:55:10.160]  happening was 9 11 which is how do they wait a minute you were with journalists
[4:55:10.160 --> 4:55:14.160]  and they in austin were like how do they already know all this yeah
[4:55:14.160 --> 4:55:17.600]  and that they're divulging it already and then how careful actually because
[4:55:17.600 --> 4:55:21.360]  normally they'll make you wait six weeks to find out if it's not it when it's
[4:55:21.360 --> 4:55:25.440]  not staged like like the shooting at the capital the guy shooting the gun
[4:55:25.440 --> 4:55:30.080]  that didn't get any traction that i mean i mean real stuff gets ignored
[4:55:30.080 --> 4:55:33.040]  yeah that barely made the continue that's key what you just said yeah so they
[4:55:33.040 --> 4:55:36.480]  were flabbergasted as to how now break it down where you were
[4:55:36.480 --> 4:55:39.280]  the groups of media i know you won't know their names we have video of all
[4:55:39.280 --> 4:55:42.960]  this but what they were saying yeah it was all the major groups um fox was
[4:55:42.960 --> 4:55:48.320]  there cnn was there um they were local people that were you know hired out but
[4:55:48.320 --> 4:55:51.440]  that's what they were making comments on how fast the the information was being
[4:55:51.440 --> 4:55:54.800]  disseminated and then i noticed that the the press
[4:55:54.800 --> 4:55:59.200]  crew that came up asavado and laughing well they made it really clear that this
[4:55:59.200 --> 4:56:02.560]  was not a terrorist act but then to know that all the
[4:56:02.560 --> 4:56:05.360]  headlines are you know making these tea party connections
[4:56:05.360 --> 4:56:09.040]  so it's almost as if you know the well they do that to gain credibility like
[4:56:09.040 --> 4:56:13.360]  oh we're we're waiting right but then okay but then an hour later oh it is that
[4:56:13.360 --> 4:56:17.840]  it is a attack and i'll take your guns don't worry so it just seems like it's
[4:56:17.840 --> 4:56:21.760]  going through all the propaganda channels but the media was saying how do
[4:56:21.760 --> 4:56:25.360]  they know this so early yep well the people there not and they're not
[4:56:25.360 --> 4:56:28.800]  reporting it you know they're just no but describe it you see reporters behind
[4:56:28.800 --> 4:56:32.080]  camera people talking pads of paper oh yeah you know we're all pressed in
[4:56:32.080 --> 4:56:34.720]  because that's how it is at at those moments you know you're trying to
[4:56:34.720 --> 4:56:38.240]  interview one person and there's 60 media people on the side and so you're
[4:56:38.240 --> 4:56:40.240]  all pressed in together and i just hear all these comments
[4:56:40.240 --> 4:56:42.800]  where are they getting this information so fast how can this is happening so
[4:56:42.800 --> 4:56:45.760]  fast and it did it just seemed like they were pouring
[4:56:45.760 --> 4:56:50.160]  out all of this information but you know usually you're a lot more reticent to
[4:56:50.160 --> 4:56:53.120]  say anything especially when you're an official
[4:56:53.120 --> 4:56:56.960]  role but then he kept asavado kept making comments like you know
[4:56:56.960 --> 4:57:00.800]  irresponsible reporters who were saying that it wasn't his plane or it was his
[4:57:00.800 --> 4:57:04.800]  but you know no one can make conjecture but well he does that to be the
[4:57:04.800 --> 4:57:07.440]  authority that that asavado he's something else
[4:57:07.440 --> 4:57:11.600]  yeah they're just planting little seeds so how many reporters roughly and they
[4:57:11.600 --> 4:57:14.720]  were saying how do they know so quick what me so they were suspicious yeah
[4:57:14.720 --> 4:57:19.040]  there was probably 25 there was more when i was there
[4:57:19.040 --> 4:57:22.640]  because that's when the press group first came out so you know i'm gonna do
[4:57:22.640 --> 4:57:25.920]  something instead of being interrupting i want free flow i did this with ike
[4:57:25.920 --> 4:57:29.360]  today i'm gonna walk out for five minutes i'm gonna come back to you
[4:57:29.360 --> 4:57:33.360]  i want you guys to just talk about whatever you want right now
[4:57:33.360 --> 4:57:36.800]  go ahead um well one one quick thing i i just want
[4:57:36.800 --> 4:57:40.400]  i hope the people out there just uh say a prayer for joe's wife and
[4:57:40.400 --> 4:57:44.000]  and daughter because it sounds like they
[4:57:44.000 --> 4:57:50.000]  were in the house when it was uh put on fire and they got out and were taken
[4:57:50.000 --> 4:57:54.960]  away so i feel um i feel really bad for them
[4:57:54.960 --> 4:57:59.120]  and um you know and then knowing joe i'm
[4:57:59.120 --> 4:58:02.480]  i'm really finding it hard to believe that joe did this and
[4:58:02.480 --> 4:58:06.400]  and that could be just me you know from knowing the guy and um
[4:58:06.400 --> 4:58:09.680]  other than that taking the personal element out of it
[4:58:09.680 --> 4:58:14.560]  um you know the neighbors i thought it was interesting that the neighbors
[4:58:14.560 --> 4:58:17.200]  didn't really know the guy at all i thought it was interesting that they
[4:58:17.200 --> 4:58:20.720]  wouldn't even come to the door yeah yeah something like that happened i'd
[4:58:20.720 --> 4:58:24.800]  want to be sharing it with right he was a great guy or he was a mean guy or
[4:58:24.800 --> 4:58:26.720]  whatever you know you think you'd want to be
[4:58:26.720 --> 4:58:30.000]  um you know telling telling people and it was really hard to get neighbors to
[4:58:30.000 --> 4:58:33.280]  talk only one guy would talk with us on camera
[4:58:33.280 --> 4:58:39.920]  and he was the guy that called um 911 so at least he thinks he was the first
[4:58:39.920 --> 4:58:41.840]  guy from from his opinion so that would be
[4:58:41.840 --> 4:58:45.440]  interesting to find out if if he was the first guy
[4:58:45.440 --> 4:58:48.720]  that actually called 911 or if it was somebody else
[4:58:48.720 --> 4:58:51.360]  because he thought it was that they got there really quickly because he was
[4:58:51.360 --> 4:58:54.960]  praising them for how fast they arrived on scene for
[4:58:54.960 --> 4:58:58.640]  for the fire the house fire eddie and that's all you keep on hearing on how
[4:58:58.640 --> 4:59:01.920]  how fast the response time was and i mean five minutes
[4:59:01.920 --> 4:59:05.440]  during a fire can seem like a lot but yeah that's that's pretty quick
[4:59:05.440 --> 4:59:08.880]  that depending on where they'll come in where the department is
[4:59:08.880 --> 4:59:16.240]  but it was it was very uh very weird typing up joe's name
[4:59:16.240 --> 4:59:19.440]  and in the search engine and just seeing that picture because that
[4:59:19.440 --> 4:59:23.280]  you know being that was haunting you all day and you get you kept making the
[4:59:23.280 --> 4:59:26.720]  music association saying yeah jazz musician i mean i know
[4:59:26.720 --> 4:59:31.040]  yeah and it's you know and i hadn't seen him in a couple years but he
[4:59:31.040 --> 4:59:35.200]  you know when i knew him and and i talked to a guy uh after i found that out i
[4:59:35.200 --> 4:59:37.680]  called a guy that i knew knew him very well
[4:59:37.680 --> 4:59:41.920]  and he'd saw he'd seen him um about two weeks ago they
[4:59:41.920 --> 4:59:44.880]  they were uh exchanging microphones because they were each doing different
[4:59:44.880 --> 4:59:49.040]  types of recording so um that he said you know
[4:59:49.040 --> 4:59:53.760]  out of everybody that he knew it joe always seemed to have his stuff together
[4:59:53.760 --> 4:59:57.920]  um compared to you know other musicians and when you're an austin musicians
[4:59:57.920 --> 5:00:01.760]  usually don't have their stuff together they're uh you know a rag tag bunch but
[5:00:01.760 --> 5:00:06.400]  joe always was clean cut dressed neat and you know maybe that's
[5:00:06.400 --> 5:00:11.600]  you know if if he was some sort of double agent or some sort of agent then
[5:00:11.600 --> 5:00:17.600]  you know i never saw it um so it's gonna be very interesting to see what they
[5:00:17.600 --> 5:00:21.120]  come out and say about you know when it's somebody you
[5:00:21.120 --> 5:00:24.240]  don't know you have a totally different perspective of it because my
[5:00:24.240 --> 5:00:27.760]  perspective has changed since you know knowing that i knew that right just
[5:00:27.760 --> 5:00:32.160]  interrupt i want you guys to go another five minutes or so but go back
[5:00:32.160 --> 5:00:35.840]  to those reporters first because that's key that reporters
[5:00:35.840 --> 5:00:39.360]  think back to exactly what they were saying jason and rob
[5:00:39.360 --> 5:00:42.240]  because that's key that they were saying this is weird because the the public
[5:00:42.240 --> 5:00:45.040]  doesn't know how reporting works that an hour and a half after it happens
[5:00:45.040 --> 5:00:48.160]  how do they already know all this right and these guys were you know they knew
[5:00:48.160 --> 5:00:51.120]  exactly and then go back to the house and the neighbors i mean let's really
[5:00:51.120 --> 5:00:53.920]  debrief really think of things you didn't think of
[5:00:53.920 --> 5:00:56.640]  why don't you go first go back to your memory think of what you didn't talk
[5:00:56.640 --> 5:01:00.960]  about all right you were at the uh you hit that press conference area
[5:01:00.960 --> 5:01:04.240]  first so what were they talking about in the press conference when you got there
[5:01:04.240 --> 5:01:08.720]  so when i first walked up you know there was there was a gaggle of uh journalists
[5:01:08.720 --> 5:01:12.400]  and and their camera people and they were shooting the building so i walk
[5:01:12.400 --> 5:01:15.680]  around the side and try to find a good shot as soon as i got there
[5:01:15.680 --> 5:01:20.000]  i noticed that you know there was a large group of official people walking up
[5:01:20.000 --> 5:01:23.760]  it was asavado laughing well this fire chief
[5:01:23.760 --> 5:01:27.840]  and so i squeezed into the gaggle trying to get in
[5:01:27.840 --> 5:01:31.360]  to get their comments and as they were you know
[5:01:31.360 --> 5:01:36.000]  giving us all the the points that that they had previously agreed to
[5:01:36.000 --> 5:01:40.000]  to let go you know you just kept hearing these whispers like boy this is
[5:01:40.000 --> 5:01:43.440]  really quick i can't believe this stuff is coming out so quickly and
[5:01:43.440 --> 5:01:48.400]  and they just seemed really surprised at how this was unfolding
[5:01:48.400 --> 5:01:55.920]  yeah and when i got there um i was trying to go around a different way and
[5:01:55.920 --> 5:01:59.440]  i got stopped so i came back around and i got a tail end of
[5:01:59.440 --> 5:02:03.120]  of uh they're doing an interview with the fire chief
[5:02:03.120 --> 5:02:06.720]  and she was uh you know talking about how they had the fire pretty much under
[5:02:06.720 --> 5:02:11.360]  control they were gonna start going in and looking around
[5:02:11.360 --> 5:02:15.280]  um but at the time somebody said were you afraid the the building was going to
[5:02:15.280 --> 5:02:17.920]  collapse and she said oh yes we were definitely afraid we've seen this
[5:02:17.920 --> 5:02:21.200]  happen before right and she made it sound very plural
[5:02:21.200 --> 5:02:25.280]  yeah but it this was you know a very common thing right right and then she
[5:02:25.280 --> 5:02:28.720]  even made it sound like it was now like nowadays steel does melt a lot easier
[5:02:28.720 --> 5:02:32.320]  than it used to yeah now we're making steel out of
[5:02:32.320 --> 5:02:38.000]  flour or something i don't know but chinese steel but but but that whole
[5:02:38.000 --> 5:02:41.760]  situation was interesting i i taped a little bit of a
[5:02:41.760 --> 5:02:45.920]  of a guy who worked in the building they were on one of the top floors and they
[5:02:45.920 --> 5:02:49.200]  you know when they said when it happens you know they had done drills before
[5:02:49.200 --> 5:02:52.400]  you know they did once a month they do a drill for evacuation
[5:02:52.400 --> 5:02:56.080]  and you know he ran around they were telling people to get out of the
[5:02:56.080 --> 5:03:00.400]  building get out of the building get out of the building and um
[5:03:00.400 --> 5:03:04.560]  you know they cleared out their floors um i'm trying to think if i remember
[5:03:04.560 --> 5:03:09.360]  anything else from that area uh i do remember seeing that car there was a
[5:03:09.360 --> 5:03:13.760]  car at least 60 yards 50 or 60 yards from
[5:03:13.760 --> 5:03:17.840]  the crash site smashed and it had smashed in windows
[5:03:17.840 --> 5:03:21.680]  it looked like a little scorched too yeah so something
[5:03:21.680 --> 5:03:24.960]  i don't know there's no parking right there i mean that's a frontage it was a
[5:03:24.960 --> 5:03:27.360]  road so obviously somebody was driving up
[5:03:27.360 --> 5:03:32.160]  they might have uh they might have been hit or something closer on closer and
[5:03:32.160 --> 5:03:34.720]  then drove forward a little bit to get out of the way then got out of their car
[5:03:34.720 --> 5:03:37.120]  and ran right but i i don't know i mean there was a
[5:03:37.120 --> 5:03:40.240]  couple cops around the car but that car was behind the police line and you know
[5:03:40.240 --> 5:03:44.400]  it wasn't it wasn't leaving um they the parking lots of those businesses they
[5:03:44.400 --> 5:03:47.840]  had shut off to people uh when we got there we were on the
[5:03:47.840 --> 5:03:50.720]  backside of the building on the south side that's where most of the people had
[5:03:50.720 --> 5:03:54.000]  gathered and they were just kind of waiting to see what was happening and
[5:03:54.000 --> 5:03:59.120]  at one point an fbi agent and a police officer came up and they were
[5:03:59.120 --> 5:04:03.040]  taking people in groups of five to their cars and inside the building if they
[5:04:03.040 --> 5:04:06.320]  had to go get their stuff but they weren't letting them take their cars
[5:04:06.320 --> 5:04:10.160]  they were still keeping that closed off you know i don't know if they were if
[5:04:10.160 --> 5:04:13.600]  they were checking them out or or how that was working
[5:04:13.600 --> 5:04:20.800]  um so then we got uh the text from craig giving us joe's address and i'd
[5:04:20.800 --> 5:04:23.280]  never you know i'd never been to his house i'd always
[5:04:23.280 --> 5:04:27.680]  seen him either at practice or at the gig and so i didn't i had no idea
[5:04:27.680 --> 5:04:30.080]  you know where he lived but we get there and it's a you know middle middle
[5:04:30.080 --> 5:04:34.000]  class neighborhood you know no uh seems like they probably have
[5:04:34.000 --> 5:04:38.000]  the hoa in effect because nobody had any political signs or anything anywhere
[5:04:38.000 --> 5:04:43.280]  um out out like that very manicured i did notice joe had a it looked like he had
[5:04:43.280 --> 5:04:46.720]  a ton of papers and stuff in his garage you know like he didn't use the garage
[5:04:46.720 --> 5:04:50.400]  for the car use the garage as a as a storage area and that looked like you
[5:04:50.400 --> 5:04:54.240]  know because i'm i'm sort of a pack rat myself so i always notice those things
[5:04:54.240 --> 5:04:57.840]  well the media is already saying he's basically a team part of your as we
[5:04:57.840 --> 5:05:00.800]  knew they would do before the media even said this was happening
[5:05:00.800 --> 5:05:04.000]  which is the evidence of it being staged in my hunch being correct
[5:05:04.000 --> 5:05:08.160]  will continue to cover this at 11 a.m tomorrow continuing tonight at info wars
[5:05:08.160 --> 5:05:12.960]  dot com and prison planet dot com anything else you gentlemen want to add
[5:05:12.960 --> 5:05:16.080]  um i just i thought it was interesting that the neighbors really didn't know
[5:05:16.080 --> 5:05:20.000]  the guy um you know he'd been there for three years is what they said one lady
[5:05:20.000 --> 5:05:22.880]  moved in four years ago as you said he moved in about a year after another
[5:05:22.880 --> 5:05:27.600]  guy had been there 15 years and he moved you know he said yeah you know i'd
[5:05:27.600 --> 5:05:32.080]  seen the daughter and and the wife but i never saw the guy never saw joe
[5:05:32.080 --> 5:05:36.560]  so i don't know if that if that just seems odd joe was always you know
[5:05:36.560 --> 5:05:40.960]  personable he wasn't outgoing but he was never rude to people i never saw him
[5:05:40.960 --> 5:05:43.840]  you know act like that but he was you know kind of an intense introspective
[5:05:43.840 --> 5:05:48.880]  type guy who seemed to be very intelligent very very intelligent like i
[5:05:48.880 --> 5:05:51.760]  was you know always kind of taken aback by his
[5:05:51.760 --> 5:05:55.360]  being able to throw out uh you know different key changes from songs that
[5:05:55.360 --> 5:05:58.560]  he'd been you know played 20 years ago he's like oh yeah that goes to this this
