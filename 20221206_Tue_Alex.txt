[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  information wars tomorrow's news today and at the moment in most parts of the
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.200]  world due to lockdown most of the transmission that's actually happening
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.600]  in many countries now is happening in the household at family level in some
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.000]  senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.440]  units now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may
[00:41.440 --> 00:48.400]  be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner
[00:48.400 --> 00:58.840]  it's 1159 radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth
[00:58.840 --> 01:02.760]  until dawn right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in
[01:02.760 --> 01:07.760]  the occupied zone the chair is against the wall the chair is against the wall
[01:07.760 --> 01:13.680]  John has a long mustache John has a long mustache it's 12 o'clock American
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.520]  another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on or behind the
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.320]  lines this is your song
[01:24.560 --> 01:28.320]  but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna make
[01:28.320 --> 01:31.680]  trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted to just took them
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.960]  away where we education camps that's what they call it so part of the gap to
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.040]  break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[01:41.040 --> 01:48.040]  belong to their families and recognize the kids belong to whole communities. I have decided we really need camps for adults
[01:48.040 --> 01:56.640]  and we need to have camps that you all run I mean really. All persons of Japanese
[01:56.640 --> 02:00.480]  descent were required to register now they were taken to racetracks and
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.740]  fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers. I'm a
[02:04.740 --> 02:11.240]  song citizen I refuse to recognize you guys. What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[02:11.240 --> 02:19.000]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons. Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.200]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques. These people are
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.480]  radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.040]  the United States. It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.880]  normal community.
[02:41.880 --> 02:49.880]  There's hope in doing here unless not a kid about it we're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[02:49.880 --> 02:57.400]  Put your gun down really. Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human
[02:57.400 --> 03:04.400]  liberty. It's Alex Jones. Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[03:04.400 --> 03:13.400]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[03:13.400 --> 03:30.400]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[03:30.400 --> 03:38.400]  What a four months old baby is caught in the middle of a row between his parents and House New Zealand. He needs life-saving surgery but his
[03:38.400 --> 03:45.400]  parents don't want him to receive blood from those who have been vaccinated and now House New Zealand wants guardianship.
[03:45.400 --> 03:55.400]  We need to have safe blood. That is our right. But his parents don't want the blood of those who received a Covid vaccine to be used in his surgery.
[03:55.400 --> 04:03.400]  And while both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can donate to our blood bank, that blood isn't held separately.
[04:03.400 --> 04:13.400]  Wolverines!
[04:13.400 --> 04:22.400]  Excuse me. There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example. December 6th.
[04:22.400 --> 04:33.400]  Alex Jones. The far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.400]  Scott! Russian! Scott!
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.400]  Until war has come to mind.
[04:48.400 --> 04:56.400]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed I hope.

[06:26.400 --> 06:46.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, December 6th, 2022.
[06:46.400 --> 06:48.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:48.400 --> 06:56.400]  We're going to open the phones up today to get your take on the incredible aftermath of the Yay interview last week and the attacks on the first member that came out of that.
[06:56.400 --> 07:01.400]  What you think is really behind it because I still haven't figured it out myself.
[07:01.400 --> 07:10.400]  And I want to look at more cruise missile attacks from Ukraine into Russia. The escalation just off the charts. More happened today.
[07:10.400 --> 07:22.400]  We have got all this mainstream news coming out now and even some mainstream news who I thought had no bottom is saying, man, Canada is really euthanizing people that don't want to be killed.
[07:22.400 --> 07:29.400]  They're like, hey, you got two out of medical bills or you don't have a job. We're going to kill you.
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.400]  Disturbing Canada's euthanasia slippery slope is real and horrifying.
[07:33.400 --> 07:42.400]  So we've got a lot of that to get into. And so you got Yay over here saying he loves Hitler to be the shock jock.
[07:42.400 --> 07:50.400]  But then at the same time, Hitler really did euthanasia and forced it on people, not just assisted but forced and called euthanasia.
[07:50.400 --> 08:00.400]  I mean, Hitler really did these things. These are some of the things I didn't like about Hitler and people that fetishize Hitler thinking, well, the opposite of Hollywood and the opposite of the New World Order is Hitler.
[08:00.400 --> 08:07.400]  No, it's not the opposite. It's another competing evil ideology.
[08:07.400 --> 08:12.400]  And I know a lot of innocent people have been called Nazis and so you start thinking, well, I am one.
[08:12.400 --> 08:18.400]  That's what you say I am. Ladies and gentlemen, don't let the ADL mind control you.
[08:18.400 --> 08:28.400]  Realize the ADL is an evil, anti-American organization that they just simply put on Nazi uniforms are almost indistinguishable.
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.400]  They create racial division. They want power. They want control.
[08:32.400 --> 08:39.400]  They're super bad news, but they do not represent the compendium of people that live here in America.
[08:39.400 --> 08:50.400]  And they are trying to foment attacks on Jews, in my view, with the rhetoric they put out so that they get more powerful and get more control over that extremely important, powerful community.
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.400]  And so that's where I stand on that. And they've singled me out as their number one enemy.
[08:55.400 --> 09:04.400]  Think about that for a good reason. I've got their number and I've got the Nazis number and I've got Jeezy Ping's number and I've got the Democratic Party's number.
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.400]  And they're all a bunch of authoritarian groups manipulating our minds for power.
[09:10.400 --> 09:19.400]  They don't believe anything they say. These are just ideologies that they deploy to manipulate us, period.
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.400]  All right, we've got some really, really, really, really good news here.
[09:25.400 --> 09:34.400]  And I look at Trump vs. DeSantis as a scale. Not their personalities, but the fruits, the tree bears.
[09:34.400 --> 09:38.400]  Trump has done so many amazing things. It would take an hour to list them all.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.400]  And the system hates his guts and he really did get reelected.
[09:42.400 --> 09:47.400]  So even if he wasn't that good, he should be the president because he got reelected.
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.400]  So I really lean towards Trump because of that.
[09:52.400 --> 10:02.400]  But on the poison shots that we know he got manipulated into bringing forward, the head of the CDC and others admit they lied to him and said it was safe and effective and would fix the problems.
[10:02.400 --> 10:08.400]  Once he realized he's been conned, he won't reverse himself because he's so pigheaded.
[10:08.400 --> 10:17.400]  And so I've said DeSantis has progressively gotten more hardcore saying children shouldn't take the shots. The military shouldn't be mandated to take the shots.
[10:17.400 --> 10:26.400]  That's stuff Trump said too. But then he started going after the lies and blocking of alternative treatments and the attempts to forcibly inject people.
[10:26.400 --> 10:36.400]  And now he started coming out and saying we're going to investigate the vaccine makers because these aren't vaccines and these weren't approved right.
[10:36.400 --> 10:43.400]  And they've heard a bunch of people and we've got to punish them so they don't do it again.
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.400]  So DeSantis has pulled way ahead of Trump with this move.
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.400]  So that makes them basically dead even in my mind.
[10:52.400 --> 11:01.400]  Even though DeSantis has all of these different neocon and rhino elites, elites supporting him.
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.400]  But that's mainly because they're scared of Trump, which again makes me like Trump more.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.400]  So I'm not into this for a popularity contest.
[11:10.400 --> 11:18.400]  I'm based on the policies and I'm based on what these people actually do and I'm issue driven. I know most of you are as well.
[11:18.400 --> 11:24.400]  But I want to open the phones up and say, are we missing the boat here?
[11:24.400 --> 11:31.400]  Because we've got somebody with a better voting record and a better history and we know where he came from and we know who he is.
[11:31.400 --> 11:36.400]  When he was out of college, just starting his family practice or I guess right still in college.
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.400]  When his dad was rerunning for Congress in 1995-96.
[11:40.400 --> 11:48.400]  One of my first big interviews and then the guy that got Ron Paul on the show in 96 after he got elected was Rand Paul.
[11:48.400 --> 11:57.400]  I've known Rand for 27 years and he is the real deal.
[11:57.400 --> 12:05.400]  Nobody's perfect but he's gotten a lot better as the years have gone on.
[12:05.400 --> 12:17.400]  And so we are entering the new big presidential drive here and I'm not being contrarian here in this big debate about who do you like more Trump or DeSantis.
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.400]  When I say, I think Rand Paul should be on the ticket.
[12:21.400 --> 12:30.400]  I think a Rand Paul DeSantis ticket would be unbeatable.
[12:30.400 --> 12:36.400]  I don't know if Rand Paul would run as Trump's VP, that would be unbeatable.
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.400]  I don't think Trump obviously would be VP, that's not going to happen.
[12:40.400 --> 12:48.400]  And I don't think DeSantis would probably take second share to Paul.
[12:48.400 --> 12:59.400]  But I really think if you get past personalities and who's got the most gravitas when it comes to charisma, then it's got to be Rand Paul.
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.400]  So let's put a poll on infowars.com today.
[13:05.400 --> 13:14.400]  Who would you support more or who would you vote for in the Republican, in the 2024 Republican primary, something like that.
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.400]  And it needs to be Rand Paul DeSantis Trump.
[13:19.400 --> 13:22.400]  And throw Tulsi Gabbers in there.
[13:22.400 --> 13:25.400]  Tulsi could run as a Republican, the word is she's going to switch over to him.
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.400]  What would that do?
[13:27.400 --> 13:28.400]  What would that do?
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.400]  So let's put those four names up there.
[13:30.400 --> 13:37.400]  And I really think our audience, if they use their brains, would probably go Rand Paul.
[13:37.400 --> 13:44.400]  Because we've known him longer, we know what he stands for, and he's come out and said the shots are dangerous and hurting kids.
[13:44.400 --> 13:50.400]  And he wants an investigation, he wants Fauci arrested, and that Fauci cooked this up, which is true.
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.400]  So that's where I stand right now.
[13:53.400 --> 14:08.400]  Toll free number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 on that subject, on the Yay interview, on whatever you want to discuss, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex.
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.400]  I'll play the DeSantis clips, his latest clips, on the poison shots that are so important and more.
[14:12.400 --> 14:15.400]  Because we bring down this poison shot agenda.
[14:15.400 --> 14:22.400]  We bring down the global ID passports, the medical ID, the social credit score, their whole next phase of their takeover plan.
[14:22.400 --> 14:29.400]  And the next pandemic that Fauci and Biden and all the rest of the globalists have been saying is around the corner.
[14:29.400 --> 14:32.400]  Because next time it's going to be a lot worse.
[14:32.400 --> 14:38.400]  Think Canada, Australia and China, think about what they're like.
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.400]  This is the end of a free society, it's the total new world order plan, it's operation lockstep, this is everything.
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.400]  That's why I keep hammering the shots, hammering the lockdowns, hammering the persecution.
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.400]  If we go to sleep for a while, we'll give them some time of political, cultural amnesty.
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.400]  And then we all just quietly go away. I mean, look at this footage.
[14:56.400 --> 14:59.400]  I'm going to cover this too coming up in the next segment.
[14:59.400 --> 15:02.400]  If you've ever seen a Pied Piper in the real world, that's it.
[15:02.400 --> 15:09.400]  One white clad Judas Goat in the paramilitary medical tyranny outfit,
[15:09.400 --> 15:16.400]  leading thousands and thousands and thousands of Chinese who all got told they were red-coated with no evidence and had to go to the camps.
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.400]  This is the social credit score. This is breaking you down, locking you up, training you to be a slave.
[15:21.400 --> 15:27.400]  Only let you out again later, as long as you follow all the orders they say, they get progressively more tyrannical.
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.400]  Where'd Bob go? I don't know. He went to a cupboard camp and never came back.
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.400]  They're just training you to get used to seeing people grab and rounded up all around you.
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.400]  Super hardcore tyranny, the model of the great reset and the new world order.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.400]  And we're going to be here fighting it big time.
[15:43.400 --> 15:49.400]  All right. Your phone calls a ton more coming up today. Infowars.com.

[17:59.400 --> 18:06.400]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible.
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.400]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.400]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[18:16.400 --> 18:22.400]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any resistance to it possible,
[18:22.400 --> 18:29.400]  was people continuing to support Infowars, despite the massive lawfare being waged against Infowars,
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.400]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against Infowars,
[18:33.400 --> 18:40.400]  the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser,
[18:40.400 --> 18:42.400]  is what keeps Infowars on the air.
[18:42.400 --> 18:49.400]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[18:49.400 --> 18:52.400]  So continue to do it. Go to places like InfowarsStore.com.
[18:52.400 --> 18:54.400]  Go to places like Save Infowars.
[18:54.400 --> 19:00.400]  Continue to keep Infowars alive because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:00.400 --> 19:05.400]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight.
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.400]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job.
[19:09.400 --> 19:12.400]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[19:12.400 --> 19:15.400]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.400]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew.
[19:19.400 --> 19:23.400]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[19:23.400 --> 19:29.400]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know.
[19:29.400 --> 19:32.400]  I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.400]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back.
[19:36.400 --> 19:41.400]  And I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[19:41.400 --> 19:45.400]  The one I like recently is Knockout. It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[19:45.400 --> 19:46.400]  It's amazing. It works.
[19:46.400 --> 19:49.400]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[19:49.400 --> 19:51.400]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[19:51.400 --> 19:55.400]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[19:55.400 --> 19:59.400]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:59.400 --> 20:25.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.400 --> 20:29.400]  Everything is stopping the central bank digital currencies.
[20:29.400 --> 20:33.400]  Everything is stopping the biomedical tyranny.
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.400]  The whole rest of your life is going to be dealing with this.
[20:36.400 --> 20:45.400]  And remember, complying with it leads to progressively intense levels of tyranny and death.
[20:45.400 --> 20:47.400]  This is global depopulation.
[20:47.400 --> 20:50.400]  And I'm really sorry I have to announce that to all of you,
[20:50.400 --> 20:55.400]  history is replete with elites and different ruling classes that try to kill off the underclass.
[20:55.400 --> 20:57.400]  This is happening again.
[20:57.400 --> 21:03.400]  And as this gets progressively worse, a lot of folks are going to try to join with the evil because they're scared.
[21:03.400 --> 21:10.400]  And that is what will grease the skids into hell, unimaginable, following orders.
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.400]  So it doesn't matter what happens to Alex Jones.
[21:12.400 --> 21:15.400]  I'm only worried about my family and my children and you should be too.
[21:15.400 --> 21:21.400]  And that's why I have a strength is that I'm resigned and I'm committed.
[21:21.400 --> 21:26.400]  And I know this is my job to warn as many people as I can and that God's going to do the rest, but understand something.
[21:26.400 --> 21:31.400]  You can see it now clear as day everywhere.
[21:31.400 --> 21:40.400]  Forced assistance, suicide, murder, transgenderism, mutilating children, fentanyl everywhere, open borders, devalued currencies,
[21:40.400 --> 21:43.400]  Satanism, openly promoted, pedophilia.
[21:43.400 --> 21:46.400]  This is just the beginning, people.
[21:46.400 --> 21:59.400]  Once they get their social credit score in place, they're going to have mobs of people coming and dragging you out of your 200 square foot coffin apartment to beat you to death on the street.
[21:59.400 --> 22:05.400]  It's all based on Mao and the struggle sessions and systems they set up there.
[22:05.400 --> 22:13.400]  The whole modern New World Order is a Maoist experiment that was run by the CIA with a high tech overlay.
[22:13.400 --> 22:23.400]  And so the sanity poking its head up above the tyranny of Senator Paul and Governor DeSantis and others saying these shots don't work.
[22:23.400 --> 22:26.400]  They were experimental. They lied to us.
[22:26.400 --> 22:28.400]  What did I ask Trump to do 100 times on air?
[22:28.400 --> 22:32.400]  What did I directly get him messages?
[22:32.400 --> 22:36.400]  The people I won't name who don't want their names named, you can guess who.
[22:36.400 --> 22:38.400]  Two people had meetings with Trump.
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.400]  He'd heard about it. He tried to call me. I missed the call a few months ago.
[22:42.400 --> 22:44.400]  I get a call about one of his components. Why are you doing this?
[22:44.400 --> 22:47.400]  And I said, I'll shoot reports to Trump explaining it.
[22:47.400 --> 22:53.400]  And I shot not one, but two reports begging him and explaining to him how they're going to set him up for this later.
[22:53.400 --> 23:01.400]  Now it's all going to come out and showing how the rats were already leaving the sinking ship with the head of the CDC and others saying they knew the shot wouldn't work.
[23:01.400 --> 23:03.400]  They told Trump it would have just got it done.
[23:03.400 --> 23:13.400]  And now Fauci last week on national TV says it's Trump's fault for the Wuhan lab and Operation Warp Speed.
[23:13.400 --> 23:16.400]  And still Trump picketedly marches into it.
[23:16.400 --> 23:26.400]  So it's so good to have DeSantis and Paul out doing this because it's real.
[23:26.400 --> 23:33.400]  They're killing us with these shots and they need to be punished for what they've done or they're going to get away with it and do it again.
[23:33.400 --> 23:38.400]  So we cover a thousand other issues that are interesting and informative, but this is everything.
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.400]  This is the big enchilada.
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.400]  The COVID tyranny and election fraud around the world keeping populist out.
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.400]  Like we see here in America, like we see in Brazil, clear evidence of fraud.
[23:50.400 --> 23:51.400]  Nobody's buying it.
[23:51.400 --> 23:54.400]  Only the Republican precincts failing.
[23:54.400 --> 24:10.400]  Now it's 44% of the machines, not 25% of the machines in America County, all in Republican districts, Republican primaries, Republican precincts.
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.400]  And then it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[24:15.400 --> 24:16.400]  And then, oh, the power went out.
[24:16.400 --> 24:18.400]  Oh, there was a water main busted.
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.400]  Oh, and we found all these extra ballots while everybody was out of the building and the camera is malfunctioned too.
[24:23.400 --> 24:35.400]  So election fraud and our ability to say no by we the people in our Republic being taken away.
[24:35.400 --> 24:37.400]  This is the process being taken away.
[24:37.400 --> 24:45.400]  The censorship, the surveillance, the control, the bullying, and then trying to take our bodies over and put this garbage in us.
[24:45.400 --> 24:48.400]  This is something we cannot put up with.
[24:48.400 --> 25:10.400]  Oh, five white vans showed up for unloading ballots and then the cameras all failed in Nevada, in Arizona, in Michigan, in Georgia, in Pennsylvania.
[25:10.400 --> 25:18.400]  A postal worker opens up the back of the truck and there's all these boxes across state lines and they're all marked for Biden two years ago.
[25:18.400 --> 25:22.400]  And he goes to the media and he goes to the FBI comes and threatens him.
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.400]  What are you doing opening up boxes in a mail?
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.400]  Well, I'm a mail carrier.
[25:25.400 --> 25:26.400]  Some suspicions.
[25:26.400 --> 25:28.400]  I'm allowed to look at it.
[25:28.400 --> 25:30.400]  It's all marked for Biden.
[25:30.400 --> 25:32.400]  Shut up.
[25:32.400 --> 25:34.400]  They don't even care.
[25:34.400 --> 25:48.400]  You've got these fools working for the system that think they can like cheat and steal and rob and it's going to get them ahead when all it's going to do is bring the whole society down where your money won't be worth anything anywhere.
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.400]  We're seeing what immorality causes.
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.400]  And I don't think of immorality as cheating on your wife.
[25:59.400 --> 26:00.400]  I do think of it as that.
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.400]  I think of it as bad.
[26:01.400 --> 26:11.400]  But they act like in the controlled Christian church that that's the ultimate sin and that that's the worst thing or, you know, drinking a beer.
[26:11.400 --> 26:21.400]  But the real sin isn't going out and fighting pedophilia or collapsing borders or human smuggling or speaking out against evil and being a coward.
[26:21.400 --> 26:23.400]  Being a coward is what God really hates.
[26:23.400 --> 26:34.400]  King David got his best friend killed because he was lusting over his wife, but he truly repented and knew it was wrong and had incredible courage and went out to approve himself.
[26:34.400 --> 26:41.400]  And God said, you're a man after my own heart because God judges the heart folks.
[26:41.400 --> 26:43.400]  But the people have lost their soul.
[26:43.400 --> 26:44.400]  They've lost their heart.
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.400]  They've lost their spark.
[26:46.400 --> 26:52.400]  And you see people that are really awake and they have like electricity in their eyes.
[26:52.400 --> 26:59.400]  You see people who aren't awake and they look like they're dead because they are.
[26:59.400 --> 27:01.400]  They're not conscious.
[27:01.400 --> 27:10.400]  They're just going through life, cutting every corner, cheating everywhere they can, ankle biting, back stabbing, believing that that's going to get them ahead.
[27:10.400 --> 27:17.400]  And what all the studies in Europe, in the U.S. and Canada show, depending on the study, it runs seven to ten times.
[27:17.400 --> 27:21.400]  Democrats, liberals are seven to ten times more likely to steal.
[27:21.400 --> 27:27.400]  Something like six to nine times more likely to tell you they're giving a charity, but not to give a charity.
[27:27.400 --> 27:29.400]  Way more likely to cheat.
[27:29.400 --> 27:31.400]  Way lazier.
[27:31.400 --> 27:34.400]  And what they are is bandwagon followers.
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.400]  They jump on every bandwagon.
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.400]  They go along with every the new thing.
[27:40.400 --> 27:50.400]  And what's happening is the civilization is unraveling and the globalist want to make that move as fast as possible by defunding the police.
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.400]  And by trying to take our guns so we can't defend ourselves.
[27:54.400 --> 28:03.400]  So that we give up and then the whole system collapses and then they come in with hardcore authoritarianism as the answer.
[28:03.400 --> 28:15.400]  And then they're going to take all these people with criminal records and they're going to put them in forced labor camps.
[28:15.400 --> 28:24.400]  And at that point, they'll come pick me up on the highway when I'm driving someday or if we're trying to get on a train,
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.400]  all of the cars gone by then and take me into an office and some other globalist will walk in and say,
[28:29.400 --> 28:31.400]  this is your last chance, Jones.
[28:31.400 --> 28:34.400]  You can join us and work with us.
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.400]  You know you've lost or we're going to kill you.
[28:37.400 --> 28:40.400]  And I'll be in that room one day.
[28:40.400 --> 28:41.400]  Very good chance of that.
[28:41.400 --> 28:43.400]  That's how this works.
[28:43.400 --> 28:45.400]  Think about it.
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.400]  See, they're going to take all the people that brought them into power and kill them.
[28:49.400 --> 28:51.400]  They're going to try to hire me.
[28:51.400 --> 28:53.400]  That's how history works.
[28:53.400 --> 29:22.400]  They're right back. Stay with us.
[29:23.400 --> 29:26.400]  And I'm going to give it a five-year-old look at the book.
[29:26.400 --> 29:32.400]  It's called The Great Reset on orders of $50 or more and big discounts on the regular shipping as well.

[30:00.240 --> 30:07.200]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.520]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[30:12.520 --> 30:18.160]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's
[30:18.160 --> 30:19.160]  going on.
[30:19.160 --> 30:22.920]  But we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air.

[30:44.720 --> 30:51.520]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and merry Christmas.
[30:59.520 --> 31:06.480]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[31:06.480 --> 31:11.080]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[31:11.080 --> 31:15.520]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[31:15.520 --> 31:20.360]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[31:20.360 --> 31:23.920]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[31:23.920 --> 31:30.080]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[31:30.080 --> 31:34.080]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3, and then it's
[31:34.080 --> 31:38.640]  very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[31:38.640 --> 31:42.560]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[31:42.560 --> 31:47.280]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[31:59.600 --> 32:04.960]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[32:04.960 --> 32:06.560]  victories tonight possible.
[32:06.560 --> 32:10.760]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[32:10.760 --> 32:15.600]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the
[32:15.600 --> 32:21.920]  school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any resistance
[32:21.920 --> 32:27.880]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive law fair being
[32:27.880 --> 32:33.280]  waged against info wars, despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against info
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.680]  wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives
[32:38.680 --> 32:43.760]  healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is
[32:43.760 --> 32:49.200]  keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[32:49.200 --> 32:55.320]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to the places like save info wars, continue
[32:55.320 --> 33:01.680]  to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[33:01.680 --> 33:13.320]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.320 --> 33:20.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:20.040 --> 33:21.040]  the info war.
[33:21.040 --> 33:28.360]  All right, let me get to this to Samus clip that I've been talking about so much.
[33:28.360 --> 33:29.360]  This is really good news.
[33:29.360 --> 33:37.520]  And don't forget, we just launched a poll on the front page about halfway down of infowars.com.
[33:37.520 --> 33:42.480]  Who would you vote for in the 2024 GOP primary?
[33:42.480 --> 33:48.480]  Rand Paul, Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump or Tulsi Gabbard, if she ran as a Republican, which
[33:48.480 --> 33:50.600]  people are saying she may.
[33:50.600 --> 33:56.880]  And I clicked on it and I'd be contrarian, I went with Rand Paul because he's not good
[33:56.880 --> 34:07.480]  enough attention, he got 36% so far, 35%, Ron DeSantis got 10%, Donald Trump 42, Tulsi
[34:07.480 --> 34:08.640]  5.
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.160]  So that's what I expected, Donald Trump is the most popular and he did have the election
[34:14.160 --> 34:15.160]  stolen from him.
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.280]  He is the president right now and you're not supposed to say that, but it's true.
[34:19.280 --> 34:20.280]  We all know that.
[34:20.280 --> 34:29.120]  So I'm going to play this clip of DeSantis talking about going after the vaccine makers.
[34:29.120 --> 34:36.760]  We are going to work to hold these manufacturers accountable for this mRNA because they said
[34:36.760 --> 34:40.280]  there was no side effects and we know that there have been a lot.
[34:40.280 --> 34:47.000]  And so we did a study in Florida and you saw an 86% increase in cardiac related activity
[34:47.000 --> 34:54.000]  from people 18 to 39 from mRNA shots and so we're going to be doing some stuff to bring
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.640]  accountability there because I think it's just something where.
[35:00.640 --> 35:03.880]  And now he's come out and said more about they're not going to basically let him have
[35:03.880 --> 35:07.400]  it on the shelves, not just don't push it on the kids.
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.640]  This is a major victory.
[35:09.640 --> 35:11.640]  This is all moving in the right direction.
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.280]  Senator Paul saying Fauci will be held accountable.
[35:15.280 --> 35:16.280]  He will not escape.
[35:16.280 --> 35:17.640]  He will be indicted.
[35:17.640 --> 35:18.800]  That's the spirit.
[35:18.800 --> 35:22.280]  That's what should happen and we have to believe it's going to happen and start pushing for
[35:22.280 --> 35:23.280]  it to happen.
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.000]  But let me tell you, it's been a lonely place for over two and a half years calling for
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  his arrest.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.760]  It makes it a lot safer for us here at M4's that people are getting on board.
[35:33.760 --> 35:36.320]  So I don't want to be the leader.
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.720]  I don't want to be the one that always says it first, but that's why we're here because
[35:40.720 --> 35:42.560]  other people know the truth.
[35:42.560 --> 35:44.360]  They don't have the courage up front.
[35:44.360 --> 35:48.840]  We have to have the courage for them to make it safe for them to do the right thing.
[35:48.840 --> 35:53.040]  That's where we come in and that's something that, quite frankly, only we are doing on
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.560]  a scale anywhere near this size and all glory goes to God.
[35:57.560 --> 36:01.080]  I want to place some more clips, get more into this and take your calls here in just
[36:01.080 --> 36:02.080]  a moment.
[36:02.080 --> 36:05.380]  Please remember that M4 Wars is fighting for its very survival.
[36:05.380 --> 36:08.840]  We have great products that will enrich and empower your life.
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.440]  We have free shipping back on orders of $50 or more at M4WarsTour.com and we have incredible

[36:39.680 --> 36:43.800]  If we sell out all this, we have got money into early January to operate and a bunch
[36:43.800 --> 36:47.640]  of new products or products that have been sold out like Turbo Force and things should
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.040]  be back in and we should be able to survive, but we need to sell out and we are going to
[36:53.040 --> 36:54.040]  sell out.
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.560]  We are going to catch 22.
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.840]  We would sell out all these products in two months at regular price, but then we wouldn't
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.240]  sell what we need the next few weeks to have money going into next year, so this is your
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.720]  opportunity to keep us on air and get a great deal, a 360 win, Survival Shield X3 sold out,
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.760]  Bob Jitslinium sold out, Patriot Blend Coffee sold out, Immune Support sold out, a bunch
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.080]  of other stuff almost about to sell out, Ultimate Crittle Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Physiomagnesium,
[37:23.080 --> 37:30.120]  it's all at infowarstore.com and again, I want to thank you all for your amazing support
[37:30.120 --> 37:32.120]  and your prayers.
[37:32.120 --> 37:41.160]  Okay, Florida, to hold vaccine makers liable over mRNA claims, you can see the video I
[37:41.160 --> 37:48.920]  just played and more of what DeSantis' Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has been saying in an
[37:48.920 --> 37:52.800]  article on infowarstore.com, but they are really telling it like it is and I have been saying
[37:52.800 --> 37:53.800]  that for months.
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.560]  I want to see DeSantis say what his Surgeon General is saying and now he is doing that.
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.680]  That is an extremely positive thing.
[38:03.680 --> 38:08.240]  Ron DeSantis says he plans to hold Pfizer and Moderna accountable for making false claims
[38:08.240 --> 38:09.240]  about their shots.
[38:09.240 --> 38:21.360]  Hell, I've got Bill Gates, I've got Borla of Pfizer, all of them, when he's not calling
[38:21.360 --> 38:28.440]  me an agent of evil, the ultimate evil, at the ADL, he is saying, oh, we have done something,
[38:28.440 --> 38:35.760]  because 100% effective for children, 100% effective in South Africa, 100%, he was saying
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.200]  that a year into it when they were saying it was 40% effective and now they admit it's
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.520]  not effective except in erasing your immune system, absolutely insane.
[38:45.520 --> 38:51.880]  Meanwhile, Pfizer seeks FDA authorization for Omicron vaccine for under five children.
[38:51.880 --> 39:01.320]  New monsters.
[39:01.320 --> 39:02.320]  Absolutely crazy.
[39:02.320 --> 39:03.320]  Breaking.
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.400]  Missouri Attorney General Schmidt releases entire transcript of Fauci deposition.
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.360]  He said 170 plus times, I don't know, I can't remember, or basically took the Fifth Amendment.
[39:15.360 --> 39:18.880]  I don't remember anything, does he?
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.640]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, Laura, thanks
[39:24.640 --> 39:25.640]  for calling.
[39:25.640 --> 39:26.640]  You're on the air from Chicago.
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.280]  Hey, Alex, I've been listening to you since I got out of the Army in the 90s.
[39:32.280 --> 39:34.000]  Well, I really appreciate you.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  God bless you.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  You're here.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.120]  You can lead a whole Army battalion.
[39:38.120 --> 39:41.880]  So, God bless your little heart.
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.360]  I also buy your products, I got your, before I get my comment, but I also got my son.
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.880]  The super male vitality, he's 14, because I think he says he's gay, so I inject it
[39:53.880 --> 39:56.880]  into his jello in his soup, and he can't like, you get.
[39:56.880 --> 40:06.360]  But the reason I'm calling, he can't handle it, man, I'm like, well, he probably isn't
[40:06.360 --> 40:09.680]  gay, you know, testosterone's way down.
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.840]  A lot of the soy and things in the school diets are feminizing men, sperm counts are
[40:14.840 --> 40:19.040]  down massively, so, sorry, go ahead.
[40:19.040 --> 40:24.360]  No, it's okay, sir, I know I saw your video of the frogs, it's everything, you know,
[40:24.360 --> 40:30.000]  it's the chemicals in the water and the plastics, but I give him alpha male vitality, I tell
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.520]  him it's a centrum, whatever.
[40:31.520 --> 40:38.800]  Well, has the super male vitality had any effect on your 14-year-old?
[40:38.800 --> 40:39.800]  I think it's better.
[40:39.800 --> 40:41.960]  I think it's not so like, I really don't know.
[40:41.960 --> 40:45.400]  Is it growing some hair on his chest?
[40:45.400 --> 40:47.400]  Yeah.
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.840]  I was bald as a mole rat till I took it, now I've got all this hair, I'm joking.
[40:51.840 --> 40:53.320]  You're a mole rat.
[40:53.320 --> 40:55.840]  Hey, I appreciate your call, Laura, God bless you.
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.000]  Let's talk to Josh and FEMA region, hey, go ahead, Josh.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.760]  Hey, Alex, yeah, I've been saying this since the 2020 election, Tulsi Gabbard should run
[41:04.760 --> 41:11.080]  as president, he has some great foreign policy, and I think Rand Paul should be her VP, yeah,
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.480]  her VP, and this should be just like back in the day where we used to choose the president
[41:15.480 --> 41:17.080]  and the VP that ran.
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.960]  Well, she just came out and said she has nothing to do with the World Economic Forum.
[41:21.960 --> 41:26.240]  She said one time she went to one conference that they sponsored, and that's what I looked
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.360]  into her background, no connections, the thing's been around 30-plus years, they put on a lot
[41:30.360 --> 41:34.720]  of big political events, and people go speak at it, and so they can act like they're super
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.080]  powerful, Klaus Schwab would then claim everybody was his agent.
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.000]  He does have a lot of people that are his agent, but he claimed Vladimir Putin works
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  for him.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.800]  So, I mean, Klaus Schwab is just out of control.
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.000]  Yeah, I even asked Tulsi to her face, I asked her if she can then Klaus Schwab, and she
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.600]  said yes, no cameras around, no nothing, she didn't even have to answer it, and she told
[41:55.600 --> 41:56.600]  me.
[41:56.600 --> 42:00.840]  Well, what matters is on her policies, she's been supporting things that they don't support,
[42:00.840 --> 42:05.280]  so basically her policy is 170 degrees different than theirs.
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.440]  Yeah, she's completely against regime change and everything, and I think Rand Paul would
[42:09.440 --> 42:14.280]  be great against the bureaucracy as a vice president, I think it's the best combo that
[42:14.280 --> 42:16.280]  we'd have going in 2024.
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.000]  So, you think a Gabbards poll ticket?
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.440]  Yes, one does foreign policy, which would be Tulsi Gabbard, she understands the military,
[42:26.440 --> 42:33.000]  she understands the regime change, she even goes against the big tech and agencies working
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.120]  together, and Rand Paul understands all bureaucracy and...
[42:38.120 --> 42:42.760]  Yeah, well, a lot of Republicans don't trust her, but I see her getting better and better,
[42:42.760 --> 42:44.000]  and I have a good feeling about her.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.760]  I appreciate your call, I really do, Josh.
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.000]  All right, we're gonna come right back and take more phone calls, bam, bam, bam, straight
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.040]  ahead, and there's so many clips, so much news I'm gonna be getting to, but your call

[44:03.800 --> 44:08.080]  denatured, it's been marked down, we didn't do that.
[44:08.080 --> 44:11.920]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can
[44:11.920 --> 44:14.640]  get, I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[44:14.640 --> 44:20.640]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because
[44:20.640 --> 44:23.920]  I want that good will.
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.200]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret, you ever seen fish oil
[44:29.200 --> 44:30.200]  look like that?
[44:30.200 --> 44:31.200]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[44:31.200 --> 44:40.200]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[44:40.200 --> 44:49.760]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.320]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil, just like
[44:55.320 --> 44:59.760]  our information is dynamite, so are our products infowarstore.com.
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.440]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support info wars and
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.960]  band.video, you know, the Bible says let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right
[45:08.960 --> 45:09.960]  now.
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.800]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.920]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.680]  pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself, I've been given so many
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.160]  opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.040]  even be half of where I am right now, if it weren't for Alex Jones, I mean, I've been
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.040]  able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[45:39.040 --> 45:45.040]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted, because
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.360]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.080]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[45:52.080 --> 45:55.760]  their store, go support info wars, leave a donation right now.
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.960]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[45:59.960 --> 46:06.960]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide,
[46:06.960 --> 46:12.240]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[46:12.240 --> 46:17.880]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's
[46:17.880 --> 46:23.480]  going on, but we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air, and you can
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.440]  do that now at infowarstore.com.

[47:21.240 --> 47:26.440]  truly, 3pm, Owen Shroyer, the info wars, live, weekday lineup, then I come in most Saturdays
[47:26.440 --> 47:33.040]  through a special tape or live show, and then Sundays, 4pm, Sunday live with myself and Owen
[47:33.040 --> 47:34.040]  Shroyer.
[47:34.040 --> 47:40.800]  Alright, I want to go back to your phone calls, but I wanted to play this clip of YouTuber
[47:40.800 --> 47:48.480]  Ethan Klein, celebrates the murder of Christ, if Jesus were here, I'd spear him, I liked
[47:48.480 --> 47:55.800]  it the first time, I'd do it again, he's Jewish, responding to Kanye West, responding
[47:55.800 --> 48:03.240]  to Nick Fuentes, and just trying to create a national scandal out of that, and that's
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.200]  what I didn't like about Thursday's interview, is it creates more division, and more people
[48:07.200 --> 48:11.640]  fighting with each other, and now the left is coming in and saying they hate Jesus, why
[48:11.640 --> 48:17.880]  does Jesus deserve to be hated because Nick Fuentes likes Hitler, why don't you leave
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.720]  Jesus alone, you have a right, Ethan, to say you killed Jesus again, but you didn't kill
[48:22.720 --> 48:32.520]  Jesus, you didn't kill Jesus, Ethan, it's just disgusting, and I don't want to even
[48:32.520 --> 48:39.960]  consider and hate this guy, I don't want to hate people like Nick Fuentes, it's just
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.800]  we're not going to make it as a planet if we keep doing this, and the left knows that,
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.720]  that's why they stir up racial division, and then act like they're the ones trying to stop
[48:47.720 --> 48:54.560]  it, that's why they disgust me to the highest level, is Hollywood our enemy, absolutely,
[48:54.560 --> 49:02.000]  is it trying to destroy our culture, yes, and the people that run the whole show folks
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.600]  are running this thing, I don't think Yay and Nick know they're playing along with it,
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.000]  but at the end of the day, yeah, it gets a bunch of attention, but I don't want to just
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.600]  get attention here, I want to change the world for the better, I want to do what Governor
[49:16.600 --> 49:20.520]  DeSantis is doing, coming out against these boys and shots, I want to protect our children
[49:20.520 --> 49:25.320]  and our elderly now, of every race, color, and creed, that's what I kept telling Yay,
[49:25.320 --> 49:29.360]  is they're targeting Jews with the most injections in any country, they have the highest death
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.920]  rate over there in Israel, if they're so special, why didn't they get a message, did not take
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.880]  it, but see, they are special, they're getting targeted by their own government, and that's
[49:39.880 --> 49:45.480]  the relationship of the ADL and these New World Order types over Jews, particularly that
[49:45.480 --> 49:51.280]  they want to control as a wealthy, hardworking, highly educated group, and so Jews would do
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.720]  very well to look at their leadership and who's controlling them, because I love the
[49:56.720 --> 50:01.560]  Jews, and I love the Chinese, and I love the Germans, and I love the Christians, and I
[50:01.560 --> 50:07.200]  love the Muslims, and I love you all, I truly love you, and I want to stop seeing all of
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.000]  us attacked by this, because this thing's coming after everybody, mark my words, and
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.360]  you've seen it come after everybody, I'm ranting, go ahead and play Ethan Clonny, it's a huge
[50:19.360 --> 50:22.360]  show, five million views on average a day, here it is.
[50:22.360 --> 50:28.880]  I'm doing my part, so you could sit in your parent's basement and cry about it, and I'd
[50:28.880 --> 50:35.800]  do it again, give me the spear, I'll do it again, you're gonna piss off the weird hysterical
[50:35.800 --> 50:44.480]  nerds dude, good, if Jesus was here on a cross I'd swear him, no, it'd be funny if he got
[50:44.480 --> 50:50.000]  banned, that's an insane thing, no, no shot, give me the hammer and the spike, I'm putting
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.880]  it up there, if someone can do it, it's Ethan, he'll find a way, oh I'll do it again, I liked
[50:55.880 --> 51:01.560]  it the first time and I'll do it again Nick, I'm getting on a call with all my Jewish brothers
[51:01.560 --> 51:07.320]  and sisters, there's 30 minutes left, I really want to make Dan proud, you know what I'm
[51:07.320 --> 51:17.200]  planning this Christmas, a mock execution of Jesus Christ, dedicated to Nick Fuentes,
[51:17.200 --> 51:23.440]  so this guy's trolling to get attention, Ye put up an image of a star of David, seal
[51:23.440 --> 51:29.160]  of Solomon with a swastika, the Hindu swastika, the metal, not racist, he got banned off Twitter,
[51:29.160 --> 51:35.880]  that is direct incitement of violence against Christians, and there's record the UN admits
[51:35.880 --> 51:39.680]  triple the amount of churches and Christians being killed the last 10 years and previous
[51:39.680 --> 51:46.760]  years, so the ADL and others say don't criticize any policies they have or you want to kill
[51:46.760 --> 51:54.520]  Jews, I don't want to kill anybody, but then you get up there and you talk about wanting
[51:54.520 --> 51:59.040]  to kill Jesus and reenact killing Jesus and you have 5 million viewers a day, he has a
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.720]  big show, and what are you going to do if somebody goes out and kills a Christian and
[52:04.720 --> 52:08.880]  it says Ethan Klein told me to do it, look you have the free speech under Supreme Court
[52:08.880 --> 52:14.720]  rulings and I agree with it, to in general say you'd like to kill Christians and that
[52:14.720 --> 52:18.320]  you're going to do it, now as soon as you plan who you're going to target or try to
[52:18.320 --> 52:26.120]  carry it out, you're going to go to prison, or you should, but just come on, come on,
[52:26.120 --> 52:34.000]  what if Ye or Nick Fuentes had called for a case of, like you know, and I'm not saying
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.880]  this, what if they had said this hypothetically, you know Hitler killed millions of Jews, well
[52:37.880 --> 52:42.200]  you know what, I'd do it again, we should do it again, what would you be saying if they
[52:42.200 --> 52:49.200]  said that, it would have been the end of the world, but see Christians, it's okay to single
[52:49.200 --> 52:57.720]  us out, isn't it Ethan, and talk about us dying, and talk about us getting killed, no
[52:57.720 --> 53:01.920]  Ethan Klein won't burn a Korean on his show because he knows they'll come and get him,
[53:01.920 --> 53:06.080]  because they don't appreciate the First Amendment, but you know us Christians, you can push us
[53:06.080 --> 53:10.840]  around can't you, I don't want any violence against Ethan Klein, and I challenge Ethan
[53:10.840 --> 53:15.200]  Klein, who's attacked me a lot over the years, to have me on this show, and I'll come on
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.760]  this show, and maybe I can talk some sense into him, because I know he calls me crazy
[53:19.760 --> 53:25.400]  and stuff, but dude, saying you want to kill the religious icon of two and a half billion
[53:25.400 --> 53:28.960]  people on this planet, and saying you did it, and saying you do it again, and say you're
[53:28.960 --> 53:33.840]  going to have a mock execution of Jesus at Christmas, is meant to be hurtful to somebody's
[53:33.840 --> 53:38.920]  religion and their beliefs, and is meant to invoke the idea of violence against those people,
[53:38.920 --> 53:45.240]  and you have a right to do that, but do you really want to do that, because what you've
[53:45.240 --> 53:50.040]  done is taking yourself, you say yay, and it points us on a very low level, well you've
[53:50.040 --> 53:53.880]  just taken yourself way lower, oh I get it though, you're allowed to, you're a liberal
[53:53.880 --> 54:04.760]  right, it was disgusting, and it was dangerous, but he has a right to do it, let's go ahead,
[54:04.760 --> 54:09.440]  but he wants my, he supports citizenship against me, he doesn't want me to have my right though,
[54:09.440 --> 54:16.560]  he can say he wants to kill Jesus, he can say he loves to kill Christians, that's okay,
[54:16.560 --> 54:20.320]  me I say nothing even close to that, but I've got to be off the air, because I bring unity,
[54:20.320 --> 54:24.160]  they don't like that, that's the tune of the show, it creates unity, they don't want that
[54:24.160 --> 54:30.640]  do they, Tim in Seattle, thanks for holding it on the air, how's it going Alex, another
[54:30.640 --> 54:36.360]  amazing show, as far as the identity politics, I was a liberal in Seattle and you were the
[54:36.360 --> 54:41.160]  one talking about saving children, and it was your politics and your message that turned
[54:41.160 --> 54:46.800]  me over to the right, it's you and you alone that is bringing that message of saving children,
[54:46.800 --> 54:53.000]  of protecting our biosphere of life and thriving outside of politics, so I just want to commend
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.040]  you for that, I just want to remind everybody that Alex Jones is the tip of the spear,
[54:58.040 --> 55:04.360]  as far as Rand Paul, I can't wait, how do we get Rand Paul to run, because he's the
[55:04.360 --> 55:08.720]  leader, he's the leader in the Republican party, he understands the threat, he's going
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.680]  after the head of the snake.
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.640]  We definitely does not have a big ego and is the smartest of all of them, the problem
[55:15.640 --> 55:21.040]  is he doesn't have a lot of charisma, he has it, but he's too reserved to use it, and I
[55:21.040 --> 55:23.640]  suggest he starts using it.
[55:23.640 --> 55:29.560]  Well, yeah, I mean, he could hire you for his campaign manager, that'd be fantastic,
[55:29.560 --> 55:34.960]  I mean, we need to break the conditioning, we need to make voices like yours mainstream.
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.400]  Well, he did, he did, he did thank me when he won for getting him elected, he said we
[55:39.400 --> 55:42.080]  wouldn't have got elected if it wasn't for you Alex, so, but...
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.680]  Imagine when he says that to you in 2024, because you got Trump elected, we all know,
[55:47.680 --> 55:54.280]  we saw Trump go on your show, and then all of a sudden Trump became our champion, because
[55:54.280 --> 55:57.680]  he was on your show, you're the litmus test for America, you're the one...
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.680]  Well, there's no doubt that that was a catalyst, one of the main factors, yes, and the left
[56:02.680 --> 56:06.800]  does recognize that, and that's why I've been so persecuted, again, I'm not a victim, I
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.000]  simply ask folks to keep me in the fight, I'm not a victim, I don't mind all the attacks
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.800]  folks, I'll do whatever it takes, but please keep me in the fight folks, that only happens
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.640]  with your word of mouth, and buying products at infoworktore.com, it's a simple equation,
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.480]  a simple thing people can do, and we're so close to shutting down, and if we do shut
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.760]  down, people go, oh my God, come back, and then I'm sure the money will flow in, but
[56:28.760 --> 56:32.880]  it's very hard to restart something like this once it's been shut down, so just, I appreciate
[56:32.880 --> 56:34.880]  you brother, anything else, Tim?
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.080]  No, I just want to say that you're not the victim, you're the champion, okay, remember
[56:39.080 --> 56:41.480]  that, you are the champion, thank you very much Alex.
[56:41.480 --> 56:46.360]  Well God bless you brother, I mean, I appreciate you, look, I don't try to be the champion,
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.280]  and I don't plan to have all the answers, but I'm definitely for real, I mean, there's
[56:50.280 --> 56:53.840]  no doubt folks, and I know you're for real too, so these people that tell you this is
[56:53.840 --> 57:00.040]  controlled opposition, or that guys, no, no, there are a lot of real people, and I can
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.080]  tell you Rand Paul's for real, I can tell you I'm for real, DeSantis has got to be for
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.840]  real coming out against Pfizer and Moderna, I think you see all the big Republican money
[57:09.840 --> 57:17.040]  behind him because they are scared of Trump, so it's, look, we're winning in many ways,
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.160]  we're making them still the elections out in the open, and that hurts them grievously,
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.160]  like Carrie Lake said, she said, everybody knows you stole it, and you're never going
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.120]  to win now, and you're just going to make us wake up and fight that much harder, we're
[57:27.120 --> 57:30.600]  not going to give up because they still elections, we're going to get involved and have such
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.960]  tsunamis that they can't override those, which is happening, they try to still everywhere,
[57:34.960 --> 57:41.080]  they try to still Texas and Florida the last two elections, the one last month and the
[57:41.080 --> 57:45.760]  one two years ago, back in two minutes with your phone calls, Daniel Russell, many others,
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.960]  stay with us.

[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:34.880]  Thank you for taking my call, I just wanted to propose an idea, what about a Rand Paul
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.880]  Ron Paul ticket?
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.000]  Yeah, no man, I like Ron Paul a lot, but I think he's a little too old.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.480]  Well, I mean we've got a walking corpse now, so I don't see that be much of a difference,
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.320]  but I wanted to talk about Elon Musk for a second, I've seen that so many conservatives
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.360]  are being fooled by him, I want to believe the guy, but I mean anybody who dresses up
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.880]  as Bathometh's boy soldier obviously has problems.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.320]  And 5G satellites and brain chips and stuff like that?
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  Yeah.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.920]  Absolutely, it's all out in front of us and all of a sudden he's being hailed as some
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.960]  hero because he's dumping information, feeding it to us with a spoon, and most of that information
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.200]  is what we already know.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:25.240]  But into the yay, and Elon, have you alluded to the star of David Swastika, cross symbolism
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.720]  that he had posted that got it banned, maybe do a little bit of research, and I started
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:36.240]  noticing that if you search Azov in Twitter, Elon Musk is one of the top people, one of
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.560]  the top accounts that pops up when you do that search, I just thought that was kind
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.360]  of interesting, and you know, most of his money has come from government subsidies and
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.040]  government funding, so I'm not sure how anybody could think that he's legitimately going to
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.240]  release some information without having a huge backlash, which I don't think he's actually
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.240]  willing to do.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.840]  I think he's just playing the game, maybe he's playing a part of it.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.680]  Well, I'll tell you this about Elon, what does it say though that their big billionaire
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.680]  space sex, brain chip, new world order guy is having to act like he's a patriot?
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.480]  It shows how far we've come, but they've got to put a good cop in there, so his negative
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.920]  is it is to know that he's pretty much a double dealer, at least he's having to act
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.560]  like he's a good guy, so that shows you how far we've come.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.760]  I agree 100%, I agree, and it's just to me, it's sad to see that a lot of people are falling
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]  for it.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.480]  Again, I really wish he was, but unfortunately, it just doesn't.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.680]  Exactly, I want to believe it, but that's just, it's not true.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.560]  I thank you for the call, great points, Russell in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:47.360]  Hey, good morning, Alex, I'm calling from the belly of the beast here in Portland, Oregon.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:54.280]  Just wanted to make some points about your call, your episode with Kanye West, thought
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.600]  you did a really great job handling the whole situation.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.120]  The thing that I don't think has gotten much attention is that he deflected your questions
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.680]  about the biomedical tyranny of the shot, at least twice, I think maybe three times.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.040]  He won't address that point, and that's a big cause for concern in terms of what is
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:23.320]  his real motivation, where does he really stand?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.600]  That's a good point, I mean, what's your gut tell you?
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:38.200]  Well, my gut tells me that he is some type of agent or operative with the transhumanism,
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.800]  because he promotes Ray Kurzweil, he promotes Steve Jobs, he talks about how Apple is the
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.000]  greatest company on earth.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.880]  He talked about Apple on your show.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.000]  I think that he is a transhumanist.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.560]  He also claimed to be writing an amended constitution with Nick Bluntest, he said that on your
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  show.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.680]  What do you think about that?
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.840]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.400]  I mean, I think he's got a lot of things going on in his head.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.240]  I don't think he's consciously trying to be a bad person.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.040]  I think he's trying to be a trailblazer and break the system.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.920]  I mean, I think that, like Scott Adams said, he's trying to overturn the game because he
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.160]  can't win the game.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.400]  I think that's just going on.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400]  I'm just curious.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:30.560]  I mean, why would he not be able to respond to your questions about real biomedical tyranny?
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.520]  Like you said, this is the issue of our time, not Hitler, anti-Semitism, the shots that
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.680]  are killing people, thousands and thousands and thousands of people, including children.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.360]  Like, why would a person not take a stand?
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  No, I hear you.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]  It was a disturbing interview.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.760]  I mean, I'm just being honest.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.560]  I was very frustrated by it.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560]  I appreciate your call, Russell.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560]  All right.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560]  We'll get to all your calls.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.560]  We have a special guest coming on as well.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.560]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:26.520]  We'll see you in a minute.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:56.440]  We'll see you in a minute.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:26.280]  We'll see you in a minute.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:56.120]  We'll see you in a minute.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:03.680]  You know, MIT, a bunch of the degrees, Homeland Security, Center for Excellence, senior member
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.680]  of the technical staff, a whole bunch of major laboratories, EcoHealth Alliance, the list
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.080]  goes on and on that he's been exposing.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.200]  And so he's got the inside scoop on how they did it.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.560]  And we now see more and more whistleblowers coming out saying that this was an inside
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.680]  job at the lab and people that worked at the lab.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.880]  So he's got a huge bio and a huge background document this to tell us a little bit about
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:32.120]  yourself and in the book, the truth about Wuhan, how I uncovered the biggest lion history
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.960]  by Dr. Andrew Huff, former EcoHealth Alliance vice president and senior scientist.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.960]  In fact, that's the thing I should have just said right up front is that he's the EcoHealth
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960]  Alliance whistleblower.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.520]  Thanks for being here with us.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.320]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.800]  Well, just you've got the floor.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.800]  Tell us what's really going on.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:56.040]  Well, I mean, it's a crazy story and, you know, I like to let everyone know I was really
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.400]  groomed to be a leader in national security and biosecurity, bioterror.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.240]  Like you said, I worked at the Department of Homeland Security, the Center of Excellence.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.120]  I worked on the classified side at a national laboratory in this space.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.520]  I wanted to get away from the deep state.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.040]  I actually got sick of working in it and I thought I was going to get trapped working
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.240]  in the national laboratory unless I ditched the security clearance.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.520]  And that's how I wound up at EcoHealth Alliance.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.360]  You know, the strange thing is, I left the beast and I wound right back up in it.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.840]  So all my work at EcoHealth Alliance was funded by the Department of Defense.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.880]  How successful I brought in six million dollars of funding, that funding I brought in transformed
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:37.000]  the organization from a technical perspective, hired and built a great team, kicked butt
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  at what I used to do.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.560]  I used to build artificial intelligence forecasting and bio threat or biosurveillance detection
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:52.840]  technologies for the three letter agencies, so CIA, DOD, etc.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:09:01.080]  And I had a first-hand account in view of what really happened with this gain of function
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:08.520]  technology and it dives into all the deep, deep, it has its tentacles deep into various
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:15.080]  aspects of the biosecurity state from sample collection to intelligence.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:23.240]  It's just incredible that we have the EcoHealth Alliance whistleblower, vice president formally
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.840]  of it and senior scientist.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.840]  I mean, this is so huge that you've gone public and you've done what you've done and
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.320]  this has been going on in the background for a while and you've been persecuted for what
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320]  you've done.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.720]  You've gone through all of this in the next segment, but just start over with who you
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.320]  are and then what you started to see and what the last three years has been like.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  Sure.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.920]  So, I guess I'll start at the point where, you know, I was hired to EcoHealth Alliance
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:56.960]  as a senior scientist to turn around a failing department in quantitative epidemiology, predictive
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.480]  modeling and forecasting.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.720]  I was successful at it and when I was promoted to vice president, I was assigned to a number
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.880]  of the other programs or projects that the organization I specifically asked me added
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.760]  to what's called the Predict Program from the United States Agency for International
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.920]  Development, USAID and, you know, this big program was developed or designed in what
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.360]  they were telling everyone was what they wanted to do is they wanted to go out and collect
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:28.360]  biological samples of things like coronaviruses to predict and prevent the next pandemic and
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.040]  I thought this was the coolest thing in the world and I actually wanted to work on that
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.120]  project more than anything, even more than my own work that I was doing.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.880]  And once I was added to the project after I was promoted, I got to see under the hood
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:46.200]  of what was going on and I realized, you know, it was one big farce and because I had previously
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.920]  worked on the classified side of a lot of these programs from the Department of Defense
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.560]  where they're trying to go out and conduct biosurveillance, you know, and the one thing
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.560]  I want to mention here, it's not all nefarious.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.040]  I've looked at some of the papers from the Biolabs in Ukraine which I co-wrote some
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.200]  of the proposals for those Biolabs.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]  It's not all nefarious.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.400]  You need to go and collect biological samples to protect the military and the United States
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.280]  people from biological threats.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.640]  But that's really sort of not what was happening because they weren't collecting the right
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.000]  data and materials to be able to predict anything accurately.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.160]  So, you know, I started to ask myself, well, what the heck are they doing here?
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.920]  To me, it looked like they were collecting intelligence on foreign laboratory capacity
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.240]  and building capacity in these foreign laboratories, which, once again, isn't all bad.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.440]  And you fast forward to a weird conversation I had.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.240]  Peter Dasek approached me and asked me whether or not he should work with the CIA.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.840]  And I was shocked when he asked me about this and I actually posted this on Twitter over
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.600]  a year ago and Infowars picked it up right away.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.400]  You know, I said, Peter, it never hurts to talk to him.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  There could be money in it.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.600]  And then over the next two months, he proceeds to tell me that the relationship with them
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]  is proceeding.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.200]  Well, a number of things happened at Equal Health Alliance.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.120]  You know, I find out Peter served a bad guy.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:06.360]  He lies to me about a part of a way that we are planning to grow and privatize a section
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.560]  of my company.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.560]  And I saw the writing on the wall.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560]  I got the heck out of there.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.680]  As happy as I could be to leave at Equal Health Alliance, I never thought that it would amount
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.680]  to anything.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:20.600]  Well, fast forward to the fall of 2019 and that's when I learned myself about the emerging
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.600]  infectious disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.360]  I actually found out about it in mid-December of 2019 from picking up some chatter and that's
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.600]  one of the technologies that I developed for the Department of Defense was actually using
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.680]  natural language processing technology to detect these emerging threats when people
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.520]  are tweeting or sending information over the pipeline or over networks.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.480]  So I always had my finger on the pulse of these events in order to look for information.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.640]  So, you know, when people start talking about there's some crazy disease event going on in
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.120]  China, I go to validate that.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.200]  And one way that I did that, this is actually an analyst technique that I learned.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.400]  You can go look for what's called particulate matter data 2.5 and what that represents,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.280]  if you see a little in a plume dispersion model, if you see clusters of this or you
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.520]  see a high concentration of it, you can then overlay it with the city's infrastructure
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520]  and that's what I did.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.080]  And it looked like the crematoriums in Wuhan were operating in overdrive.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.640]  Well, this is super exciting.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.040]  You know, like this is what people like me get really excited about.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.400]  And you know, I start calling up friends, coworkers, colleagues and, you know, sounding
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.840]  alarm like, hey, why isn't the U.S. government doing anything about this?
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840]  And nobody really had a good answer.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.600]  Then over the next two weeks, it starts to pick up on other public forums where epidemiologists
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.120]  share information that there's an outbreak happening and then trickles into the U.S.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.040]  government about the first week of January and they start releasing some communications
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040]  on it.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:48.240]  And that everything the U.S. government tells us in early January 2020 is a lie.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.200]  And I quickly put it together and I'm like, holy crap, at EcoTheLiance we are doing all
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.120]  this gain-of-function work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.640]  I actually reviewed the understanding the risk of back coronavirus emergence proposal
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.080]  when I worked at EcoHealth.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.560]  You know, another interesting thing that happened while I worked at EcoHealth was that we actually
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:14.280]  pitched the humanized mouse gain-of-function work to make medical countermeasures, vaccines
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.600]  for lack of a better term, for these coronaviruses to Incutel.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.680]  And Incutel is probably not known by your audience, but that is the venture capital
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.480]  arm of the CIA and Department of Defense to some extent.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]  And I have all these documents.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.280]  I actually just released all these documents on Twitter today.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.880]  If you go to AGHUFF, AGHUFF on Twitter, you can go download all these documents yourself.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.080]  So this was the big gift that I'm giving to everyone.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.120]  I have the original unredacted documents that prove everything I'm saying.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.680]  I mean, a lot of people came on and called me crazy.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.920]  Senator Gary Peters actually his office, he was staffed and I was crazy and I was lying,
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920]  whatever thing.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.000]  But everything I said from day one is proven to be true.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.760]  And through 2020 to 2021, other independent scientists like people from Drastic and around
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.440]  the world are investigating this and they're plugging in missing pieces of the story.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.640]  So when I come forward as a whistleblower in 2021, the US government really clamps down
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]  hard.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640]  I mean, they start hacking into my devices.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640]  They break into my house.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.120]  I find out they're actually working with the Michigan State Police, they taze my dog of
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.120]  all things.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:28.640]  I mean, just insanity and it was really strange for me personally to go from developing and
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.720]  working on these kind of technologies for the US government to then having him used
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720]  against me.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.280]  I mean, I received the Edward Snowden treatment only for telling the truth.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280]  Amazing.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.840]  Stay right there.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.840]  I'm going to come back.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  A lot of people are joining us.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.600]  Minute to minute, I'm going to reintroduce you.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]  This is just incredible.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.680]  I mean, I've been wanting to get you on as a guest and I've been wanting to read the book.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.800]  I know it's just not coming out and I remember all the big things you broke from behind the
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.800]  scenes.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800]  No wonder they came after you.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.560]  Now you're going public.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:05.560]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.440]  is back at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.440]  That's right.

[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.360]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.680]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680]  to do it.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.760]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.

[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:06.360]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.960]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.400]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.240]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.800]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:30.600]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.680]  enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3, and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.520]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.440]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin

[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.720]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.560]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560]  to speak freely.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:36.600]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go from Steve Bannon,
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:51.780]  Steve Bannon, Steve Bannon.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:58.780]  1776, the promo code, the destination is infoworkstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:24.780]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:41.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, this guest is huge. This guest is so important, and he's a very humble person, combat veteran who joined up in September 11th, went on to earn degrees in psychology and security technologies and geographic information systems,
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:54.780]  and the doctor of environmental health science and the emerging infectious diseases, specifically track Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota after graduation. He then continues education at MIT in complex modeling and analysis.
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:21:07.780]  He also worked in research, felt the Department of Homeland Security, Center for Excellence, a senior member of the technical staff at the Sanadena National Laboratories, and as an executive, the vice president at EcoHealth Alliance.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:16.780]  And it just goes on, I'm not going to read the rest of his bio, or we'd burn the whole hour. He's the big whistleblower that was quietly exposing the crematoriums.
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:28.780]  At first said, hey, we got a virus that's out. And then it all dawned on him later, wait, I used to be the vice president just a little bit before at EcoHealth Alliance.
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:40.780]  Obviously a CIA cut out, they're trying to recruit him, hey, we work with the CIA, and all the intel and gathering intel on these so-called virus research labs are really dual use.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:50.780]  And then he begins to expose it, and they come after him. Well, now he's written a book, and now he's going public, and he is taking the world by storm.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:22:04.780]  The truth about Wuhan, I can't wait to get it from the great people at Sky Horse. The truth about Wuhan, how I uncovered the biggest lie in history, Dr. Andrew G. Huff, former EcoHealth Alliance vice president and senior scientist.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:12.780]  So you've given us some background, you're getting up to the harassment point, but just condensing it down, then we'll walk through a lot of the key points in the book.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:20.780]  I've got some talking points here, some questions, just to boil down for people. They've only got five minutes to hear what's happening.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:28.780]  I want to take this out later and post it so they get the big picture, because you really are the insider that can, I think, testify in Congress with Senator Paul.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.780]  I mean, I think you could bring this whole House of Cards down. No wonder they've been harassing you.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:42.780]  You're absolutely right. And the fine thing here is I actually delivered all my documents to the House Intelligence Committee, various members of the Senate.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:52.780]  Attorney Tom Renz and I actually published a report that's all based off my information, my documents, and a recorded deposition that I did under oath with penalty of perjury.
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:58.780]  I've actually released a number of sworn statements as well, so everything I'm telling you is factual.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:11.780]  And I challenge the other side, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Peter Dasek, Dr. Barrick, to go out and testify under oath with penalty of perjury and try to negate the things that I've been saying.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:19.780]  And frankly, they can't do it. Dr. Anthony Fauci all of a sudden has a case of amnesia during those last deposition.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:30.780]  He's telling everyone that, well, I don't really know this Dr. Ralph Barrick guy. I don't know if they got into Dr. Dasek, but I mean, do you know how ridiculous it is that the leader of NIAID,
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:36.780]  the guy who funds all the gain of function work, doesn't know who their best world famous virologist is and he can't remember who he is?
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:44.780]  I mean, this is the insanity of what we're dealing with. And we're really dealing with a big problem in our country. It's the Uniparty.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:52.780]  Democrats and Republicans do not want to touch this. It's toxic. And a big reason why they don't want to do that is, here's another fact.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:24:02.780]  The SARS-CoV-2 agent and the mRNA medical countermeasure, the vaccine as they call it, it's not a vaccine, were co-developed.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:10.780]  That's in the book. It was patented by Ralph Barrick, Moderna and a number other of U.S. government scientists.
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:16.780]  So you have to ask yourself, you know, when the hell is this insanity going to stop? I mean, we have to do something about it.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:23.780]  That's why I wrote the book. And, you know, I realized the side-up that's been going on against the American people is this.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:33.780]  They try to confuse this whole discussion about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID by talking about this detailed minutiae of virology.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:40.780]  So I actually became friends with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. He called me up and it was a really interesting conversation.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:45.780]  He said, you know, I heard that you're from the Alliance. You're working in all these places.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:51.780]  I hear that you're getting harassed by the CIA. My family and I have really interesting history with the CIA.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:56.780]  And it blew my mind. And so he sent me an autographed copy. He was both telling me to read it.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:04.780]  And, you know, he covers everything so well there. I realized they've been bogging everyone down with the detailed technical minutiae of virology.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:09.780]  So nobody can understand it. I mean, people at my level can barely understand a lot of the technical detail.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.780]  It actually takes me some time to read through these virology papers.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:22.780]  So what I do in this book is I break it down in layman terms so that a high school student can understand what has happened here.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:29.780]  And I firmly believe if we can make every American understand and, you know, I'm an educator, I love teaching, I want everyone to be able to understand,
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:35.780]  then we can prevent this from ever happening again. And that's really my goal here.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:42.780]  It's just incredible. And you've got so much courage. But what I get from this at first, you were just trying to be helpful.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:48.780]  And then they came after you and describe some of that harassment for folks that don't know what this is like.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:55.780]  Yeah, it was really strange. I mean, so the first thing that happens is the military-grade quadrocopter drones are hovering around my house.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:01.780]  And I get really freaked out about this. I mean, I live in a remote area and my driveway is a mile long.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.780]  I live in the upper peninsula of Michigan. It's one of the most remote areas of Lower 48.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:09.780]  Everyone, you know, speculates that I moved here to run from the deep state.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:12.780]  And the reality is I'm still connected to a lot of people in the deep state.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.780]  I mean, I worked with these people for a year. Some of them are great scientists.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:19.780]  Not all the bureaucrats are bad. Some are terrible, obviously.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:26.780]  So that starts happening. And, you know, I go to law enforcement. We call up the local Sheriff's Department of State Police.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:32.780]  And they verify seeing all these weird drones out here. People out hunting in my neighbor see all these drones.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:37.780]  And it just continues to escalate. Then I start getting followed by teams of people.
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:45.780]  Where I go, complex tailing operations, 5 to 10 vehicles. And, you know, there's a crazy moment that happens and it's in the book.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:51.780]  I think it's around December 12th is a specific date. The U.S. government hovers a Coast Guard helicopter over my house.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:58.780]  I snap a picture of it and I started laughing because at first I thought maybe I'm like, this is, you know, contractors, you know, hired by the Chinese.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:04.780]  What happens in these situations is that the U.S. government will sometimes work with foreign intelligence agencies to conduct illegal domestic operations.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:09.780]  This is well documented. But no, it's actually the U.S. government doing these things.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:16.780]  And, you know, I started experiencing hacks on my devices. My wife, every, we started experiencing these hacks probably at a rate of every two weeks.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:23.780]  So I'm spending a fair amount of time just trying to keep a computer, you know, a network operational and devices operational.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.780]  They try to delete and wipe all my Equal Health Alliance records, which I just posted on Twitter.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.780]  I saved it for this big moment so I could release those today.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:36.780]  So your audience should go check those out and download those if they want to see the original, the ties to the Rockefeller Foundation, the Google Foundation,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.780]  Welcome Trust. I mean, it's just some really damn stuff.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.780]  Metabiotta, which has ties to Hunter Biden.
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.780]  And please, everybody on radio, tell people your Twitter address.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.780]  A.G. H.U.F.F. A.G. Huff.
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:55.780]  A.G. Huff. There it is. And let's scroll through that and show viewers. This is incredible. Please continue.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:03.780]  So, you know, it continues to escalate. So I finally realized that my only way out of this because I actually really feared for my life.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.780]  I didn't know whether or not they were going to try to put a hit on me.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.780]  It's just hard to know because you can't figure it out. So I'm contacted or approached by a number of people.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:17.780]  Some are probably intelligence assets. Actually, some of them I identify, you know, so I can trace some of this back to the FBI,
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:20.780]  the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:26.780]  I mean, I'll have a little bit soup of agencies they went to and they actually partnered up with the Michigan State Police.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:33.780]  Fast forwarding through the story, that harassment just continued to escalate. They actually backdoored my security system on my house
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.780]  and I figured out how they did it. It was a close system. I put it in after all this harassment started happening.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.780]  They dumped, they did some real petty stuff. They dumped acid in my wood boiler.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.780]  I had a new high efficiency wood boiler installed. They dumped acid in the tank.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.780]  Stay there. This is incredible. And then let's come back and talk about what it is you discovered
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.780]  and how you've reverse engineered what really happened. This is incredible.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:29:18.780]  We've got to get you back again, too. Wow, because we need to really promote this. This is huge. We'll be right back.

[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:09.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:22.780]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:32.780]  Well, we have the former vice president and the head of their operations, Dr. Andrew Huffman.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:41.780]  This is the whistleblower of whistleblowers and so much the intel we got the last two and a half years came from him, but he was behind the scenes and went through incredible harassment now.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:55.780]  He's got a book that is now out. The truth about Wuhan from Sky Horse destined to be a bestseller. How I uncovered the biggest lie in history, Dr. Andrew G Huff, former eco health alliance vice president and senior scientists.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:06.780]  This is the guy that sent the document reports to the Senate committees. This is the guy that got massively harassed for it.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:13.780]  And now he is standing tall, fighting harder than ever. So you were finishing up with the harassment, then let's get into what they don't want us to know.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:20.780]  How you reverse engineered this, working in these labs, what you know they really did and where this is all going, Dr.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.780]  Well, I didn't reverse an engineer anything and that's that's the whole stupidity of this situation.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:30.780]  And this is what the book looks like for the people who want to buy it. Nice and shiny.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:41.780]  You know, and it's sad that it got to this point. So the there are a number of peer reviewed publications that came out recently that look at this from like a Bayesian or statistical approach,
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:53.780]  which say what's the probability of this occurring in nature. And there is no chance as highly improbable as one in the billions that this would this could emerge from nature.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:35:00.780]  Now, if you go back, then you look at some of the other publications that came out over the past year really since, you know, they started clamping down on me.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:08.780]  So the funny part here is if they were to let me come forward a year ago, this story wouldn't have been as big because other scientists who did some great work,
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:21.780]  prove that certain aspects of the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been patented by the likes of Moderna, NIH, and Dr. Ralph Beric.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:28.780]  So think about this. They go out and they surveil and they look at scientists, look at the disease that's circulating the planet.
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:33.780]  Okay, after the emerges, and then they look at the genetics of it using something called BLAST.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:42.780]  And then they find perfect matches to specific sequences that have also been patented back in 2015, 2014.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:51.780]  And that tells you everything right there. It shows that the agent, SARS-CoV-2, and the medical countermeasure, the vaccine were co-developed together.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:58.780]  And that's typically what happens in bio weapons programs. I get that question a lot. So they're like, you know, people ask me, is this a bio weapon?
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:06.780]  Well, not in the traditional sense. So when you want to use a bio weapon, if you're a state-sponsored actor or military, you want to use it to knock out, debilitate your enemy.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:17.780]  And, you know, if this is a bio weapon, it's not a very good one, but it could be used for a new type of asymmetrical warfare, where it could be used to stoke fear, like in terrorism, or economically.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.780]  I don't believe that...
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:22.780]  It could be used as the pretext for lockdowns and the great reset.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:29.780]  Exactly. And why that's so interesting is that, you know, people come to me like, oh, this is all a big part of the master plan.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:37.780]  Well, maybe some people had this as part of their master plan, but I don't think all the players were on board, and that's why they have this event 201.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:49.780]  You know, one thing I talk about in the book is that the epidemiology of this disease is clear. This infectious disease emerged in late August or early September of 2019.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:54.780]  That was months before the US government told everyone what was going on here.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:59.780]  And I didn't do that work. Other scientists did that work, but I went and looked at it. It's excellent.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:06.780]  And it was replicated in other people independently to different studies, which were correlated or validated the other people's work.
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:11.780]  So this is all rock solid scientists that had been done by science, by the global community.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:14.780]  So, you know, a lot of scientists, you know, we weren't all bad, so almost really did the right thing.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:24.780]  So give us the bottom line then. I mean, obviously it was made of a composite, a chimeric virus of a bunch of already patented strains. They've been lying about it.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:31.780]  Senator Paul's on it. He's got your information. What do we need to know about this and where this is going?
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:37.780]  Well, I don't know where it's going. Hopefully, you know, I'm sending, you know, hopefully what happens is we're sending Dr. Anthony Fauci to prison.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:50.780]  Hopefully we send Dr. Ralph Barrett to prison. I hope we send Dr. Dasek to prison, because that's where they all deserve to be. I mean, this is the biggest scam travesty that's ever happened to humanity.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:56.780]  And I can understand why the Chinese government, the Communist Party, the US government tried to cover this up, because it's terrible.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:05.780]  But if you want to have these key people making stupid decisions, one after another, just to fuel their own greed, we wouldn't have millions of deaths around the planet.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:18.780]  We want to have these lockdowns. And the fact that our governments then go along with these globalist type people like the World Economic Foundation, Klaus Schwab, these maniacs, I mean, it's just insane.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:26.780]  The whole premise of our freedoms being restricted and taken away to prevent this disease from spreading was ridiculous.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:34.780]  And this is why I signed the Great Barrington Declaration early on. You know, I actually helped work on some of the national pandemic preparedness plans for different agencies.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:41.780]  And they talked about lockdowns. We actually modeled and simulated these to see when you use them. And actually, it does make sense when they first came on site, we need to lock down for two weeks.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:49.780]  That was actually part of the plan. But when they said we need to lock down for another 30 days, we need to lock down for another 60 days, we need to keep extending these emergency relief acts.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:59.780]  It's all nonsense. And really what they've done is they've created a whole biomedical military industrial complex around this gain of function work, which is nonsense.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:10.780]  And the medical countermeasure of a vaccine that doesn't work. And to explain this to your audience how I've come along and how I evolved, when this first came out, I was pro mRNA jabs.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:17.780]  I said, everyone should go and get this. I trust the government. And then I started to see the histopathology data, the pathology reports coming out.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:22.780]  And then that added with the fact that I read the clinical trial reports of the tests that they conducted.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:30.780]  And it was clear that the jabs were not preventing transmission. In fact, they were causing the new variance to emerge.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:36.780]  The more you jab people, the more variance you get. Then you get to the point where you realize, okay, well, this is having no impact.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:44.780]  It looks like it's having no impact on the burden of disease. And it might actually be hurting people. There's no informed consent.
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:51.780]  So here we are. Our government is still recommending this poison to people. It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:56.780]  And the problem, it's a slippery slope. You go as a scientist like me, I worked for the government for a number of years.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:05.780]  Everyone thinks I'm deep state fine. I'm deep state. But they violated my trust too. And through that process, I now question everything that they tell me.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:18.780]  What can you believe from these people? A simple fact that I like to point out to the naysayers on Twitter about this is that the vast majority of scientific research in medicine and psychology cannot be replicated.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:23.780]  They call it the replication crisis. And there's a reason for that. If it can't be replicated, it's not valid.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:29.780]  But they don't want you to know that the government doesn't pay to replicate studies. And this problem has been going on for years.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.780]  And now they're just pushing this product on people to basically keep a new economy going.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:43.780]  Well, that's right. And we end the last segment with the harassment, with them breaking into your new security system to finish up with the harassment.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.780]  Has the harassment stopped now because it didn't work? Or what's happening?
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:51.780]  Well, yeah. I mean, basically, I beat these guys. I mean, the height of it is I actually got in a gunfight with these guys on my property.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:57.780]  I reported to the Michigan State Police. Nobody showed up. There's witnesses to this. My neighbor is my wife. It was a prolonged engagement.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.780]  That's what we call it in the military. It was an hour long.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.780]  Well, let me describe that story. Tell us about that.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:12.780]  Well, it was simple. So I was sitting in my house, actually, in the room next door. And there was a man hiding in the bushes who was armed operating a small drone around my house.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:19.780]  Well, who cares about the small drone, but I have an armed guy trespassing on my property. So I did what any American would do out in a rural area.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:24.780]  This is a standard ground state. I grabbed my firearms and I went after them. I called the police first. I told them there was an armed trespasser on my property.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:32.780]  When I went after them, they shot at me. Actually, they turned at me with a firearm in his pocket. And that's when I started to shoot at them.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:38.780]  And then they started to return fire back across the swamp. I owned 200 acres in a remote area. You know, the whole thing is...
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:48.780]  Which is a lesson, everybody. You fired back at the real... You know, people say, oh, you've worked for the deep state. Yeah, we should be ready to have defectors back to America who were never bad and wake up and tell the truth.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:56.780]  The key to bringing them down is going to be people like you and Edward Snowden. It's going to be insiders. So when you finally shot back at them, they went away after that.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:03.780]  They ran away and they actually... I had them pinned down so bad, this gentleman deployed what's known as a tactical rescue beacon.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:08.780]  I hadn't seen one of these things in the military. And I laughed. Well, I mean, I'm sort of happy that I had on top of this guy.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:17.780]  But this guy actually deployed something into the sky that made a sonic noise and emitted, I'm guessing, other technology. So rescue vehicles would come to his location.
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.780]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up. The rescue vehicles actually came down to the front of my driveway of a mile-long driveway.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:28.780]  And they were waiting to pick this person up. When I came back, I had my wife call the Sheriff's Department again to find out where the heck they were.
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:40.780]  I reloaded. I went back to the point where I thought this person was escaping. And the Sheriff's Department actually went by my driveway with their sirens on at about 100 miles an hour.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:49.780]  And I couldn't believe it. I mean, I was just shocked. And I did an interview with Majid Nawaz after this shortly happened with my wife, who's a professor at Michigan State University.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.780]  I mean, and she was the first-hand witness to all this.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:58.780]  I hear you just stay there. It's just incredible what they do. They're intimidation backfired.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:30.780]  And you can do that now at infowarstore.com. Help us clear out our stock of bodies tumored.

[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:45.780]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:52.780]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:58.780]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:10.780]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:17.780]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that.
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:30.780]  You know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:39.780]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:44.780]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:49.780]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:53.780]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:58.780]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:07.780]  It's a post COVID world now. Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system. There's a solution. The wellness company.

[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:31.780]  Dr. Andrew Huff, the truth about Wuhan, we're going to take a special hour long commercial free show this Saturday at noon, later about two o'clock or so.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:35.780]  I was going to add a bunch of documents and clips to it, but that'll be out Saturday. We're live right now.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.780]  The book, The Truth About Wuhan, available on Amazon.com, Skyhors Publishing, you name it.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:47.780]  And everything he's saying is document. He was the Vice President of EcoHealth Alliance. He did release all this info that turned out to be very accurate.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:50.780]  And now he's got this book coming out. It's going to be a best seller. Incredible.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:48:03.780]  In the nine, eight, nine and a half minutes we have left here, you go through a lot of stuff in the book here about what were the potential goals of the program, how does it help the global agenda, the gain of function.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:11.780]  As you pointed out earlier, the asinineness of Fauci with two attorney generals, Louisiana and Missouri, within a seven hour deposition.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:17.780]  He doesn't know who his best friends are for 30, 40 years, and the heads of people he runs projects with.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:26.780]  It'd be like Obama saying he doesn't know who Joe Biden is, or Batman saying he doesn't know who Robin is. I mean, this is crazy.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:35.780]  Oh, it's absolutely crazy. But I think it's going to happen here in the near future. I believe and I hope that Congress fully investigates.
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:42.780]  You should question everything that I'm saying. And I like that type of scrutiny. We should be questioning. This is a big deal.
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:52.780]  My allegations, when I said they're inflammatory, it's massive in terms of the type of impact I could have on geopolitical relations.
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:49:02.780]  Go ahead, question everything that I'm saying. But when I'm proven to be right about all these things and I continue to be proven right, we need to hold these people accountable.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:16.780]  This whole idea that we're doing gain of function work where we're enhancing the virulence, the pathogenacity, the infectivity we're making so these diseases can survive longer in the environment than increasing their environmental persistence.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:31.780]  It's nonsense. I mean, to evolve an agent to 150,000 years into the future and then make a vaccine, which isn't a vaccine, the mRNA platform to treat these Frankenstein diseases that we create makes no sense.
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:40.780]  It's a huge waste of taxpayer money. And because we created this massive economy, we have to do something to stop it.
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:49.780]  And otherwise, my fear is this is just going to continue into the future. It's going to be another reason to impress humans around the planet.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:58.780]  Actually, this is a global fight. I mean, this isn't just an American one. The same fight that's happening here, and I think you're showing clips of it earlier, that the same thing is happening in China.
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:08.780]  I mean, people in China are standing up against the Communist Party and what's going on. I mean, the one funny thing here I like to point out to people, and people will think this will just make perfect sense.
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:15.780]  When this disease breaks out in China, do you really believe that the only city that has this disease is Wuhan?
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:21.780]  But the only information that the Chinese government are putting out is, well, we have this contained in Wuhan. We locked down Wuhan. The disease isn't going to spread.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.780]  I mean, that's insane. It's going around the rest of the planet, but Wuhan's the only place.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:35.780]  Well, obviously, they're training people for a global social credit score. The red code, the yellow code, the green code, telling everybody to randomly stay in their house over 100 days.
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:48.780]  That doesn't stop a virus locking you in 130 days in a high rise when the virus only lasts a few weeks or whatever. I mean, it's all so incredibly obvious that it's a giant exercise of power.
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:59.780]  Yes, power and grab for money. If you look at these organizations, the WAF and some of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, even though they're not directly tied in my story, they're all around it.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:16.780]  You're asking, well, what do these people have to gain from what's happening? And they want to create, in my opinion, it feels like they want to create a world that's good for them to live in, where we have to then change the way that we live so they can have their lifestyle.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:28.780]  That's right. At least they'd locked down so they can go out and enjoy themselves. I mean, look at this video of the Pied Piper just came out today in China of one medical tyranny worker leading thousands of people to a camp who came up red code.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.780]  I mean, this is all just an exercise in total control.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:44.780]  Oh, absolutely. And it makes you wonder, could that kind of thing ever happen in the United States? And the worst fear is that kind of thing could become a reality, but it won't as long as people stand up and fight.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:51.780]  And that's what I encourage all of your audience to do. And not just, you know, actually fight. I'm not talking about guns here, but you also have to be politically active.
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:52:07.780]  People would say, well, I'm not going to get a lot of traction with my congressman, who am I, or my senator. But, you know, when they get inundated with letters, phone calls, you show up to rallies, or the places that they're appearing and talking, and you get loud and vocal, they hear you.
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.780]  And they're terrified of not hearing about it.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:21.780]  I totally agree with you. By the way, they should make a Hollywood movie about you, because it's all in record, this happened. And you finally, you know, they brandish a gun, you start shooting at them, they run. And so what, the harassment stopped after you did that?
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:39.780]  Well, a couple of things happened. So I started working with Tom Wrens. Tom Wrens files a billion-dollar lawsuit against these clowns, Equal Health Alliance, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Ralph Barrick. There's a thousand does list. And what that means is we can expand the case out to anyone that is brought in through depositions or testimony.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:47.780]  And that's what we plan to do. We hopefully get to people like Dr. Anthony Fauci and the people behind these people. That's really our goal here.
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:53:01.780]  So when that lawsuit was filed, a couple other things happened. I caught the Michigan State Police trespassing on my property with who I believe to be the FBI. They were pointing what's called a long-range acoustic device at my house, and I caught him red-handed.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:15.780]  But who do I have to call? You know, who's going to investigate the state police and the FBI trespassing on my property, you know, playing loud annoying noises at my house? I mean, you just can't make this stuff up. And how petty the whole thing was.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:20.780]  Well, they did the same thing as the branch of Indians. They were trying to make you crack up.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:29.780]  Yeah, I think so. I mean, the whole funny thing is I actually thought that was part of their playbook. Just by, you know, I'm not a super religious guy, but there's a few times where I prayed my life.
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:39.780]  And one was in combat in Iraq, made out of that alive. And another time was through this craziness. And I came to the conclusion like, maybe they're trying to make me look crazy.
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:52.780]  Just by a twist of fate, the local VA medical center here happened to have my psychologist working there that I saw at the VA when I was a young man, when I had pretty bad PTSD when I first got back from Iraq.
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:54:01.780]  I saw him for a number of years, made great progress. And he had been promoted up to the chief of counseling or psychiatry at my local hospital.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:12.780]  So I gave him a call up. I went down there and saw him. And Dr. Strom asked me, we write a letter saying that I'm not crazy. After I told him this whole story to him, he's like, I believe everything you're saying.
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:22.780]  He wrote me the letter. I've actually posted this to Twitter too, because I've been completely open on this. And then I sent a copy of this letter off to the Michigan State Police and the FBI, along with the loss of being filed.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.780]  And it all stopped.
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:34.780]  Oh, beautiful. You're you're a real hero, brother, and we appreciate you. And it's good people that have been in the government like you, and these private corporate systems coming forward, they're going to stop this.
[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:57.780]  I can't wait till Saturday. We'll take for an hour commercial free. You'll you'll be able to go over all the exhibits. Anything you send us will will will put it up there. Because there's so much your story you haven't had a chance to tell yet here today.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:08.780]  We're going to sell your book. I can't wait to read it. And I can't wait some time for you to come to town. Listen, Joe Rogan's known in 25 years. Good friend of mine. He has a pet peeve, though he doesn't let me recommend a guest to him or anybody else doing it.
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:23.780]  Though I did get Dr. Peter McCullough on and a bunch of other guests. I hooked up with Joe. So I'm going to break my rule. Let me get your number and info to the producer. When this shows over in an hour after take calls, I'm going to call Joe and say you got to get this guy on.

[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:59.780]  I've not even told these stories. People wouldn't believe him. But let's just say one time it didn't go too well for him. But it wasn't with guns though.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:09.780]  But all the power I've got is through God and it all goes to God and God works through you. And there's nobody fighting the tyrants harder than we are.

[01:57:49.780 --> 01:58:01.780]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at infowarstore.com. That's right free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.

[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:26.780]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again. We couldn't afford it before but by moving to a bigger national distributor we're able to do it.

[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:48.780]  But now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life and keep invoices on the air infowarstore.com.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:59:00.780]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:09.780]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:19.780]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:27.780]  But if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:32.780]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:42.780]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload in your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:58.780]  Don't wait, support the infowar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at infowarstore.com.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:06.780]  I want to thank the callers for holding during that hour but that was particularly important and informative.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:12.780]  We're going to bring down the whole new world order operation. Matt in New York, welcome here on the air.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:19.780]  Yeah, what's up Alex. In my opinion none of these people are qualified after this whole COVID debacle.
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:29.780]  And voting for this corrupt system, it makes me feel like a retarded carnival playing a rigged game that no matter how hard I try you just can't win.
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:33.780]  Sure, so what do we do? What do we do then?
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:40.780]  In my opinion, we have to stop feeding the beast, right? We don't stop paying our taxes, we pay our taxes to our own community.
[02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:44.780]  You know what I mean? To an open, transparent fund. What's so hard about that?
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:52.780]  We cut out the military industrial complex, we prevent World War III from happening and we rain peace on earth simply by cutting off these freaking tyrants.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:01:01.780]  They have unlimited funds, they just steal our money. Why can't we have a system open and transparent in all our communities where our taxes go directly into that?
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:07.780]  Could you imagine if we took all that money that they blow on these wars and that go inside all these guys' pockets and we used it at home?
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:15.780]  Could you imagine the utopia that we were living that would spread throughout this whole freaking realm? It would be unbelievable. It's real simple.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:21.780]  If we keep feeding this beast, it's going to eat us. You know what I mean? If we stop feeding the beast, we'll starve it and then we could kill it.
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:27.780]  Well, I agree. We shouldn't support the big globalist corporations. We support local. They don't even need our, quote, tax money.
[02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:36.780]  We do that to keep us down and control little people. They print all the money they want, but yeah, we need to absolutely exit us out of their system.
[02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:44.780]  Without a doubt. Without a doubt. This whole thing, in my opinion, I don't know how anybody could say that this whole COVID thing was anything but a hope.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:51.780]  There's been multiple people that have filed, what is it called, whatever, they filed...
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:58.780]  Sir, here's the deal. I know. Telling local governments to give them the isolated virus. Local governments don't have it. They're clearly creating bio weapons at labs, but you're right.
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:04.780]  It's the shots that really make you sick. I appreciate your call. Mike in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead, Mike.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.780]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing today, brother?
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:08.780]  I'm all right. Talking to you, brother. Still on air. Still above ground.
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.780]  That's right. I love you, brother. Thanks for everything you do.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:25.780]  I just want to start by saying I heard you talking about the t-shirt. What do you call them? Fundraiser shirts that you wear. I think it brainstorming about bringing up.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:31.780]  I think it's time over the past few weeks and even years. I mean, it's just been building in my mind.
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:45.780]  We really need an Owen Schreuer was right or something around the log. Owen has been absolutely killing it. He calls it out. He makes this prediction.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.780]  Absolutely. We'll put on an Owen Schreuer was right shirt.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:52.780]  Oh, you're the man, Alex. It's maybe a war room logo on the back.
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:57.780]  Sure. We need to do it. I need to get the money to actually print the shirts, but you're absolutely right.
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:04.780]  I got every shirt, Alex. With the last blowout sale, I bought everything in my size. I mean, where are you going to get a $5 t-shirt?
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:08.780]  Well, you're the one keeping us on air. But again, $5, we lose money.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:14.780]  Most t-shirts cost us our high quality fabric. Some of them are like $15 apiece. Most are like $6 apiece to make.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:24.780]  But yeah, we need money to even buy a future product. We're always caught in this conundrum. It wasn't for that Bitcoin donation. We'd be off air right now.
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:33.780]  So we're so close, though. And I agree that as soon as we get extra funds, we're going to put out some new shirts because we've given a lot of requests for those.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:39.780]  Yeah. And just to pay homage to Owen, I think he's earned it. He's really put in the work.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:42.780]  I know you said that. Hey, you want to talk about Rand Paul?
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:49.780]  Yeah. Well, the people before covered it, I just want to say I think he's the real deal and I think he's got real skin in the game.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:56.780]  And I think it'd be a great person to get behind. No baggage. None of the, you know, none of the garbage. It's just, you know...
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:02.780]  And the left tried to kill him twice with a shooting attack at the baseball game and the other thug attack and a bunch of other attacks.
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:05.780]  They don't like him. They want him dead.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:12.780]  Exactly. And that's what I mean. Real skin in the game. You know, we need people who understand where it's like to be under attack because quite frankly, we're under attack.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:24.780]  We are. Great points. God bless you. We're going to break for one minute and we're going to go to Baldy and we're going to go to Reagan and we're going to go to Catherine and we're going to go to Robert.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:30.780]  We're going to go to Daniel. We're going to go to Marvin. We're going to go to Carlos. We're going to go to Aaron. We're going to go to John and the order your calls are received.
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:36.780]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Love the calls. Love the angles that you take us in.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:44.780]  But I'll tell you this, there won't be any M4Ware shirts the next few months if folks don't go to M4WareStore.com. Look, I'm lying. I'm dying. I'm in personal bankruptcy.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.780]  I'm out of money. Personal. This place is out of money.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:50.780]  We're going to stay on air, but we need everybody to go to M4WareStore.com right now.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:53.780]  We're right at the edge of the red and black. Right on the edge.

[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:33.780]  We're now into hour number three, taking your phone calls in the order they're received. Baldy in Florida. Thanks for joining us.
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:50.780]  Great, great. So speaking of Owen's story and the war room, the last time you and I talked, you said you wanted to replay my call from January 3rd, 2020, the very first day that President Trump was briefed on the Wuhan virus.
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:07:01.780]  I was the first caller into the war room predicted a false flag pandemic, which would lead to forced vaccines that the vaccines would make everything worse, and that Alex Jones would join the Baldy's.
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:10.780]  But and I have a definite answer to the, to the, to your poll of who we should, who the Liberty movement should support moving forward.
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:20.780]  And I feel there's only one answer in a little further context, when we, when we were talking, it was during the 15 days to slow the spread.
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:26.780]  I got through a couple of times and was begging and pleading for you and your audience to realize that this was the April Fool's virus.
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:43.780]  And, but unfortunately, the biggest fool of them all, President Trump did not wait until April Fool's Day to extend the lockdowns. Instead, extended them way further. And between that, pushing warp speed.
[02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:52.780]  And trust me, no one has lost more family, friends or fortune on this guy. I lost over $50,000 when the election was stolen from him.
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:08:03.780]  I was the firm supporter of him. But, but when, when they de-platformed you and others, he didn't come out in support of free speech. So then he got, he got it in the back.
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:15.780]  So, so, you know, in politics, everything is fair. He lost in his relative to politics fair and square. Tulsi Gabbard, pretty face. I like what she says.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:22.780]  Her, her association with Bernie Sanders and the young leaders. And besides the fact, her resume is not long enough.
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:26.780]  Sure. So I'm asking, we'll put the poll on screen. We have an infowars.com poll going.
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:27.780]  That's right.
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.780]  Who would you support? Let me just tell listeners who just tuned in.
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:35.780]  There's a lot of folks from the radio. They're not watching this on TV, not watching this, you know, be other eyeballs are listening to us.
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:48.780]  Who would you vote for in 2024? GOP primary. Rand Paul gets 26%. Ron DeSantis gets 23%. Donald Trump gets 44%. And Tulsi Gabbard gets 7%.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:54.780]  We just started the polls. Got 2,713 votes on infowars.com. We'll close the poll out tomorrow.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:09:01.780]  We'll have hundreds of thousands of votes. So, so, so what do you think the political combination for victory is? Go ahead.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:12.780]  So, so, so, so far, Baldy has crossed off Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump, and, and Rand Paul, I love him, but, but the polls just overall are a little too soft.
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:17.780]  We got President Trump because Ron Paul got pushed out of the Republican Party.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:20.780]  Okay. So who would you support out of those four? I got to get other callers.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:25.780]  Baldy used to call him from New York. Now he calls him from Florida. Okay. I put my money where my mouth.
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:26.780]  So you like DeSantis?
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.780]  He's the only choice, bro.
[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:33.780]  I got it. Thank you. I love your calls, but we can't do four minutes with you. I got to get to the next caller. Thank you.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.780]  Let's go to Reagan in Idaho. Go ahead.
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:39.780]  Jones, God bless you, brother.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:41.780]  God bless you.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:45.780]  Okay. Give me General Flynn and Rand Paul.
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:48.780]  Oh, that'd be a good ticket. I love General Flynn.
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:52.780]  He's got the brawn and Paul's got the brains. Perfect combo.
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:55.780]  So, so who would be the president? Who would be the vice president?
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:58.780]  Either combo, either one.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:04.780]  Well, because Paul's already been in government, I bet Flynn would defer as long as he was actually in charge of a lot of foreign policy.
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:11.780]  I bet he would be the VP because so, so, so a Paul Flynn ticket. I like that.
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:16.780]  Absolutely. 100%. And I want to say one more thing. There was a question that you posed a while ago when you said,
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:23.780]  why is it that all the moms are instinctively worried about their children and taking them out of the cities and wanting to flee?
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:33.780]  I have to tell you exactly what I did. And it's because the Holy Spirit put it on me and I could not silence it until I left Vegas and moved to Idaho.
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:36.780]  And it's just God's country.
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:39.780]  Absolutely. Anything else you'd like to add, Reagan?
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:43.780]  No, just God bless all of you and one incredible segment. God bless Dr. Huff.
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:46.780]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:49.780]  I want to play a clip here and then go back to your calls.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:55.780]  Dr. Huff was incredible and we're going to do another special commercial free show Saturday with him.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:59.780]  For this broadcast is so special and I'm so blessed to be here.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:03.780]  I'm not a booster of Tulsi Gabbards. I've seen her come a long way. I've seen her leave the Democratic Party.
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:08.780]  I've seen her come out against the wars, the shots, the surveillance, the censorship, all of it.
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:14.780]  And I did discover that a lot of the people they put on the young global leaders thing 20, 30 years ago was made up.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.780]  Fake it till you make it is what Klaus Schwab did.
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:25.780]  So as you responded to this yesterday, here's a clip where she got asked about it and she's saying,
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:28.780]  they just put me on there.
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:36.780]  Well, you know Trudeau, you know Macron, you know the people they control because they actually take orders from and say,
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:40.780]  build back better, great reset, they support the lockdown. She didn't support that.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:46.780]  And I'm not here to boost her. I'm just saying just because Klaus Schwab pushed you on some list of global leaders
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:49.780]  does not mean you're part of the organization. Here it is.
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:56.780]  Luckily, what happened was early, I don't know, maybe in the first or second year that I served in Congress,
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:04.780]  I found out that my picture name had been placed on the World Economic Forum's website under this category.
[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:11.780]  They have listed as young global leaders. And I looked at it and I was like, okay, well they have different people of different political parties
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:17.780]  and from around the world that are on this website. I was never asked to join and I was never informed by them
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:24.780]  that they had put my name and picture on their website and I honestly didn't know that much about it.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:33.780]  But people have said, oh, well, what did you learn by graduating from Klaus Schwab's young global leaders,
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:45.780]  Academy or all this stuff. And it's unfortunate that there's a lot of, I don't know, false assumptions being made, I guess.
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:49.780]  It's an organization. I've never gone to any of their shenanigans. That's a good word.
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:52.780]  I've never gone to any of their events. I didn't graduate from any.
[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:57.780]  I've literally not had anything to do with the World Economic Forum.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:03.780]  Oh, yeah, there you go. I believe when I saw that a year ago, I went and searched everywhere and did not find her anywhere.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:09.780]  But some of the people that were on it, like iPatch, we did.
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:15.780]  And Lord Rothschild and Zuckerberg and Alexander Soros, oh, they're all part of it.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.780]  I looked at her name everywhere, no connection, no speech, nowhere.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:24.780]  Okay, William in California, you're on the year. Thank you so much. Go ahead.
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:26.780]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me, sir?
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.780]  Go ahead.
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:32.780]  Hi, Alex. Man, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, they just have nothing on you, man.
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:37.780]  You knocked it out of the park today is no exception. Hats off to Dr. Haas.
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:43.780]  I just, you know, I have to be sitting on the edge of my seat all the time when I turn you on, man.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:48.780]  Well, the real world's edge of the seat. We're in it together. So what's your take on the situations?
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:58.780]  Well, real quick, I know I keep this into a time frame here. First of all, I'm still a B-12 advocate.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:06.780]  Without it, I wouldn't make it. But, you know, the Braveheart moment here, getting more intense,
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:12.780]  we've got to do something here. And, you know, we're getting fogged over with who we're going to vote for.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:17.780]  I think we need to have world tribunals with the war crimes they've committed so far.
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.780]  You know, we need to address first things first. These people need to be held accountable.
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:26.780]  I agree. And that begins with flooding city councils, health department meetings, PTA meetings, school boards,
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:31.780]  and bringing these subjects up. You're trying to forcibly inject us. You're getting your new lockdowns ready.
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:37.780]  We want you to go to prison. We need to totally scare, legally and lawfully, the minions of a Jinnah 2030,
[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:41.780]  our local governments, that we are not on board with this crap.
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:48.780]  Exactly. I can't, you know, I'm hoping the Texas Rangers, they're not going to, you know, where they, you know,
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:55.780]  they should be standing up, hey, you know, one ranger, one riot, you know, send me in there, swear me in.
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:15:02.780]  You know, I've had enough of this. I've had enough, man. You know, with what they're doing, you know,
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:08.780]  we need to have two or three presidents. We need to have something going on here where we have tribunals.
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:11.780]  And people are...
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.780]  Well, I tell you, Rand Paul's the closest to that.
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:19.780]  In Nuremberg, too, we're going to arrest Fauci, Governor DeSantis coming out saying we're going after the big farm
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:24.780]  of the Acidna vaccine. You've got these whistleblowers. We're on the march, brother. We're fighting back.
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:28.780]  This isn't a one-sided deal. I mean, we're giving as good as we're getting.
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:33.780]  We're kicking and screaming and biting like crocodiles and kicking like mules, brother.
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:39.780]  Thank you, sir. Thank you for everything you do. You know, you make my day, man. You really do.
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:44.780]  You make mine. I love you, brother. Nothing shows me to the bone more than the footage we'll show when we come back, though,
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:52.780]  of the one white-clad biomedical tyrant high priest leading thousands into a slave camp in China.
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.780]  We do not want to be that.
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:16:04.780]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:09.780]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:16.780]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:20.780]  But we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air.
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:28.780]  And you can do that now at infowarstore.com. Help us clear out our stock of bodies, tumor,
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.780]  vitamin C with zinc and alpha-power.
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:38.780]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while they still last.
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:41.780]  Now with free shipping.
[02:16:41.780 --> 02:16:51.780]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and merry Christmas.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:05.780]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:13.780]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex.
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:16.780]  It's not election day, and that's the problem.
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:19.780]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:28.780]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.780]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:35.780]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:41.780]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that,
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:47.780]  and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:53.780]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:56.780]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:18:00.780]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:08.780]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:13.780]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:17.780]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:22.780]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:26.780]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:30.780]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:34.780]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:39.780]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because of your past support.
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:43.780]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now to critical juncture of the battle
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:49.780]  for your double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:56.780]  1776, the promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:18:56.780 --> 02:19:03.780]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company,
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:14.780]  an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:23.780]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:32.780]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID,
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:39.780]  vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:47.780]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:20:12.780]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:17.780]  We're going to ride back to your phone calls, but Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us later in the week.
[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:21.780]  Gay went and gave him a little visit. They haven't, I guess, released a full interview yet.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:27.780]  And I wonder if Gay walked back anything he said on air.
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:30.780]  Well, let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:31.780]  Can we start?
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:36.780]  I think we shall.
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:45.780]  Yay! Nick, we're here. So this is Saturday afternoon, two days after the InfoWars interview,
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:50.780]  and I was just telling you before we started filming that we were watching it at home,
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:55.780]  and Ryan and I were just looking at each other, about every 20 minutes we looked at each other and just go,
[02:20:55.780 --> 02:21:06.780]  Like, this is a big deal. This was an offence. And I think there's a spectrum of reactions, of course,
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:14.780]  and the biggest reaction, the most positive one is it's the craziest, most punk rock thing since the Sex Bistols got kicked off the Bill Grundy show.
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:20.780]  But on the other end of the spectrum, people are saying, this is bad for a presidential campaign, say the least.
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:22.780]  Where do you stand on that spectrum?
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:24.780]  I think it's awesome for a presidential campaign.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:25.780]  Yeah?
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:34.780]  To have someone that's honest, that understands the state of the world, and that's ready to listen to what the American people need.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.780]  But Hitler's got a pretty bad reputation.
[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:42.780]  Well, who made that reputation? That was made by Jewish people.
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:46.780]  Well, the murdering Jews was a pretty big part of his bad reputation.
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:51.780]  Yeah, but some of it's incorrect. Also, the Holocaust is not the only Holocaust.
[02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:58.780]  So for them to take that and claim, we have abortion right now, that's eugenics, that's genocide.
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:02.780]  That's a Holocaust that we're dealing with right now.
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:15.780]  So because Jewish people control the majority of the media, along with banks, along with real estate, along with...
[02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:19.780]  Well, this should be interesting.
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:24.780]  Catherine, in Canada, thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.780]  Hi, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:30.780]  I'm in the fight, you keep me in the fight, thanks for keeping me there, that's where I'm at.
[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:37.780]  Okay, I got some things to say about why I think Ye thinks and says things he does.
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:45.780]  He doesn't understand, quite frankly, he's too rich and famous to understand the different factions that of the New World Order slash like Satanic Cabal.
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:52.780]  Everywhere he looks, he's going to see certain groups, quite frankly, he's not going to see the smaller echelons.
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:56.780]  Well, exactly, he's been inside one Cabal, so he thinks that's everything.
[02:22:56.780 --> 02:23:06.780]  That's exactly what I think. He doesn't understand, like there's the Boulais, there's the Asians, there's Triads, these are all different...
[02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:09.780]  There's the British Empire, there's the Nazi remnant, yeah.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:15.780]  You crystallized it when you were talking about the Tulsi Gabbard clip, how they just put your name on a list,
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:21.780]  and she didn't even know she was on it, and all of a sudden, all these people think she was New World Order.
[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:25.780]  And by the way, I didn't just believe her, I went and did a deep dive and had my crew do it,
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:29.780]  because they would have listed her at their events on their site, she's not on there, it wasn't true.
[02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:36.780]  Well, that's the thing, I think Ye only looks at the surface of things and then doesn't look a little deeper,
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:41.780]  and I think he's just too rich and famous to understand that, and I think that's what's going on with him.
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:46.780]  If he just keeps hearing the same kind of things and what personally is going on with him,
[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:51.780]  he thinks that's the whole world, right? It's a bubble that people can get in if you're
[02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:55.780]  yay or myself or yourself, and I think that's what's going on with him.
[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.780]  Well, I want to be clear, I believe in his First Amendment, believe he has the right to say what he says.
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:01.780]  Does it mean I have to agree with it? He's been sent a piece of text?
[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:08.780]  Yeah, exactly. I don't think anyone agrees with it. I think someone just needs to pop his bubble.
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:13.780]  Unfortunately, everyone needs to hit a rock bottom, and that has to happen to him for him to realize.
[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:14.780]  That's what I think.
[02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:18.780]  Thank you, Katherine, a powerful call. John in Nebraska, you're on the air.
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:23.780]  Yeah, Alex, pros and cons on yay.
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:38.780]  The January 26, 1995 New York Times, Poland lowers Auschwitz death toll from 4 million to 1.5 million.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:43.780]  That right there would mean you have to lower the 6 to 3.5.
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:56.780]  And another point on the same date, January 26, 1891 New York Times, Russia's population of 5 to 6 million Jews,
[02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:02.780]  about 6 million persecuted, miserable wretches.
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:21.780]  If you check, what's his name here? Nick Collestrum, he has 287 headlines from 1850 to 1945 that pair the term 6 with million Jews.
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:32.780]  So that's a yay. That's a pro for yay, in my opinion. A yay negative, you can't go from zero to Hitler in five seconds,
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:38.780]  or you'll lose the listener immediately. Are you there, buddy?
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:43.780]  I'm listening. That's quite the term. You can't go from zero to Hitler. Yeah, I get it.
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:51.780]  Okay, so here's a Hitler pro for yay, Dunkirk. If people take a step back on Dunkirk.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.780]  Sure, Hitler let the British Expeditionary Force leave.
[02:25:54.780 --> 02:26:06.780]  Yes, from May 27 to June 4, 1940, Hitler allows the Brits over 338,000 folks to evacuate.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:13.780]  That was a beach a few hundred yards wide at most and a mile or two in length.
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:18.780]  He could have taken them out a half hour, but he wanted peace, which my next point is,
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:24.780]  do how many people know Hitler made seven peace operas between 1933?
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:30.780]  Albert Spear, that was his Ministry of Interior, and it was Rudolf Hess, his deputy,
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:35.780]  if you're actually parachuted into one of the castles with the peace deal.
[02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:44.780]  Yes, May 10, 1941, he was imprisoned in solitary confinement until he was murdered in 1987.
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:49.780]  So they wanted to shut up Rudolf Hess.
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:53.780]  Now, I honestly know your history. I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:57.780]  Thanks, buddy. Here's my final point, and this is a blockbuster.
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:06.780]  At 7.27 p.m. Central Standard Time this last Sunday, December 4, on America's favorite television program, Yellowstone,
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:12.780]  there's somebody who comes in for the office to do standard causes.
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:17.780]  Her son is the Attorney General, and she starts at 5 o'clock.
[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:20.780]  Hold on. Your phone's breaking up. Shift your phone. I want to hear this.
[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:24.780]  I heard Yellowstone. Get back on your phone. Go ahead.
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:29.780]  It's 7.27 p.m. on Sunday, so next Central.
[02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:33.780]  So next Sunday, they'll rerun it unless they scrub it now.
[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:35.780]  Okay, what happened on the show?
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:39.780]  She unzips her thing, and she says, we had a 6 p.m. appointment.
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:44.780]  And he said, 6 p.m., and she said, yeah, 6 p.m.
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:54.780]  There is the 6 p.m. bed that Hollywood and TV, or TV for 70 years, but Hollywood for 100,
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:58.780]  have put into about a third of the Hollywood films.
[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:06.780]  Now, people have their arguments about why I think it has something to do with Revelation 13.18,
[02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:09.780]  in which it says, here is wisdom, dot, dot, dot.
[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:14.780]  The number of the beast, 6, 6, 6. Kanye's pointing out the evils of Hollywood.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:20.780]  This may well be a clue, and I learned all of this 25 years ago from Steve Quayle
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:22.780]  at a conference in Bozeman, Montana.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:28.780]  Oh, yeah. Let's do this, guys. I'm interviewing Dr. Huff against Saturday at noon.
[02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:34.780]  Can we call Steve Quayle and ask him pretty please to come on at, like, 1.30 Central after we tape that?
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:37.780]  No error, like, 4 o'clock in the afternoon. We tape shows on Saturday.
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:41.780]  We're going to add little extra articles and nuggets and little juicies to it.
[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:45.780]  Those are really popular shows. We've got about 4 million views on average, so we love doing those.
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:47.780]  Thank you for the call, John. Great points.
[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:49.780]  All right. We're going to come back from the break.

[02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:27.780]  People continuing to support infowars, despite the massive law fair being waged against infowars,
[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:32.780]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against infowars,
[02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:38.780]  the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier,
[02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:41.780]  and wiser is what keeps infowars on the air.
[02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:47.780]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:52.780]  So continue to do it. Go to places like infowarsstore.com. Go to places like saveinfowars.

[02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:59.780]  And for more story on now.
[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:04.780]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:10.780]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world.
[02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:15.780]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:17.780]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:24.780]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:30.780]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:34.780]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:40.780]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight,
[02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:44.780]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out, and to intensify them.
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:47.780]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you.
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:53.780]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target, and history is happening.
[02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:58.780]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:05.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:32.780]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:37.780]  Alright, Robert and Thailand and others in Canada, you name it, are up next.
[02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:42.780]  Here on the Alex Jones Show coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting Worldwide.
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:47.780]  But I meant to cover this when it broke last Friday. I didn't get to it, so I want to play it now and just briefly comment.
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:53.780]  If you're an American and you believe in July 4th, the Millerites of Constitution and Declaration of Independence,
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:59.780]  you're not an Anglophile. You're not worshiping the British government, you're not worshiping the British Crown.
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.780]  Plus they're not even British, they're not even German, they're like Transylvanian.
[02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:04.780]  And they're at the heart of the New World Order.
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:09.780]  And you go to a Walgreens, you go to a grocery store, when you're checking out my whole life,
[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:15.780]  it's just nothing but royal family crap, like it's our first family, and it's like we're supposed to worship it.
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:21.780]  And they take away the Brits culture, they don't let it promote any nationalism except the royal family,
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:24.780]  which is running the country to destroy it.
[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:30.780]  So Prince Charles is now King Charles III, and he is on the World Economic Forum and helping captain it.
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:32.780]  He wants to depopulate you.
[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:42.780]  So I love the Celtics player who got questioned when the royal family was there, that, you know, idiot,
[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:51.780]  Prince Ling and his wife, and then the coach also just blow it away because this is a joke.
[02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:54.780]  America is not about worshiping royalty, here it is.
[02:34:56.780 --> 02:34:59.780]  I know you guys have played in front of a lot of celebrities,
[02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:02.780]  but what was it like to compete in front of royalty tonight?
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:05.780]  The Prince and Princess of Wales were in the building.
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:07.780]  It was just a regular game to me.
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:12.780]  Did you get a chance to meet with the royal family?
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:16.780]  And if not, how was it like having them there in the building?
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.780]  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:21.780]  The Prince and Princess of Wales?
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:23.780]  No, I did not.
[02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:25.780]  I'm only familiar with one royal family.
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.780]  I don't know too much about that one.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:29.780]  Thank you.
[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:34.780]  But I'm glad they're hopefully their Celtic fans.
[02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:35.780]  Thank you.
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:41.780]  We're Americans.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.780]  We don't worship these people.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:46.780]  It's disgusting.
[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:49.780]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Thailand.
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:50.780]  You're on the air, Robert.
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:51.780]  Go ahead.
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:55.780]  Sorry, your phone's breaking up.
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:56.780]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:58.780]  Let's go to Marvin in Alabama.
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.780]  Marvin, you're on the air.
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:00.780]  Go ahead.
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:03.780]  Hey, Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:07.780]  So a t-shirt idea real quick is a gay frog conversion therapy
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:08.780]  is not a crime.
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:10.780]  I think you should put that on the website.
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:11.780]  That's a pretty good idea.
[02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:14.780]  Gay frog conversion therapy is not a crime.
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:15.780]  It's not a crime.
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:16.780]  Yeah, I like that one.
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:19.780]  And as far as I know, it's my original idea.
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:20.780]  I've never seen that anywhere.
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:21.780]  It's pretty good.
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:22.780]  I think it's pretty good.
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:23.780]  Yeah.
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:26.780]  So for you, I think a lot of people are kind of missing
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:28.780]  the bigger picture, like the caller a few minutes ago that
[02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:32.780]  said you can't go zero to Hitler in five minutes,
[02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:36.780]  but you can if your goal, your mission is to break the paradigm.
[02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:40.780]  And so I think in a biblical term, we refer to that as
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:41.780]  spiritual warfare.
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:47.780]  But I think a more modern term for that might be paradigm warfare
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:51.780]  where we're in a situation now where it's actually,
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:55.780]  we're being controlled on what we're allowed to think and say,
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:59.780]  even to the point of being forced to actually speak words.
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:03.780]  So with their pronoun obsession, we actually have to speak the
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:05.780]  words that they want us to say.
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.780]  Could a new pronoun be identified as Hitler?
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:12.780]  Oh, you know, as far as I know, their infinite is my
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:14.780]  understanding, although I've never actually...
[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:17.780]  Yeah, folks who identify as Apache attack helicopters.
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:19.780]  So you could identify, you know, but Joe,
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:21.780]  identifies as a pedophile criminal.
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:23.780]  You could identify as baby Hitler.
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:25.780]  I think Nick Pointess does that.
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:28.780]  Yeah, or a gay frog, you know, maybe.
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:30.780]  I'm a gay frog, by the way, I'm not being mean to Nick.
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:32.780]  I'm having some fun with Nick.
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:34.780]  I sat on Crowder, I wanted to debate Nick Pointess,
[02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:36.780]  because, you know, I didn't really...
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:38.780]  I mean, I'm sitting there like, you like Hitler too?
[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:41.780]  Nick's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like really happy about it.
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:44.780]  So I want to have a little bit of a discussion with him about that.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:48.780]  I didn't really take it that way, and that's part of my call,
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:52.780]  is that I think that Ye is leaving clues and, you know,
[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:55.780]  he's supposedly rewriting the Constitution and he's not
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:59.780]  dropping clues that he's rewriting it in a using fascist
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:01.780]  or Nazi tenets.
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:04.780]  He's saying he's using Christian tenets.
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:07.780]  So if he wanted to, he never comes out and says,
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:12.780]  like, I'm a fan of what Hitler, you know, stood for.
[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:14.780]  He's very careful.
[02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:16.780]  No, no, here's my deal.
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:18.780]  Look, I like Kanye West, I'm glad I came on the show.
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:20.780]  I think he has been provocative, free speech,
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:22.780]  so I don't like some of the things he says.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.780]  But it was a litmus test for me to say,
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:26.780]  well, I fail your litmus test.
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:27.780]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:30.780]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air, give me your take on this.
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:35.780]  Well, very briefly, Alex, in my opinion, okay,
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:40.780]  President Trump was elected by the majority of people in America,
[02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:43.780]  bar none, I mean, there's no debate.
[02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:48.780]  He cannot run against the governor of the state of Florida.
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:52.780]  If he's a resident of Florida, that would be president and vice president
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:54.780]  of the same state.
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:57.780]  And I don't know whether that's allowed or not.
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:39:00.780]  But the point I want to make is that President Trump
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.780]  is one of the greatest politicians well-known
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:09.780]  who has already established for himself results.
[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:13.780]  He's one who, when he comes to campaigning,
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:15.780]  is one of the best in history.
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:19.780]  And he's a man who stands tall because self-financed,
[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:22.780]  everybody that tried to bring him down for corruption has failed,
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:24.780]  even at the sexual level,
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:27.780]  well, he dealt with people like Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:32.780]  So, in my opinion, when you want to elect a candidate as an informed elector,
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:38.780]  I think President Trump is the most known politician out there.
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:42.780]  Now, having said that, he had a weakness when he was president.
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:46.780]  You and I have discussed President Trump over the years a lot.
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:49.780]  And he had no team behind him.
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:53.780]  And I don't know whether to this date he has discovered
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:56.780]  that a politician cannot just be elected alone.
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:59.780]  He has to bring a team of people.
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:02.780]  Now, the United States right now is infiltrated,
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:06.780]  long time infiltrated by American Israeli agents.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.780]  Whether they know it or not,
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:14.780]  or whether they serve the interests of America after the interest of Israel,
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.780]  because Israel is important,
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:20.780]  it matters at the level of the institutions of the United States.
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:23.780]  Well, and I agree with you in criticizing Israeli infiltration,
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:27.780]  which does go on, or any other country doing it, is not anti-Jew.
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:32.780]  And so they conflate loving Hitler with not wanting Israeli infiltration.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:33.780]  No, I'm a big critic of that.
[02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:34.780]  Exactly.
[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:35.780]  And not only that,
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:39.780]  if all the people that were in the key institutions of the United States
[02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:42.780]  were Italians and they had an Italian nationality
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:46.780]  or were very involved with Italian politics, et cetera,
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:51.780]  in some instances almost a conflict of interest in investments and so on,
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.780]  then people would say, hey, the United States is being run by the mafia,
[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:56.780]  then you would be anti-mafia,
[02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:59.780]  then you would have the mafia defamation league against you.
[02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:03.780]  I mean, no, no, this is absolutely incorrect.
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:08.780]  The United States is a changing dynamic of social people.
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:11.780]  And what will bring about the corrections that are needed
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:15.780]  is the awareness not to follow harebrained ideas
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:17.780]  like those of the World Economic Forum
[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:20.780]  to rely on the Constitution of the United States,
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:24.780]  which are the best instruments of social order in America.
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:25.780]  I believe that...
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:26.780]  No, no, I agree.
[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:29.780]  The American idea being expressed is so much better
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:31.780]  than the Klaus Schwab New World Order view
[02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:35.780]  that the American ideal cannot be allowed because people will want that.
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:36.780]  But here's the thing.
[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:38.780]  As harebrained as Klaus Schwab is,
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:39.780]  what he wants is being implemented,
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:41.780]  shutting down farms, shutting down production,
[02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:44.780]  destroying factories, killing the economy.
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:45.780]  They're really doing it.
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:48.780]  Thank you, Carlos.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:53.780]  We're going to come back and talk to Mike, Aaron, and others straight ahead.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:55.780]  And I'll host a little bit in the next hour
[02:41:55.780 --> 02:41:58.780]  and hand the baton to our Australian host,
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:41:59.780]  who does a great job.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:00.780]  It's going to be taking over.
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:04.780]  But seriously, what we're doing here is invaluable.
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:08.780]  Your calls, the guests, this whole place, the crew.

[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:13.780]  God keeps me treading water to keep me honest, I guess,
[02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:14.780]  and keep me hungry.
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:18.780]  But we're right on the edge of the red and black.

[02:43:57.780 --> 02:43:58.780]  Look at that.

[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:02.780]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:05.780]  It's been worked out. We didn't do that.
[02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:08.780]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:10.780]  that this is the very best I can get?
[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:12.780]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:15.780]  I will only give you the maximum best info,
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:18.780]  the maximum truth, the maximum product,
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:21.780]  because I want that good will.
[02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:23.780]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:25.780]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:27.780]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:29.780]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:35.780]  And this little jewel right here is solid,
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:40.780]  liquid consciousness.
[02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:41.780]  Look it up.
[02:44:41.780 --> 02:44:45.780]  Find out how even the FDA and the government
[02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:47.780]  admit that fish oil is incredible.
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:50.780]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:52.780]  is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:54.780]  Just like our information is dynamite,
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:57.780]  so are our products in forestore.com.
[02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:00.780]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process,
[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:03.780]  the only thing that made any Republican victories
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:05.780]  tonight possible, the only thing that made
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:08.780]  any resistance to the war machine possible,
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:11.780]  the only thing that made any opposition
[02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:13.780]  to the lockdowns and the mask mandates
[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:16.780]  and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:18.780]  and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:20.780]  that made any resistance to it possible
[02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:23.780]  was people continuing to support info wars,
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:26.780]  despite the massive lawfare being waged against info wars,
[02:45:26.780 --> 02:45:29.780]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[02:45:29.780 --> 02:45:32.780]  against info wars, the ordinary people,
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:34.780]  the everyday people that buy products
[02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:37.780]  that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser
[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:39.780]  is what keeps info wars on the air
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:43.780]  and what that does is keep the populist message alive
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:46.780]  in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:48.780]  So continue to do it.
[02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:50.780]  Go to places like infowarstore.com.
[02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:52.780]  Go to places like save info wars.
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:54.780]  Continue to keep info wars alive
[02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:58.780]  because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:02.780]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:06.780]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases
[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:09.780]  in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:14.780]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:16.780]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:18.780]  or catching a chill that killed people,
[02:46:18.780 --> 02:46:22.780]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:25.780]  You see the sun via your skin
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:28.780]  helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:30.780]  But if you're not getting enough sun,
[02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:32.780]  you will not produce vitamin D3
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:34.780]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:37.780]  and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:39.780]  So now it's more important than ever
[02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:42.780]  because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin D3
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:44.780]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies
[02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:46.780]  with calcium for better upload into your body
[02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:51.780]  for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:54.780]  Don't wait, support the infowar and your immune system
[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:58.780]  with vitamin D3 gummies at infowarstore.com.
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:02.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:05.780]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:14.780]  Everybody knows, my friends, that the elections are stolen.
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:19.780]  Everybody knows the globalists want to be populist.
[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:22.780]  But what do we do about it?
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:24.780]  We stop complying with it.
[02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:26.780]  And we wake up those that actually don't know
[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:29.780]  because the truth is everybody doesn't know
[02:47:29.780 --> 02:47:32.780]  how serious the situation is, what they're starting to
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.780]  and that's why the power structure is so scared.
[02:47:35.780 --> 02:47:37.780]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:40.780]  Aaron and Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:42.780]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:43.780]  Welcome.
[02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:46.780]  I just want to give a quick Bible study to everybody.
[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:49.780]  Jesus wasn't crucified because he was preaching forgiveness.
[02:47:49.780 --> 02:47:52.780]  He was crucified because he called himself God.
[02:47:52.780 --> 02:47:55.780]  He called himself the voice and the burning bush.
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:58.780]  That's why the Pharisees had him crucified.
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:00.780]  And the reason why he was crucified
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:02.780]  is because he was supposed to be crucified.
[02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:05.780]  The Jews did not push for his crucifixion
[02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:08.780]  and nobody here talking on any of these platforms,
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:11.780]  including Yale, would have been forgiven of his sins.
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:13.780]  All right, so let's move on to the next one.
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:15.780]  He said he came willingly as a sacrifice.
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:16.780]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:18.780]  It says in the Bible time and time again
[02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:20.780]  that the word became flesh.
[02:48:20.780 --> 02:48:22.780]  You only understand what the word means to a Jew.
[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:23.780]  That's the Torah.
[02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:26.780]  He was the Torah scroll that became a human
[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:28.780]  to sacrifice himself because why?
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:30.780]  Because God couldn't, because the Pharisees couldn't.
[02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:31.780]  Anyways, let's move on.
[02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:34.780]  We're going to talk about Christ's returning.
[02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:35.780]  Why is Christ returning?
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:38.780]  People have said on this program, not you,
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:41.780]  that he's coming back because things will get bad.
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:42.780]  Things are bad.
[02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:44.780]  Valenciaga is horrible.
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:46.780]  Christ would return like that a long time ago.
[02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:50.780]  He's returning because the Jews are going to admit
[02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:53.780]  their offense that they crucified their king.
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:55.780]  They're going to call upon the name Jesus Christ.
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:57.780]  So that's why he's coming back.
[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:00.780]  You were on Crowder and I listened to it great.
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:01.780]  Good job.
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:03.780]  One of Crowder's guys said basically,
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:06.780]  Christians are very ignorant in this
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:11.780]  because they don't understand that the whole Bible,
[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:15.780]  through the Bible, God has a plan for the Jews.
[02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:17.780]  There's a covenant between the church,
[02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:20.780]  the bride of Christ, and there's a covenant between
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:22.780]  Israel and the Jewish people.
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:26.780]  So let's move on from that.
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:29.780]  We're talking about, yeah, honestly, Alex,
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:31.780]  there's a spiritual battle going on.
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:33.780]  You're right in the middle of the brother and I'm here.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:35.780]  I'm standing with you, man.
[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:38.780]  You were surrounded by wickedness.
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:40.780]  There's a spirit of Antichrist floating around
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:42.780]  and I think Ye embodies that.
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:45.780]  He came onto your program in a black mask.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:48.780]  For two years we've been saying people in masks are villains.
[02:49:48.780 --> 02:49:49.780]  Have we not?
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:51.780]  We've been literally, oh, people in masks.
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:52.780]  Look at Fauci, he's a villain.
[02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:53.780]  He's a mask.
[02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:54.780]  They want to put masks on us.
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:57.780]  The guy comes in a black mask with his hand on the Bible
[02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:00.780]  and he said, I quote, I am a gargoyle for Christ.
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:03.780]  Now, if anybody knows what gargoyle is, come on.
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:05.780]  He's telling us.
[02:50:05.780 --> 02:50:07.780]  And then sometimes you just got to listen to people
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:09.780]  when they're talking.
[02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:11.780]  He's going on every show.
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:14.780]  He's been on a tour with Nick, the wife,
[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:17.780]  Fuentes about how Jews are the problem.
[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:19.780]  And then everybody's like, oh, nobody loves Jews.
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:20.780]  He said it.
[02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:22.780]  That's like a pedophile saying, you like kids?
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:25.780]  Of course he likes kids.
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:26.780]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:27.780]  Who does?
[02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:28.780]  What?
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:30.780]  He's telling us who he is.
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:31.780]  Go back to that.
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:32.780]  I don't follow you there.
[02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:34.780]  Who said something pedophilic?
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:36.780]  Oh, no, sir, I'm saying,
[02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:39.780]  anything he likes Jews while going on a tour
[02:50:39.780 --> 02:50:41.780]  for months about how Jews are the problem
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:44.780]  is like a pedophile saying he likes kids.
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:45.780]  Oh, got it.
[02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:46.780]  Got it.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:47.780]  All right, I hear you.
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:48.780]  Interesting points.
[02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:49.780]  Got to jump to the next person.
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:50.780]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:51.780]  You're on the air.
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:53.780]  Hey, I was going to say, man, like 10 years ago,
[02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:55.780]  we used to do this thing on Google.
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:57.780]  Remember, you throw out like a call sign
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:58.780]  and we all like hashtag it.
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:50:59.780]  Yeah, Google bomb.
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:01.780]  And then it was like, that was like 13, 14 years ago.
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:02.780]  Yeah.
[02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:03.780]  All right.
[02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:04.780]  So Google bombs.
[02:51:04.780 --> 02:51:06.780]  We have control over Twitter now.
[02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:07.780]  Theoretically, right?
[02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:09.780]  So now they're not going to be able to stop that.
[02:51:09.780 --> 02:51:10.780]  We need to do that on Twitter.
[02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:11.780]  A Twitter bomb.
[02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:13.780]  What's your idea of a Twitter bomb?
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:16.780]  We need to probably hot link up videos
[02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:18.780]  from band.video, right?
[02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:20.780]  Or we need a hot link up old articles.
[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:22.780]  I would like to see you guys every single day
[02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:24.780]  push a Twitter bomb in relation
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:26.780]  to like continuity of government,
[02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:28.780]  Department of Homeland Security, FEMA camps,
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:31.780]  something to educate these morons out there
[02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:33.780]  that we're not playing games.
[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:35.780]  People that are coming with us are organized.
[02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:36.780]  They're FBI.
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:37.780]  They're radicalized.
[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:38.780]  They're DOJ.
[02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:40.780]  They are operating under continuity of government.
[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:43.780]  And they are planning to put you in a damn FEMA box
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:44.780]  whether you like or not.
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:45.780]  If you're even allowed to live.
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:48.780]  No, they want to domesticate us, break our will.
[02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:52.780]  And then like Larry Grathwald infiltrated the weathermen.
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:54.780]  And they said they're going to put 50 million people in camps
[02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:56.780]  to kill 25 million.
[02:51:56.780 --> 02:51:58.780]  That's when there was 200 million Americans.
[02:51:58.780 --> 02:51:59.780]  So that's their real plan.
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:01.780]  I just want to say one thing, bro.
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:03.780]  Ever since about the Paul Pelosi story,
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:06.780]  we've been about five steps ahead of mainstream.
[02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:07.780]  Have you noticed that, right?
[02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:09.780]  Like whenever they try to float the Poland story,
[02:52:09.780 --> 02:52:11.780]  when Kazaria supposedly nuked all those goat farmers
[02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:12.780]  and killed them all, right?
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:13.780]  Yeah.
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:15.780]  You know, when Russia did it actually was just,
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:16.780]  it was actually Zelenski, right?
[02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:18.780]  We've been so far ahead of them now
[02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:21.780]  since we've got control of Twitter theoretically
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:23.780]  that if we were able to do Twitter bombs,
[02:52:23.780 --> 02:52:26.780]  if we're able to like really push stories out ahead of them,
[02:52:26.780 --> 02:52:29.780]  and the key is we have to pivot faster than the machine.
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:32.780]  Like, look how, how much time it takes an army
[02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:34.780]  to get to the border, get ready, and then invade, right?
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:36.780]  We're talking about months, talking about weeks.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:39.780]  It takes them that much time to get their narrative
[02:52:39.780 --> 02:52:41.780]  in place of all their stupidity, right?
[02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:44.780]  And so if we can Twitter bomb and pivot to the next one,
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:45.780]  pivot to the next one, pivot to the next one.
[02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:47.780]  So let me do it with hashtags like,
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:49.780]  okay, the hashtag is this.
[02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:51.780]  Yeah, we pushed them further and further back
[02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:53.780]  into your relevancy, right?
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:57.780]  Like just now that idiot John Pierre got up yesterday
[02:52:57.780 --> 02:52:58.780]  and was like, oh, that's old news.
[02:52:58.780 --> 02:53:00.780]  Like, what are you talking about old news, man?
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:01.780]  Come on, dude, get out of here.
[02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:03.780]  Right, Mike, thank you, great points.
[02:53:03.780 --> 02:53:06.780]  Marlo in Vegas, go ahead.
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:08.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:11.780]  I think that we need to step away from all the Hollywood funny
[02:53:11.780 --> 02:53:13.780]  built weirdos just because Kanye West goes around
[02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:15.780]  talking about Jesus as king.
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:17.780]  Royce White said it the best on the Sunday show.
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:20.780]  I think people need to go back and look at that.
[02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:22.780]  Stop thinking in two dimensions.
[02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:24.780]  Just because he says Jesus as king doesn't mean
[02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:25.780]  he's a true Christian.
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:28.780]  Just because Elon Musk says he's fighting for free speech
[02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:31.780]  doesn't mean he's really fighting for a free speech.
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:33.780]  Just because Donald Trump holds up a Bible
[02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:36.780]  outside of a church doesn't mean he's a real Christian.
[02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:38.780]  He's on stage at a Christian university saying
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:41.780]  that he's never asked for forgiveness from God.
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:44.780]  He doesn't involve God in anything like that.
[02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:46.780]  He just goes out and tries to do it himself.
[02:53:46.780 --> 02:53:49.780]  He surrounds himself with Rothschild people.
[02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:51.780]  Wilbur Roth, the Commerce Secretary,
[02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:54.780]  worked for Rothschild Incorporated for two decades.
[02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:57.780]  He has a $2.1 billion art collection,
[02:53:57.780 --> 02:53:59.780]  but this guy is supposed to represent the blue-collar
[02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:00.780]  working class.
[02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:04.780]  And number three, it's not the Jews that are the problem.
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:07.780]  It's the synagogue of Satan that's the problem.
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:10.780]  Those that claim to be Jews but are not.
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:14.780]  And the parable of the vineyard with divine workers,
[02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:18.780]  verse 36, they knew he was the Messiah,
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:21.780]  and they collaborated to kill him
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:25.780]  and seize his inheritance.
[02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:28.780]  And I got an idea about another coin.
[02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:31.780]  I think you should do another coin to save the frogs
[02:54:31.780 --> 02:54:33.780]  with that dope logo on one side
[02:54:33.780 --> 02:54:35.780]  and then your big dome screaming about
[02:54:35.780 --> 02:54:38.780]  you don't want to make the frogs get on the other side.
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:40.780]  You really think so?
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:41.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:43.780]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:45.780]  I'm Jim as many as I can.
[02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:48.780]  Scott in Arizona, go ahead.
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:51.780]  Alex, hey, thanks for having me on.
[02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:54.780]  Been listening since, jeez, late 90s.
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:56.780]  Been watching what you've been doing
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:58.780]  and trying to do my part.
[02:54:58.780 --> 02:55:00.780]  Here's my next attempt.
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:01.780]  My next attempt.
[02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:03.780]  A few things I want to mention.
[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.780]  First of all, by the way, we'd love to hear
[02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:07.780]  a Queen's Rite Revolution calling.
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:10.780]  Maybe some other Queen's Rite on there in your intro.
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:12.780]  I also think we need to quick call them
[02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:13.780]  World Economic Forum.
[02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:15.780]  We need to call them what they really are
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:19.780]  to build in the subliminal.
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:21.780]  They're WF'ers.
[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:24.780]  That's a great one. WF'ers.
[02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:25.780]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:27.780]  They're a bunch of WF'ers.
[02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:30.780]  Here's a couple ideas, though.
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:33.780]  So I get ideas like maybe a t-shirt
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.780]  that might say something like
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:39.780]  COVID 1984 lockdown 2.0.
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:40.780]  Fool me once.
[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:43.780]  Not fool me twice with a question mark.
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:45.780]  Just to kind of get people thinking.
[02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:47.780]  Or maybe some signs.
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:49.780]  Like I've done real estate investing.
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:50.780]  And we put signs out.
[02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:51.780]  Come by my house, right?
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:52.780]  Or whatever.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:53.780]  House for sale.
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:54.780]  You've seen them all over the place
[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:56.780]  in your city that you live in.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:57.780]  A lot of times you'll say,
[02:55:57.780 --> 02:55:59.780]  hey, why don't you go ahead and run with that idea?
[02:55:59.780 --> 02:56:01.780]  But we don't have the platform.
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:02.780]  That's why I think,
[02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:04.780]  and I understand this takes money
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:06.780]  and you're spying on for money now.
[02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:07.780]  If it can happen, though,
[02:56:07.780 --> 02:56:09.780]  I think that setting up
[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:12.780]  an e-commerce platform like Amazon.
[02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:15.780]  They skim 15% off the top of everything,
[02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:17.780]  including shipping fees if you charge it
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:19.780]  as a seller on Amazon.
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:20.780]  You know what?
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:22.780]  An info wars marketplace
[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:24.780]  where someone like my store.
[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:26.780]  Kind of like my store with what
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:28.780]  with what Michael and Del's doing.
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:30.780]  Nobody's going to my store
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:32.780]  like they would go to info wars.
[02:56:32.780 --> 02:56:33.780]  You know?
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:34.780]  I mean, it's just,
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:37.780]  you've got the opportunity
[02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:39.780]  with the audience there to build that.
[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.780]  And the other thing on the side of Amazon
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:42.780]  they do this thing.
[02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:44.780]  You can choose charities.
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:46.780]  You know, you got guys like Soros
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:48.780]  that have thousands of foundations
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:50.780]  and charities and everything.
[02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:52.780]  I think some sort of a charity
[02:56:52.780 --> 02:56:54.780]  since you give to a lot of different things
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:56.780]  in order to promote freedom.
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:58.780]  They have political and other stuff there.
[02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:00.780]  They got faith categories on there.
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:02.780]  I think having a charity
[02:57:02.780 --> 02:57:05.780]  that people every time they go to that beast.
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.780]  No, no, it's just stuff I can organize
[02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:08.780]  to get done, man.
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:10.780]  I'm not really a good organizer
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:11.780]  or a business guy.
[02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:12.780]  But I hear what you're saying.
[02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:14.780]  The key is the people getting excited
[02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:15.780]  and spreading the word.
[02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:16.780]  That's going to change the world.
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:17.780]  Thank you, Scott.
[02:57:17.780 --> 02:57:18.780]  I'm going to do five more minutes
[02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:19.780]  ahead of our guests that I was taking over.
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:21.780]  So Dr. John in Florida,
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:22.780]  Tom and Daniel,
[02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:23.780]  I'm coming right back to you.
[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:24.780]  I'm going right to you.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:25.780]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:26.780]  I want to hear from you.
[02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:27.780]  So please stay there,
[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:29.780]  but be brief so we can get to everybody else.
[02:57:29.780 --> 02:57:31.780]  And then coming up in about an hour
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:32.780]  and two minutes from now,
[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:34.780]  Owen Schreuer in the War Room,
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:35.780]  3 p.m. Central,
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:36.780]  infowars.com,
[02:57:36.780 --> 02:57:38.780]  forward slash show.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:39.780]  A lot of great ideas.
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:40.780]  A lot of amazing calls.
[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:41.780]  Another great show.
[02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:42.780]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:58:11.780]  Stay with us.
[02:58:12.780 --> 02:58:13.780]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:49.780]  Until about 150 years ago,
[02:58:49.780 --> 02:58:52.780]  cultures all over the world believe
[02:58:52.780 --> 02:58:55.780]  that people got sick and died in many cases
[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:58.780]  in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:58:58.780 --> 02:59:01.780]  They associated these poisonous vapors
[02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:03.780]  with cold weather.
[02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:05.780]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather
[02:59:05.780 --> 02:59:07.780]  or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:11.780]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:14.780]  You see, the sun, via your skin,
[02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:17.780]  helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:59:17.780 --> 02:59:19.780]  But if you're not getting enough sun,
[02:59:19.780 --> 02:59:21.780]  you will not produce vitamin D3.
[02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:23.780]  And then it's very easy for viruses
[02:59:23.780 --> 02:59:24.780]  and other things that start replicating
[02:59:24.780 --> 02:59:26.780]  and taking your body over.
[02:59:26.780 --> 02:59:28.780]  So now it's more important than ever,
[02:59:28.780 --> 02:59:29.780]  because the winter's here,
[02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:31.780]  to take high quality vitamin D3.
[02:59:31.780 --> 02:59:33.780]  And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies
[02:59:33.780 --> 02:59:35.780]  with calcium for better upload into your body

[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:51.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:53.780]  of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.780 --> 02:59:56.780]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.780 --> 03:00:03.780]  Folks, I'll be covering this
[03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:05.780]  when I kick off the show at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:09.780]  It's up on infowars.com. The Oxford Mail's reporting.
[03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:11.780]  They're setting up electronic Berlin walls
[03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:13.780]  with your smartphones and your cars.
[03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:15.780]  We're only allowed to travel 15 minutes
[03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:16.780]  without government permission
[03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:18.780]  in a major city in England.
[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:19.780]  Just like China.
[03:00:19.780 --> 03:00:21.780]  It's these damn smartphones.
[03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:23.780]  I got one in my hand. I'm a hypocrite.
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:25.780]  The total control is here.
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:27.780]  They're trying to enforce it right now.
[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:29.780]  That's what COVID was the pretext for.
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:31.780]  Dr. John in Florida, go ahead.
[03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:33.780]  Thanks for coming.
[03:00:33.780 --> 03:00:35.780]  Thank you all for having me on.
[03:00:35.780 --> 03:00:37.780]  I just want to make mention here
[03:00:37.780 --> 03:00:39.780]  that I want to apologize to you personally.
[03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:40.780]  We were supposed to meet personally
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:42.780]  through a mutual acquaintance.
[03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:43.780]  Unfortunately, that didn't happen last year
[03:00:43.780 --> 03:00:45.780]  when I was in Texas.
[03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:46.780]  So I just want to apologize.
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:47.780]  I had a friend of mine, Gilbert,
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:49.780]  who used to come to my church.
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:51.780]  I used to have a church out of a pizza restaurant,
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:53.780]  and I was teaching through the book of the Revelations
[03:00:53.780 --> 03:00:55.780]  and End Times Theology.
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:00:57.780]  And he presented this information that you were doing.
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:59.780]  This is about 15 years ago.
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:01.780]  And I thought you were crazy at the time.
[03:01:01.780 --> 03:01:03.780]  But no, you weren't.
[03:01:03.780 --> 03:01:05.780]  You were ahead of the curve.
[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:07.780]  And again, I want to apologize.
[03:01:07.780 --> 03:01:09.780]  I don't remember that, brother,
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:11.780]  but everything's great.
[03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:13.780]  What else is on your mind?
[03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:15.780]  Well, this is what's on my mind,
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:17.780]  the four people that you're choosing for president.
[03:01:17.780 --> 03:01:19.780]  One, Rand Paul,
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:21.780]  I had a conversation with Dr. David Martin
[03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:23.780]  about a year ago, has been sitting on the information
[03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:25.780]  that Dr. David Martin had given them
[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:27.780]  a year ago.
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:29.780]  And he hasn't presented all that stuff.
[03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:31.780]  I'm a little disappointed in Rand Paul.
[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:33.780]  Two, Ron DeSantis,
[03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:35.780]  he kept South Florida
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:37.780]  locked down for almost a year,
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:39.780]  even though I back in March,
[03:01:39.780 --> 03:01:41.780]  I think it was April and May,
[03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:43.780]  I presented all this information showing that all this stuff
[03:01:43.780 --> 03:01:45.780]  was lies.
[03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:47.780]  The COVID lockdowns were no good.
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:49.780]  No, I don't really know that he didn't do a good job,
[03:01:49.780 --> 03:01:51.780]  but he's doing a better job now.
[03:01:51.780 --> 03:01:53.780]  Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I have to give him credit.
[03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:55.780]  He's gotten on board,
[03:01:55.780 --> 03:01:57.780]  as well as I presented these doctors
[03:01:57.780 --> 03:01:59.780]  from the Sanford Institute,
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:01.780]  like Dr. Barcheri
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:03.780]  and Caldorff, and he did bring them in
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:05.780]  so he can consult with them.
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:07.780]  So I have to give him credit about that.
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:09.780]  But of course, Donald Trump disappointed me
[03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:11.780]  when he started doing the situation
[03:02:11.780 --> 03:02:13.780]  with work speed.
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:15.780]  I knew that was going to be a disaster from the get-go.
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:17.780]  That's before I was listening to you there.
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:19.780]  Sure, so what do you think of Tulsi Gabbers?
[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:21.780]  What you're mentioning is the poll
[03:02:21.780 --> 03:02:23.780]  on Info Wars about who would you like
[03:02:23.780 --> 03:02:25.780]  in the Republican primary.
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:27.780]  No, I problem with Tulsi.
[03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:29.780]  I remember one time saying that
[03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:31.780]  if I was going to vote for a Democrat
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:33.780]  and I used to be a Democrat, I'm an independent.
[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:35.780]  I've been an independent since 2012.
[03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:37.780]  I was going to vote.
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:39.780]  I kind of was going to vote for her,
[03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:41.780]  but she had an issue with voting
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:43.780]  for against Second Amendment things
[03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:45.780]  in Congress when she was there.
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:47.780]  You know, red flag laws
[03:02:47.780 --> 03:02:49.780]  and other situations,
[03:02:49.780 --> 03:02:51.780]  and I don't know if she's reversed her course on that.
[03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:53.780]  Good points. I appreciate your call. God bless you.
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:02:55.780]  Let's go to Tom in California.
[03:02:55.780 --> 03:02:57.780]  Go ahead.
[03:02:57.780 --> 03:02:59.780]  Thanks. Coming out of the last break,
[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:01.780]  you made a great point. We got to get to more people,
[03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:03.780]  the information.
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:05.780]  For instance, my brother thinks Bill Gates is a nerd
[03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:07.780]  that was coming out of a garage.
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:09.780]  You know what I mean? He's a killer.
[03:03:09.780 --> 03:03:11.780]  Yeah.
[03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:13.780]  So this is something for Greg Rees.
[03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:15.780]  Can Greg Rees do something on the nepotism
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:17.780]  of the so-called elites?
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:19.780]  That's a good point.
[03:03:19.780 --> 03:03:21.780]  I was passed down. He needs to make
[03:03:21.780 --> 03:03:23.780]  a bullet point
[03:03:23.780 --> 03:03:25.780]  on who these people are
[03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:27.780]  and who their parents were
[03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:29.780]  so the Normies can understand
[03:03:29.780 --> 03:03:31.780]  what's going on.
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:33.780]  It's a new aristocracy.
[03:03:33.780 --> 03:03:35.780]  That's right. People don't know.
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:37.780]  The Normies do not know who these people are.
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:39.780]  Okay, the other thing,
[03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:41.780]  I mean, you're doing all you can,
[03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:43.780]  but you're preaching to the choir here.
[03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:45.780]  We need silver bullets
[03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:47.780]  to hand over to our family and friends, right?
[03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:49.780]  That's why listeners can take the show,
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:51.780]  clip it up, share it.
[03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:53.780]  This is a great outpost. Other great shows out there as well.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:55.780]  Right.
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:57.780]  And as nasty as some of the Yale interview was,
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:59.780]  God's going to turn that towards good
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:01.780]  reaching a lot of new people.
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:03.780]  They're tuning in here on the truth.
[03:04:03.780 --> 03:04:05.780]  Right. So Greg Rees should do
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:07.780]  a re-support on the nepotism we can use.
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:09.780]  And the other thing is,
[03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:11.780]  I don't think people know enough about
[03:04:11.780 --> 03:04:13.780]  Event 201 and you're great at this.
[03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:15.780]  You know that history, it goes back
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:17.780]  farther than that.
[03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:19.780]  And Operation Lockstep.
[03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:21.780]  Yes, but you and Dr. Boyle
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:23.780]  do a
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:25.780]  10-minute bullet point
[03:04:25.780 --> 03:04:27.780]  on how they had been planned.
[03:04:27.780 --> 03:04:29.780]  All right, brother, your
[03:04:29.780 --> 03:04:31.780]  phone cut out.
[03:04:31.780 --> 03:04:33.780]  Daniel, I'm out of time. Get his name and number.
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:35.780]  If he wants to be on tomorrow, I'll go to him first. We take calls.
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:37.780]  We have a special guest host, Marie Z
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.780]  from Australia.
[03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:41.780]  Z with 3zmedia.com
[03:04:41.780 --> 03:04:43.780]  Everything you see in China,
[03:04:43.780 --> 03:04:45.780]  everything you see there, they mean to bring it here.
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:47.780]  That's why we're all Australian.
[03:04:47.780 --> 03:04:49.780]  We're all Chinese today. She takes over
[03:04:49.780 --> 03:04:51.780]  in T minus 60 seconds.
[03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:53.780]  Please share the links folks. It's how we went. Thank you.
[03:04:57.780 --> 03:04:59.780]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute
[03:04:59.780 --> 03:05:01.780]  pleasure
[03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:03.780]  to introduce to you the wellness company.
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:05.780]  An alternative
[03:05:05.780 --> 03:05:07.780]  healthcare system for this COVID
[03:05:07.780 --> 03:05:09.780]  and post COVID world
[03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:11.780]  where trust has been lost
[03:05:11.780 --> 03:05:13.780]  in doctors and
[03:05:13.780 --> 03:05:15.780]  healthcare systems.
[03:05:15.780 --> 03:05:17.780]  This new online
[03:05:17.780 --> 03:05:19.780]  virtual platform
[03:05:19.780 --> 03:05:21.780]  is nationwide providing
[03:05:21.780 --> 03:05:23.780]  uncensored content, virtual
[03:05:23.780 --> 03:05:25.780]  appointments,
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:27.780]  laboratory testing, diagnostics,
[03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:29.780]  prescriptions,
[03:05:29.780 --> 03:05:31.780]  treatment packages specifically
[03:05:31.780 --> 03:05:33.780]  for COVID, post
[03:05:33.780 --> 03:05:35.780]  COVID, vaccine injury syndromes
[03:05:35.780 --> 03:05:37.780]  and all the usual things
[03:05:37.780 --> 03:05:39.780]  that are seen in primary care.
[03:05:39.780 --> 03:05:41.780]  And then we have
[03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:43.780]  an entire array of holistic products
[03:05:43.780 --> 03:05:45.780]  and online store
[03:05:45.780 --> 03:05:47.780]  media and health
[03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:49.780]  advice. Come see
[03:05:49.780 --> 03:05:51.780]  the wellness company and
[03:05:51.780 --> 03:05:53.780]  go to onlinehealthnow.com
[03:05:53.780 --> 03:05:55.780]  as a conduit
[03:05:55.780 --> 03:05:57.780]  to the wellness company.
[03:06:01.780 --> 03:06:03.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones
[03:06:03.780 --> 03:06:05.780]  show. I'm your guest host Maria Z
[03:06:05.780 --> 03:06:07.780]  from Zmedia.com.
[03:06:07.780 --> 03:06:09.780]  That's Z with 3z.
[03:06:09.780 --> 03:06:11.780]  It is good to be with you all
[03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:13.780]  today. Alex just made a fantastic
[03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:15.780]  point about
[03:06:15.780 --> 03:06:17.780]  some of the smart city
[03:06:17.780 --> 03:06:19.780]  technology that's being implemented around the world.
[03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:21.780]  I'm so glad he did because I'm going to actually
[03:06:21.780 --> 03:06:23.780]  talk about that news today.
[03:06:23.780 --> 03:06:25.780]  With all the news that we hear
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:27.780]  daily coming out that exposes
[03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:29.780]  the agenda, which is
[03:06:29.780 --> 03:06:31.780]  multifaceted in the way
[03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.780]  in which they are waging war
[03:06:33.780 --> 03:06:35.780]  on humanity and it is so
[03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:37.780]  complex. The final
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:39.780]  outcome of the entire agenda
[03:06:39.780 --> 03:06:41.780]  can be forgotten when you look at all of this
[03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:43.780]  news and all of the propaganda.
[03:06:43.780 --> 03:06:45.780]  And what we're going to do today
[03:06:45.780 --> 03:06:47.780]  is actually piece together all of the
[03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:49.780]  pieces of that puzzle
[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.780]  to give you a very high level explanation
[03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:53.780]  of the agenda and the end game.
[03:06:53.780 --> 03:06:55.780]  People often forget
[03:06:55.780 --> 03:06:57.780]  or lose sight of the end game or maybe don't even
[03:06:57.780 --> 03:06:59.780]  know the end game. There are so many people out there
[03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:01.780]  who realize that we live in a crazy world
[03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:03.780]  but they don't understand
[03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:05.780]  why things are happening the way that they are.
[03:07:05.780 --> 03:07:07.780]  And I'm going to
[03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:09.780]  explain that today.
[03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:11.780]  But we're going to start with the most obvious
[03:07:11.780 --> 03:07:13.780]  most blatant
[03:07:13.780 --> 03:07:15.780]  attack in history
[03:07:15.780 --> 03:07:17.780]  and the most recent and that
[03:07:17.780 --> 03:07:19.780]  being COVID. It was the
[03:07:19.780 --> 03:07:21.780]  catalyst for everything that they want to
[03:07:21.780 --> 03:07:23.780]  implement. COVID was what
[03:07:23.780 --> 03:07:25.780]  kicked off the lockdowns
[03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:27.780]  which they want to become
[03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:29.780]  the way of life and I will explain how.
[03:07:29.780 --> 03:07:31.780]  COVID was the
[03:07:31.780 --> 03:07:33.780]  catalyst that kicked off the surveillance
[03:07:33.780 --> 03:07:35.780]  that we see and we have the elites
[03:07:35.780 --> 03:07:37.780]  like Schwab, self-proclaimed elites
[03:07:37.780 --> 03:07:39.780]  might I add.
[03:07:39.780 --> 03:07:41.780]  Schwab saying that
[03:07:41.780 --> 03:07:43.780]  COVID is the thing that showed us
[03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:45.780]  that we need to reimagine our world
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:47.780]  and reshape our future
[03:07:47.780 --> 03:07:49.780]  and you've even got Premiers
[03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:51.780]  here in Australia like Dominic Perotay
[03:07:51.780 --> 03:07:53.780]  in the state of New South Wales using this rhetoric.
[03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:55.780]  People
[03:07:55.780 --> 03:07:57.780]  claimed that it might be unknowingly. I don't think so.
[03:07:59.780 --> 03:08:01.780]  COVID was the catalyst for surveillance
[03:08:01.780 --> 03:08:03.780]  the rise of technocracy and so much
[03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:05.780]  more and it's inching us
[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:07.780]  closer and closer to their vision of transhumanism
[03:08:07.780 --> 03:08:09.780]  for the whole world
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:11.780]  but it's not just
[03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:13.780]  transhumanism that they're seeking
[03:08:13.780 --> 03:08:15.780]  here. It's not just the merging
[03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:17.780]  of humans with AI and it's not
[03:08:17.780 --> 03:08:19.780]  just complete and total control
[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:21.780]  of people. That's not all
[03:08:21.780 --> 03:08:23.780]  that they're seeking.
[03:08:23.780 --> 03:08:25.780]  We have evidence that
[03:08:25.780 --> 03:08:27.780]  COVID is a bioweapon. We know that
[03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:29.780]  the propaganda made
[03:08:29.780 --> 03:08:31.780]  it possible to fool the world
[03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:33.780]  and it is propaganda that will fool
[03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:35.780]  the masses again unless they wake up
[03:08:35.780 --> 03:08:37.780]  perpetually. This
[03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:39.780]  is a perpetual cycle until
[03:08:39.780 --> 03:08:41.780]  the globalists reach
[03:08:41.780 --> 03:08:43.780]  their endgame
[03:08:43.780 --> 03:08:45.780]  and the power of fear can
[03:08:45.780 --> 03:08:47.780]  grip even the strongest of people
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:49.780]  and they know this all too well.
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:51.780]  It's why they keep using it.
[03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:53.780]  It's why they have weaponised
[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:55.780]  words and changed
[03:08:55.780 --> 03:08:57.780]  the meaning of words just like in Orwell's
[03:08:57.780 --> 03:08:59.780]  1984
[03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:01.780]  what a prophetic
[03:09:01.780 --> 03:09:03.780]  prophetic piece of literature
[03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:05.780]  that has become.
[03:09:05.780 --> 03:09:07.780]  If you're living in the spirit of fear
[03:09:07.780 --> 03:09:09.780]  which I know the viewers of this
[03:09:09.780 --> 03:09:11.780]  broadcast and
[03:09:11.780 --> 03:09:13.780]  my viewers are not
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:15.780]  but for those of
[03:09:15.780 --> 03:09:17.780]  the people who are you will not escape
[03:09:17.780 --> 03:09:19.780]  what is coming because that fear will be
[03:09:19.780 --> 03:09:21.780]  weaponised against you again and why
[03:09:21.780 --> 03:09:23.780]  why do they choose
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:25.780]  fear as their weapon?
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:27.780]  Fear has the power
[03:09:27.780 --> 03:09:29.780]  to cripple people
[03:09:29.780 --> 03:09:31.780]  to switch off their ability
[03:09:31.780 --> 03:09:33.780]  to think critically and turn
[03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:35.780]  to others for an answer
[03:09:35.780 --> 03:09:37.780]  but what they're doing simultaneously
[03:09:37.780 --> 03:09:39.780]  while they're positioning themselves as
[03:09:39.780 --> 03:09:41.780]  the people that need to be turned to for an answer
[03:09:41.780 --> 03:09:43.780]  is destabilising
[03:09:43.780 --> 03:09:45.780]  the very government that people look to for
[03:09:45.780 --> 03:09:47.780]  guidance because they're setting the stage
[03:09:47.780 --> 03:09:49.780]  for a one world leader.
[03:09:49.780 --> 03:09:51.780]  If you missed the Alex Jones show
[03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:53.780]  yesterday I
[03:09:53.780 --> 03:09:55.780]  would encourage everyone to go back and watch it
[03:09:55.780 --> 03:09:57.780]  Alex touched on this
[03:09:57.780 --> 03:09:59.780]  it's very very important they
[03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:01.780]  at the same time that they want you
[03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:03.780]  to look to the government for answers
[03:10:03.780 --> 03:10:05.780]  they also want to
[03:10:05.780 --> 03:10:07.780]  destabilise your trust in the government
[03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:09.780]  being able to provide you the answers
[03:10:09.780 --> 03:10:11.780]  this is why when people talk about the
[03:10:11.780 --> 03:10:13.780]  mismanagement of the pandemic that was on purpose
[03:10:13.780 --> 03:10:15.780]  the reason
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:17.780]  why every single
[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:19.780]  country had a different response and now
[03:10:19.780 --> 03:10:21.780]  they're talking about
[03:10:21.780 --> 03:10:23.780]  how
[03:10:23.780 --> 03:10:25.780]  the reason why
[03:10:25.780 --> 03:10:27.780]  it was such a shamosal
[03:10:27.780 --> 03:10:29.780]  was because of the fact that every country did it
[03:10:29.780 --> 03:10:31.780]  differently and this is why we need to sign up
[03:10:31.780 --> 03:10:33.780]  to a treaty and trust the World Health Organization
[03:10:33.780 --> 03:10:35.780]  to have the same approach
[03:10:35.780 --> 03:10:37.780]  next time for the next pandemic
[03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:39.780]  which now all of a sudden a one in a 100 year event
[03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:41.780]  is happening all the time apparently
[03:10:43.780 --> 03:10:45.780]  it was purposely
[03:10:45.780 --> 03:10:47.780]  a mess
[03:10:47.780 --> 03:10:49.780]  so that they can introduce this one government
[03:10:49.780 --> 03:10:51.780]  world leader
[03:10:51.780 --> 03:10:53.780]  approach and they're conditioning the masses
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:55.780]  and they're conditioning the people right now for that
[03:10:55.780 --> 03:10:57.780]  and while we're all standing there
[03:10:57.780 --> 03:10:59.780]  outraged calling for an answer from our government
[03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:01.780]  calling for them to do the right thing
[03:11:01.780 --> 03:11:03.780]  many of them that seem
[03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:05.780]  incompetent or seem to be lacking
[03:11:05.780 --> 03:11:07.780]  in taking action are doing so purposely
[03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:09.780]  because they are playing their part
[03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:11.780]  in this theatre
[03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:13.780]  that is the world stage today
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:17.780]  but I want to get back to COVID
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:19.780]  we have a few catalysts
[03:11:19.780 --> 03:11:21.780]  that introduced
[03:11:21.780 --> 03:11:23.780]  or excuse the introduction of lockdowns
[03:11:23.780 --> 03:11:25.780]  which is the state that they want you to live in forever
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:27.780]  and they are setting this up
[03:11:27.780 --> 03:11:29.780]  right now as we speak
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:31.780]  we'll get into some of those articles
[03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:33.780]  and some footage later on in the broadcast
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:35.780]  but I want to go through a little bit of a timeline here
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:39.780]  we had COVID, we had the propaganda
[03:11:39.780 --> 03:11:41.780]  we had the footage out of China showing people dropping
[03:11:41.780 --> 03:11:43.780]  dead on the streets
[03:11:43.780 --> 03:11:45.780]  and of course people were terrified of this
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:47.780]  and I have not seen anyone drop dead on the streets
[03:11:47.780 --> 03:11:49.780]  if anyone has
[03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:51.780]  I'd love to hear about it
[03:11:51.780 --> 03:11:53.780]  but I don't know anyone in the world who has
[03:11:53.780 --> 03:11:55.780]  that was fake footage
[03:11:55.780 --> 03:11:57.780]  out of China at the time
[03:11:57.780 --> 03:11:59.780]  and of course this is what they used to excuse
[03:11:59.780 --> 03:12:01.780]  the lockdowns
[03:12:01.780 --> 03:12:03.780]  the lockdowns were a conditioning tool
[03:12:03.780 --> 03:12:05.780]  for the coming climate change lockdowns
[03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:07.780]  this is going to be a permanent
[03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:09.780]  state of life
[03:12:09.780 --> 03:12:11.780]  the smart cities that they are implementing
[03:12:11.780 --> 03:12:13.780]  and the rules that they are implementing
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:15.780]  as I just mentioned
[03:12:15.780 --> 03:12:17.780]  not being able to leave
[03:12:17.780 --> 03:12:19.780]  past a 15 minute boundary
[03:12:19.780 --> 03:12:21.780]  if you recall the first time that I came on
[03:12:21.780 --> 03:12:23.780]  Info Wars and hosted the Alex Jones show
[03:12:23.780 --> 03:12:25.780]  I showed you the maps
[03:12:25.780 --> 03:12:27.780]  out of Australia
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:29.780]  that show you where the boundaries are
[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:31.780]  where you're not meant to leave
[03:12:31.780 --> 03:12:33.780]  and they call them districts
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:35.780]  just like the Hunger Games
[03:12:35.780 --> 03:12:37.780]  the people in the capital
[03:12:37.780 --> 03:12:39.780]  determining
[03:12:39.780 --> 03:12:41.780]  where the peasants can and can't go
[03:12:41.780 --> 03:12:43.780]  to their district
[03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:45.780]  and dehumanizing people
[03:12:45.780 --> 03:12:47.780]  so much so to the point where they give
[03:12:47.780 --> 03:12:49.780]  the district a number rather than even a name
[03:12:51.780 --> 03:12:53.780]  and this is where we're heading
[03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:55.780]  and this is what climate change
[03:12:55.780 --> 03:12:57.780]  the climate change agenda is about
[03:12:57.780 --> 03:12:59.780]  it is their new religion
[03:12:59.780 --> 03:13:01.780]  it is going to be weaponized against the people
[03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:03.780]  to control every single
[03:13:03.780 --> 03:13:05.780]  aspect of their lives
[03:13:05.780 --> 03:13:07.780]  but again it's not just about control
[03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:09.780]  and we will get there
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:11.780]  so come the lockdowns
[03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:13.780]  the way out of the lockdowns
[03:13:13.780 --> 03:13:15.780]  that was sold to the people
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:17.780]  the way that we'll get out of the lockdowns
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:19.780]  and the way that we'll go back to normal
[03:13:19.780 --> 03:13:21.780]  is with these vaccines
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:23.780]  that's what we were told
[03:13:23.780 --> 03:13:25.780]  never mind the lies that they were
[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:27.780]  safe and effective and are now
[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:29.780]  killing millions of people
[03:13:29.780 --> 03:13:31.780]  and I might
[03:13:31.780 --> 03:13:33.780]  that might be an understatement I don't know
[03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:35.780]  I don't know because it's so difficult
[03:13:35.780 --> 03:13:37.780]  to get to the truth of the data
[03:13:37.780 --> 03:13:39.780]  because it's so skewed everywhere
[03:13:39.780 --> 03:13:41.780]  they refuse to do autopsies
[03:13:41.780 --> 03:13:43.780]  and they keep changing their data
[03:13:43.780 --> 03:13:45.780]  for example what they're doing on the VAERS system
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:49.780]  but what was the point of the vaccines
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:51.780]  of course
[03:13:51.780 --> 03:13:53.780]  first and foremost you had
[03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:55.780]  the compliance aspect of the vaccines
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:57.780]  do what you're told and then we'll let you
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:13:59.780]  out
[03:13:59.780 --> 03:14:01.780]  do what you're told and you'll have freedom
[03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:05.780]  this was the conditioning tool
[03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:07.780]  coming in the future mark my words
[03:14:07.780 --> 03:14:09.780]  if the masses do not wake up
[03:14:09.780 --> 03:14:11.780]  you will be in a perpetual state
[03:14:11.780 --> 03:14:13.780]  of a digital prison with geofencing
[03:14:13.780 --> 03:14:15.780]  and mass surveillance
[03:14:15.780 --> 03:14:17.780]  everywhere that you go and 15 minutes
[03:14:17.780 --> 03:14:19.780]  will be your boundary
[03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:21.780]  maybe 20 if they're generous
[03:14:21.780 --> 03:14:23.780]  this is why
[03:14:23.780 --> 03:14:25.780]  if you recall in Australia
[03:14:25.780 --> 03:14:27.780]  we were told that even if the grocery
[03:14:27.780 --> 03:14:29.780]  store is more than 5 kilometers
[03:14:29.780 --> 03:14:31.780]  away from your house you can't go
[03:14:31.780 --> 03:14:33.780]  so
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:35.780]  if you don't think
[03:14:35.780 --> 03:14:37.780]  that that was part of future conditioning
[03:14:37.780 --> 03:14:39.780]  like every other PSYOP
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:41.780]  that has happened throughout history
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:43.780]  including false flags
[03:14:43.780 --> 03:14:45.780]  including 9-11
[03:14:45.780 --> 03:14:47.780]  it is all
[03:14:47.780 --> 03:14:49.780]  setting up what is happening in the future
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:53.780]  so not only are the vaccines
[03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:55.780]  injuring people and harming them
[03:14:55.780 --> 03:14:57.780]  we have the questions and they're not vaccines
[03:14:57.780 --> 03:14:59.780]  they're injections I should call them that all the time
[03:14:59.780 --> 03:15:01.780]  but we have the questions
[03:15:01.780 --> 03:15:03.780]  around what is actually happening
[03:15:03.780 --> 03:15:05.780]  inside of people the nanotechnology
[03:15:05.780 --> 03:15:07.780]  and I've conducted so many interviews
[03:15:07.780 --> 03:15:09.780]  my recent interview with Dr David Nixon
[03:15:09.780 --> 03:15:11.780]  is up on band.video go and check it out
[03:15:11.780 --> 03:15:13.780]  Zmedia has a tab in here
[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:17.780]  about the nanotechnology
[03:15:17.780 --> 03:15:19.780]  and essentially what looks like robot arms
[03:15:19.780 --> 03:15:21.780]  compiling this nanotechnology
[03:15:21.780 --> 03:15:23.780]  inside of people which is leading
[03:15:23.780 --> 03:15:25.780]  to that merge of human beings
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:29.780]  with AI in their digital prison
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:31.780]  I don't know if anyone's seen that article
[03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:33.780]  that Forbes wrote some years ago
[03:15:33.780 --> 03:15:35.780]  which talks about those who
[03:15:35.780 --> 03:15:37.780]  the surveillance
[03:15:37.780 --> 03:15:39.780]  became too much for them
[03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:41.780]  and they felt like there was too much of an invasion
[03:15:41.780 --> 03:15:43.780]  of their privacy and so they left the big cities
[03:15:43.780 --> 03:15:45.780]  and I'll talk about that as a potential
[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:47.780]  solution later on
[03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:49.780]  are they setting us up to be captured
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:51.780]  outside
[03:15:51.780 --> 03:15:53.780]  we shall see we'll be right back
[03:15:53.780 --> 03:15:55.780]  after this short break
[03:16:23.780 --> 03:16:25.780]  we'll be right back
[03:16:53.780 --> 03:16:55.780]  gone
[03:17:23.780 --> 03:17:25.780]  this is a game changer
[03:17:25.780 --> 03:17:27.780]  we're so excited about it
[03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:29.780]  our listeners have really asked for free shipping again
[03:17:29.780 --> 03:17:31.780]  we couldn't afford it before

[03:19:53.780 --> 03:20:13.780]  music
[03:20:13.780 --> 03:20:15.780]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[03:20:15.780 --> 03:20:17.780]  I'm your guest host Maria Z
[03:20:17.780 --> 03:20:19.780]  from Zmedia.com
[03:20:19.780 --> 03:20:21.780]  the leader in exposing the new
[03:20:21.780 --> 03:20:23.780]  world coming out of Australia
[03:20:23.780 --> 03:20:25.780]  no one else is doing the work
[03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:27.780]  that we are doing in this country
[03:20:27.780 --> 03:20:29.780]  let me tell you and we have exposed so much
[03:20:29.780 --> 03:20:31.780]  I'm going to go through a couple of our interviews
[03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:33.780]  later on in the broadcast
[03:20:33.780 --> 03:20:35.780]  to show people
[03:20:35.780 --> 03:20:37.780]  what our guests have actually exposed
[03:20:37.780 --> 03:20:39.780]  and let me tell you Australia
[03:20:39.780 --> 03:20:41.780]  being such a compliant country for so long
[03:20:41.780 --> 03:20:43.780]  and having that she'll be right attitude
[03:20:43.780 --> 03:20:45.780]  really for the most part
[03:20:45.780 --> 03:20:47.780]  was not aware of just how deep this agenda goes
[03:20:47.780 --> 03:20:49.780]  but I think COVID has exposed that
[03:20:49.780 --> 03:20:51.780]  to other great people
[03:20:51.780 --> 03:20:53.780]  doing the work of independent media
[03:20:53.780 --> 03:20:55.780]  in this country have exposed that
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:57.780]  and of course we've played a huge role in that
[03:20:57.780 --> 03:20:59.780]  so we're talking about the entire agenda
[03:20:59.780 --> 03:21:01.780]  say in the end game and I'm going to get there
[03:21:01.780 --> 03:21:03.780]  so stay with me here
[03:21:03.780 --> 03:21:05.780]  but going from the vaccines
[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:07.780]  the injections we're now seeing
[03:21:07.780 --> 03:21:09.780]  the introduction of
[03:21:09.780 --> 03:21:11.780]  the digital ID
[03:21:11.780 --> 03:21:13.780]  and a vaccine pass
[03:21:13.780 --> 03:21:15.780]  this was the beginning of this conditioning
[03:21:15.780 --> 03:21:17.780]  was the QR codes
[03:21:17.780 --> 03:21:19.780]  papers
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:21.780]  where we've seen that in history before
[03:21:21.780 --> 03:21:23.780]  and you know every time I'm reminded
[03:21:23.780 --> 03:21:25.780]  of some of the atrocities
[03:21:25.780 --> 03:21:27.780]  that
[03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:29.780]  regular people
[03:21:29.780 --> 03:21:31.780]  complied with and
[03:21:31.780 --> 03:21:33.780]  participated in
[03:21:33.780 --> 03:21:35.780]  as part of this
[03:21:35.780 --> 03:21:37.780]  I never really get sick of hearing it
[03:21:37.780 --> 03:21:39.780]  because I think we all need to be reminded sometimes
[03:21:39.780 --> 03:21:41.780]  I think we need to remember
[03:21:41.780 --> 03:21:43.780]  I mean I'm not talking about living in a
[03:21:43.780 --> 03:21:45.780]  permanent state of PTSD
[03:21:45.780 --> 03:21:47.780]  from what the government did to us
[03:21:47.780 --> 03:21:49.780]  I don't believe people are sitting here
[03:21:49.780 --> 03:21:51.780]  permanently traumatized by it
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:53.780]  because the people that know what's going on
[03:21:53.780 --> 03:21:55.780]  are resilient people and I thank them for that
[03:21:55.780 --> 03:21:57.780]  but it's important to remember
[03:21:57.780 --> 03:21:59.780]  because
[03:21:59.780 --> 03:22:01.780]  it ties into what they're going to do in the future
[03:22:01.780 --> 03:22:03.780]  everything that we went through
[03:22:03.780 --> 03:22:05.780]  was conditioning so the QR codes
[03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:07.780]  show us your papers do this
[03:22:07.780 --> 03:22:09.780]  be
[03:22:09.780 --> 03:22:11.780]  accustomed to surveillance
[03:22:11.780 --> 03:22:13.780]  until that surveillance no longer
[03:22:13.780 --> 03:22:15.780]  requires you to actively
[03:22:15.780 --> 03:22:17.780]  participate in it
[03:22:17.780 --> 03:22:19.780]  now we're just going to make it easy
[03:22:19.780 --> 03:22:21.780]  we're going to improve our surveillance
[03:22:21.780 --> 03:22:23.780]  systems so that you're constantly
[03:22:23.780 --> 03:22:25.780]  being surveilled
[03:22:25.780 --> 03:22:27.780]  and you don't even have to actively
[03:22:27.780 --> 03:22:29.780]  participate in it it's just happening
[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:31.780]  like we see in China this is one of
[03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:33.780]  the reasons why and I just had Dr Li Mengyan
[03:22:33.780 --> 03:22:35.780]  on this week that interview is not up on
[03:22:35.780 --> 03:22:37.780]  Bandog video yet but it is on
[03:22:37.780 --> 03:22:39.780]  zbdeo.com I'll get it up there as soon as possible
[03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:41.780]  where she said
[03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:43.780]  everything that you're telling me
[03:22:43.780 --> 03:22:45.780]  about Australia Maria
[03:22:45.780 --> 03:22:47.780]  these are things that were already set up
[03:22:47.780 --> 03:22:49.780]  in China and that have allowed
[03:22:49.780 --> 03:22:51.780]  for the citizens to be
[03:22:51.780 --> 03:22:53.780]  controlled in this manner to be
[03:22:53.780 --> 03:22:55.780]  locked in their buildings to get used
[03:22:55.780 --> 03:22:57.780]  to having a red code on their phone
[03:22:57.780 --> 03:22:59.780]  that forces them into a quarantine camp
[03:22:59.780 --> 03:23:01.780]  your country is currently setting this up
[03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:03.780]  now and I said I know
[03:23:03.780 --> 03:23:05.780]  and every single country around the world
[03:23:05.780 --> 03:23:07.780]  is doing that we've set up that infrastructure
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:09.780]  and it's ultimately leading
[03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:11.780]  to what they're going
[03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:13.780]  to use as an excuse for
[03:23:13.780 --> 03:23:15.780]  under the guise of climate change
[03:23:15.780 --> 03:23:17.780]  needing you to stay inside your home
[03:23:17.780 --> 03:23:19.780]  giving you these
[03:23:19.780 --> 03:23:21.780]  fences and these borders
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:23.780]  what's essentially geofencing
[03:23:23.780 --> 03:23:25.780]  turning your life into a digital prison
[03:23:25.780 --> 03:23:27.780]  where you aren't allowed
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:29.780]  to
[03:23:29.780 --> 03:23:31.780]  think anything other than
[03:23:31.780 --> 03:23:33.780]  what the government narrative is
[03:23:33.780 --> 03:23:35.780]  because then you're committing thought crimes
[03:23:35.780 --> 03:23:37.780]  and they're manufacturing
[03:23:37.780 --> 03:23:39.780]  this economic crisis
[03:23:39.780 --> 03:23:41.780]  they're manufacturing these food shortages
[03:23:41.780 --> 03:23:43.780]  and they are coming
[03:23:43.780 --> 03:23:45.780]  they've told us to our faces
[03:23:45.780 --> 03:23:47.780]  Antonio Gatera says
[03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:49.780]  2023 food shortages
[03:23:49.780 --> 03:23:51.780]  aren't going to be on the rise
[03:23:51.780 --> 03:23:53.780]  when these maniacs tell us what they're going to do
[03:23:53.780 --> 03:23:55.780]  we should believe them
[03:23:55.780 --> 03:23:57.780]  and we should prepare for it because we know
[03:23:57.780 --> 03:23:59.780]  how evil they are and how capable they are
[03:23:59.780 --> 03:24:01.780]  of committing the worst atrocities
[03:24:01.780 --> 03:24:03.780]  on humanity look at what they've done to us
[03:24:03.780 --> 03:24:05.780]  for two years three years
[03:24:05.780 --> 03:24:07.780]  forget two three years
[03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:09.780]  look at what they've done throughout history
[03:24:09.780 --> 03:24:11.780]  what can you even believe
[03:24:11.780 --> 03:24:13.780]  in history anymore
[03:24:13.780 --> 03:24:15.780]  because they've rewritten the books how many times over
[03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:21.780]  and so the things that they are
[03:24:21.780 --> 03:24:23.780]  setting up now for example the food shortages
[03:24:25.780 --> 03:24:27.780]  imagine next time
[03:24:27.780 --> 03:24:29.780]  having to line up in a government bread line
[03:24:29.780 --> 03:24:31.780]  and the only way to access
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:33.780]  that bread is with your injection
[03:24:33.780 --> 03:24:35.780]  you think that that's beyond them it's not
[03:24:35.780 --> 03:24:37.780]  imagine
[03:24:37.780 --> 03:24:39.780]  going to the supermarket
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:41.780]  and not being able to
[03:24:41.780 --> 03:24:43.780]  I mean just yesterday we had this announcement
[03:24:43.780 --> 03:24:45.780]  of a major chain here one of the
[03:24:45.780 --> 03:24:47.780]  essential services that stayed open
[03:24:47.780 --> 03:24:49.780]  during COVID during the lockdowns
[03:24:49.780 --> 03:24:51.780]  but they're no longer going
[03:24:51.780 --> 03:24:53.780]  to be printing receipts in fact
[03:24:53.780 --> 03:24:55.780]  these receipts will be linked to your banking app
[03:24:57.780 --> 03:24:59.780]  this is Kmart in Australia that's doing it
[03:24:59.780 --> 03:25:01.780]  so what does that do
[03:25:01.780 --> 03:25:03.780]  that means
[03:25:03.780 --> 03:25:05.780]  that your carbon credits
[03:25:05.780 --> 03:25:07.780]  your carbon emissions will be
[03:25:07.780 --> 03:25:09.780]  monitored through your purchases and linked to your bank
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:13.780]  and of course
[03:25:13.780 --> 03:25:15.780]  we've seen major banks announcing that they're going to start
[03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:17.780]  reporting on your carbon emissions
[03:25:19.780 --> 03:25:21.780]  and regularly letting you know what they are
[03:25:21.780 --> 03:25:23.780]  and they've started conditioning the masses
[03:25:23.780 --> 03:25:25.780]  for that inside their phones
[03:25:25.780 --> 03:25:27.780]  so that when they go and make purchases their banking app
[03:25:27.780 --> 03:25:29.780]  gives them a little bit of a notification
[03:25:29.780 --> 03:25:31.780]  that they've exceeded their carbon credits or whatever
[03:25:33.780 --> 03:25:35.780]  again part of the conditioning for the future
[03:25:35.780 --> 03:25:37.780]  where you don't get to go
[03:25:37.780 --> 03:25:39.780]  and see your mum
[03:25:39.780 --> 03:25:41.780]  if you've exceeded your carbon credits
[03:25:43.780 --> 03:25:45.780]  you don't get to go down the street
[03:25:45.780 --> 03:25:47.780]  if you've exceeded your carbon credits
[03:25:47.780 --> 03:25:49.780]  you need to sit home right now
[03:25:49.780 --> 03:25:51.780]  you need to stay home
[03:25:51.780 --> 03:25:53.780]  because you're emitting too much CO2 the gas of life
[03:25:53.780 --> 03:25:55.780]  you can't eat meat
[03:25:55.780 --> 03:25:57.780]  you've eaten too much
[03:25:57.780 --> 03:25:59.780]  you can eat crickets though
[03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:01.780]  they're allowed
[03:26:01.780 --> 03:26:03.780]  they're sustainable
[03:26:03.780 --> 03:26:05.780]  they're good for the environment
[03:26:05.780 --> 03:26:07.780]  and somehow you're going to emit less CO2
[03:26:07.780 --> 03:26:09.780]  when you eat crickets than when you eat meat
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:13.780]  and how many people will fall for this
[03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:15.780]  and even if they don't fall for it
[03:26:15.780 --> 03:26:17.780]  by the time that infrastructure is in place
[03:26:17.780 --> 03:26:19.780]  and it pretty much already is guys
[03:26:19.780 --> 03:26:21.780]  it's too late
[03:26:21.780 --> 03:26:23.780]  and people are sleep walking
[03:26:23.780 --> 03:26:25.780]  into this system
[03:26:25.780 --> 03:26:27.780]  that is a complete digital
[03:26:27.780 --> 03:26:29.780]  imprisonment
[03:26:29.780 --> 03:26:31.780]  and it's being done
[03:26:31.780 --> 03:26:33.780]  through the corporations as well
[03:26:33.780 --> 03:26:35.780]  when you think about and just again
[03:26:35.780 --> 03:26:37.780]  back to my interview with
[03:26:37.780 --> 03:26:39.780]  this senator
[03:26:39.780 --> 03:26:41.780]  Senator Alex Antic he's actually been on this program before
[03:26:41.780 --> 03:26:43.780]  that's being released tonight on Zero Time
[03:26:43.780 --> 03:26:45.780]  again it won't be on band.video straight away
[03:26:45.780 --> 03:26:47.780]  but head to Zmedia.com
[03:26:47.780 --> 03:26:49.780]  and watch it
[03:26:49.780 --> 03:26:51.780]  and talk about the fact that
[03:26:51.780 --> 03:26:53.780]  they've done this through the corporations
[03:26:53.780 --> 03:26:55.780]  so you go to work
[03:26:55.780 --> 03:26:57.780]  and your companies
[03:26:57.780 --> 03:26:59.780]  adopted all of these policies and ESGs
[03:26:59.780 --> 03:27:01.780]  and you know
[03:27:01.780 --> 03:27:03.780]  talking about sustainable development
[03:27:03.780 --> 03:27:05.780]  all the time reducing their carbon footprint
[03:27:05.780 --> 03:27:07.780]  and so people take this attitude home with them
[03:27:07.780 --> 03:27:09.780]  and what they're doing through the destruction
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:11.780]  of small to medium enterprise
[03:27:11.780 --> 03:27:13.780]  is that they're forcing people to go and join
[03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:15.780]  these large corporations because they need money to eat
[03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:17.780]  and then they go and they have to be part
[03:27:17.780 --> 03:27:19.780]  of this system they are
[03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:21.780]  squashing you
[03:27:21.780 --> 03:27:23.780]  with every move that they make
[03:27:23.780 --> 03:27:25.780]  they are restricting you, they're strangling you
[03:27:25.780 --> 03:27:27.780]  from every single angle
[03:27:27.780 --> 03:27:29.780]  and people don't even realize in fact
[03:27:29.780 --> 03:27:31.780]  for the most part the masses are happy to participate
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:33.780]  because
[03:27:33.780 --> 03:27:35.780]  they believe the climate religion
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:37.780]  they believe
[03:27:37.780 --> 03:27:39.780]  in universalism
[03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:41.780]  and I recently spoke about
[03:27:41.780 --> 03:27:43.780]  the fact that they've just launched their new 10 commandments
[03:27:43.780 --> 03:27:45.780]  commandments from Mount Sinai
[03:27:45.780 --> 03:27:47.780]  the 10 climate commandments
[03:27:49.780 --> 03:27:51.780]  and you know what they released an eco-bible
[03:27:51.780 --> 03:27:53.780]  an eco-bible
[03:27:53.780 --> 03:27:55.780]  not an eco-Quran
[03:27:55.780 --> 03:27:57.780]  not an eco-any other book
[03:27:57.780 --> 03:27:59.780]  an eco-bible
[03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:01.780]  which they say they're now selling these programs
[03:28:01.780 --> 03:28:03.780]  at varying prices
[03:28:03.780 --> 03:28:05.780]  20,000 I think is the maximum
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:07.780]  for some posters that you can put up
[03:28:07.780 --> 03:28:09.780]  in your churches
[03:28:09.780 --> 03:28:11.780]  but they're actually talking about how
[03:28:11.780 --> 03:28:13.780]  churches
[03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:15.780]  need to start
[03:28:15.780 --> 03:28:17.780]  preaching this eco-bible
[03:28:17.780 --> 03:28:19.780]  to their congregations
[03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:21.780]  and get Christians involved
[03:28:21.780 --> 03:28:23.780]  in climate change specifically churches
[03:28:23.780 --> 03:28:25.780]  why
[03:28:25.780 --> 03:28:27.780]  why are they doing that and there is
[03:28:27.780 --> 03:28:29.780]  very alarming language in there that suggests
[03:28:29.780 --> 03:28:31.780]  that churches will no longer be
[03:28:31.780 --> 03:28:33.780]  able to preach
[03:28:33.780 --> 03:28:35.780]  other than that
[03:28:35.780 --> 03:28:37.780]  so they shut you down you didn't stand up
[03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:39.780]  for your rights they shut down your religious institutions
[03:28:39.780 --> 03:28:41.780]  you didn't stand up for your faith
[03:28:41.780 --> 03:28:43.780]  and now they're going to tell you that you have to preach
[03:28:43.780 --> 03:28:45.780]  universalism and climate change
[03:28:45.780 --> 03:28:47.780]  and if you don't do it
[03:28:47.780 --> 03:28:49.780]  you'll be shut down again
[03:28:49.780 --> 03:28:51.780]  because you're endangering the planet
[03:28:51.780 --> 03:28:53.780]  we'll be right back with more of this
[03:28:53.780 --> 03:29:13.780]  short break
[03:29:23.780 --> 03:29:25.780]  help us clear out our stock
[03:29:25.780 --> 03:29:27.780]  of bodies tumor
[03:29:27.780 --> 03:29:29.780]  vitamin C with zinc and alpha power
[03:29:29.780 --> 03:29:31.780]  turn those shady federal
[03:29:31.780 --> 03:29:33.780]  reserve notes into the highest
[03:29:33.780 --> 03:29:35.780]  quality supplements available
[03:29:35.780 --> 03:29:37.780]  while they still last
[03:29:37.780 --> 03:29:39.780]  now with free shipping
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:41.780]  we thank you
[03:29:41.780 --> 03:29:43.780]  for your support
[03:29:43.780 --> 03:29:45.780]  and we wish you a very peaceful
[03:29:45.780 --> 03:29:47.780]  happy and merry Christmas
[03:29:47.780 --> 03:29:55.780]  music
[03:29:55.780 --> 03:29:57.780]  December 2022
[03:29:57.780 --> 03:29:59.780]  is here and we are proud
[03:29:59.780 --> 03:30:01.780]  and very excited to announce
[03:30:01.780 --> 03:30:03.780]  that free shipping is back
[03:30:03.780 --> 03:30:05.780]  at infowarstore.com
[03:30:05.780 --> 03:30:07.780]  that's right free shipping on all orders
[03:30:07.780 --> 03:30:09.780]  of $50 or more
[03:30:09.780 --> 03:30:11.780]  but we've signed a new deal with a big
[03:30:11.780 --> 03:30:13.780]  national shipping company
[03:30:13.780 --> 03:30:15.780]  and they're able to cut our regular shipping
[03:30:15.780 --> 03:30:17.780]  costs by up to 50%
[03:30:17.780 --> 03:30:19.780]  so that means even on orders
[03:30:19.780 --> 03:30:21.780]  that are below $50 you're going to be paying
[03:30:21.780 --> 03:30:23.780]  way lower than you were previously
[03:30:23.780 --> 03:30:25.780]  this is a game changer
[03:30:25.780 --> 03:30:27.780]  we're so excited about it
[03:30:27.780 --> 03:30:29.780]  our listeners have really asked for free shipping again
[03:30:29.780 --> 03:30:31.780]  we couldn't afford it before
[03:30:31.780 --> 03:30:33.780]  but by moving to a bigger national distributor
[03:30:33.780 --> 03:30:35.780]  we're able to do it so now
[03:30:35.780 --> 03:30:37.780]  your orders will be shipped even faster
[03:30:37.780 --> 03:30:39.780]  the same great customer service and more
[03:30:39.780 --> 03:30:41.780]  so get huge discounts
[03:30:41.780 --> 03:30:43.780]  and free shipping on so many great items
[03:30:43.780 --> 03:30:45.780]  at infowarstore.com
[03:30:45.780 --> 03:30:47.780]  right now I want to thank you all for your support
[03:30:47.780 --> 03:30:49.780]  but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:51.780]  lead a healthier life
[03:30:51.780 --> 03:30:53.780]  and keep info wars on the air
[03:30:53.780 --> 03:30:55.780]  infowarstore.com
[03:30:55.780 --> 03:30:57.780]  once a tragedy reaches
[03:30:57.780 --> 03:30:59.780]  a level of national significance
[03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:01.780]  American citizens
[03:31:01.780 --> 03:31:03.780]  should be allowed to basically
[03:31:03.780 --> 03:31:05.780]  question that event
[03:31:05.780 --> 03:31:07.780]  in any way that they deemed fit
[03:31:07.780 --> 03:31:09.780]  the first amendment is unique in the world
[03:31:09.780 --> 03:31:11.780]  that's what they want to take away
[03:31:11.780 --> 03:31:13.780]  and speak freely
[03:31:13.780 --> 03:31:15.780]  so they're going to go from Mike Lindell next
[03:31:15.780 --> 03:31:17.780]  or are they going to go for Steve Bannon
[03:31:17.780 --> 03:31:19.780]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson
[03:31:19.780 --> 03:31:21.780]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago
[03:31:21.780 --> 03:31:23.780]  but on air 28 years
[03:31:23.780 --> 03:31:25.780]  and I knew they were planning all of this
[03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:27.780]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere
[03:31:27.780 --> 03:31:29.780]  but I couldn't have done it without your support
[03:31:29.780 --> 03:31:31.780]  and now because we've been so successful
[03:31:31.780 --> 03:31:33.780]  warning the population of the planet
[03:31:33.780 --> 03:31:35.780]  not just America, we're public enemy number one
[03:31:35.780 --> 03:31:37.780]  when it comes to the globalist agenda
[03:31:37.780 --> 03:31:39.780]  that's why it's more important than ever
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:41.780]  to salute you and I thank you
[03:31:41.780 --> 03:31:43.780]  and I ask you now to critical juncture of the battle

[03:32:09.780 --> 03:32:11.780]  but we've signed a new deal

[03:32:55.780 --> 03:33:05.780]  Welcome back
[03:33:05.780 --> 03:33:07.780]  we're talking about the end game
[03:33:07.780 --> 03:33:09.780]  of the agenda
[03:33:09.780 --> 03:33:11.780]  starting with the COVID
[03:33:11.780 --> 03:33:13.780]  nonsense
[03:33:13.780 --> 03:33:15.780]  leading to lockdowns
[03:33:15.780 --> 03:33:17.780]  leading to vaccines
[03:33:17.780 --> 03:33:19.780]  leading to the ID
[03:33:19.780 --> 03:33:21.780]  digital ID
[03:33:21.780 --> 03:33:23.780]  which started off as the QR codes
[03:33:23.780 --> 03:33:25.780]  leading to the climate change
[03:33:25.780 --> 03:33:27.780]  agenda
[03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:29.780]  and now we're circling back to the lockdowns
[03:33:29.780 --> 03:33:31.780]  because that's where we're going
[03:33:31.780 --> 03:33:33.780]  I really love the team to queue up the video
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:35.780]  Smart Cities
[03:33:35.780 --> 03:33:37.780]  this has just come out of
[03:33:37.780 --> 03:33:39.780]  the State of Victoria
[03:33:39.780 --> 03:33:41.780]  talking about these 20 minute neighbourhoods
[03:33:41.780 --> 03:33:43.780]  and I really want to play this for everyone
[03:33:43.780 --> 03:33:45.780]  I've played footage on here before
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:47.780]  about Smart Cities
[03:33:47.780 --> 03:33:49.780]  but this one really takes the cake
[03:33:49.780 --> 03:33:51.780]  I hope the team have it ready now
[03:33:51.780 --> 03:33:53.780]  to improve livability
[03:33:53.780 --> 03:33:55.780]  the Victorian Government
[03:33:55.780 --> 03:33:57.780]  is working to create a city
[03:33:57.780 --> 03:33:59.780]  of 20 minute neighbourhoods
[03:33:59.780 --> 03:34:01.780]  it's all about creating
[03:34:01.780 --> 03:34:03.780]  walkable neighbourhoods
[03:34:03.780 --> 03:34:05.780]  where people can live locally
[03:34:05.780 --> 03:34:07.780]  places where communities can
[03:34:07.780 --> 03:34:09.780]  access most of their daily needs
[03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:11.780]  within a 20 minute return walk from home
[03:34:13.780 --> 03:34:15.780]  these places should have
[03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:17.780]  diverse housing options and access to
[03:34:17.780 --> 03:34:19.780]  recycling routes and local public transport
[03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:23.780]  local health facilities, parks, shops
[03:34:23.780 --> 03:34:25.780]  and other local infrastructure
[03:34:25.780 --> 03:34:27.780]  we are already working with local
[03:34:27.780 --> 03:34:29.780]  government, communities and industry
[03:34:29.780 --> 03:34:31.780]  to deliver projects
[03:34:31.780 --> 03:34:33.780]  and are committed to building a livable city
[03:34:33.780 --> 03:34:35.780]  of 20 minute neighbourhoods
[03:34:35.780 --> 03:34:37.780]  to find out more visit the
[03:34:37.780 --> 03:34:39.780]  Plan Melbourne website
[03:34:43.780 --> 03:34:45.780]  as you can see that agenda
[03:34:45.780 --> 03:34:47.780]  from 2017 to 2050
[03:34:47.780 --> 03:34:49.780]  but dare I say they will be accelerating
[03:34:49.780 --> 03:34:51.780]  that much sooner than 2050
[03:34:51.780 --> 03:34:53.780]  they want you in this digital prison
[03:34:53.780 --> 03:34:55.780]  what you're seeing on your screen right now
[03:34:55.780 --> 03:34:57.780]  is a climate lockdown trial
[03:34:57.780 --> 03:34:59.780]  that's supposed to begin in 2024
[03:34:59.780 --> 03:35:01.780]  let me explain that
[03:35:01.780 --> 03:35:03.780]  Canterbury City Council
[03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:05.780]  is another one that's doing this
[03:35:05.780 --> 03:35:07.780]  but this article pertains to Oxford Shire
[03:35:07.780 --> 03:35:09.780]  Council
[03:35:09.780 --> 03:35:11.780]  which has proposed
[03:35:11.780 --> 03:35:13.780]  to trial six new
[03:35:13.780 --> 03:35:15.780]  traffic filters
[03:35:15.780 --> 03:35:17.780]  in the city of Oxford
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:19.780]  or the council of Oxford I should say
[03:35:19.780 --> 03:35:21.780]  and what these traffic filters are
[03:35:21.780 --> 03:35:23.780]  the trial has actually
[03:35:23.780 --> 03:35:25.780]  started on the 5th of September
[03:35:25.780 --> 03:35:27.780]  and they are supposed to
[03:35:27.780 --> 03:35:29.780]  well under the guise of reducing traffic
[03:35:29.780 --> 03:35:31.780]  as you can see some of the
[03:35:31.780 --> 03:35:33.780]  sales pitch words that have been
[03:35:33.780 --> 03:35:35.780]  used in that Victorian video
[03:35:35.780 --> 03:35:37.780]  improve livability
[03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:39.780]  because we need that now right
[03:35:39.780 --> 03:35:41.780]  the cities we live in are not livable right now
[03:35:41.780 --> 03:35:43.780]  the
[03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:45.780]  rural areas that they're
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:47.780]  flooding are not livable right now
[03:35:47.780 --> 03:35:49.780]  and spraying
[03:35:49.780 --> 03:35:51.780]  our skies daily so that we just
[03:35:51.780 --> 03:35:53.780]  destroy all these rural
[03:35:53.780 --> 03:35:55.780]  areas destroy the farming
[03:35:55.780 --> 03:35:57.780]  to push us into these livable cities
[03:35:57.780 --> 03:35:59.780]  these aren't livable right now well they're not livable
[03:35:59.780 --> 03:36:01.780]  when you keep spraying us
[03:36:01.780 --> 03:36:03.780]  like ants
[03:36:03.780 --> 03:36:05.780]  and I'm frustrated
[03:36:05.780 --> 03:36:07.780]  because for those who don't know
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:09.780]  Australia is meant to be
[03:36:09.780 --> 03:36:11.780]  forging hot in the summer
[03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:13.780]  we are having 14 degree
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:15.780]  Celsius days
[03:36:15.780 --> 03:36:17.780]  this is not normal
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:19.780]  we've got global warming right
[03:36:19.780 --> 03:36:21.780]  global warming guys 14
[03:36:21.780 --> 03:36:23.780]  degrees summer days because of La Nina
[03:36:23.780 --> 03:36:25.780]  and I've had
[03:36:25.780 --> 03:36:27.780]  geoengineering experts on to prove that
[03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:29.780]  that is actually man made
[03:36:29.780 --> 03:36:31.780]  completely manufactured weather but
[03:36:31.780 --> 03:36:33.780]  back to these live
[03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:35.780]  locally sales pitch of these smart cities
[03:36:35.780 --> 03:36:37.780]  what does live locally
[03:36:37.780 --> 03:36:39.780]  mean
[03:36:39.780 --> 03:36:41.780]  and people will listen to that
[03:36:41.780 --> 03:36:43.780]  who trust the government propaganda and think oh yes
[03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:45.780]  it would be good to live locally
[03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:47.780]  you already live locally
[03:36:47.780 --> 03:36:49.780]  your neighbourhood
[03:36:49.780 --> 03:36:51.780]  is local to you
[03:36:51.780 --> 03:36:53.780]  you likely have a local shopping centre
[03:36:53.780 --> 03:36:55.780]  you likely have a local
[03:36:55.780 --> 03:36:57.780]  grocer
[03:36:57.780 --> 03:36:59.780]  you already live locally
[03:36:59.780 --> 03:37:01.780]  what a stupid catchphrase
[03:37:01.780 --> 03:37:03.780]  but I guarantee you
[03:37:03.780 --> 03:37:05.780]  we'll hear this again
[03:37:05.780 --> 03:37:07.780]  talking about living locally again
[03:37:07.780 --> 03:37:09.780]  so this proposal
[03:37:09.780 --> 03:37:11.780]  for these six new traffic filters
[03:37:11.780 --> 03:37:13.780]  basically imposes fines on people
[03:37:13.780 --> 03:37:15.780]  if they go outside
[03:37:15.780 --> 03:37:17.780]  of these geo
[03:37:17.780 --> 03:37:19.780]  fencing borders
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:21.780]  that have been implemented we've also got
[03:37:21.780 --> 03:37:23.780]  the Canterbury City Council
[03:37:23.780 --> 03:37:25.780]  I just found this out yesterday
[03:37:25.780 --> 03:37:27.780]  Canterbury City Council in the UK
[03:37:27.780 --> 03:37:29.780]  they are actually
[03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:31.780]  intending to divide
[03:37:31.780 --> 03:37:33.780]  the Cathedral City into five zones
[03:37:33.780 --> 03:37:35.780]  and fine
[03:37:35.780 --> 03:37:37.780]  drivers to move between each area
[03:37:37.780 --> 03:37:39.780]  so they sell this to you as oh we're creating
[03:37:39.780 --> 03:37:41.780]  all these liveable cities
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:43.780]  local living
[03:37:43.780 --> 03:37:45.780]  locally
[03:37:45.780 --> 03:37:47.780]  for your convenience but meanwhile
[03:37:47.780 --> 03:37:49.780]  you're going to be fined to travel
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:51.780]  outside of that
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:53.780]  and they started this conditioning
[03:37:53.780 --> 03:37:55.780]  with toll roads with paying to drive
[03:37:55.780 --> 03:37:57.780]  on freeways privatising the roads
[03:37:57.780 --> 03:37:59.780]  they got you used to
[03:37:59.780 --> 03:38:01.780]  the idea of paying
[03:38:01.780 --> 03:38:03.780]  to leave your home
[03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:05.780]  and they're doing it now in New South Wales
[03:38:05.780 --> 03:38:07.780]  in the state of New South Wales
[03:38:07.780 --> 03:38:09.780]  they're talking about paying per kilometre
[03:38:09.780 --> 03:38:11.780]  they've discussed this in the state of Victoria here as well
[03:38:11.780 --> 03:38:13.780]  paying per every kilometre
[03:38:13.780 --> 03:38:15.780]  that you travel
[03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:17.780]  this is a
[03:38:17.780 --> 03:38:19.780]  it's a prison that's being set up
[03:38:19.780 --> 03:38:21.780]  I really want the team to pull up
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:23.780]  some highlights out of the interview that I did
[03:38:23.780 --> 03:38:25.780]  with Amman Jarbi
[03:38:25.780 --> 03:38:27.780]  this has been shared on technocracynews.com
[03:38:27.780 --> 03:38:29.780]  Silicon Valley whistleblower
[03:38:29.780 --> 03:38:31.780]  smart cities worldwide are being converted
[03:38:31.780 --> 03:38:33.780]  into open concentration camps
[03:38:33.780 --> 03:38:35.780]  Dr. McCollough
[03:38:35.780 --> 03:38:37.780]  has also shared the article as well
[03:38:37.780 --> 03:38:39.780]  saying that an invisible prison
[03:38:39.780 --> 03:38:41.780]  has been built just for you
[03:38:41.780 --> 03:38:43.780]  let's play that clip of Amman Jarbi
[03:38:43.780 --> 03:38:45.780]  and hear what he has to say
[03:38:45.780 --> 03:38:47.780]  did you just say mapping digital
[03:38:47.780 --> 03:38:49.780]  IDs to trees
[03:38:49.780 --> 03:38:51.780]  yeah every tree and plant
[03:38:51.780 --> 03:38:53.780]  all of nature is going to be mapped digitally
[03:38:53.780 --> 03:38:55.780]  and eventually we'll be
[03:38:55.780 --> 03:38:57.780]  getting pushed into the metaverse
[03:38:57.780 --> 03:38:59.780]  these are called smart lights and smart poles
[03:38:59.780 --> 03:39:01.780]  which are an integral part
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:03.780]  of the smart city infrastructure
[03:39:03.780 --> 03:39:05.780]  they all are
[03:39:05.780 --> 03:39:07.780]  wirelessly communicate with each other
[03:39:07.780 --> 03:39:09.780]  it's an open air concentration
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:11.780]  camp for surveillance
[03:39:11.780 --> 03:39:13.780]  as well as I'll show you it'll be weaponized
[03:39:13.780 --> 03:39:15.780]  and then they will also
[03:39:15.780 --> 03:39:17.780]  host all sorts of sensors
[03:39:17.780 --> 03:39:19.780]  in the name of climate change and global warming
[03:39:19.780 --> 03:39:21.780]  they don't even have diffusers on top of them
[03:39:21.780 --> 03:39:23.780]  so you can't look up
[03:39:23.780 --> 03:39:25.780]  at these lights they're designed to make humans look down
[03:39:25.780 --> 03:39:27.780]  there's something called a puke ray
[03:39:27.780 --> 03:39:29.780]  it's an LED incapacitator
[03:39:29.780 --> 03:39:31.780]  where you have this
[03:39:31.780 --> 03:39:33.780]  think of it this is an LED gun
[03:39:33.780 --> 03:39:35.780]  which is able to emit different
[03:39:35.780 --> 03:39:37.780]  frequencies of light
[03:39:37.780 --> 03:39:39.780]  at a very high rate of change
[03:39:39.780 --> 03:39:41.780]  so when you do this
[03:39:41.780 --> 03:39:43.780]  at a very high frequency
[03:39:43.780 --> 03:39:45.780]  with different lighting
[03:39:45.780 --> 03:39:47.780]  and if there's a human being
[03:39:47.780 --> 03:39:49.780]  that's in the vicinity
[03:39:49.780 --> 03:39:51.780]  and looking at these lights or near these lights
[03:39:51.780 --> 03:39:53.780]  you can get intracranial
[03:39:53.780 --> 03:39:55.780]  damage you can hurt your spine
[03:39:55.780 --> 03:39:57.780]  you can get sick
[03:39:57.780 --> 03:39:59.780]  I bet you it can even kill you
[03:39:59.780 --> 03:40:01.780]  so these can be used as weapons
[03:40:05.780 --> 03:40:07.780]  I encourage everyone to go and watch that interview
[03:40:07.780 --> 03:40:09.780]  it's gone absolutely viral
[03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:11.780]  I would say close to a million views
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:13.780]  across platforms if not more by now
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:15.780]  it is a crucial interview
[03:40:15.780 --> 03:40:17.780]  and what is
[03:40:17.780 --> 03:40:19.780]  every tree being mapped digitally going to do
[03:40:19.780 --> 03:40:21.780]  every single plant everything being mapped digitally
[03:40:21.780 --> 03:40:23.780]  that means your interaction
[03:40:23.780 --> 03:40:25.780]  with everything that's been mapped digitally
[03:40:25.780 --> 03:40:27.780]  is going to be punished
[03:40:27.780 --> 03:40:29.780]  with carbon emissions punishments
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:31.780]  by impacting your social
[03:40:31.780 --> 03:40:33.780]  credit score
[03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:35.780]  and these lights
[03:40:35.780 --> 03:40:37.780]  these weaponized lights
[03:40:37.780 --> 03:40:39.780]  for anyone who doesn't realise
[03:40:39.780 --> 03:40:41.780]  Amman Javi 25 years in Silicon Valley
[03:40:41.780 --> 03:40:43.780]  working on these types of technologies
[03:40:43.780 --> 03:40:45.780]  surveillance technologies he knows what he's talking about
[03:40:45.780 --> 03:40:47.780]  and these weaponized lights
[03:40:47.780 --> 03:40:49.780]  that make humans look down
[03:40:49.780 --> 03:40:51.780]  to you in these smart cities that they're pushing everyone into
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:53.780]  so that you can't even
[03:40:53.780 --> 03:40:55.780]  hold your head up high
[03:40:55.780 --> 03:40:57.780]  so that you don't have any pride
[03:40:57.780 --> 03:40:59.780]  because the aim is to destroy
[03:40:59.780 --> 03:41:01.780]  you as a human
[03:41:01.780 --> 03:41:03.780]  not just your life but
[03:41:03.780 --> 03:41:05.780]  destroy and crush your soul
[03:41:05.780 --> 03:41:07.780]  and if that wasn't bad enough
[03:41:07.780 --> 03:41:09.780]  some lights
[03:41:09.780 --> 03:41:11.780]  that can also kill you
[03:41:11.780 --> 03:41:13.780]  some lights that can also kill you
[03:41:13.780 --> 03:41:15.780]  admit puke rays
[03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:17.780]  so it's not only are we going to subvert you
[03:41:17.780 --> 03:41:19.780]  and control you and keep you trapped
[03:41:19.780 --> 03:41:21.780]  in a prison that you can't see but you know
[03:41:21.780 --> 03:41:23.780]  is there and it's always looming
[03:41:23.780 --> 03:41:25.780]  it's always there looming over your shoulder
[03:41:25.780 --> 03:41:27.780]  that you can't leave this border
[03:41:27.780 --> 03:41:29.780]  this district that these hunger games
[03:41:29.780 --> 03:41:31.780]  maniacs have set up for you
[03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:33.780]  because you need to
[03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:35.780]  you need to eat tomorrow
[03:41:35.780 --> 03:41:37.780]  and if you leave your district you'll be penalised
[03:41:37.780 --> 03:41:39.780]  you've got to eat
[03:41:39.780 --> 03:41:41.780]  tomorrow you've got to go and visit
[03:41:41.780 --> 03:41:43.780]  your sick mum so you're
[03:41:43.780 --> 03:41:45.780]  going to eat less meat this month
[03:41:45.780 --> 03:41:47.780]  in order to be able to have
[03:41:47.780 --> 03:41:49.780]  enough social
[03:41:49.780 --> 03:41:51.780]  credit points to go and visit your mum
[03:41:51.780 --> 03:41:53.780]  and they're talking about
[03:41:53.780 --> 03:41:55.780]  in the Oxford Shire City Council
[03:41:55.780 --> 03:41:57.780]  they're actually talking about how people will need
[03:41:57.780 --> 03:41:59.780]  to apply for these permits
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:01.780]  to be able to leave their areas
[03:42:01.780 --> 03:42:03.780]  and not everyone
[03:42:03.780 --> 03:42:05.780]  will be granted a permit
[03:42:05.780 --> 03:42:07.780]  so not only do you need to pay to leave your area
[03:42:07.780 --> 03:42:09.780]  but you also may not be
[03:42:09.780 --> 03:42:11.780]  granted the permit to do so
[03:42:11.780 --> 03:42:13.780]  in Australia
[03:42:13.780 --> 03:42:15.780]  they've started painting
[03:42:15.780 --> 03:42:17.780]  red mark
[03:42:17.780 --> 03:42:19.780]  big chunks of the road
[03:42:19.780 --> 03:42:21.780]  in red, in rural areas
[03:42:21.780 --> 03:42:23.780]  where I think they're going to lock people out
[03:42:23.780 --> 03:42:25.780]  or lock them in to these areas
[03:42:25.780 --> 03:42:27.780]  when a crisis hits and they've actually got
[03:42:27.780 --> 03:42:29.780]  cameras
[03:42:29.780 --> 03:42:31.780]  and surveillance set up at those very
[03:42:31.780 --> 03:42:33.780]  points that are going
[03:42:33.780 --> 03:42:35.780]  to limit people moving around
[03:42:35.780 --> 03:42:37.780]  this is not a joke
[03:42:37.780 --> 03:42:39.780]  these people really mean business
[03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:41.780]  when they say
[03:42:41.780 --> 03:42:43.780]  and I'm saying what they're really saying
[03:42:43.780 --> 03:42:45.780]  which is that they want to lock you up
[03:42:45.780 --> 03:42:47.780]  in a digital prison right after this break
[03:42:47.780 --> 03:42:49.780]  I've got a sneak preview from my interview
[03:42:49.780 --> 03:42:51.780]  with Senator Alex Antic being released tonight
[03:42:51.780 --> 03:42:53.780]  and we're going to wrap this up
[03:42:53.780 --> 03:43:21.780]  in a minute, stay with me.
[03:43:23.780 --> 03:43:25.780]  Thank you so much for joining us
[03:43:25.780 --> 03:43:54.780]  and we'll see you in the next one.
[03:43:55.780 --> 03:43:57.780]  Look at that
[03:43:57.780 --> 03:43:59.780]  everybody else is just like yellow or clear
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:01.780]  that's because it's been denatured, it's been
[03:44:01.780 --> 03:44:03.780]  marked down, we didn't do that
[03:44:03.780 --> 03:44:05.780]  you think I would
[03:44:05.780 --> 03:44:07.780]  metaphysically tell you something
[03:44:07.780 --> 03:44:09.780]  this is the very best I can get
[03:44:09.780 --> 03:44:11.780]  I'd rather go to hell and do that
[03:44:11.780 --> 03:44:13.780]  I will only give you the maximum
[03:44:13.780 --> 03:44:15.780]  best info, the maximum truth
[03:44:15.780 --> 03:44:17.780]  the maximum product because
[03:44:17.780 --> 03:44:19.780]  I want that good
[03:44:19.780 --> 03:44:21.780]  will, what I do to you
[03:44:21.780 --> 03:44:23.780]  I do to myself, don't you get the big secret
[03:44:23.780 --> 03:44:25.780]  you ever seen
[03:44:25.780 --> 03:44:27.780]  fish oil look like that, no you never seen that have you
[03:44:27.780 --> 03:44:29.780]  and this little jewel right here
[03:44:29.780 --> 03:44:31.780]  is solid
[03:44:33.780 --> 03:44:35.780]  liquid consciousness
[03:44:37.780 --> 03:44:39.780]  look it up
[03:44:39.780 --> 03:44:41.780]  find out
[03:44:41.780 --> 03:44:43.780]  how even the FDA
[03:44:43.780 --> 03:44:45.780]  and the government admits
[03:44:45.780 --> 03:44:47.780]  fish oil is incredible, the number one thing anybody can do for themselves

[03:45:57.780 --> 03:45:59.780]  world now
[03:45:59.780 --> 03:46:01.780]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors
[03:46:01.780 --> 03:46:03.780]  and the healthcare system
[03:46:03.780 --> 03:46:05.780]  there's a solution, the wellness company

[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:19.780]  pharmacies

[03:46:21.780 --> 03:46:23.780]  laboratory testing, imaging

[03:46:37.780 --> 03:46:39.780]  and the array of things that now America
[03:46:39.780 --> 03:46:41.780]  has to work through
[03:46:41.780 --> 03:46:43.780]  in this new world
[03:46:43.780 --> 03:46:45.780]  that we are living in

[03:47:15.780 --> 03:47:17.780] .
[03:47:17.780 --> 03:47:19.780]  in the rest of the day
[03:47:19.780 --> 03:47:21.780]  week
[03:47:21.780 --> 03:47:25.340]  I mean, that whole heartedly support your favorite independent media because they are
[03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:28.660]  literally putting their lives on the line to get the truth out to you.
[03:47:28.660 --> 03:47:31.580]  This is dangerous work.
[03:47:31.580 --> 03:47:35.660]  Before I play the clip of Senator Alex Antik, I really just want to play this short clip
[03:47:35.660 --> 03:47:36.660]  from Peter Hobson.
[03:47:36.660 --> 03:47:40.040]  He's from Goldstackers Australia, a Gold bullion group Australia.
[03:47:40.040 --> 03:47:45.500]  He talks about CBDCs and he warns people about what CBDCs will be.
[03:47:45.500 --> 03:47:49.140]  Take a look at this before we go to the clip of Senator Antik.
[03:47:49.140 --> 03:47:54.660]  People are actually quite opposed to the CBDC coming CBDC.
[03:47:54.660 --> 03:47:55.660]  Talk to us about that.
[03:47:55.660 --> 03:47:56.660]  Well, all right.
[03:47:56.660 --> 03:48:02.220]  Let's say you live in District 12 and you go to District 13 and you're not meant to
[03:48:02.220 --> 03:48:03.220]  be there.
[03:48:03.220 --> 03:48:04.220]  Your money won't work.
[03:48:04.220 --> 03:48:05.220]  Okay.
[03:48:05.220 --> 03:48:07.220]  You speak out poorly against the government.
[03:48:07.220 --> 03:48:09.060]  It'll be a social credit system.
[03:48:09.060 --> 03:48:11.780]  They'll control us from the cradle to the grave.
[03:48:11.780 --> 03:48:15.380]  And again, they still have their Ponzi scheme of mass click money.
[03:48:15.380 --> 03:48:16.380]  They will allocate you money.
[03:48:16.380 --> 03:48:19.100]  If you don't spend it in a certain time frame, they'll take it from your account.
[03:48:19.100 --> 03:48:22.660]  It's just total control.
[03:48:22.660 --> 03:48:29.460]  It's control gone mad and we must not allow this to take place and you need yourself and
[03:48:29.460 --> 03:48:33.980]  everyone you know and all of your listeners to rally and band together to fight this.
[03:48:33.980 --> 03:48:38.340]  Because we're going to go from, as I said, the Ponzi scheme being back, I believe they're
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:43.380]  going to try and implement CBDCs and they're trying to do it in Australia right now.
[03:48:43.380 --> 03:48:48.020]  Until we get back to sound money policy where there's fiscal responsibility, we all take
[03:48:48.020 --> 03:48:53.900]  control of how we're meant to spend and the way we're meant to spend.
[03:48:53.900 --> 03:48:57.700]  Rather than this debt-based changing system, we're going to have a lot of problems and
[03:48:57.700 --> 03:49:02.580]  it's going to be a big uphill fight because the young of the day are just going to look
[03:49:02.580 --> 03:49:06.660]  at convenience as opposed to any of the other issues and it'll be too far down the track
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:09.300]  before they realise they're going to trap them in the court.
[03:49:09.300 --> 03:49:11.300]  That's the same one.
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:15.620]  If you're in Australia, I encourage you to head to Goldstock because they're an amazing
[03:49:15.620 --> 03:49:16.620]  group of people.
[03:49:16.620 --> 03:49:19.660]  You can see they really understand the agenda.
[03:49:19.660 --> 03:49:24.700]  If you are looking for precious metals, these are the guys to visit in our country.
[03:49:24.700 --> 03:49:29.540]  What he speaks about is so crucial because we spoke about this earlier on in the broadcast.
[03:49:29.540 --> 03:49:35.100]  We spoke about the fact that they're getting rid of receipts in order to track through
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:38.140]  your banking app, your spending and the things that you're buying.
[03:49:38.140 --> 03:49:39.940]  This is what CBDC is about.
[03:49:39.940 --> 03:49:41.940]  This is what Digital ID is about.
[03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:46.980]  It is all linking back to this system that they're setting up, but why are they setting
[03:49:46.980 --> 03:49:47.980]  it up?
[03:49:47.980 --> 03:49:49.980]  Why?
[03:49:49.980 --> 03:49:55.900]  That is the most crucial question that I want to answer for everyone today.
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:50:00.220]  Before I do, I've got this clip, this preview, not before seen.
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:06.540]  This interview hasn't been released yet, but we're broadcasting this very, very important
[03:50:06.540 --> 03:50:09.380]  clip of my interview with Senator Alex Antik.
[03:50:09.380 --> 03:50:11.900]  He's an amazing senator out of Australia.
[03:50:11.900 --> 03:50:16.060]  He talks about the risks of digital ID, smart cities.
[03:50:16.060 --> 03:50:21.500]  In fact, he's the only senator that has... Not the only, I should say, Senator Malcolm
[03:50:21.500 --> 03:50:25.700]  Roberts has as well, but he is one of the only senators in our country that has the bravery
[03:50:25.700 --> 03:50:28.540]  to speak on these things and do so very boldly.
[03:50:28.540 --> 03:50:30.420]  Watch this preview of tonight's zero time.
[03:50:30.420 --> 03:50:35.140]  If you want to look into the future, have a look at the digital surveillance systems
[03:50:35.140 --> 03:50:38.740]  and the facial recognition that's going out through Chinese cities at the moment.
[03:50:38.740 --> 03:50:44.580]  Sadly, I fear with the white paper revolution that's happening in China as we speak, I fear
[03:50:44.580 --> 03:50:48.860]  that information, that data, that biometric data is going to be proven to be weaponized
[03:50:48.860 --> 03:50:54.740]  against the population as these protests die down or as they're quelled.
[03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:57.020]  This stuff is creeping into our society.
[03:50:57.020 --> 03:51:01.540]  We've got these so-called smart cities that, as you said in that intro, really are building
[03:51:01.540 --> 03:51:04.540]  towards the framework of a digital prison.
[03:51:04.540 --> 03:51:07.100]  I think we just have to see them in that light.
[03:51:07.100 --> 03:51:15.540]  There are cities around the country now that are ripped in with this technology.
[03:51:15.540 --> 03:51:20.300]  So grateful for senators that have the courage to speak about this.
[03:51:20.300 --> 03:51:27.860]  If you understand smart cities and if you understand the agenda, then it is not an overstatement
[03:51:27.860 --> 03:51:31.140]  to call this a digital prison.
[03:51:31.140 --> 03:51:35.260]  What is the whole reason why we've gotten to this point?
[03:51:35.260 --> 03:51:39.740]  What is the reason that they want to push us into this system of digital ID, CBDC, everything
[03:51:39.740 --> 03:51:45.420]  being tracked and traced through a mark?
[03:51:45.420 --> 03:51:51.300]  The whole purpose is to condition you for the mark of the beast.
[03:51:51.300 --> 03:51:56.420]  You won't be able to buy or sell unless you do what we tell you to and unless you receive
[03:51:56.420 --> 03:51:57.420]  this mark.
[03:51:57.420 --> 03:51:59.020]  This is where we are heading.
[03:51:59.020 --> 03:52:08.220]  The entire agenda is for the soul of man.
[03:52:08.220 --> 03:52:14.060]  If you understand the New World Order, and I believe this broadcast really does, and
[03:52:14.060 --> 03:52:20.020]  you understand that these people who are pushing towards this system are actually Satanists
[03:52:20.020 --> 03:52:24.140]  and they're bringing people along the journey with them until this final point where they
[03:52:24.140 --> 03:52:30.700]  say to you, okay, all of these systems, all of this infrastructure is in place now.
[03:52:30.700 --> 03:52:36.740]  That's why I said to you in the beginning, it's not only about control, it is about bringing
[03:52:36.740 --> 03:52:43.500]  the people to the point where they cannot buy or sell unless they receive this mark.
[03:52:43.500 --> 03:52:49.020]  You can easily see how people have, over the years, I mean, when barcodes came out, people
[03:52:49.020 --> 03:52:50.460]  were so concerned.
[03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:53.540]  When credit cards came out, people were so concerned, but over the years, we've become
[03:52:53.540 --> 03:52:56.980]  really comfortable with that idea.
[03:52:56.980 --> 03:53:00.100]  Over the years, we've become a lot more comfortable with surveillance.
[03:53:00.100 --> 03:53:03.980]  Imagine when you first started seeing cameras on the road and you thought, oh, that's a
[03:53:03.980 --> 03:53:05.700]  bit intrusive.
[03:53:05.700 --> 03:53:08.380]  Now we're watched by them all the time.
[03:53:08.380 --> 03:53:13.820]  In fact, if you're watching this on your phone right now, your camera is staring at you on
[03:53:13.820 --> 03:53:16.380]  top of my face.
[03:53:16.380 --> 03:53:17.660]  That's just the reality of it.
[03:53:17.660 --> 03:53:23.100]  Alex said we're all guilty of carrying these devices around and they've become such a normal
[03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:28.100]  part of life and this is what will happen with the geofencing.
[03:53:28.100 --> 03:53:34.100]  This is what will happen with the climate change agenda, with every little inch that
[03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:39.460]  they keep creeping in on your freedom, your freedom of speech, your freedom of movement,
[03:53:39.460 --> 03:53:44.500]  your freedom of religion, your freedom of commerce.
[03:53:44.500 --> 03:53:49.740]  Every little step that they take and it is progressive, the agenda, it's not instant.
[03:53:49.740 --> 03:53:56.500]  COVID was probably the most instant blow that we saw for the agenda because it fast tracked
[03:53:56.500 --> 03:53:57.500]  all the rest of it.
[03:53:57.500 --> 03:54:02.100]  But the other steps that are happening are all happening progressively.
[03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:07.740]  The smart city, for example, agenda, like I exposed the first time that I was hosting,
[03:54:07.740 --> 03:54:12.580]  that's set to happen in 2025 where they limit your water and limit your electricity and
[03:54:12.580 --> 03:54:13.580]  things like that.
[03:54:13.580 --> 03:54:17.460]  That's still two years away.
[03:54:17.460 --> 03:54:24.900]  So they're doing it incrementally so that the people don't feel the sudden complete
[03:54:24.900 --> 03:54:30.260]  loss of any type of freedom that they have left.
[03:54:30.260 --> 03:54:33.620]  And through the central bank, so let's circle back to the start.
[03:54:33.620 --> 03:54:40.260]  You've got COVID, then you had the lockdowns, then you had the vaccine, comply or else,
[03:54:40.260 --> 03:54:43.420]  show us your papers, check in here.
[03:54:43.420 --> 03:54:49.340]  They even were tracking people's transactions in that time if you remember.
[03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:53.780]  Because if you went to a place where there was a close contact reported and this happened
[03:54:53.780 --> 03:55:01.860]  on more than one occasion, your bank got notified and then your bank notified the authorities.
[03:55:01.860 --> 03:55:05.780]  This did happen in Australia and people were getting calls saying you had a credit card
[03:55:05.780 --> 03:55:10.500]  transaction at this place and there was a close contact, now you have to quarantine.
[03:55:10.500 --> 03:55:12.420]  This was happening.
[03:55:12.420 --> 03:55:19.180]  Show us your papers, comply, do this or else, do this to be free.
[03:55:19.180 --> 03:55:20.660]  Stay within your 15 minutes.
[03:55:20.660 --> 03:55:22.380]  We're giving you this livable city.
[03:55:22.380 --> 03:55:28.620]  You can live locally and save the climate and you'll feel like a hero doing it.
[03:55:28.620 --> 03:55:32.340]  And you convert your signal to all your friends on Facebook and Instagram about how you're
[03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:37.100]  saving the climate by riding your bicycle and not being allowed to travel 15 minutes
[03:55:37.100 --> 03:55:41.460]  from your home and make sure that you tell them about the fact that I've never received
[03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:46.900]  a climate fine because I comply with daddy government.
[03:55:46.900 --> 03:55:51.900]  You can post that all day on Instagram and of course your social credit score will go
[03:55:51.900 --> 03:55:56.780]  up because you're promoting looking after the climate and mother earth and the religion
[03:55:56.780 --> 03:55:59.860]  of universalism and how dare anyone speak against it.
[03:55:59.860 --> 03:56:07.180]  Love is love and loving the planet is love and how dare you have your own religion.
[03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:09.380]  That's hate speech.
[03:56:09.380 --> 03:56:14.300]  We all love and tolerate one another and you saying that your way is the right way is hate
[03:56:14.300 --> 03:56:16.980]  speech.
[03:56:16.980 --> 03:56:19.300]  Can you see how our world is progressing to this?
[03:56:19.300 --> 03:56:25.420]  So when they say to you that digital ID is good for your security and for privacy reasons
[03:56:25.420 --> 03:56:30.220]  and CBDCs are going to be great for helping the climate and all these organizations jump
[03:56:30.220 --> 03:56:38.020]  on board and the culture gets permeated with this cancer of lies through the corporate takeover
[03:56:38.020 --> 03:56:44.380]  that is the new world order and everyone shows their colleagues at work, oh look at my Instagram
[03:56:44.380 --> 03:56:45.380]  post.
[03:56:45.380 --> 03:56:50.300]  I rode my bike for 10 minutes yesterday and my social credit score went up and now I'm
[03:56:50.300 --> 03:56:55.700]  allowed to eat meat this weekend, I'll treat myself.
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:57:00.740]  So many people will be fooled by this and the ultimate goal is to then present to those
[03:57:00.740 --> 03:57:08.100]  people that are completely fooled with the choice of take this mark so that you can buy
[03:57:08.100 --> 03:57:16.940]  or sell and by that time their minds would have been so raped by the propaganda and these
[03:57:16.940 --> 03:57:23.660]  evil satanists that they will not even know what choice they have made and they will be
[03:57:23.660 --> 03:57:27.220]  eternally damned to hell.
[03:57:27.220 --> 03:57:31.900]  This is a warning for everyone watching, I know that you're aware, don't ever, ever let
[03:57:31.900 --> 03:57:34.140]  them steal your soul.
[03:57:34.140 --> 03:57:38.420]  Tune in tonight at 8 p.m. on Zmedia.com for that interview with Senator Antik, thank
[03:57:38.420 --> 03:57:43.700]  you so much for being with me here today, I appreciate all of you and I appreciate this
[03:57:43.700 --> 03:57:46.820]  broadcast, God bless.
[03:57:46.820 --> 03:57:53.580]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[03:57:53.580 --> 03:57:58.940]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors, they associated
[03:57:58.940 --> 03:58:02.580]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:58:02.580 --> 03:58:07.420]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[03:58:07.420 --> 03:58:15.500]  people was a lack of vitamin D3, you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce
[03:58:15.500 --> 03:58:21.060]  vitamin D3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then
[03:58:21.060 --> 03:58:24.900]  it's very easy for viruses and other things that start replicating and taking your body
[03:58:24.900 --> 03:58:25.900]  over.
[03:58:25.900 --> 03:58:29.660]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
