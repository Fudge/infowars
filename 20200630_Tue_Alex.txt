[00:00.000 --> 00:14.600]  Mark your calendars. It is Tuesday, June 30, 2020, 125 days out from the election. And
[00:14.600 --> 00:19.240]  more than two weeks ago, we were contacted by a state health department individual saying
[00:19.240 --> 00:26.120]  you need to look at how they're counting under federal directives individuals that they say
[00:26.120 --> 00:30.720]  might have COVID and they're using computer models where they'll have a contact tracer
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.240]  talk to someone and say, well, you're at a bar of what, 100 people? Well, we're just
[00:34.240 --> 00:38.840]  going to say half of them have it. And then that's put in the number. And I meant to research
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.920]  it and then people started sending us links out of Texas with county commissioners and
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.600]  folks on Facebook saying, Hey, here's why the numbers are up. We've been told that if
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.760]  someone has a sore throat or the sniffles and even comes up negative, we count them
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.040]  as COVID-19. And then anyone there around we count as COVID-19. Well, then yesterday
[00:59.040 --> 01:03.840]  after the broadcast, I spent about five hours with Rob Dew, our new director, watching county
[01:03.840 --> 01:10.640]  commissioner meetings in some of the most populous counties in Texas, one up in Dallas.
[01:10.640 --> 01:17.240]  And they show the CDC documents and the NIH directives and we've confirmed that not just
[01:17.240 --> 01:22.520]  here but in other states, this is what's been sent out. Now, some states like West Virginia
[01:22.520 --> 01:30.680]  are refusing to follow this directive. But Texas is this is the end of this hoax. If
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.280]  you get the article out that's at info wars.com of the video report. Now, today's live show
[01:35.280 --> 01:41.440]  is titled to global exclusives now breaking NIH CDC caught inflating COVID numbers at
[01:41.440 --> 01:48.320]  least 15 times. Plus Roger Stone to break his silence on Eve imprisonment and more.
[01:48.320 --> 01:51.960]  And in that same post, we have the article, not just the live feed, but the article in
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.400]  the video posted here is the article that has the video posted. Planned Demic bombshell
[01:57.400 --> 02:06.600]  CDC inflating COVID infection rates up to 16 times. And that's really some of it. That's
[02:06.600 --> 02:12.040]  just 20 to 30 times. We just say at least 16 times. But I wrote this this morning with
[02:12.040 --> 02:18.120]  the crew member very quickly. So let's just add the number at least 16 times because they
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.840]  count the person that has it. And then they save on average 15 times. It's on video. We
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.440]  show you all the graphs. In fact, here are some of these documents. This is out of Collin
[02:28.440 --> 02:34.720]  County. This is from the CDC and NIH right here. Zoom in a little bit more for me guys.
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.560]  Thank you. And the current case detection system before May 18th, which just came out
[02:41.560 --> 02:48.640]  yesterday was only one person's counted as it. Now the new one is up to 36. But the average
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.880]  is 15 additional on top of the one. So 16 or 15, depending on how you look at it. New
[02:55.880 --> 03:01.640]  probable case detection. And then they say on video in the documents, they count that
[03:01.640 --> 03:08.000]  as a case. We have the new definition right here. New probable case definition means a
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.480]  case. Chris Hill, the county commissioner judge, just says this is going to be problematic.
[03:13.480 --> 03:19.880]  This is going to create a hysteria. And this is back on May 18th. So this is incredible.
[03:19.880 --> 03:24.240]  You've got to investigate your counties and your cities. This is going on everywhere.
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.840]  This is so important. I cannot stress to all of you how important it is to get these articles
[03:28.840 --> 03:37.760]  out. Pandemic bombshell, CDC inflating COVID infection rates up to 16 times. And again,
[03:37.760 --> 03:44.320]  you've got to correct that. It's actually up to 36 times, but it's at least 16 times.
[03:44.320 --> 03:52.240]  That the bottom projection is 15 for every person that has it. But then it gets worse.
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.040]  This is breathtaking. I'm actually having an anxiety attack. This is so huge and I never
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.400]  have anxiety attacks. I mean, I'm literally having an anxiety attack right now in there.
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.200]  This is so bombshell. This is so smoking gun. They say on the video and show the CDC
[04:05.200 --> 04:10.120]  directive that they don't need a positive test to say you have COVID-19. And then that's
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.080]  the basis for at least 15 more around you. It says sniffles, runny nose, sore throat,
[04:15.080 --> 04:21.320]  cough, any of those. And so he basically says anybody in Texas that has a sore throat, you
[04:21.320 --> 04:27.880]  know, I'm COVID-19, then that counts 15 more people. This is unbelievable fraud. And Joe
[04:27.880 --> 04:33.280]  Biden's running on this saying it's all Trump's fault. The EU shut US citizens out of the
[04:33.280 --> 04:39.880]  EU. Half of Americans are out of work. That's the new headlines. Half of the people in the
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.080]  country that we're working are not working. It's right at half 49%. I mean, we are in
[04:44.080 --> 04:49.320]  a devastating economic war. This is the globalist siege to punish us for trying to get control
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.080]  of our country. The special report is on the other side till everyone you know to tune
[04:53.080 --> 04:58.920]  in now and spread the links if you want to defeat this giant hoax.
[04:58.920 --> 05:02.520]  What can I say to the viewers and listeners? Thank you for supporting us. You've done a
[05:02.520 --> 05:08.000]  great job. We've done amazing things together. The war is now out in the open. You can see
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.400]  that info wars world vision of who the globalists are and who we are has been very, very accurate.
[05:15.400 --> 05:20.800]  We're not just some little Hollywood New World Order rabbit trail trying to distract humanity.
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.680]  We're the zeitgeist and the spirit of liberty together in this symbiotic relationship that
[05:25.680 --> 05:32.000]  believes in humanity. And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.520]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.440]  the guest, the callers, the host, we will fail. I'm stating the obvious here. I just
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.280]  want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support, no matter what color you are or where
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.120]  you came from. If you love human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together
[05:52.120 --> 05:57.640]  and I salute and thank you all. Now share those links at band.video and crush the globalist
[05:57.640 --> 06:17.520]  murderers. It is Tuesday, June 30th. The year is 2020. We are 125 days out from the election
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.440]  and the Democrats are openly saying President Trump is to blame for the worst COVID cases
[06:22.440 --> 06:28.880]  on earth and rapid explosion in a number of cases, though the decline in deaths is now
[06:28.880 --> 06:34.000]  the public is on to how they're killing people by intubating them. But still they're trying
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.080]  to create total hysteria. The biggest news ever on COVID-19 has broken exclusively at
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.640]  infowars.com. Rob do stayed up here till 2am last night. I stayed up here till 9 o'clock
[06:45.640 --> 06:50.960]  last night working on this. It was so important. And what's shocking is it turns out health
[06:50.960 --> 06:55.280]  departments are calling us. People are calling us. The emails are flooding in going, we've
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.920]  been telling you this for weeks, but no major news has picked us up. And it's true. Over
[06:59.920 --> 07:04.680]  two weeks ago, state health department official contacted me and said, Alex, they're counting
[07:04.680 --> 07:12.680]  all of the people. This is just amazing that are around someone that has COVID as having
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.360]  COVID. Look into it and I just dropped them all. Well, now we have the documents. Now
[07:17.360 --> 07:20.920]  we have the county commissioner meetings and now we've confirmed it's all over the country.
[07:20.920 --> 07:26.080]  Where the NIH and CDC can turn up the cases or turn them down. Totally criminal. You think
[07:26.080 --> 07:29.520]  it's bad to save people that died of gunshot wounds, died of COVID. You think it's bad
[07:29.520 --> 07:35.320]  to send old people at nursing homes to their deaths by sending real patients in there.
[07:35.320 --> 07:40.880]  This is even bigger. Fauci and all of them are orchestrating it. He needs to go to prison.
[07:40.880 --> 07:45.160]  By the way, he's been caught after he does the hearings pulling the mask off when he's
[07:45.160 --> 07:50.160]  getting in his car, when he's leaving or when he's in the meeting rooms. It's all a hoax.
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.280]  That's in Nevada have been caught doing it as well. So these people are savage criminals
[07:56.280 --> 07:59.400]  and they know exactly what they're doing. This is Bill Gates running this whole thing
[07:59.400 --> 08:04.080]  with the UN against America. So it's a 14 minute report. We'll have time to air half
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.640]  of it now for your own future. Go to band.video. We had to launch our own system and be able
[08:09.640 --> 08:13.760]  to give you this information and get the video that broke at 2 a.m. last night when Duke
[08:13.760 --> 08:20.000]  posted it. Breaking states ordered to fraudulently inflate COVID-19 cases 15 times actual
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.560]  rate. That is conservative by the way. This is kryptonite to the new world order. Get
[08:25.560 --> 08:32.720]  it. Share it by hand, by email, by text. Print out copies of it with a URL at band.video
[08:32.720 --> 08:40.480]  or m4wars.com and just get it out there everywhere. This morning I was at a red light and people
[08:40.480 --> 08:44.800]  started screaming and I looked over, rolled my window down and a man was flipping me off
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.080]  saying FQ, put your mask on. Joy Bayhard said she stalks people in New York not wearing
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.400]  masks. We have video police beating the hell out of people not wearing them. A black man,
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.680]  white cops. Whoa, but that's okay. This is a cult, folks, making their move. So here
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.560]  is the first half of the report and if you choose this mission and choose to accept it,
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.440]  this will devastate the enemy. It's got 80,000 views since 2 a.m. this morning. Okay, great.
[09:09.440 --> 09:16.960]  It needs 5 million views. Our top video on band.video only has 3 million. I want 5 million
[09:16.960 --> 09:23.040]  by tomorrow. We can break their back. We can expose these murdering criminals and the great
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.560]  depression they are already triggered. This is a war, an info war. Get the video. Breaking.
[09:29.560 --> 09:37.280]  States ordered defraudulently inflate COVID numbers at least 15 times. Here is the report.
[09:37.280 --> 09:43.920]  State of Texas, the SHS has informed public health departments that they have adopted
[09:43.920 --> 09:53.200]  a revised definition for COVID-19 probable cases. So for confirmed case, it stays the
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.040]  same. You still just need PCR, but now they've added a probable case definition. So that
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.800]  still gets counted towards the case count. It's different. It's not confirmed. It's probable,
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.240]  but it's still a case. So at the end of this definition, there are 15 different options
[10:10.240 --> 10:16.240]  on how you could be classified as a probable case. Based on this diagram and what they report,
[10:16.240 --> 10:22.400]  there's a total of 17 cases now. One is still only confirmed because that was that original
[10:22.400 --> 10:28.120]  index case who then had all these contacts underneath in orange. And all the rest of
[10:28.120 --> 10:33.920]  them became probable, but they are still considered a case. It has the potential to be a very
[10:33.920 --> 10:40.160]  significant event for us here in Texas and here in Collin County as the state now has
[10:40.160 --> 10:46.080]  elected to adopt this new probable definition. If you have a subjective fever and you have
[10:46.080 --> 10:50.960]  a headache and you live in Collin County, you now meet the qualifications to be a probable
[10:50.960 --> 10:58.480]  COVID patient. It is remarkable how low the standard is now. If you have one of the major
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.720]  symptoms, you have a cough or you have shortness of breath and you live in Collin County,
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.400]  then you can satisfy the definition for a probable COVID case. But I'm very concerned
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.560]  that we absolutely could see the numbers jump very rapidly in a way that actually is not
[11:16.560 --> 11:20.400]  indicative of what we're seeing here in the community in the public health department.
[11:20.400 --> 11:26.560]  The clips you just saw took place on May 18th of this year, just a few weeks ago.
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.760]  Now, we were contacted by a whistleblower inside the state health department at a high level
[11:31.760 --> 11:38.560]  a few weeks ago about the big changes that were coming. Separately, another whistleblower contacted
[11:38.560 --> 11:45.600]  us with the video you just saw and more were about to play. But this is complete proof that the
[11:45.600 --> 11:54.240]  COVID-19 testing regime and the definitions they semantically use from the NIH and CDC are frauds.
[11:54.240 --> 12:00.640]  This has been confirmed. If one person tests positive for COVID-19, 15 people in the computer
[12:00.640 --> 12:10.240]  model are then said to have it. So, possibles are now defined as of the middle of May as COVID cases.
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.680]  But it gets worse. They go on to say that they're going to say it's COVID-19, even if someone's
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.240]  not been tested. And if someone dies without tests, they're going to say it's COVID-19.
[12:20.240 --> 12:27.440]  And let's say the virus called you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem.
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.160]  Some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.
[12:37.040 --> 12:43.360]  Right now, we're still recording it. And we'll, I mean, the great thing about having forms that
[12:43.360 --> 12:50.880]  come in and a form that has the ability to market as COVID-19 infection, the intent is right now
[12:50.880 --> 12:57.600]  that those, if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.
[12:58.240 --> 13:09.120]  But this is bigger than that. This is the NIH directing the states to say that if one person
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.560]  tests positive in a questionable test, that 15 others are positive as well. So, we're going to
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.720]  go through these clips. We're going to link where you can see hours of this at the end of the video
[13:18.720 --> 13:22.080]  for yourself because we don't just have the documents from the state health department.
[13:22.080 --> 13:28.000]  We actually have a county going over this last month and breaking it down and asking the question,
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.880]  this is going to create a lot of new false cases. Rob News, the M4's news director,
[13:32.880 --> 13:35.600]  he's been following this for weeks. We're ready to break this right now.
[13:35.600 --> 13:40.160]  Yeah, that prophetic statement was made by Chris Hill, the county judge. Basically, he said,
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.360]  wow, with all these new parameters we're using to create COVID cases, they're using the word case
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.720]  very specifically, that we can have these inflated numbers. So, it used to be if you tested positive
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.840]  for COVID-19, that was one case. Now, if you have one case, they also look around it and see who
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.280]  you've been in contact with and they say, okay, these are probable cases. These go into the caseload
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.520]  and they use a lot of different parameters that we're going to go over just in one second. But
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.840]  one case could equal 17 cases, could equal 10 cases, could equal 20 cases. It doesn't matter.
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.800]  All it looks at is the word probable and they add probable into the caseload and now you've seen
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.800]  since May 18th when these were implemented in Texas, the numbers skyrocketing.
[14:22.800 --> 14:28.800]  And they confirm that if they say probable, that's now called a case. So, this is lawyer
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.520]  semantics. We've confirmed other states are following this same directive. So, they can
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.440]  turn the cases up or turn them down the bureaucrats can whenever they want.
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.600]  That's right. So, let's go into these clips. We have clip one. This is where they talk about
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.720]  the case definitions being revised. Here it is. State of Texas, the SHS has informed public health
[14:48.720 --> 14:57.920]  departments that they are, they have adopted a revised definition for COVID-19 probable cases.
[14:57.920 --> 15:03.760]  Probable case definition was adopted by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists
[15:03.760 --> 15:09.760]  back in early April, April 4th or 5th. They adopted this. They sent it to the CDC and the CDC did
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.320]  take that recommendation and adopted. And again, when you hear that, it's John Hopkins run by
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.120]  Bill Gates that runs the entire show. So, it gets into all of it. They admit all of it.
[15:19.120 --> 15:22.800]  It's a total fraud. They admit they don't even test people to say they have COVID.
[15:22.800 --> 15:28.480]  This is beyond criminal. And that's how this has been done. And you've got the Governor,
[15:28.480 --> 15:32.320]  who's not a doctor, doesn't know this. He's just hearing, we have record cases. You better do
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.120]  something and it's all a giant fraud. The Governor needs to call for criminal investigation. The
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.560]  President does. And a Fauci needs to be SWAT team now. This is their criminal fraud to keep America
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.280]  closed. They admit it. The full report's on infowars.com and newswars.com. But first,
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.920]  Roger Stone breaks his silence. And you've got so much to say to President Trump. You name it.
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.920]  Coming up on the other side, exclusive Roger Stone breaks the silence. 2020 is a very special year
[15:59.920 --> 16:05.280]  to the globalists, to the occultists, to those that are into esoteric mysticism. And they believe
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.920]  this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America and the world and bring in their anti-God,
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.880]  anti-human tyranny. Well, we're here on air. We just ask you all to realize that we're in
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.840]  opposition to this evil. And that only your word of mouth helps us reach new people. And I want to
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.160]  salute you all. Thank you for your support. And I also want you to know that our 4th of July,

[18:22.000 --> 18:28.320]  And he's the guy that got Donald Trump to run for office, breaking his silence right now.
[18:28.320 --> 18:36.880]  The next three segments on this Tuesday edition is Roger Stone facing execution basically in a
[18:36.880 --> 18:43.200]  COVID-19 infested jail supposedly in two weeks. Now probably fighting for the most important
[18:43.200 --> 18:50.240]  campaign of his life, his life to not be a political prisoner, one of the casualties of the Russia
[18:50.240 --> 18:54.560]  collusion hoax. Roger Stone, thank you so much for joining us, my friend. Good to have you back on.
[18:55.440 --> 19:01.200]  Alex, it's terrific to be back with you. It's kind of like old home week. And first and foremost,
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.960]  I want to thank you. And I want to thank Info Wars. And I want to thank the Info Warriors out
[19:06.960 --> 19:15.280]  there in your audience who have stood by me through this entire epic struggle. I could never have made
[19:15.280 --> 19:21.680]  it this far. My family could never have survived this long without the support of each and every
[19:21.680 --> 19:28.880]  one of you. It has been gratifying. It has been extraordinary. It is only through the grace of
[19:28.880 --> 19:37.600]  God and for prayer and for the prayers of millions and millions of Americans, the contributions of
[19:37.600 --> 19:43.280]  thousands, tens of thousands of Americans that I have been able to fight. And I am
[19:43.280 --> 19:50.320]  continuing to fight for my vindication and for justice in this extraordinary
[19:51.600 --> 19:57.280]  witch hunt. It has been nothing short of miraculous. So I want to thank you and the Info
[19:57.280 --> 20:04.000]  War audience first and foremost. And for all of my friends at Info Wars, it is really, really good
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.240]  to be back. It's good to have you here. Now you said no questions off limits all of a sudden.
[20:08.240 --> 20:13.520]  This weekend we talked, you said gloves are off, but wait till I go on air. What does it mean?
[20:13.520 --> 20:18.000]  No, nothing's on limits. I mean, I don't people know what's happened behind the scenes and why
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.160]  you haven't been able to be on? You say nothing's off limits. Should we hit that and then talk about
[20:22.160 --> 20:27.760]  the sequence of events that's all intertwined with Trump in 2020? Yeah, I think that's a good way
[20:27.760 --> 20:34.240]  to proceed. I think it's important to recognize that immediately after my Soviet style show trial
[20:34.240 --> 20:42.400]  in Washington, DC, in which the judge not only prohibited every powerful line of defense,
[20:43.200 --> 20:50.240]  but I also was faced with what was essentially a stacked jury, a jury that included no Republicans,
[20:50.240 --> 20:57.360]  no conservatives, no military veterans, no Info Warriors, certainly, but could have passed for
[20:57.360 --> 21:05.520]  the Obama Clinton Administration Alumni Association, also included a number of Democratic Party
[21:05.520 --> 21:14.880]  activists, contributors to Donald Trump's 2020 donors. And then, of course, we had the post
[21:15.680 --> 21:24.480]  trial revelations regarding the antics of the jury for women who indisputably posted on Twitter
[21:24.480 --> 21:33.360]  and Facebook during 2019, starting on the day of my arrest. And subsequently, individual posts
[21:33.360 --> 21:40.480]  attacking me and many, many posts attacking President Trump. So this is not someone who
[21:40.480 --> 21:48.800]  meets the Supreme Court's definition of impartial and indifferent. This was a Democratic Party
[21:48.800 --> 21:56.960]  activist, a Trump hater, a stone hater, who essentially hid her bias during jury selection,
[21:56.960 --> 22:05.280]  had her social media platforms on a private setting during jury selection and during the trial,
[22:05.280 --> 22:13.760]  and then after the trial, deleted those email posts, in fact, deleted her entire page,
[22:13.760 --> 22:20.960]  so that the truth could not be known. Now, as you know, Alex, we filed a motion for a new trial
[22:20.960 --> 22:28.320]  based on the bias of the jury for women. I believe we demonstrated that bias. We asked,
[22:28.320 --> 22:35.600]  specifically, asked Judge Jackson for the ability to subpoena the deleted material from Facebook.
[22:35.600 --> 22:40.320]  The woman's MO was to place something on Facebook and then take the Facebook link and
[22:40.320 --> 22:48.240]  post it on Twitter. And, of course, that line of inquiry was denied. So we were somewhat surprised,
[22:48.240 --> 22:54.960]  as were many in the legal community, when I was not given a new trial. When my conviction,
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.760]  which I believe was wrongly decided anyway, was not vacated and I wasn't given a new trial.
[23:01.760 --> 23:08.480]  Just to be clear to everyone, I have filed an appeal not only of my bogus conviction,
[23:08.480 --> 23:16.320]  but I've also filed an appeal specifically of the decision by Judge Jackson not to grant me a
[23:16.320 --> 23:22.720]  new trial. And those are pending. But in this process, an appeal is not immediate. It can take
[23:22.720 --> 23:29.120]  a year or longer. It can certainly cost as much as a million dollars. And in the short term,
[23:29.120 --> 23:36.320]  you're absolutely right, even though Michael Avenatti, the Democrat super lawyer who was a
[23:36.320 --> 23:42.960]  hyper critic of the president, who stole $25 million from his clients and faces additional
[23:42.960 --> 23:49.280]  charges, I believe, even though Michael Cohen, who was convicted of various financial crimes
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.440]  that don't involve Donald Trump. What about Harvey Weinstein, convicted of raping?
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.840]  He's out, but you've got to go to jail. Yeah, it's really extraordinary. So the
[23:57.840 --> 24:03.600]  Department of Justice's directives to the U.S. Bureau of Prison that nonviolent,
[24:03.600 --> 24:09.200]  or I should say inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes be moved from incarceration to home
[24:09.200 --> 24:16.400]  confinement does not apply to Roger Stone. Therefore, my attorneys, my new attorneys,
[24:17.120 --> 24:23.520]  appealed that to Judge Jackson, which is the correct avenue, asking that instead of being
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.480]  sent to a prison in Jessup, Georgia, which is a very dicey situation and where the potential
[24:30.480 --> 24:38.640]  for infection of coronavirus, I think is very real. Last Friday, very late on Friday afternoon,
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.800]  the judge essentially ignored the substance of our arguments, ordered me placed under
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.680]  immediate house arrest, which is where I am right now, and added that I had two weeks to
[24:51.680 --> 24:55.920]  settle my affairs and report to the prison in Georgia. And that's my quick question.
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.320]  You weren't going to do interviews until whether a clemency partner, whatever was going to happen,
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.600]  what made you change the last few days and now be here? You're going to get into
[25:03.600 --> 25:09.280]  2020 election. You're warning to Trump coming up in a few segments. But what made you say
[25:09.280 --> 25:13.040]  the gloves are off? Any questions you want to ask? You know, everything's on the table.
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.560]  Because I'm vitally concerned about the direction of this country. And I think it is
[25:18.560 --> 25:24.000]  incredibly important to reelect the president. I see the way they have destroyed his whole
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.200]  card, the American economy. I see the way our streets are burning under a violent socialist
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.000]  revolution in our streets. And therefore, the sooner I could speak out the better,
[25:34.000 --> 25:42.160]  I cannot stand the idea that I will either be six feet under or incarcerated in October of 2020,
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.800]  when I need to be on the battlefield. That's why I decided to speak out today.
[25:46.800 --> 25:50.480]  And you told me that in confidence, but now you're just throwing it all to the wind,
[25:50.480 --> 25:53.680]  which I really respect you even more now. I want you to say it in your own words.
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.200]  You're not here for you, because you know, you'll be penalized by this judge and others for
[25:57.200 --> 26:00.880]  speaking out. You're here because you're really worried about Trump. This isn't like some leftist
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.600]  Oh, Trump's in trouble. We need to be honest, just like you were 120 something days out last
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.520]  time to Trump, you need to warn him. And undoubtedly, the president is going to get this
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.280]  message from you. So let's finish up with what happened to you, where this is all going on.
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.680]  It's part of the Russiagate hoax. And then let's tie it into what Trump needs to do because,
[26:17.680 --> 26:21.840]  believe me, obviously, you issue a message to President Trump here on the Alan Jones show.
[26:21.840 --> 26:25.760]  He's going to get it. And he needs your counsel. I wish he would just pardon you,
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.880]  not just clemency immediately and then put it in their face and put you in the White House,
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.840]  where Bannon was. He would win the election. I have no doubt he needs to double down and own
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.360]  it instead of running away from you, which he's not been doing. He's been saying
[26:39.360 --> 26:44.320]  stones innocent and tweeting how it's all fraud. So Trump gets he's in the fight of his life right
[26:44.320 --> 26:57.920]  now. We're all in it. Stay with us, Roger Stone, straight ahead. As we enter the critical month
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.840]  of July, it is very important for listeners and viewers to understand that all of the major
[27:03.840 --> 27:10.400]  storable food companies have been sold out of food for months. My Patriot supply, our supplier,
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.800]  was out to an eight week wait, not because they didn't have food, but because their four plans
[27:14.800 --> 27:21.040]  were backed up packaging and getting it out. Now they are at three to four weeks right now.
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.600]  They've gotten over the hump. Their other competitors are completely sold out or selling
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.200]  old garbage. This is high quality food. I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing and buy
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.480]  more storable food now before the next big hump comes. Because if you think things are about
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.120]  to settle down, think again, the world is only going to get more insane. I've been telling you
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.040]  this for six months. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms and ammo and water filtration,
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.880]  you better get it. If you don't have storable food, you better get it. Go to infowarstore.com
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.720]  to take care of the water filtration and to take care of the storable foods. Get your orders in now
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.960]  before the next big rush. Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.040]  Hey, hello. Can you hear me? I sure can, sir. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.800]  wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now. Sir, it's an honor to talk
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.320]  to you, brother. I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver,
[28:14.320 --> 28:21.040]  and two before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us,
[28:21.040 --> 28:28.480]  we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola,
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.200]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[28:33.200 --> 28:38.880]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is,
[28:38.880 --> 28:42.560]  so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.760]  obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.320]  design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there,
[28:50.320 --> 28:53.600]  and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you. To all your
[28:53.600 --> 29:02.480]  truck drivers, we love you. The 4th of July, 2020. We are here, and despite all the globalist attacks,
[29:02.480 --> 29:07.760]  you, the viewers and listeners of this transmission, have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth,
[29:07.760 --> 29:12.960]  and by buying the products, and you have done all of this. So when you look at the huge effect
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.800]  Info Wars has had, I want you to understand that it's because of what you have done,
[29:18.800 --> 29:27.200]  and myself and the whole crew salute you on this July 4th, 2020. We've got a lot of our best-selling
[29:27.200 --> 29:32.160]  products that were sold out, DNA Force Plus, bodies, Ultra 12, and others that have been sold
[29:32.160 --> 29:38.400]  out for months, back in stock, 50% off for the 4th of July. We're running this special,
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.560]  I want to encourage you to get these products because they have enriched my life so much.
[29:42.560 --> 29:48.080]  I know they'll enrich your life, and regardless, it's a total 360 win because it funds the Info
[29:48.080 --> 29:52.320]  War. The only way we fail is when you don't take action. I don't need to tell you that.
[29:52.320 --> 29:54.640]  You already took action, and I salute and thank you.
[29:58.320 --> 30:00.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:05.440 --> 30:11.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[30:11.760 --> 30:19.200]  And Roger Stone is here with us exclusively because he's so worried about President Trump
[30:19.200 --> 30:23.040]  and the country and what's happening in the election. They want him in prison for helping
[30:23.040 --> 30:27.920]  get Trump elected. They want him in prison for getting Trump to run, and they want to send a
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.720]  message to everybody else. I've done with General Flynn and Manafort, everybody, and how they're
[30:32.720 --> 30:37.680]  trying to indict me and put me in jail and sue me to death, that you don't stand up for America.
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.680]  I will punish you. That's why this election is so important for this country and the world.
[30:41.680 --> 30:45.600]  So, Roger Stone, I want to finish up with the persecution you've gone through and what's
[30:45.600 --> 30:49.920]  happening, and the death sentence this judge is trying to send you to in two weeks,
[30:49.920 --> 30:53.840]  and what happened in the trial, and then what people really want to hear your expertise on,
[30:54.400 --> 31:00.080]  the 2020 contest, and what you think President Trump needs to do. So, Roger, please continue.
[31:00.640 --> 31:07.120]  All right. Thank you, Alex. Again, it's great to be back. First, let me say that my affection
[31:07.120 --> 31:12.720]  and loyalty and support for this president have never flagged for a nanosecond. If you go back
[31:12.720 --> 31:20.080]  through his tweets, at the time my house was charged by 29 heavily armed FBI agents, to the
[31:20.080 --> 31:30.080]  time I was wrongfully convicted, to the time I was subjected to the corruption of this jury
[31:30.080 --> 31:38.880]  for a woman as recently as last Saturday morning, when at 7 a.m., the president retweeted a tweet
[31:38.880 --> 31:46.400]  by Lori Hendry, urging people to sign the petition at freerogerstone.com to the president,
[31:46.400 --> 31:52.720]  urging that he grant an act of clemency and either a pardon or a commutation of sentence.
[31:52.720 --> 31:58.240]  The president has correctly recognized my persecution as a miscarriage of justice,
[31:58.240 --> 32:05.920]  his words. He has said as recently as last week on Sean Hannity's terrific show that I was treated
[32:05.920 --> 32:11.280]  very, very unfairly that my conviction should have been thrown out. I should have been declared
[32:11.280 --> 32:17.120]  a mistrial. So, I have no complaints about the president whatsoever. I stand with him,
[32:17.120 --> 32:23.680]  and I think ultimately, I pray ultimately, that he will stand with me. As for my trial,
[32:23.680 --> 32:29.280]  you know that first thing they had to do was to slap a gag order on me,
[32:29.280 --> 32:35.680]  an unconstitutional gag order that held that I could not defend myself in any public forum,
[32:35.680 --> 32:42.960]  not info wars, not social media, not Fox, nowhere. And that's because they
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.640]  claimed that any social media commentary or defense of me might taint the jury. This is
[32:50.640 --> 32:56.160]  an absurd argument for which the judge offered no evidence, no proof. In fact, what about the
[32:56.160 --> 33:04.400]  tainting of the jury by the Washington Post or by CNN, the tsunami of fake news, which if you
[33:04.400 --> 33:09.840]  go back and look for 16 months here, what did they say? Roger Stone will be indicted for treason.
[33:09.840 --> 33:14.400]  Roger Stone will be charged by Mueller for conspiracy. Roger Stone will be charged for
[33:14.400 --> 33:18.640]  conspiracy against the United States. And they've had to admit no Russian collusion,
[33:18.640 --> 33:22.960]  bars come out, they've confirmed no Russian collusion by any US citizen.
[33:22.960 --> 33:27.200]  What an incredibly loyal country. All you did was get Trump elected.
[33:28.160 --> 33:33.520]  Well, Trump got Trump elected. All I did was support Donald Trump and never flagged in that
[33:33.520 --> 33:39.200]  support. Look, I admit that going back to 1988, maybe I was one of the first people right after
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.920]  former President Nixon to recognize that Donald Trump had the courage and the bravado and the
[33:45.920 --> 33:54.400]  audacity and the independence and the energy and the stamina and the anti-globalist worldview
[33:54.400 --> 34:00.480]  to be not only a great candidate for president, but a truly great president. He also had the looks.
[34:01.680 --> 34:06.640]  He's charismatic. He understood television in the television age. But let's be honest,
[34:06.640 --> 34:13.680]  he delivered in spades. They said when he became president, look, America's greatest days are behind
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.320]  us for structural reasons. We'll never bring back our economy. Those manufacturing jobs,
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.160]  they are going forever. We just have to take a back bench in the global economy and accept our
[34:24.160 --> 34:31.200]  fate. And Donald Trump said, no, wrong. And with an extraordinarily comprehensive program of
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.800]  tax reduction, regulatory reduction, and redoing the trade deals that were stealing all of our
[34:36.800 --> 34:45.280]  jobs, he gave us the greatest single economic boom in American history. We had record job creation,
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.880]  we had record wage growth, and employment among all categories, among all peoples,
[34:50.880 --> 34:57.920]  was higher in this country than it has ever been before. He rebuilt the strength of our military.
[34:57.920 --> 35:03.600]  He fought endlessly to close our southern border to make our streets and neighborhoods safer.
[35:03.600 --> 35:08.000]  But then Bill Maher said we should plunge the economy and they've used COVID-19
[35:08.640 --> 35:15.520]  to shut the economy down. What is your warning to the president? What is your advice to the
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.160]  president, Roger Stone? Well, first of all, the president has an obligation to protect
[35:20.160 --> 35:24.800]  the public health. And when you had all of these scientists making what we then thought
[35:24.800 --> 35:30.480]  legitimate projections about the rate of infection and the danger of this, I think the president
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.560]  did the only thing he could do, which was to proceed cautiously and close the country down.
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.040]  You know, he didn't like slowing and killing our economy, but he does have an obligation to
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.880]  protect the public health. And by the way, COVID virus is real. It's dangerous. I know people who
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.160]  have died from it. Members of my family know people who have died from it. This is not a hoax
[35:52.160 --> 35:59.840]  by any means. It is a very real, current danger. But at the same time, none of the projections
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.280]  that most of the scientists make panned out. The good news is that only through the bold
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.960]  leadership of the president, we close our country to China early, or this could have been much,
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.520]  much worse. Now I say to you, the way I would frame this is quite obvious.
[36:16.960 --> 36:23.120]  Our economy is now in shambles. Who do we want to lead us forward? A man who has proven
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.560]  that he knows how to revive the economy and bring us to record levels of productivity and
[36:28.560 --> 36:35.920]  prosperity, or a man whose prescription will make the sick patient even sicker. We know that Trump
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.760]  has the keys to this. He's already proven it. This is not conjecture. This is a fact. He knows
[36:41.760 --> 36:47.920]  what to do. In fact, if you saw the last jobs report, the Trump program of tax and regulatory
[36:47.920 --> 36:54.880]  reduction is already working. We're already on our way back. Whereas under Joe Biden, if we increase
[36:54.880 --> 37:01.040]  taxes, we increase regulation, we increase spending, and we redo these trade deals that have been bad
[37:01.040 --> 37:07.280]  for America, the economy won't get better. It will actually get worse. That is the choice
[37:07.280 --> 37:12.320]  that Americans have. A man that has shown he knows how to do it, or a man who will make things
[37:12.320 --> 37:19.120]  worse. That is the stark reality of the 2020 election. It's very clear. The Democrats help
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.400]  run it in the ground. They help hype it up. They cheerleader for it to fall. They screwed up beforehand.
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.080]  Do we want the guy that fixed it before when they said, when Krugman said he couldn't,
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.880]  everybody else said he couldn't? Or do we want to put these losers? Why is the Democrat field
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.120]  so bizarrely weak with Biden saying 120 million died from COVID and Pelosi looking completely
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.960]  insane? I mean, what the hell is wrong with these people? Well, let's not let's not lose
[37:44.960 --> 37:51.200]  sight of the fact that they are propped up by a malicious, vicious, fake news media. I mean,
[37:51.200 --> 37:56.720]  look, we've said it on this program before, if Donald Trump cured cancer tomorrow, found the cure
[37:56.720 --> 38:02.880]  for cancer, the headline would be, Trump puts doctors out of work. I mean, the president is
[38:02.880 --> 38:09.120]  damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. We have a violent social revolution going on in the
[38:09.120 --> 38:15.280]  streets. If the president mobilizes our military to crush the rebellion, they'll say, oh, he's a
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.840]  Hitler, he's a Nazi. And then when he doesn't, they say, oh, he's letting the streets burn in the city,
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.360]  he's burned and he's doing nothing. Look, the guy can't do anything right. Yet I'm absolutely
[38:25.360 --> 38:32.880]  convinced, despite these unfair criticisms by the mainstream media, by the by the vicious tsunami of
[38:32.880 --> 38:41.200]  fake news that rains on him and his family unfairly every single day, that he is the man to lead America.
[38:41.200 --> 38:46.720]  And all of these stories that he's having second thoughts about reelection, he's dejected, he's
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.600]  depressed, he's not going to run. That's not the Donald Trump that I know. Now, I have no inside
[38:51.600 --> 38:58.160]  information, but I know this. Donald Trump is a fighter. Donald Trump is a brawler. Who wouldn't
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.640]  be upset about the destruction of your signature whole car, the most vibrant, robust economy in
[39:04.640 --> 39:11.280]  American history? You can see why he is unhappy about that. But only one man can lead us back
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.440]  to prosperity. How do I know that? Because he's done it before. It isn't conjecture. It isn't a
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.440]  guess. It isn't. It isn't a subjective question. Donald Trump has proven he knows how to create
[39:23.440 --> 39:30.080]  jobs and economic wealth. A man who did it once can do it again. All right, Roger Stones with us
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.840]  for one more segment. I've got thousands of questions, but I'm giving him the floor because
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.240]  it's just like he said, it's great to have him back on air. It's great to hear his voice,
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.160]  to see him talking. You know, that's all been blocked by this judge, but now he's thrown all
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.240]  that to the wind because he's so worried about the country. We'll be right back just a few minutes
[39:48.240 --> 40:14.240]  on the other side of this exclusive interview with Roger Stone. Please spread the live links.
[40:18.640 --> 40:30.740]  You'll get a quick look at the Diary New Aerodyne Technology. It allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.

[41:16.240 --> 41:22.240]  Or who has been in contact with someone COVID-19 is then added into the database as having a
[41:22.240 --> 41:27.240]  case that is counted as a case of COVID-19. It's in the NIH documents. It's at the state
[41:27.240 --> 41:32.240]  level. We confirmed it in Texas. We're now confirming it's in other states. This is beyond
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.240]  the other smoking guns of them putting people with a shotgun shot wounds and stuff in the
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.240]  COVID column and the false positive test. That's all huge. This is beyond that mega
[41:42.240 --> 41:47.240]  criminal activity and we've got these every county commission videos where they're just
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.240]  freaking out over it saying what in the world is this? The full video is posted at bandon
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.240]  video. Get it out and expose the hoax.
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.240]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key. Coffee and energy
[41:59.240 --> 42:04.240]  drinks provide a short boost but the crash always follows. That's why we created a mixable
[42:04.240 --> 42:10.240]  energy formula to take on the go, Turbo Force. Turbo Force from infowar's life utilizes vitamins,
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.240]  amino acids and extracts used across the globe to provide focus, clarity and a boost of energy

[42:54.240 --> 42:59.240]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast, I'm not patting you on the head. I'm like
[42:59.240 --> 43:05.240]  a person that's been thrown overboard who finds a life raft to get on or a piece of driftwood.
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.240]  I am clinging to you. So when you call the show and thank me, listen, I'm thanking you too.
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.240]  We are in this together. Now, I try to bring you things that I know are amazing that have
[43:14.240 --> 43:19.240]  helped me and my family. So you get a great response. You order again. I treat you like
[43:19.240 --> 43:23.240]  I want to be treated. It's not a science. It's not a plan. It's just the way to do it.
[43:23.240 --> 43:28.240]  It's just common sense. And if you get one product, it's bodies. Now, our big 4th of
[43:28.240 --> 43:33.240]  July Supercell is going right now through 4th of July and bodies have been sold out for
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.240]  over three months. It's now back in stock. It is the strongest turmeric concentrate we
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.240]  can find out there. It may be the strongest on the market. Somebody might have one stronger.
[43:41.240 --> 43:46.240]  We don't know about it or we'd have it. It is back in stock at 50% off. I want to encourage
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.240]  you all to get bodies, ultimate turmeric formula while you still can, 50% off for the 4th of
[43:50.240 --> 44:05.240]  July and find the M4. M4shore.com. My salute and thank you all.
[44:20.240 --> 44:30.240]  We're living in America. He don't want to take credit for it. But it's like, yeah, you train
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.240]  a boxer. You put him in the ring. He didn't get the credit of the boxer, but he did help
[44:33.240 --> 44:39.240]  Donald Trump. You want to blame somebody or give him an award. Roger Stone is as important
[44:39.240 --> 44:43.240]  as anybody out there. Probably the most important other than Donald Trump for getting Trump to
[44:43.240 --> 44:48.240]  run. And I'm very thankful that Trump has run. I've been persecuted mildly for it. But you
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.240]  know what? All the good things in life you get persecuted for. Roger, we only got like
[44:52.240 --> 44:55.240]  10 minutes left. Maybe I can twist your arm and do five more, but you got to go. I know
[44:55.240 --> 45:00.240]  here, but I've got so many questions. Obviously, I haven't talked to Trump in a while. They're
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.240]  talking about clemency. They're talking about pardons. He said Roger has nothing to worry
[45:03.240 --> 45:08.240]  about in major tweets he's put out. Let's talk about that. I know you don't want to mess
[45:08.240 --> 45:14.240]  anything up, but what are you expecting? What are you thinking? What is the thinking on when
[45:14.240 --> 45:18.240]  you should get clemency or a pardon because Trump wants to repudiate this whole Russiagate
[45:18.240 --> 45:23.240]  hoax? Well, first of all, I have no inside information. I've been promised nothing. I've
[45:23.240 --> 45:28.240]  been assured nothing. So I can't tell you really what's going to happen other than the
[45:28.240 --> 45:34.240]  fact that July 14th is an absolute drop dead date. Why do they want to do this? It's very
[45:34.240 --> 45:41.240]  simple, Alex, because the Deep State and Judge Jackson would like me to die in a COVID-infested
[45:41.240 --> 45:47.240]  prison before my appeal is heard a year from now, because when my appeal is heard, the
[45:47.240 --> 45:55.240]  epic corruption of my trial, of the judge, of her clerks, of the Mueller prosecutors is
[45:55.240 --> 46:02.240]  going to be exposed. They can't afford that, which is why I have an essence for a series
[46:02.240 --> 46:09.240]  of completely fabricated process crimes and essentially getting capital punishment, the
[46:09.240 --> 46:14.240]  death penalty. That's what this is Tadamot to. So one of the important things I wanted
[46:14.240 --> 46:22.240]  to do here today is appeal to your audience, to appeal to the president, to as a humanitarian
[46:22.240 --> 46:29.240]  act of both mercy and justice, to use his extraordinary powers of clemency so that I
[46:29.240 --> 46:36.240]  can avoid dying in a dank, squalid prison someplace when I should be on the battlefield
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.240]  doing everything I humanly can on my own. I'm not looking for a job to re-elect this
[46:42.240 --> 46:48.240]  president. It's that important. I honestly believe that this country will hurdle over
[46:48.240 --> 46:54.240]  the cliff towards globalism and that we will have chaos in America and there is only one
[46:54.240 --> 47:00.240]  man with the courage and the stamina and the fortitude to stop it. I saw it a long time
[47:00.240 --> 47:06.240]  ago. Let's be very clear. Donald Trump is responsible for the election of Donald Trump.
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.240]  And he's right. I had no formal role in his campaign. I was doing everything I could,
[47:11.240 --> 47:16.240]  including the publication of my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which I still think
[47:16.240 --> 47:22.240]  is not only the definitive opposition research on the Clintons and their epic corruption,
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.240]  but is one of the main reasons why I was targeted. Here's something interesting that we learned
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.240]  Alex. When Rod Rosenstein testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee a couple
[47:31.240 --> 47:38.240]  weeks ago, he admitted that the investigation into Roger Stone was not opened until October
[47:38.240 --> 47:46.240]  of 2017. That means three months after Robert Mueller already knew there was no Russian collusion,
[47:46.240 --> 47:53.240]  proving that my persecution was a political hit job. They knew I had no involvement with
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.240]  the Russians. And then Rosenstein in that same under oath testimony went on to say that
[47:59.240 --> 48:05.240]  he is not the one who approved it. But that was a lie because the scope memo that authorized
[48:05.240 --> 48:11.240]  the investigation into me was signed by Rosenstein himself. It's a public document now thanks
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.240]  to the heroic efforts of Rick Brinnell, one of the president's greatest temporary appointees
[48:16.240 --> 48:21.240]  and ultimately one of the real stars of this administration, who got the documents declassified
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.240]  to prove one. And by the way, I was about to say in those new documents, Strock and Page
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.240]  are admitting that Obama and Biden ordered all this, not just during the campaign, but
[48:32.240 --> 48:38.240]  after they were out of office. That is smoking gun illegality. Trump's called it treason.
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.240]  What do you think we should expect if Trump gets reelected? Because like you said, his
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.240]  philosophy is he doesn't attack, but if you do attack, he strikes back 10 times harder.
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.240]  He said that himself. What do you expect? They've got to be really scared if he gets
[48:50.240 --> 48:51.240]  reelected.
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.240]  Well, it's a backwards world. You hear people like Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff talking
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.240]  about how Bill Barr and Donald Trump are destroying the rule of law. What are these guys talking
[49:01.240 --> 49:07.240]  about? They weren't screaming when Loretta Lynch as Attorney General wired the investigation
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.240]  into Hillary Clinton and her illegal email server. They weren't screaming when Eric Holder
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.240]  basically snuffed the Congress, snubbed the Congress on Fast and Furious, and let's face
[49:19.240 --> 49:26.240]  it, the Obama administration has been caught red handed indisputably in the greatest single
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.240]  abuse of power in American history.
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.240]  So how does Trump go on the offense? How does Trump go on the offense?
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.240]  I think we have to make sure people understand what happened here. They use the full authority
[49:37.240 --> 49:43.240]  of the United States government and the incredible capability of our intelligence agencies to
[49:43.240 --> 49:49.240]  defraud the FISA court and to use the authority and capability of the government to spy on
[49:49.240 --> 49:50.240]  the Republican candidate.
[49:50.240 --> 49:54.240]  So this wasn't just a kill against Trump, it was a kill against the Republican rule of
[49:54.240 --> 49:55.240]  law.
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.240]  There's no question about it. They were trying to undo the results of the 2016 elections
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.240]  and we now know definitive that there was never any legal, legitimate basis for the
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.240]  opening of this investigation.
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.240]  And imagine if Nixon tried something like this. He just thought about little stuff. This
[50:12.240 --> 50:17.240]  is so much more gargantuan and red handed. We hear about the CIA overthrowing countries.
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.240]  This is America they tried to overthrow.
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.240]  It's really quite extraordinary. Look, this has been a difficult and debilitating fight.
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.240]  I mean, I will admit too that I am tired. I am battered.
[50:30.240 --> 50:34.240]  I was about to ask you though, Roger, I don't mean to interrupt. What is it like to be at
[50:34.240 --> 50:39.240]  the super center of history? I don't envy you, but I kind of do. I mean, you are a major
[50:39.240 --> 50:44.240]  historical figure now. This is beyond witch hunt. I mean, this is beyond Salem trials.
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.240]  I mean, this is insane.
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.240]  Well, if I had my choice, I would wish somebody else was in this place, but say what you just
[50:51.240 --> 50:57.240]  to follow up. Let me say a couple of things. This I'm not yet finished. The final chapter
[50:57.240 --> 51:02.240]  of Roger Stone is not written. I have put my faith completely in God. We've talked about
[51:02.240 --> 51:09.240]  that privately. I was very, very fortunate back in January to meet Reverend Franklin Graham
[51:09.240 --> 51:15.240]  as a 12 year old boy. I saw Billy Graham's preach to a tent revival in Bridgeport,
[51:15.240 --> 51:21.240]  Connecticut was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I still remember how charismatic
[51:21.240 --> 51:26.240]  he was, how riveting he was. When I was working for President Richard Nixon, I had the
[51:26.240 --> 51:30.240]  opportunity to meet him and shake his hand. I think Reverend Billy Graham was one of the
[51:30.240 --> 51:37.240]  greatest figures of this century. I had the absolute privilege to meet his son, Franklin
[51:37.240 --> 51:45.240]  Graham at a time, Eric Alex, that my life was an absolute turmoil. I was worried. I was angry.
[51:45.240 --> 51:52.240]  I was frustrated. Really, I was not sleeping. It was horrific. And I spilled out my heart to
[51:52.240 --> 51:57.240]  Reverend Graham. And he said, you know, there's a simple answer to this. You need to turn your
[51:57.240 --> 52:03.240]  life back over to Jesus Christ. You need to confess your sins and get right with Jesus.
[52:03.240 --> 52:09.240]  And I absolutely guarantee you, God will protect you. God will walk with you. If you try to
[52:09.240 --> 52:15.240]  live within his laws, he will protect you. I thought about that. And then on that very
[52:15.240 --> 52:21.240]  same day, I stood with 500 others in a public park in Boca Raton and I witnessed before God
[52:21.240 --> 52:27.240]  I confessed my sins because there's no question in my younger days, I had some pretty wild
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.240]  times. And then Reverend Graham sent me a Bible with certain sections annotated. I'll be honest
[52:32.240 --> 52:36.240]  with you, whenever I get angry, whenever I get frustrated, I go back to that Bible.
[52:36.240 --> 52:41.240]  But you told me about the time privately that the depression ended and suddenly your
[52:41.240 --> 52:45.240]  fortunes turned like the next day.
[52:45.240 --> 52:50.240]  There is no question. It is amazing as soon as I put this all in the hands of God, as
[52:50.240 --> 52:55.240]  soon as I professed again and reaffirmed my belief in Jesus Christ, because I was born
[52:55.240 --> 53:01.240]  as a Catholic. I got all my sacraments in that church. I am still a Catholic. I am,
[53:01.240 --> 53:07.240]  more importantly, a Christian. And I believe that I am protected by God. And in the end,
[53:07.240 --> 53:10.240]  I will win this epic struggle.
[53:10.240 --> 53:15.240]  So you've publicly, you were already loved God, but now you've publicly chosen a side.
[53:15.240 --> 53:17.240]  That's what God wants.
[53:17.240 --> 53:26.240]  Well, there's no question. You know, I have been enormously given enormous strength and
[53:26.240 --> 53:31.240]  insertitude by reading the Psalms and reading the Proverbs and learning the Bible. I had
[53:31.240 --> 53:35.240]  no idea that this book was so practical that if you know what you're looking for, there
[53:35.240 --> 53:39.240]  is solid advice for you, no matter what calamity or what problem.
[53:39.240 --> 53:43.240]  Well, there are no atheists and foxholes. Before you got to go, get into your defense
[53:43.240 --> 53:47.240]  and get into the t-shirt you're wearing. Roger Stone still did nothing wrong.
[53:47.240 --> 53:53.240]  First of all, you can get the original Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt at Info Wars
[53:53.240 --> 53:58.240]  in the store. Now, this is important because these are limited and this particular t-shirt
[53:58.240 --> 54:04.240]  is going to end up in the Smithsonian. So my advice to you is to get this collector's item
[54:04.240 --> 54:09.240]  while they are still available. There are not going to be any more of them made.
[54:09.240 --> 54:16.240]  If you want to help me in this epic fight immediately, sign the petition at freerogerstone.com.
[54:16.240 --> 54:23.240]  That's freerogerstone.com. It is a petition to the president urging him as an act of
[54:23.240 --> 54:30.240]  humanity and in the name of justice and mercy to extend clemency, grant clemency to me either
[54:30.240 --> 54:36.240]  in the form of a commutation of sentence. So I may pursue my appeal or a pardon.
[54:36.240 --> 54:39.240]  And lastly, if you want to help me in the horrific expense.
[54:39.240 --> 54:42.240]  Hold on. You got to do five more minutes. We're back in two minutes.
[54:42.240 --> 54:45.240]  We got to go do five more minutes, Roger Stone, to finish up.
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.240]  What can I say to the viewers and listeners? Thank you for supporting us.
[54:48.240 --> 54:53.240]  You've done a great job. We've done amazing things together. The war is now out in the open.
[54:53.240 --> 54:59.240]  You can see that Info Wars world vision of who the globalists are and who we are
[54:59.240 --> 55:03.240]  has been very, very accurate. We're not just some little Hollywood,
[55:03.240 --> 55:06.240]  New World Order, rabbit trail, trying to distract humanity.
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.240]  We're the zeitgeist and the spirit of liberty together in a symbiotic relationship
[55:11.240 --> 55:17.240]  that believes in humanity. And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[55:17.240 --> 55:24.240]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.240]  the guests, the callers, the host, we will fail. I'm stating the obvious here.
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.240]  I want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support, no matter what color you are
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.240]  or where you came from. If you love human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together,
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.240]  and I salute and thank you all. Now share those links at band.video
[55:42.240 --> 56:11.240]  and cross the globalist murderers.
[56:12.240 --> 56:20.240]  And that's all Trump's fault. And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city
[56:20.240 --> 56:34.240]  We've got to lock down again, everything's over.
[56:34.240 --> 56:38.360]  However, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.760]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it.
[56:42.760 --> 56:48.760]  Your choice.
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:52.240 --> 57:00.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[57:00.240 --> 57:03.240]  All right, I really like Roger Stone.
[57:03.240 --> 57:07.680]  I met him like eight years ago at JFK event in Dallas and then got to know him early in
[57:07.680 --> 57:08.680]  the Trump campaign.
[57:08.680 --> 57:11.240]  He became really good friends, but I'd get mad at him because he was just saying, I'm
[57:11.240 --> 57:12.240]  not a Russian agent.
[57:12.240 --> 57:15.240]  I mean, he was co-hosting the war room and like, dude, we all know that we're sick of
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.240]  it, but he was fighting for his life.
[57:16.240 --> 57:17.240]  Then he got indicted.
[57:17.240 --> 57:18.240]  I was like, oh, you were right.
[57:18.240 --> 57:19.240]  It just sounded so crazy.
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.280]  I knew we weren't involved with the Russians or WikiLeaks or any of this.
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.240]  I just can't wait till he's pardoned or has clemency so he can be in this campaign and
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.360]  he can be on air and talking about Nixon and talking about the Clintons and just having
[57:33.360 --> 57:34.360]  his speech.
[57:34.360 --> 57:38.040]  So Roger, in closing, I want you to plug the new T-shirt to fund it because I know what
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.040]  lawyers cost.
[57:39.040 --> 57:45.960]  I know you've had lost your house, everything, but before we do that, I know you say Trump
[57:45.960 --> 57:46.960]  might be in trouble.
[57:46.960 --> 57:52.080]  That's why you're here or whatever, but what finally got you really mad and made you say,
[57:52.080 --> 57:53.080]  screw it.
[57:53.080 --> 57:54.080]  I've been told not to have my free speech.
[57:54.080 --> 57:55.080]  I'm going to do it.
[57:55.080 --> 58:02.080]  Well, first of all, the official gag order was dropped at the time that the judge decided
[58:02.080 --> 58:09.920]  not to grant me a new trial and ordered that I be incarcerated no less than three weeks
[58:09.920 --> 58:12.800]  after, pardon me, no, yes, no less than three weeks after that.
[58:12.800 --> 58:14.680]  Can we talk about the other stuff that was there?
[58:14.680 --> 58:16.320]  There was some other things.
[58:16.320 --> 58:23.840]  Well, then the Federal Bureau of Prisons first assigned me a date of June 30th.
[58:23.840 --> 58:28.560]  Free filed, as I said, an emergency motion to fight that, but I'm now free to say what
[58:28.560 --> 58:34.360]  I want and I am deeply concerned about this next election being stolen.
[58:34.360 --> 58:40.600]  The idea of a mail-in ballot system is an open invitation for voter fraud.
[58:40.600 --> 58:46.280]  12 states, Constitution specifically require in-person voting.
[58:46.280 --> 58:48.560]  They don't even have absentee voting.
[58:48.560 --> 58:54.040]  Probably 35 states require the showing of a photo ID.
[58:54.040 --> 58:59.680]  So you cannot just run roughshod over state constitutions and state law requiring what
[58:59.680 --> 59:03.520]  it takes to vote by federal fiat.
[59:03.520 --> 59:05.360]  It doesn't work that way.
[59:05.360 --> 59:08.320]  But you can see what the Democrats are up to.
[59:08.320 --> 59:11.560]  They have the weakest candidate in their history.
[59:11.560 --> 59:18.000]  Joe Biden is personally responsible to the 1994 crime bill for the mass incarceration
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.360]  of more black people, more African-Americans, more people of color than anyone currently
[59:23.360 --> 59:25.320]  in American politics.
[59:25.320 --> 59:31.120]  The harsh, mandatory penalties for the first time nonviolent crime of possession of small
[59:31.120 --> 59:32.560]  amounts of drugs.
[59:32.560 --> 59:39.560]  The turbocharging of the war on drugs has been a social, economic, racist failure.
[59:39.560 --> 59:40.800]  It has not worked.
[59:40.800 --> 59:43.880]  It is ruining lives, it is ruining families.
[59:43.880 --> 59:45.800]  No one is being rehabilitated.
[59:45.800 --> 59:51.920]  And if you're a conservative, you're paying billions now in taxes to house and feed people
[59:51.920 --> 59:53.640]  who are not violent criminals.
[59:53.640 --> 59:55.880]  This is one of the best issues for Donald Trump.
[59:55.880 --> 59:56.880]  Why?
[59:56.880 --> 1:00:02.000]  Because Donald Trump under the Second Chance Act is the person giving these people who
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:09.120]  are locked in the bowels of our penal system for 15, 20, 25 years a second chance at life.
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  And he's also anti-war.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:15.600]  I think you should start doing weekly addresses to the nation like 8 p.m. central and laying
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.320]  this out at the Oval Office.
[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:19.360]  You should use the power of the Oval Office.
[1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:20.440]  We're almost out of time.
[1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.440]  Tell folks about the new shirt.
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:23.360]  Roger Stone still did nothing wrong.
[1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:25.280]  And how folks support you.
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:30.840]  You can go to StoneDefenseFund.com because I have to file my appeal.
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:36.760]  If the president in his wisdom decides to commute my sentence, I still have to pay for a million
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:41.000]  dollar appeal to overturn my conviction.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.480]  If the president pardons me, well, then this fight is finally over and I get back to making
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:50.640]  a living and finishing a book and writing yet another book.
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:53.560]  And I pray for that every single day.
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:01:00.520]  If you want to get a t-shirt like the one I am wearing, you can go to fightback.store.
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  That's fightback.store.
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:07.120]  But I urge you to go to the InfoWars site to get the original because there's a very,
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:11.200]  very limited number of those and they will not be available again.
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:12.200]  Well, that's right.
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:13.200]  We're almost sold out.
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:14.200]  But Roger, don't worry about us.
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:15.720]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:16.720]  You're a target.
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  You're a beta test.
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.440]  They've told me in behind the scenes, you know what's going on.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:21.440]  If they can get you, they're going to indict me.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:24.120]  But they're still going to, they're going to trump the whole rush of things and start
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  back up.
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:28.560]  I mean, there's still have groups of Democrats in there operating.
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.320]  I think overall Bill Barr is a good guy.
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:33.000]  I just don't, people realize how dangerous this is.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.560]  Well, there's no question.
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:39.880]  That's why we have to do whatever is humanly possible necessary to, to reelect the president.
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:43.600]  What really makes me sick is these country club Republicans are already leaking.
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.440]  Oh, we're in panic mode.
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:46.720]  We're going to lose the Senate.
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:47.720]  Trump's a sure loser.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:48.720]  That's Roger Stone.
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.840]  Hold on, folks.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:56.920]  I told you this five months ago and now it's official.
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:00.160]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and Andy is permanent.
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:05.400]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew that once
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:09.320]  they got the public for several months to wear masks and social distance, they would
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:13.600]  be able to permanently turn it on and off at any time they want by putting handcuffs
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.520]  on someone and then add new demands that people take for some oscillations that they have
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:23.600]  contact tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:27.960]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government for some oculation and
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:30.920]  complete enslavement of the human population.
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:32.800]  This is medical tyranny.
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.600]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN takeover.
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.840]  This is the end of civilization.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.400]  As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:45.560]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.560]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:48.560]  Show them the numbers.
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:51.720]  Show them the facts and explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  don't wake up and resist.
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:03:06.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:09.120]  front lines of the Info War.
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:13.680]  Well, Roger Stone's a really smart guy and a funny guy and a talented guy and a good
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:14.680]  friend of mine.
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:17.800]  We've been through the wars together the last five years, met him like seven, eight years
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:25.640]  ago but been good friends for many years now and it just feels good, you know, it's like
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:29.440]  feels like family getting back on a lot of stuff behind the scenes, why he couldn't come
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:36.560]  on and he was starting to really, if you just joined us as we start our two into blue blood
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:42.560]  Republicans who are leftist or America haters and have their problems and are mentally ill.
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:46.000]  But blue blood Republicans are a disgusting lot as well.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.840]  They just think everything's okay, they're insulated, they're living off old family money
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:56.120]  and if they think Trump's got this and they don't realize how dangerous things are, they
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:57.400]  are living on other planets.
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:01.160]  So, Roger, your emergency message to the country club Republicans.
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:05.640]  Yeah, it's been very disturbing over the last couple of days I've seen these fake stories
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:10.680]  about how Trump's heart is really not in it, he's not going to fight for reelection, he's
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:14.120]  thinking about heading for the tall grass, that's not the Trump I know.
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:18.520]  Trump I know is a fighter, Trump I know is a brawler, the Trump I know will never leave
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:20.000]  this country in the lurch.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.880]  But I also know that there are members of the Trump campaign staff at the lower levels
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:29.960]  who are out shopping a memoir, tell all memoirs because they're already assuming his defeat.
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:32.400]  He's not going to lose, he's going to win.
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:38.280]  He's going to win if every one of us recognizes the inherent danger of his loss.
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:42.080]  He's the only thing that stands between us and globalism.
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:47.160]  He's the only thing that stands between us and a total socialist takeover of America.
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:54.600]  This may well be our last presidential election if he does not win, I really believe that.
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:57.280]  And my confidence in him has never been shaken.
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:05.320]  Look Alex, this is really clear, on July 24th, 2019, the prosecutors working for Mueller
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:11.600]  approached one of my lawyers to propose a deal and they were very careful in their
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:12.600]  reporting.
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:15.600]  They said, it's time for your client to confess.
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:18.400]  It's time for your client to come clean.
[1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:24.640]  It's time for your client to re-remember these phone calls we have a record of between
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:27.360]  he and candidate Trump in 2016.
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:33.160]  And if he's prepared to tell the truth, which is that these phone calls pertain to coordinating
[1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:38.640]  the timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures in Russia, well we might be willing to propose
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:41.560]  to the judge that he served no time.
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:44.280]  In other words, they wanted me to lie.
[1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:50.040]  They put me under enormous financial and legal pressure to bear false witness against the
[1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:53.320]  president and I refuse to do this.
[1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:55.400]  I can document this.
[1:05:55.400 --> 1:06:01.640]  It is something that I have never regretted, not for a minute, staring into the abyss looking
[1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:07.240]  at 40 months in jail and what is in fact a de facto death sentence right now.
[1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:13.520]  I still say to you, I regret nothing that I did during the 2016 election because I didn't
[1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:15.680]  do anything wrong.
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:23.160]  In her tongue lashing at me of the sentence, the judge said that I was a belligerent.
[1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:25.840]  Let me define that for you.
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:27.960]  That means I wouldn't plead guilty.
[1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:33.640]  That means I wouldn't take responsibility for a crime I did not commit, which is my right
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:34.840]  as an American.
[1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:39.520]  And particularly, I would not roll over on the president of the United States like Michael
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:42.480]  Cohn and tell them what they wanted to hear.
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:45.360]  This was weeks before the Mueller report came out.
[1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:50.560]  It was clear to me they had no evidence of Russian collusion, but because the president
[1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:56.920]  had correctly and honestly said in the written answers to the Mueller interrogatory, the written
[1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:02.160]  questions that he and I never discussed WikiLeaks, they thought that they could trip him up by
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:06.040]  getting me to say otherwise, and I refused.
[1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:12.240]  The accounts of Rick Gates at my trial, the accounts of Michael Cohn before the two Senate
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.000]  committees and the House Oversight Committee are uncorroborated lies.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.480]  Well, that's right.
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:22.000]  And Trump's talked about the treason and the illegality and the Russiagate was a fraud
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  and Ukrainegate was a fraud and now all this is a fraud.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.640]  And that's really the problem is they never get in trouble, so they just keep doing it
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:29.640]  over and over again.
[1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:32.400]  You know I'm the inside baseball, I can't talk about it on air because I had agreements
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:33.400]  I wouldn't.
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:36.880]  They've approached me and said, come out against Trump, the Second Amendment will drop the
[1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:37.880]  lawsuits.
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:41.960]  They've come out and said, hey, a big billionaire, well-known guy, he wants to give you a First
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:43.760]  Amendment foundation and give you money.
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:47.960]  Instead of lawsuits, we'll give you money or, oh, we won't indict you.
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:49.800]  You need to really come out against Trump.
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:55.400]  This is a major squeeze against the American people by the deep state and the fact that
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:08:01.800]  now almost four years in, they can't execute, shows to their minions they're losing power.
[1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:06.320]  But that's what's scary is now they're really getting desperate, Roger.
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:10.200]  Well, that's why they want me off the battlefield for 2020.
[1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:13.120]  That's what I think most of this is really about.
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:15.360]  That's my closing thing, get you off the battlefield.
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:16.360]  Talk about that.
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:20.720]  How beautiful if you got clemency next week or a pardon and then instead of running from
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:25.520]  you, Trump brought you in as a spokesperson or brought you in as an advisor.
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.600]  The president has never run from me.
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:29.120]  Look at his history of tweets.
[1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:30.120]  No, no, he hasn't.
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:31.120]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:32.840]  He said, Roger, nothing wrong.
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:34.640]  Roger doesn't worry about.
[1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:39.720]  Roger's been saying, I'm saying, instead of saying, pardon you and then just bring you
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:43.080]  in front and center in press conferences.
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:44.080]  That would be so powerful.
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.320]  Well, but let me be very clear.
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:49.160]  I'm not looking for a job in his campaign entourage.
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:56.000]  I think what I did in 2016 by making African-Americans aware of the existence of Danny Williams, who
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:04.320]  was on this show, who is in fact the illegitimate son of Bill Clinton, who was cut off by Hillary,
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:10.960]  not by Bill, by revealing Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults against multiple women.
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:15.720]  But far more importantly, the role Hillary played in bullying and intimidating and threatening
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:16.720]  those women.
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:17.720]  That's right.
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:18.720]  You didn't do the dirty work.
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:21.000]  You did the dangerous work nobody else would do.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  And we did it as well.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And the listeners did it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.120]  You exposed what was documented reality.
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.000]  And that's exactly what you're saying.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.160]  Make you a free agent and you'll get back in the fight.
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:36.720]  I will do everything I possibly can within the bounds of the law to reelect this president
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:39.160]  as I did four years ago.
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:41.640]  They know that I'm a scrapper and a fighter.
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:46.320]  I'm tired of reading Roger Stone, self-described dirty trickster.
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:51.560]  Roger Stone self-proclaimed I have never called my that myself that I have never proclaimed
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:56.680]  myself that I have acknowledged that Democrats who I have beaten have called me that.
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.640]  But now it's ubiquitous and now it's all over.
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:00.640]  I did.
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.640]  Well, Roger.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:05.280]  It's like when they say Jones, who admits he's an actor and admits he's fake, million
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:06.280]  dollars.
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:07.280]  You have that.
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:08.280]  I never said that.
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:09.280]  I'm totally real.
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.280]  Have I been in a few movies?
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:11.280]  Have I done acting?
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:12.280]  Yes.
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:14.280]  That's like saying, have I played croquet, but I'm not a croquet player.
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.280]  Have I played basketball?
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:16.280]  Yeah.
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  I'm not a basketball player.
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.280]  Have I shot guns?
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:19.280]  Yeah.
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:20.280]  I'm not an Olympic marksman.
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:22.480]  The idea that I'm an actor, you're a fraud.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:23.880]  It's a fraud.
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:24.880]  I agree.
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:31.560]  So one more time, sign the petition at freerodgerstone.com, freerodgerstone.com.
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:37.000]  Part of our campaign to make sure the president is aware that, you know, I have basically
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:43.760]  14 days, 14 days from now, I will have to report to a prison in rural Georgia.
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:47.240]  And as I've said, I believe it is a death sentence.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:50.560]  I believe it is the end of the line.
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:51.560]  And I'm praying fervently.
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.040]  Well, not just from COVID.
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:57.040]  I mean, they'll try to abstain you, and I know they'll put you in solitary confinement
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.040]  like Manafort.
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.240]  And we don't want to put you in the clutches of these guys.
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:05.160]  Well, let's not get my wife more upset than she already is, but I recognize that's a very
[1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:06.160]  real danger.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:11.600]  No matter what, there's no circumstance whatsoever in which I will ever betray this president.
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:14.160]  I have great affection for him and for his family.
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:18.000]  And you'll never commit suicide, and you'll never commit suicide.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  You'll never commit suicide.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.400]  No, if they ever tell you Stone killed himself, you will know that somehow the Clintons are
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:24.400]  involved.
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:25.900]  I will never do that.
[1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:28.480]  As a Christian, it is prohibited.
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:31.560]  I would never, under any circumstances, do that.
[1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:35.720]  So if they come back to you and tell you, oh, he was despondent, he killed himself, that
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  will never happen.
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.400]  But let's get the statement clear without me interrupting, because number one, you're
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.520]  a fighter, you crave the fight, you don't look for it.
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:48.400]  Say a statement, Roger Stone, will you kill yourself in prison if they lock you up as
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:49.400]  a political president?
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:52.840]  Alex, there's no circumstances under which I will do that.
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:53.840]  God will protect me.
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.560]  I believe that at the end of the day, justice will be done in my case.
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.360]  I am praying to this president.
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:03.560]  I'm praying more importantly to God to protect me, because I know he will.
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:08.040]  I've learned it in the Bible, and it has been, it has been solace.
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:09.040]  It has been strength.
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:12.720]  It has given me the fortitude to continue the fight.
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:16.640]  I could not have done it any other way.
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:20.520]  So Roger, we salute you and just, just, I mean, can you just say with all of us here,
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:26.000]  in the name of Jesus Christ, we beg for justice with Roger Stone, but just please, Jesus protect
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  me.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Absolutely.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.560]  In the name of Jesus Christ Almighty, in the name of our savior and Lord, I walk with
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:39.240]  him, and I ask that he protect me and my family in these final days of my epic struggle
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  for freedom.
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:43.760]  In the name of Jesus, amen, all of us together for Roger Stone.
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  We love you, Roger.
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:45.760]  We'll talk to you soon.
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:46.760]  We salute you.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  Thank you for so much time.
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:49.440]  We are all Roger Stone right now, folks.
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:50.440]  Pray for Roger Stone.
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:51.760]  They want to make him a political president.
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:52.760]  We won't let it happen.
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:56.400]  It just happened on Tuesday morning, rather than to work about to break the big Roger
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:02.520]  Stone news and the big COVID-19 hoax news, and I met a red light at the corner of Brody
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:07.800]  and 290, and an old Mercedes pulls up next to me, and a Hispanic man and two white women
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:12.320]  start flipping me off, and I thought they recognized who I was, so I rolled down my
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:17.080]  window and I said, what, COVID-19's a hoax, and they were going, F-U, F-U, F-U, F-U, F-U,
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.760]  and I said, is that your IQ?
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:24.000]  One finger, so they got put up two fingers, I said, oh, it's 11, and I was like, do you
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  know who I am?
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  They're like shaking their heads.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.520]  They go, where your mask?
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:28.520]  Where your mask?
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:29.520]  And they're pointing at the mask.
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:32.800]  So I guess Joy Bayar, when she says she goes around and does this with her husband, this
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:33.800]  is a thing, man.
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:35.920]  Their cult is going crazy.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.440]  Their control freaks, their attacking language, borders, everything, because they all bet
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:44.760]  on leftist garbage and it hasn't delivered to them, so they're totally going completely
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:45.760]  insane.
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:48.760]  This is crazy.
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.080]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:55.880]  The 4th of July 2020 special has gone into high gear.

[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:50.320]  focus, and your support.
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:57.320]  Again, I salute you all.
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:47.600]  This country is fighting for its life, and there's so many giant things breaking it makes
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:48.920]  my head spin now.
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:55.000]  I have a thousand ways to start this segment, and incredible articles, videos that we haven't
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.920]  even hit that are super entertaining and interesting, I probably won't get to any of it, because
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:02.800]  the core issues are what matters, and the understanding of that.
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:07.960]  So I've told the story probably 3,000 times, I started a lot of the shows with this.
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:12.640]  26 years ago on Radio and TV, I might have never said the first few years this is the
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:16.440]  biggest show I've ever done, and then about 15 years ago, maybe once a year, I'd say
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.800]  biggest show ever, and then as time goes on, it's like every month and then every week
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:25.760]  and then every day, it's the quickening, it's the compounding.
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:32.280]  Now there is more news breaking today of just over-the-top nature than has broken the last
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:37.240]  month, and that's the thing about the quickening is it's going to get more insane, it's going
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:42.800]  to get more crazy, it's going to get more out of control, and it's all just going to
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:47.920]  come out in the open, but here's the secret, the key, the core, the rosetta stone, the
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:50.320]  skeleton key.
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:56.040]  By the time we fully wake up, the globalist will be in AI robot control, will be domesticated,
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:17:01.360]  and we're going to have the total choice of joining Satan and pedophilia and world government
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:07.280]  and the end of our species to just live a few more years, or we have to fight it and
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:10.160]  most of us die.
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:14.240]  And so, I've never really been super scared to die, I mean I'm willing to do what has
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:18.160]  to be done, I've gone through a lot of stuff in my life, I realized that all those persecution
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:21.920]  things I went through was God preparing me so I could handle this at this point.
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:26.680]  I'm very thankful for the persecution now, I thank God for everything, every time I got
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:32.000]  too bad I couldn't take it, God gave in, it was crazy, it's been quite a journey now,
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:40.720]  in hindsight it's 2020 I can see God's hand on me the whole time, God's hands on you as
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:47.400]  well, but we should really mourn for the people that have been turned over to evil and who
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:52.560]  were cut off from God because it's a spiritual choice they're making and they're already
[1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:58.400]  in a bad place and they're going to go to a much, much worse place and there's a big
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:01.720]  letter out from a famous environmentalist today that I have time, I'll get to David
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:09.400]  and I covered it at the end of his broadcast today at about 10.50 or so is powerful, hopefully
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:15.720]  they'll put it out as a report and this fellow bought into it all, did it all, well known
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:19.760]  author, well known person that believed it, went to the Amazon to help people, traveled
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:25.640]  all over, chained himself to bulldozers and he saw how mentally ill his daughter was and
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:30.400]  suicidal and having guilt about herself and how it was all a fraud what he'd been taught
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:33.960]  and how they're really actually hurting the real environment with this fake environmental
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:39.800]  movement saying heat is the problem and carbon dioxide is the problem, genetic engineering,
[1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:46.000]  nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors out of control, gene splicing, that's the threat to everybody
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  and the planet.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:51.520]  It's a very powerful article it's on info wars.com, in fact I had it here in the stack
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:55.280]  I was looking for it during the break, you guys reprinted for me it'd be great but there's
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:58.200]  so many hundreds of articles about the time I read over and I'm like, put them in the
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:04.800]  stacks you can't find them even though I try to organize all this but I can do a whole
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:10.440]  show just on this well known individual just finally come into Jesus and go and man this
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.720]  is an anti-human system to kill everybody and it's depressing and it's a lie and it's
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:21.000]  about how we suck and we don't suck we're not going to decide to just roll over to die
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:26.280]  because a bunch of Satanists want control we're not perfect but we're not going to be directed
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:34.680]  by a bunch of Satanist and then I already knew this but right before the broadcast started
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:39.720]  they come in and they give me a mainstream German newspaper article about 30,000 people
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:45.720]  under investigation for a powerful governmental level pedophile ring in German.
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:52.000]  Now remember the psychiatrist at Berlin running thousands of kids to people over 30 years
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:58.720]  and now with that bust it expanded out with the list to where the people now adults say
[1:19:58.720 --> 1:20:05.920]  the judges and the politicians and the police chiefs were coming so when you see one of
[1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:11.360]  these leftist globalist politicians they're either a pedophile or worse or they've been
[1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:17.800]  abused and have been programmed when I say programmed I mean McCron was a sex object
[1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:25.080]  on record when he was 12 years old at satanic parties McCron has obviously been programmed
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:33.200]  electro shock you name it go about MK ultra he's it these groups groom and prepare people
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:41.040]  for control so they know they've got full control of them well the new world order's
[1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:45.720]  got its programming regimen God's got his so you while the enemies building their soldiers
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:51.080]  God's building his building you what you went through in your life so those persecutions
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:54.920]  and bad things that happen to you when you fought back against them and even if you didn't
[1:20:54.920 --> 1:21:00.720]  overcome them if you fought against them you became stronger not weaker own your persecution
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:08.400]  own when you've been outnumbered own it that's the power that's what makes you strong not
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:12.600]  saying I'm a victim and rolling over and pissing all over yourself like these videos coming
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:15.960]  into this latest Karen video I forgot to tell you guys to get it go ask McBreen he's got
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:19.560]  it of this woman flips this guy off and cuts him off she pulls over his lady why are you
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:27.040]  being mean she's just going black person don't hurt me she's a liberal and she's like covering
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:30.680]  her life's plate and crying and this video this white dude the black dude hits him he
[1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:35.520]  falls down and starts pissing on himself the brainwash racist black guy's got problems
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.880]  but at least he thinks he's doing something the person that pisses on themselves and gets
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:50.240]  on the ground and begs like a baby is the real enemy let me let me tell all the limperist
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.640]  and people I don't mean you're gay I mean people that are into being weak when folks
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:22:01.960]  that are predators look for somebody like you you know I've had a couple big predators
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:05.800]  before come across me and try to shake me down when I'm and they can just tell it's
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:09.560]  not going to be easy and I just tell them look let's just go ahead let's start dying
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:14.280]  they always go away because they're going to go on to an easier subject because they
[1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:19.160]  know I'm not bluffing I'm ready to kill people and they might win but they're going to fight
[1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:24.720]  somebody that is going to hurt them really bad because I kick like a mule and I fight
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:30.840]  like a crocodile and I bite people too you get me down I start biting big ass chunks
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:36.600]  out of you say you like that big chunks see most people have a governor where they can't
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:42.480]  jump down I'm bitten chunks out of people had me down the size of a two ounces of meat
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:46.480]  you don't think the biggest roughest guy gets off my back when I'm the ground when I jump
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:53.280]  into his leg I've done it many times I'll bite right through your jeans I'll tear a

[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:30.760]  I had intended to do the whole show last night on the covid 19 hoax coming down because that's
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:35.560]  the key is stopping world depression hundreds of millions carving to death but I don't just
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:40.960]  say that like we're superheroes fighting it totally freaks me out I have nightmares over
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:46.640]  the fact this is a global depopulation operation and that we're not stopping you talk about
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:52.740]  karma you talk about reap what you sow we know this it's one thing to be evil and not
[1:29:52.740 --> 1:30:02.520]  care or be part of it but to know it and not do enough to stop it or die trying if I get
[1:30:02.520 --> 1:30:10.520]  measured by God is not doing enough I mean I'm guilty so I shake not at the new world
[1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:18.920]  order but I shake in God's presence that I have it from the words of the information
[1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:29.560]  of all of it it's all public to look stop this it's a damn nightmare I shouldn't drift
[1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:34.720]  off into fantasies about slit the globalist throat I should realize that our weaknesses
[1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:39.480]  allow them to do this we are the ones have to get strong we're the problem I'm the problem
[1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:46.560]  you're the problem let's be honest about it and I was intended to cover that and then
[1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:51.040]  Roger was ready to do this big interview so we did that and that was powerful and drudgereport.com
[1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:55.520]  linked to it it's important she's a political president and repudiating the whole rush gate
[1:30:55.520 --> 1:31:01.440]  lie is important but then right before the show I saw these articles and I already knew
[1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:08.560]  the backstory but to see it in build and or spiegel in DW and on the major national German
[1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:14.720]  TV that 30,000 people most of them government officials and bureaucrats in child protective
[1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:19.880]  services are under investigation for pedophilia I mean actually keeping children having sex
[1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:33.680]  with them look at that BBC news BBC's run by pedophiles on record Germany investigates
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:39.560]  30,000 suspects over pedophile network as I told you two weeks ago breathlessly that
[1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:46.800]  comes out of the DW.com Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years
[1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:53.600]  thousands of them per city and they would run a brothel for sex with children as young
[1:31:53.600 --> 1:32:01.640]  as five so that government officials to come screw children it's not enough to just talk
[1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:09.800]  about these people if they don't go to prison or get executed what are we gonna do I mean
[1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:18.280]  it's really reached that point hasn't it they're vampires and if you read Bram Stoker's
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:23.400]  Dracula that's actually based on the religion of the globalist there's not real vampires
[1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:27.640]  that live forever but there's a bloodline that they believe lives forever that goes back
[1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:32.000]  to Transylvania that went through German royalty that became the British royalty and the House
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:37.160]  of Dracula Count Dracula, Gladney and Paylor and they do drink blood and they do have sex
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:42.040]  with children and what does Dracula at the beginning of Bram Stoker's Dracula do he's
[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:50.880]  got babies delivered to him that have been kidnapped for his brides to drink their blood
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:57.120]  what do you think a black Sabbath this you drink a blood a baby's blood you have a sex
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:00.360]  or G and it's blood I mean I don't want to tell you about this type of stuff this is
[1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:08.240]  mainline research it's not debated and you don't understand folks that they're not just
[1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:13.400]  having sex with kids they're capping them they're torturing the living hell out of them
[1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:19.320]  before they die sometimes they can suck their blood with lances cutting into them for up
[1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:28.800]  to two days and they love the children to bang and cry and scream for mommy and I don't want
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:40.240]  to tell you about all this but these people need killing don't they and they will but
[1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:45.720]  if we go off half cocked they'll be the victim and get away with it we have to walk softly
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:52.120]  carry a big stick he is wise as a serpent and peaceful as a dove until God delivers judgment
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:56.720]  and you'll know when that moment is and we will be the implements of the judgment God's
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:03.040]  hand picks us up like the dagger and thrust it into the enemy's throat but we do not direct
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:14.520]  it and you'll know you'll know the time and when the time comes it's important not to
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:19.520]  torture these people you dispatch them like you dispatch a rattlesnake I hate to put on
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:34.000]  a rattlesnake or a cockroach you step on them and you move on but they will die
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:40.600]  but think about the quickening there is so much galactic news happening and it's going
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:45.720]  to be crazy tomorrow and crazy the next day so all I can tell you is get right with God

[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:05.000]  selling out fast and I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:09.960]  it for yourself here just part of one testimonial I look in january 2016 I went in a hospital
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:14.560]  I went to va hospital out here in boise and I was in until june and one of the only things
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:19.560]  that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:23.680]  here in doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.920]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years and the
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:32.960]  doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:36.320]  I kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.000]  get me some of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.520]  because they don't want you to have a stuff but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:48.440]  it I hid it from the nurses I started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:42:13.920]  my life Alex Jones and info wars saved my life you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:20.280]  you walk into this room you walk into reality that's really what we need to do is break
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:26.680]  out of the proto matrix break out of the simulation and try to insert us into hollywood or false
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:33.320]  culture it was very important when I said earlier that's really an overstatement everybody
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:37.520]  already kind of knows this don't you know God is the will of the universe God is conscious
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:49.640]  as God is the Almighty and so vengeance is God's but how does God deliver it well God
[1:42:49.640 --> 1:42:55.760]  delivers vengeance through us but you got to be real careful that you're actually following
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:03.760]  God's plan and you'll know when it's time for vengeance but if you won't engage in information
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:18.400]  warfare of vengeance then when it comes time if ever to execute violence you will falter
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:29.120]  you will waver in fact you won't even show up a lot of people talk about how we see you
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:36.240]  in troops will kill them and rightfully so that's the invasion of our sovereign nation
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:41.600]  that's a default position but now the flag is evil America's bad the UN should run our
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:46.600]  police Biden's giving a press conference now babbling like he's on another planet like
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:57.600]  he's got a rotting dementia addled mad cow brain which he does he says America needs
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:09.720]  a president well that means we don't need you don't take his weakness as weakness of
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:13.960]  the enemy he's a placeholder and I know you know that but you did hear that here two years
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:27.320]  ago and now you see it's confirmed all right listen I get up here constantly and I'm like
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:33.760]  this is an important article that's an important article this is an important video and sometimes
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:40.480]  I beg and I plead to the audience to get excited about something and and and rarely when I
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:47.080]  beg for something do I get it so almost get superstitious where I just don't want to say
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:51.280]  this is super important please promote it because when I don't promote something like
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:55.280]  it's super important that goes to the zeitgeist and a lot of times it's something that's important
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:45:05.760]  but nothing compared to the stuff that I know will devastate the globalist will wreck their
[1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:16.760]  world so I could sit here and break this story down or you could go research yourself and
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:19.840]  decide to promote it but I'm telling you you want to fire a torpedo into the new world
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:25.120]  border you want to sink their ship you want to wreck their biggest hoax covered 19 that
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:30.720]  is creating a worldwide depression you really want to save millions of people this is it
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:35.600]  including your own future because for you it just means you'll be bankrupt and might
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:40.480]  be homeless for the third world it means a bunch are going to die and that's just because
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:43.880]  the globalist ain't got around to us yet they're just bringing us down to third world status
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:49.320]  while they kill the third world and then they'll get to us next that's why empathy is a very
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:56.520]  selfish and good thing so let's go ahead and lay this out if you go to info wars dot com
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:02.000]  or you go to news wars dot com there are articles and videos with a report and we've got five
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:06.840]  times the previous record traffic right now so thanks to drugs report dot com link he does
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:12.800]  and also thanks to all the listeners promoting the links you know roger stone coming on today
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:17.000]  and then they they triple the servers again we just signed an even bigger deal just this
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.640]  morning when we saw the traffic surge because we've got tens of thousands of people a second
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:36.680]  hitting manned out video it's beautiful for this story state of texas confirms that the
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:44.920]  feds have ordered them to falsify the 19 numbers at least 15 times what they actually are for
[1:46:44.920 --> 1:46:51.520]  every person with covid they add 15 more people that's the minimum they talk about adding 36
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:56.480]  people no testing or nothing they go on to say oh by the way we don't count somebody
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:01.360]  is covered that's tested positive you have a running nose or a headache or a sore throat
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:07.320]  any one thing you're now covid and then everyone around use covid so that one's based on a
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:13.680]  fraud too but see how they've already gotten us use the fraud oh they take all these people
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.560]  that die of car wrecks and cancer and heart attacks and gunshot wounds on record put them
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:23.120]  in the covid thing they take nursing home patients they've killed put them in the thing
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.920]  and we know there's a lot of false positive tests and we know that people the antibodies
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:30.040]  they count as having it you know that means you already are immune to it and it turns
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:35.560]  out this covid 19 as the Spanish government said has been around for years you've all
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:41.920]  got it that's why they chose it so once the democrats keep saying testing testing testing
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:45.600]  testing testing testing oh America's behind on testing even though we've done more than
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:50.560]  anybody else so that when you get it though you get to go home and be upset and not working
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:55.400]  watching Netflix you go I've got it I'm asymptomatic but I've got it and then your whole business
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:59.880]  shuts down and those outside the business shuts down whether it's a grocery store or
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:09.520]  a warehouse or a farm or a factory or a police department and we all are just shut down over
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:15.160]  a test that finds anybody that's had flu or coronavirus the last decade comes up positive
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:20.600]  in the main test and then we get the video and then we confirm now it's pouring in from
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:24.360]  health departments around the country that these are the documents this is Collin County
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:30.160]  seventh most populous county in Texas it's a suburb of Dallas 800,000 people live there
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:39.360]  and they show the government documents and they say this is insane the standard is so
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.080]  low to have covid anybody with a sore throat it says anybody with a sore throat has it
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.720]  and then if that person has it everyone around them has it and they go this is going to shut
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:53.360]  everything down this is a lie but they go well it's state law because the NIH said here's
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:58.880]  the policies in middle of May two days later Texas and a bunch of the states some states
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:06.200]  have said no to this they have low covid numbers say okay this legislature of Texas passed
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:11.240]  this the governor in an emergency said it was the law he's been given emergency powers
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:17.560]  by the legislature so he did that and so Abbott follows the UN follows Fauci follows
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:23.640]  Governor Newsom and the county judge says this looks like BS to me this is insane this
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:26.840]  is going to cause a lot of problems he talks to the medical director they go no sir this
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:36.200]  is the you're correct anyone that has a sniffles has a cough or test positive for covid-19
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:40.760]  we will then count everyone around them is having it as cover cases and the county judge
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:45.800]  is like that'll cause a giant spike it's a very competent meeting I watched like hours
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.160]  of years today I wish we had a county like that in Austin I mean he knows all the facts
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:54.240]  they do too they're like well it's the law so it's up to the legislature and the governor
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:58.560]  to figure it out he goes okay so if you have the sniffles or headache or cough or if you
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:03.560]  test positive everybody around you has it too so the testing is fake the diagnostics
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:08.680]  are fake they're counting people that haven't been tested as having covid and then all those
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:16.680]  around you have covid and this happened over a month ago and we now learn about it and
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.680]  then now we're confirming it's all over the country these are homeland security documents
[1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:28.040]  right here where they are telling the states if someone has a runny nose I went for a four

[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:37.560]  I hear you such a good music video the alex jones show all right I'm gonna cover the
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:43.600]  waterfront when we come back and then we've got a special guest that lady that blew him
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:48.440]  away in Florida on the mask of the pedophile rings it's now breaking she's gonna be joining
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:59.720]  us here but I want to go to report here check your effing privilege this is in DC in some
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:04.680]  New York City punk tries to intimidate this woman and it looks like her son and when
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:10.520]  she talks back to him he starts crying and aunt Eva says leave him alone don't be mean
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.720]  to him and she's like you're the one told me get out of here it's like this weird exercise
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:21.440]  of power they always flip you off then rush you and go get out of here get out of here
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:24.120]  get out of here and it's usually when you're walking on the street like I am getting out
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:33.280]  of here they go get out of here you know it's like a weird larpic live action roleplay
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:38.800]  where they want you to grovel to them and they want you to bow down to them and it's
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:44.320]  all again like they go you're a white supremacist get out of here all just because you're white
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:52.080]  but it's a white person saying it this is true hardcore mental illness and people need
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:55.720]  to stop and I think when Ted Cruz in that restaurant they say they ran him out of there
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:56:58.520]  a few years ago he should have not done it Ted Cruz retweeted this lady and said just
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  how you handle it I agree they do this to me in a restaurant oh I'm ruining their dinner
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.760]  I'm coming over I mean I'll be honest I should have I'd like grabbed steak off their plate
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:13.200]  treatment when the dude does to me he comes over to my table gets in my face you know
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:15.800]  tells me to have a horrible evening I just walk over to this table and ruin his evening
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:21.080]  that's how it works that's your steak eat some of that right now because I'm not gonna
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:25.400]  bow to these bullies I'm not a bully but you want to start something with me you're gonna

[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:25.920]  info wars.com news wars.com and Bandai video for the state of Texas confirms they've been
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:33.320]  ordered to falsify the number of covid cases at least 15 times and that they're not testing
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:37.320]  to see if someone has covid we have a running nose or a sore throat they say you have covid
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.920]  and then anyone around you they then count as covid the lowest number is 15 additional
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:47.600]  people so based on fraudulent non-testing they then create an excess point to create
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:55.200]  15 more people bare minimum state of Texas has put the documents out if we put up with
[2:01:55.200 --> 2:01:58.720]  this we deserve what we get I mean Fauci is an outrageous criminal we're gonna show you
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:02.520]  video in a moment of Fauci at the congressional hearing as soon as the hearings over he takes
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:08.280]  the mask off it's a little clown mask he wears to look oh I'm Fauci oh Trump needs to wear
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:15.080]  it oh look Pence is good he wore it disgusting they said 2.5 million would be dead then 2.2
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:20.200]  million then 1.7 million then 1 million then 500,000 by now and now they are on Fox News
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:28.000]  yesterday saying 30,000 will die by November election if we don't do it save the 30,000
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.240]  save your grandmother save those that could be killed by it that's where they ship people
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:38.640]  with covid is to your grandmother killer I mean this hoax is going down fast and the
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:42.880]  left it where I live in Austin is running around screaming and cussing and people that
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:47.240]  aren't wearing masks I mean they happen to be this morning they're like through the window
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:51.400]  and look over this this guy's like at you at you wearing his mask and I'm like you know
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:57.600]  who I am no where I'm asked because he's a hero see and I'm a bad man in my car with
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:10.560]  my windows up and he's in a lot of land all right I want to play this clip this is out
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:16.760]  of it's a long clip I'll just play a little bit of it and I hope it's bleep because last
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:21.600]  night when I was up here at the office I said please bleep it we'll see what happens because
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:24.520]  I want anything put in the file to be bleep nothing against the crew they're great people
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:29.080]  I just this keeps happening so I kind of get nervous when a new clips in and it's in Seattle
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:33.280]  and for this woman cuts this guy off flips him off does yells at him so he pulls him
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:40.080]  behind her not a good idea but she then goes into this Karen event I play with a dog at
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:45.480]  Central Park and starts just totally spazzing out so this is kind of the collapse of evolution
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:55.760]  here and what these Karen's turn into so here it is Karen are you okay can you explain to
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:04.840]  me calmly I'm not attacking you ma'am you flicked me off guys this is her license plate
[2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:14.520]  number she lives here this is her address Karen you flip me off you cut me off and flipped
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:22.120]  me off and now you're playing the victim ma'am would you like to calm down guys she flipped
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:26.840]  me off she literally flipped me off and then she said pausing on this guy was a postmates
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:32.680]  for delivery driver she cut him off flipped him out poorly there's witnesses to he still
[2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:38.280]  got in trouble and got fired from a job we're told but again this is the type of hysteria
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:43.640]  and this morning it wasn't a female Karen it was a male Karen through he has his window
[2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:52.600]  down screaming and cussing and hyperventilating at me at a access road to a highway and I
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:59.800]  look over and he's flipping me off that I don't have a mask on this is the cult let's continue
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:03.640]  Karen would you like to calm down and have a conversation why you
[2:05:06.360 --> 2:05:13.160]  am I attacking her ma'am I'm not attacking you you flipped me off and you thought you could get
[2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:15.160]  away with it you didn't think I would find you
[2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:33.320]  I'm trying to talk to you my name is Carlos would you like to speak to me
[2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:39.560]  this is what we get ma'am why are you sitting here crying what have I done to you
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:42.360]  ma'am what have I done to you
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:47.240]  it's like a coyote you ever heard coyotes they'll be like oh
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:52.200]  so you didn't flip me off
[2:05:54.200 --> 2:05:59.560]  by the way he says he called the n-word too which I believe because I've never heard right wingers
[2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:03.640]  or people call people the n-word I've never heard it but the left is like obsessed with it
[2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:08.200]  I've been out in Hollywood many times major Hollywood stars and they just start talking crap
[2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:16.280]  about black people and and other people and you're like are you trying to see if I'm in your club
[2:06:16.280 --> 2:06:23.720]  because I'm not in that club if I'm a cross by a name it's to their face and again I I believe it
[2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:27.560]  he says he called her at the n-word as well here let's go ahead and continue with the freaking out
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:35.480]  you cannot sit she she literally flipped me off she caught me off she flipped I have it on camera
[2:06:35.480 --> 2:06:42.440]  oh she flipped me off three blocks away and then she slammed on her brakes I have it on
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:47.320]  my instagram and then I got on my car I'm like ma'am why are you following me she literally
[2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:53.080]  followed me so then I followed her back home and I said ma'am why are you being harassing me
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:00.920]  ma'am listen stop there turn it off and look he shouldn't have followed her his name is Carlos
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:05.720]  Dillard but I'll be honest I shouldn't have rolled the window down and yelling back at these people
[2:07:05.720 --> 2:07:11.560]  today I mean I was laughing at him but the left wants to make you behave and do what they say
[2:07:12.200 --> 2:07:18.120]  because they can't run their own lives that's what all this is about and it's getting crazier
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:22.840]  and crazier all right I mentioned this we have a special guest coming up the article is environmental
[2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:29.480]  progress on behalf of environmentalist I apologize for the climate scare and his name is Michael
[2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:35.320]  Schnellenberg and he's a very well known author and environmentalist who spent decades in the
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:40.520]  rainforest somewhere else and he now comes out and says it's all a cult it's all a fraud it almost
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:45.640]  destroyed my family it turned my daughter into a mental patient and he said it's all based on
[2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:49.880]  lies carbon dioxide is good a heating earth is good even though it hasn't really heated
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:56.840]  and I apologize this covers up for the genetic engineering the leaking reactors
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:01.080]  he gets it I mean because let me tell you I care about the environment we're all in it
[2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:07.080]  major environmental groups go radiation is good now because it gets rid of humans he gets rid
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:12.120]  of everything and I'm not against nuclear power except it's never been implemented correctly
[2:08:12.120 --> 2:08:19.560]  they all leak they all suck and genetic engineering out of control toxic waste dumping overfishing
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:25.160]  plastic dumping all that stuff's real but this stuff about carbon dioxide is a joke

[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:28.920]  gumez in florida i guess was in palm beach laying out the fact that they're aware of the mask wearing
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:33.080]  wardens they're passing everybody's gonna wear a mask for the next year she got really pissed
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:39.560]  it went viral here it is you literally cannot mandate somebody to wear a mask knowing that
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:45.320]  that mask is killing people it literally is killing people and might the people we the people are
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:51.080]  waking up and we know what citizens arrest is because citizens arrest are already happening
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:58.280]  okay and every single one of you that are obeying the devil's laws are going to be arrested and you
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:04.920]  doctor are going to be arrested for crimes against humanity every single one of you
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:10.440]  have a smirk behind that little mask but every single one of you are going to get punished by
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:17.800]  god you cannot you cannot escape god you cannot escape god i'm gonna say that again you cannot
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:24.840]  escape god not even with the mask or six feet okay six feet like i said before is military protocol
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:30.680]  you're trying to get the people to train them so when the the cameras the 5g comes out what
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:34.360]  they're they're gonna they're gonna scan everybody we got to get scanned we got to get

[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:53.880]  hell you are all talking about this is insane and then you want to open this meeting with a prayer
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:59.240]  to god are you praying to the devil because god is not listening to that prayer because all of you
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:04.760]  are practicing the devil's laws what happened to bill gates why is he not in jail why is
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:10.520]  hillary clinton not in jail why are all of all of these pedophiles that are demanding you
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:15.720]  all to to listen to their rules why are they not in jail oh is it because you're part of them
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:20.440]  are you part of the deep time has expired the state is going down and if you are in the deep
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:25.800]  state you're going down with them well palm beach did help cover up for epstein the giant
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:30.520]  globalist cia misad mi6 had a following for a while but was people in the police department
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:35.960]  helped expose it so just like everything else it's good people and bad people but yeah uh here is
[2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:41.720]  Fauci video Fauci in hearings yesterday and as soon as the cameras are off he takes the mask off
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:47.560]  it's it's a mask a clown mask to show he's good you're bad here's that video
[2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:54.760]  all right so is earrings over the clap for him oh you're such a good little liar for big pharma
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.960]  he doesn't care everybody hates him he loves he ran the AIDS hoax everything there he is
[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:08.680]  it's a mare while they're in recess doesn't need to wear that mask when he's not on tv
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:19.080]  and it turns out no mask of vada resist governor who mandates mask but did not wear one himself
[2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:24.680]  the vada democrat governor steve sysilax he said that right was caught without a mask
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:28.920]  at a recent fancy dinner in las vegas even though he says everybody else should be made to wear a
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.120]  mask so that's how this works all right joining us is christina gomez christina we can't get your
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:38.200]  skype working you join us for your phone that's great uh what would you make of this incredible
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:45.560]  time we're living in well would i make of it i would make it um i don't even know it
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:49.800]  i would say it's the devil's playground right now
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:59.560]  well yeah we're on here go ahead that's what i think of it i just think it's chaos
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:04.680]  what else would you want to say to the city council if you had more time
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:15.320]  um if i had more time um i would say to fire every single doctor that is um getting paid
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:22.360]  to say what they're saying that masks are good that masks are protecting everybody um and i would
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:30.520]  say um that's pretty much what i would say it's they just all of them have to get fired because
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:37.160]  none of them are doing their um their research none of them they're just going along with what
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:42.920]  the doctors um that are being presented to them they're just going off by what they're saying
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:49.640]  they're going off you know off of numbers and um those numbers are faulty those those are not real
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:55.560]  numbers um you know so i would say look more into holistic oh that's another thing look more into
[2:19:55.560 --> 2:20:02.840]  the holistic ways um the holistic approaches of how to feel a human body rather than just looking at
[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:07.960]  the science person because there's always science but there's always the natural holistic way well
[2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:12.840]  sure there's the natural therapeutics like vitamin c vitamin d3 zinc and other things that are so
[2:20:12.840 --> 2:20:17.400]  desperate to keep it away from but what do you make of it coming out that they're counting people
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:23.160]  that die of other things as covid that there are the that the nih is ordering states to say that
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:27.800]  just anybody they think might have it as a case i mean this is just incredible fraud and they're
[2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:32.920]  not getting in trouble for they're just doubling down i'm sorry say that again
[2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:42.680]  hello yeah it's okay it's all right you can't hear me can you over the audio the phone callers
[2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:46.280]  can't ever hear me it's just it's an ongoing deal i probably just stopped doing the show
[2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:50.520]  i appreciate you joining us thank you all right that's it for that interview thank you we're done
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:56.360]  appreciate it certain point i gotta get about give up i'm just gonna rebroadcast damn
[2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:06.520]  man i'll tell you it's hard callers can't hear me guests can't hear me so i'm not complaining
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:12.120]  but when i've been a guest on the show i can't hear very well and the same thing's on skype
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:19.080]  and so it's just this endless thing of hello hello hello hello hello hello hello like groundhog day
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:24.120]  and a certain point i just gotta throw my hands up because you know the definition of insanity
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:31.480]  is doing the same thing over and over and over again isn't it so someday we're gonna get
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:38.840]  zoom oh that isn't secure none of it's secure or we're gonna get face time for the guests because
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:45.000]  microsoft bought skype like five years ago and it went straight to hell the minute it did
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  because bill gates is spying on you and running scams and everything he does is a criminal operation
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:22:02.040]  everything bill gates does is a fraud whatever you think the product is about it's something
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:08.280]  completely different so when we come back i'm gonna do it if we go through all these clips
[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:11.640]  and i'm gonna cover the news we may not be able to have guests on the show anymore though
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:16.040]  uh just because of technical issues but that's okay we can fly people here and

[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:32.760]  very psychically negative to look at all this bad news coming out and i get frustrated and get mad
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:36.840]  on air there's nothing to do with the listeners the crew or anybody or the guest that was on i just
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:42.280]  just technology i get frustrated but at least we're on air at least we're fighting back nobody's
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:49.880]  going to do a perfect job in this but when i sit here and i look at hundreds of articles and documents
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:56.760]  and government reports where covet 19 is a giant hoax confirmed and then i got to look at fauci on
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:02.200]  tv lying and i've got to look at the democrat saying it's all america's fault and the e you lock
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:07.960]  on their borders down saying it's all our fault and then people cussing at me at red lights and i've
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:12.360]  had some crew members had folks confront them in stores or on the street and get in their face
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:19.160]  and i'm in texas it's not as bad as most states it's just crazy what do you say to a cult member
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:25.240]  who's got a mask that doesn't protect them from something that barely exists then you start thinking
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:31.000]  what are they going to do next because they've got an army of domesticated followers that will do
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:38.280]  whatever they're told and so we're all pissed off about it so i apologize the listeners for
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:45.400]  throwing fit sometimes and getting angry and everybody else but um let's cover what i can cover
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:51.480]  coming up the next big thing is the flu it's going to be a pandemic now and the flu does kill
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:57.320]  people so now they're going to fetishize flu death and they're going to fetishize it's spreading and
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:03.800]  and exaggerated and we've got a lockdown for the flu see once you get into this hysteria and once
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:09.400]  you get into all this it just never ends but don't worry bill gates has got a nice vaccine for you
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:15.080]  that's coming up get danielsarticleinfowords.com media pushing pig virus as potential next pandemic
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:22.520]  and here's the article he's uh linking to he writes about it new strain of flu found in China
[2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:31.560]  has potential to become a pandemic scientist worn coronavirus mutation has taken over the world
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:34.120]  scientists are trying to understand why
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:45.320]  but let's look at the utopia of chas that quickly changed into chomp
[2:29:47.320 --> 2:29:51.000]  and not because they have fake guillotines out there talking about cutting white people's heads
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:56.760]  off and by the way i'm not virtue selling a black people it's mainly white people leading all this
[2:29:56.760 --> 2:30:03.320]  thing kill white people kind of an oxymoron like when age screelex yells it oh and shroyer you don't
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:08.600]  have free speech you're an effing white male let's see by alchemy if you're against the white male
[2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:14.200]  and a white male then you have your speech remember that seattle police chief asks why
[2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:21.960]  black people keep dying in the black lives matter chop zone killed by black people bill deblasio
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:27.720]  confirms one billion cut from new york pd budget he said on the news today we're going to redistribute
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:32.600]  it to community groups he means to communists look at that creepy guy he's here to baby said
[2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:39.240]  he's not as creepy as brian stelter he's a close second though not saying deblasio is a
[2:30:39.240 --> 2:30:46.840]  child molester i'm saying he looks like one doesn't he oh minneapolis city council members using
[2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:55.480]  private security after voting to abolish police turns out they've already spent $60,000 $4,500
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:31:02.120]  a day in the last month to protect themselves agitators could be charged with trespassing
[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:08.360]  assault effort confronting armed homeowners though the prosecutor says they may prosecute them
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:12.600]  saying does it matter if they had a gate that we don't learn was broken down it's still hateful
[2:31:12.600 --> 2:31:18.760]  what they did so now you can't protect your own house wow black lives matter chapter co-founder
[2:31:18.760 --> 2:31:25.080]  called white people defects new york times writer called for whites to be killed but that's okay
[2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:31.960]  it's liberal and again devout a democrat governor was caught without a mask even though he calls
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:37.800]  for those that don't wear him to be arrested at a dinner party you know that's for him not you
[2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:46.280]  meanwhile antifa curds clash with fascist muslim turkish nationalist in austrian streets
[2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:53.240]  turns out sorrows is even funding antifa overseas but let's go ahead and go to some of these clips
[2:31:54.440 --> 2:31:59.560]  here's the seattle police chief ask why black people keep dying in chop here it is
[2:31:59.560 --> 2:32:07.160]  it's very unfortunate that we have yet another murder in this area identified as the chop
[2:32:07.720 --> 2:32:13.880]  two african-american men dead at a place where they claim to be working for black lives matter
[2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:21.480]  but they're gone they're dead now and we've had multiple other incidents assaults rape robbery
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:26.840]  and shootings and so you know this is something that's going to need to change we're asking that
[2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:32.280]  people remove themselves from this area for the safety of the people if they care about people
[2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:38.200]  they're going to have to try to help us to make it safe not opposed to anybody's issue or concerned
[2:32:38.200 --> 2:32:43.160]  they certainly can't demonstrate you know and peacefully anyplace but they can't possibly take
[2:32:43.160 --> 2:32:50.040]  over a neighborhood and cause the crime levels to go up like this two men are dead two men are
[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:57.240]  dead and a child a 14 year old is hospitalized and we don't know what is going to happen to that kid
[2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:03.960]  enough is enough here i'm not going to let the detractors and the naysayers and the agitators
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:08.360]  you know be the ones that are the voice here there are people who live here there are multiple
[2:33:08.360 --> 2:33:12.840]  people who are being injured and hurt and we need to do something about it it is absolutely
[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:18.840]  irresponsible for this to contend to continue well i can tell you this as an african-american
[2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:24.840]  woman with uncles and brothers and stuff i wouldn't want them to be in this area we've had two men
[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:31.320]  killed and we have a child that's injured uh uh from gunfire so this is a real problem and i would
[2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:38.040]  question you know why we would continue to allow this to happen okay so they shut her down here's
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:44.680]  what's really going on folks it's black on black crime and sustainment chicago everywhere else
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:50.920]  and it's what the culture of appeasement has created it hurts black people leftist policies hurt
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:56.200]  black people they hurt everybody and they need to come to an end but the video we're about to show
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:00.440]  your radio listeners i'll describe it for you again it's on info wars.com it broke last night i
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:09.400]  went short it was first covering it several white deputies tackle and start choking and and and throw
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:14.840]  a young black man of the ground because he's at a flea market trying to buy something he's like i don't
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:19.240]  need to wear a mask instead of just saying we're going to lead you out they tackle him and start
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:24.680]  pushing him to the ground and the black sheriff comes out says this was not excessive
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:33.400]  so again you've seen the videos of black cops beating up black people white cops beating up
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:39.400]  white people advice versa if you are doing this for drugs or guns or anything else be the end of
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:44.600]  the world but because it's masked oh the police are good so here it is out of north carolina
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:51.080]  deputy throws band to the wall end of the ground they start choking him for refusing to wear a
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:35:11.080]  mask here it is put your hand behind your back by the way it's like a parking ticket
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:20.040]  ticket in north carolina not wear a mask but here's the two white dudes literally choking the black
[2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:33.720]  total cult program you were asking nobody to leave you don't even ask them to leave
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:37.000]  they just tackled him because they want his their heroes
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:41.240]  so your hands are on your back they're just instantly and now the black dude
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:48.680]  helps hold up you're not supposed to video in here you're not supposed to video in here

[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:08.280]  that's it don't belong to you that belongs to me i know it does give it to him he deserved it
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:15.000]  he's bad this is all the virtues signaling and it's all based on total fraud
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:21.320]  the feds are counting people that are around someone with covid as having it that's why
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:27.960]  they're spiking those the deaths aren't there it's all a criminal fraud and i'm just saying
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:32.280]  i can restrain myself but if the cops do that to me i don't care they're black or white you
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:36.120]  start doing that to me we're not wearing a mask i'd rather want it that man i'm not put up with
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:41.080]  this crap anymore see you're lucky that guy was restrained they beat the hell out of that guy they
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:44.520]  strangled him i don't care what color he is he was wrong

[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:55.240]  what i was privately saying of the crew last night we may have just broken not just the biggest story
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:40:02.440]  in info arts history but one of the biggest stories period the state of texas confirms that the cdc and
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:10.680]  nih have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:17.000]  in contact with someone covered 19 is then added into the database as having a case that is counted
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:22.360]  as a case of covet 19 it's in the nih documents it's at the state level we confirmed it texas
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.720]  we're not confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.760]  people to die got shot wounds and stuff in the covet column and the false positive test that's
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:39.960]  all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these ever kind of commission
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:44.520]  videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world is this the full video
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:58.440]  supposed to depend on video get it out expose the hoax you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:12.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones this has been one of the most
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:18.760]  powerful broadcasts we've ever done absolutely jam packed and i feel empty and pathetic
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:27.320]  because i feel like we just should just do even better because we have such incredible tools
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:38.920]  it is confirmed homeland security nih documents from the cdc that covet 19 is a hoax that they
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:43.080]  are saying anybody with the flu anybody with a cold has it and that they're saying that
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:49.720]  we don't need a test to say somebody has covet 19 and then if they say one person has it starting
[2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:56.360]  with 15 and up to 36 we're going to say that group has it so if two people test positive
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:03.800]  they're going to say that 70 something cases we have the documents we have the video
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:11.640]  no if i thought putting a blender on my desk and turning on high and sticking my fingers in
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:15.560]  and chopping them off would defeat the globalist i would stick my hand in a blender right now
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:21.160]  i'm not a sadomasochist i don't like pain i'm saying i want to beat these people and and there's
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:27.080]  nothing more frustrating than sitting here knowing we have them by the balls
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:35.000]  but it's like okay yeah they sent people that had coveted nursing homes to kill people
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:38.840]  yeah they took people that all these other diseases and heart attacks and cancer and gunshot wounds
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:48.920]  and car wrecks and skydiving accidents literally and i mean i think it's just ridiculous
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:59.800]  how they've conditioned us to sit here and take the lies and then more comes up and it's like
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:05.000]  we've seen so many lies like oh yeah they're ordering 15 times the reporting a big deal
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:12.440]  and then i have to send messages i sent probably 50 messages out on text message the prominent
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:19.960]  talk show host and prominent journalist saying listen i don't need the credit will you please
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:25.880]  just do an article about this and here's the raw video and a few of them did it
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:33.800]  and didn't give us credit which i don't want but the weird mental illness that if we break
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:39.080]  something big that's confirmed no one else will touch it just out of some weird it's
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:44.600]  it's a spirit of failure uh humanity is a rotting maggot covered corpse
[2:43:46.200 --> 2:43:50.360]  there are a lot of good people left but man there's just no instinct like i don't care who
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:55.320]  breaks something big if it's true and it's documented i'm gonna promote it and give credit i
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:44:02.280]  want to beat these people i don't give a rat's ass about who gets the credit and i'm sitting here
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:10.760]  literally with the Death Star plans of the collapse and depression and the destruction
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:16.120]  of society and the annihilation of the third world and trump losing the election and all of it
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  and we sit here and it's just like oh it's one more story you know don't promote info wars you
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:31.720]  might get banned you know i know all the big talk show host i mean almost all of them and
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:36.520]  i've had private conversations with them and i've said oh i notice you won't come on my show
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:41.480]  anymore because you think you'll get banned as if i even need that host on my show that's like
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:45.560]  things are interesting and they go no it's true i really like you but i don't want to come on
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:51.480]  i don't want to get banned and i go you'll be banned within six months they ban prominent people
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:57.880]  they dole it out like stefan malinu yesterday so the other people go oh i better stop what i'm saying
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:05.960]  i'd better become a leftist so i won't get banned instead of everybody up front when i got banned
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:11.080]  standing up and saying it's wrong no we all hunkered down i didn't but people do
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:19.240]  and wait and hope they get passed over you're the target paul joseph watson's the target
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:28.280]  stefan malinu is the target mike sternovich is the target all these people are the targets
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:38.600]  and that's why authoritarians always go after one group at a time so that they don't go after all
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:43.480]  the groups so the other groups wait like a school of fish saying thank god they didn't come out for
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:53.400]  me jack posobic oan the list goes on and on you know oan are good guys i mean i like them
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  and the folks that own that own uh cloud tv and it's super popular info wars they confirm to me on
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:04.600]  here has more viewers than all their channels combined they had a hundred something channels
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:10.280]  info wars is bigger than all their new channels combined and they're like but just don't really
[2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:16.040]  tell people that i i'm like why don't you mimic that why don't you do better than that the people
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:22.120]  want that oh god no we can't do that i mean we get and again it's just it's like this this attitude
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:26.600]  like when you're over the target and you're winning and you're dominating and people want victory
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:31.000]  they want to destroy the globalist they want a pro human future and it's like everyone's like oh well
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:38.440]  we want alex to bring us their audience but we don't actually want to really embrace it
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:44.760]  i don't care about you embracing me do you get that i'm like super rock and roll outlaw
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:48.360]  because you don't it'd be uncool if you did
[2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:59.960]  i don't even want the credit from you you know how dangerous that is i knew 10 years ago we were
[2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:09.320]  the zeitgeist and i flew to the radar didn't say it the enemy knows and let me tell you i feel
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:16.760]  pathetic that we're the best there is the most bona fide the most genuine the most real that
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:23.960]  is what keeps me up at night because all these men aren't men they live in a world of compromise
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:29.960]  and the angles and trying to figure out how they best advance themselves and they may love america
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:33.640]  and they may not like communism and they but the end of the day though they keep
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:40.280]  dialing back who they are and that becomes who you are i'm not dialing anything back
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.960]  and so we put out the ultimate bombshell that they're premeditatedly inflating
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:58.120]  covid-19 infections 15 times at least and it's only got 120 000 views in 12 hours
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:05.800]  thank god we've got our own platform thank god the supporters supported us they're the great people
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:11.560]  out there black white male female hispanic asian you name it you care about freedom i love you
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:16.200]  i don't judge you if you're gay straight whatever it is as long as you love justice
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:22.440]  you don't want to screw kids but imagine we build our own network knowing this is coming
[2:48:22.440 --> 2:48:30.520]  what we knew was coming happens and then we've got the x caliber weapon to absolutely end this
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:36.120]  that's going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the aggregate and i literally sent out a message
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:41.320]  to over 50 prominent people and six of them retweeted us and the others all pissed down their
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:54.600]  legs to jack dorsi and to facebook's leader and and to and to the leader of google and the leader
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:49:04.120]  of apple and just him it's just like it's a it's an obscene thing to just watch almost everyone
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:13.000]  is a follower almost everyone gets off on never doing what's right and they die all these incredible
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.080]  deaths and so let me tell you all those names i list they'll be completely banned in a month or two
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:25.240]  but they'll hold on like a cicada to a tree when i win gums till they blow away and then they had no
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:32.280]  effect because before they blow you away they get you to compromise and sell out and give into them
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:38.040]  and then they get rid of you to scare whoever's left and there's always more people being purged
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:43.240]  always more people being taken down always more people being destroyed so that all of
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:50.600]  you run from your convictions and hope of you appease and say i'm sorry we sell tooth whitening
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:59.800]  toothpaste i'm sorry we said we love america i'm sorry that they'll pass over you but all you've
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:07.560]  done is gotten them to identify you to come after you even that much stronger but i'll tell listeners
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:12.520]  that care and i'll tell people that don't want to roll over that i salute you and i thank you
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:18.600]  and i'll tell you we got products you need and you've given us money has kept us in attack
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:23.720]  formation and pissed off the most powerful people on this planet who would have already had me killed
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:27.880]  but they know their own penopping on surveillance system or get them caught they're trying to think
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:33.480]  around that plan right now that's okay i'm just telling you with me i'm the real deal and i could
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:37.560]  be a jerk i could be everything but i'm real let me tell you something this universe you're real

[3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:41.060]  Our democracy.
[3:01:41.060 --> 3:01:44.240]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:46.560]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:49.480]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:52.160]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:55.140]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:58.480]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:00.900]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:02:00.900 --> 3:02:03.700]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:06.240]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:08.500]  This is extreme dangerous to our democracy.
[3:02:08.500 --> 3:02:13.860]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[3:02:13.860 --> 3:02:15.700]  What an amazing coincidence.
[3:02:15.700 --> 3:02:17.540]  Everybody just happened to say the same thing.
[3:02:17.540 --> 3:02:20.540]  I'm sure that was totally organic.
[3:02:20.540 --> 3:02:22.820]  Nothing weird or strange about that at all, right?
[3:02:22.820 --> 3:02:25.900]  Now, let's think about something here.
[3:02:25.900 --> 3:02:32.540]  If the Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald and Bill Cosby all got together and they sat down
[3:02:32.540 --> 3:02:38.420]  and they said, let's write out a plan of how we're going to rob the local convenience store
[3:02:38.420 --> 3:02:39.900]  of Pudding Pops, right?
[3:02:39.900 --> 3:02:42.620]  They sat down, they drew it up, right?
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:49.180]  Bill Cosby drew it up, and then you found that plan and you went to the convenience
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:54.220]  store guy and you said, Bill Cosby and the Hamburglar and the Cookie Monster, they're
[3:02:54.220 --> 3:02:57.340]  all coming to rob your Pudding Pops, right?
[3:02:57.340 --> 3:03:02.980]  The Bill Cosby is coming to rob the Pudding Pops, the feeble fiber.
[3:03:02.980 --> 3:03:08.180]  You would think right away that you had discovered a plot and you would try them all and they
[3:03:08.180 --> 3:03:09.540]  would go to jail, right?
[3:03:09.540 --> 3:03:16.920]  If so, plots can be public for a century, however, and nobody goes to jail, nobody gets
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:17.920]  in trouble.
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:18.920]  This is amazing.
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:25.500]  This is what blows my mind that we can have books a century old, right?
[3:03:25.500 --> 3:03:29.460]  Let's go back to, let's do our first example here.
[3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:35.580]  Edward Bernays, Propaganda, 1928 and 1928, how does this book start out?
[3:03:35.580 --> 3:03:42.220]  He says, we are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, not by Pudding Pops, but
[3:03:42.220 --> 3:03:49.300]  by ideas that are suggested largely by men that we have never heard of.
[3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:53.980]  This is the logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.
[3:03:53.980 --> 3:03:59.500]  You see, and he goes on to talk about our invisible governors, who makes up this invisible
[3:03:59.500 --> 3:04:00.500]  government?
[3:04:00.500 --> 3:04:01.500]  What?
[3:04:01.500 --> 3:04:02.500]  Where have we heard that term before?
[3:04:02.500 --> 3:04:05.300]  Well, in the last four years, we've heard it quite a bit, haven't we?
[3:04:05.300 --> 3:04:06.300]  This is 1928.
[3:04:06.300 --> 3:04:07.300]  Right.
[3:04:07.300 --> 3:04:09.900]  Now, why was Bernays really a man?
[3:04:09.900 --> 3:04:13.100]  He's the father of modern propaganda.
[3:04:13.100 --> 3:04:15.540]  And he was in a circle of men, right?
[3:04:15.540 --> 3:04:19.260]  He actually renamed the war department to the defense department.
[3:04:19.260 --> 3:04:20.260]  Okay.
[3:04:20.260 --> 3:04:21.260]  So this is not a conspiracy book.
[3:04:21.260 --> 3:04:22.260]  This is not a nobody.
[3:04:22.260 --> 3:04:24.460]  This is the father of modern propaganda.
[3:04:24.460 --> 3:04:26.620]  And where does propaganda come from?
[3:04:26.620 --> 3:04:30.180]  It comes out of military operations.
[3:04:30.180 --> 3:04:34.140]  And then it moves directly into advertising and media.
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:35.140]  Right.
[3:04:35.140 --> 3:04:40.900]  The second chapter of the book, page 61, he says, this invisible government is made up
[3:04:40.900 --> 3:04:47.260]  of people, for example, who used to be in the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA.
[3:04:47.260 --> 3:04:52.380]  So they took all those techniques and tactics and tricks that they learned in the war theater
[3:04:52.380 --> 3:04:56.540]  and brought it over into the network news media.
[3:04:56.540 --> 3:04:57.540]  Yes.
[3:04:57.540 --> 3:05:04.540]  The heads of the three main networks, they were all from the OSS, Paley, Sarnal, Walter
[3:05:04.540 --> 3:05:08.340]  Lippmann, the ad agency.
[3:05:08.340 --> 3:05:13.620]  So we start to realize that we have for a long time been under a coordinated plan.
[3:05:13.620 --> 3:05:21.780]  Now again, remember, if we found the coordinated plans and we were to look into who wrote it
[3:05:21.780 --> 3:05:26.300]  and they made it public, right, this is not like you discovered Bill Cosby's secret book.
[3:05:26.300 --> 3:05:31.540]  You actually found it plastered on the wall all around to every McDonald's has the plan
[3:05:31.540 --> 3:05:32.540]  up, right?
[3:05:32.540 --> 3:05:35.500]  A Bill Cosby is going to rob all the pudding pops.
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:38.980]  And yet no one gets in trouble.
[3:05:38.980 --> 3:05:43.020]  But let's move forward, let's move backwards, let's go back in time a little bit.
[3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:44.340]  So where does this come from?
[3:05:44.340 --> 3:05:45.340]  This is crazy.
[3:05:45.340 --> 3:05:46.500]  I've never heard anything like this.
[3:05:46.500 --> 3:05:51.540]  Well, you've heard probably me or many other people mention that famous big fat, boring
[3:05:51.540 --> 3:05:54.860]  book, Tragedy and Hope, and let me tell you, it is boring.
[3:05:54.860 --> 3:05:57.300]  It is a nightmare to read that giant book.
[3:05:57.300 --> 3:06:01.580]  But our friend, Dr. Quigley, it was an apologist for this whole plan.
[3:06:01.580 --> 3:06:07.740]  Well, he wrote a much smaller book that says everything and more called the Anglo-American
[3:06:07.740 --> 3:06:08.740]  establishment.
[3:06:08.740 --> 3:06:12.740]  And again, I will warn you, this book is also very boring.
[3:06:12.740 --> 3:06:15.180]  But it's so revelatory.
[3:06:15.180 --> 3:06:21.060]  And he begins this book by saying that there was a plan devised out of the British Empire
[3:06:21.060 --> 3:06:24.820]  as the British Empire sort of waned in its power and influence.
[3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:28.740]  There was a plan devised by a group called the elect.
[3:06:28.740 --> 3:06:32.700]  It almost sounds like some kind of Gnostic secret society, right?
[3:06:32.700 --> 3:06:41.620]  The elect, the chosen of these elite British lords, Lord Milner, Lord Stead, Lord Brett,
[3:06:41.620 --> 3:06:48.300]  Cecil Rhodes, who ironically, didn't he just get something torn down of his, which is ironic
[3:06:48.300 --> 3:06:50.620]  because the revolution you see eats itself, right?
[3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:55.860]  So here's the father of, in many ways, the modern world in the sense of the round table
[3:06:55.860 --> 3:06:56.860]  groups and all that.
[3:06:56.860 --> 3:06:59.820]  He gets his statue torn down.
[3:06:59.820 --> 3:07:01.620]  But who's at the head of this?
[3:07:01.620 --> 3:07:04.220]  Well, we've got all these elite families.
[3:07:04.220 --> 3:07:08.540]  We've got Lord Rothschild here, according to Quigley on page 39.
[3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:11.540]  We've got Rhodes, as I said, Milner.
[3:07:11.540 --> 3:07:15.140]  And then he said, we've got a circle of initiates around them.
[3:07:15.140 --> 3:07:17.740]  It's called the circle of initiates.
[3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:21.140]  One of those was a famous cardinal, Cardinal Manning.
[3:07:21.140 --> 3:07:26.660]  Others were people like William Booth or General Booth of the Salvation Army.
[3:07:26.660 --> 3:07:33.380]  And then a whole host of professors, academic idiots, right?
[3:07:33.380 --> 3:07:37.900]  Liberal professors who thought they were going to bring in this great commonwealth of God.
[3:07:37.900 --> 3:07:38.900]  This is what they called it, right?
[3:07:38.900 --> 3:07:41.500]  The commonwealth of God initially.
[3:07:41.500 --> 3:07:45.740]  And the way that they decided that they would have to do this was to infiltrate and control
[3:07:45.740 --> 3:07:52.300]  all the areas of society, literally, pages 64, 65.
[3:07:52.300 --> 3:07:59.500]  It's all about controlling every aspect of man's life, full spectrum dominance, to use
[3:07:59.500 --> 3:08:01.940]  the term of William Engdahl, right?
[3:08:01.940 --> 3:08:04.500]  Great book, by the way.
[3:08:04.500 --> 3:08:08.420]  Now they said we'd have to get rid of this older British imperial notion, right?
[3:08:08.420 --> 3:08:12.660]  Because that's got a lot of bad publicity surrounding it, slavery, this kind of stuff.
[3:08:12.660 --> 3:08:20.420]  So let's rebrand this as a secular technocratic order, and we will use the philosophy and
[3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:26.060]  propaganda of actually somebody who predates Bernays as a father of propaganda.
[3:08:26.060 --> 3:08:30.700]  He's probably the father of the modern world in many ways, Mr. H.G. Wells himself.
[3:08:30.700 --> 3:08:35.380]  And H.G. Wells said, we're going to have to just get rid of all of the old ways of doing
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:36.380]  things.
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:42.100]  Because this older British imperial notion will have to cave into a world federation
[3:08:42.100 --> 3:08:51.700]  of a secular technocratic order where every area of life is ruled by managerial technocrats.
[3:08:51.700 --> 3:08:54.580]  What's the last chapter of Bernays' book say?
[3:08:54.580 --> 3:09:01.660]  The last chapter says that the future is a managerial technocratic society.
[3:09:01.660 --> 3:09:06.780]  Let's move on to the next in our lecture here.
[3:09:06.780 --> 3:09:08.900]  More technocracy.
[3:09:08.900 --> 3:09:10.860]  Now you probably heard about Mr. Salk.
[3:09:10.860 --> 3:09:15.700]  He's known for being the father of arm stabbies, right?
[3:09:15.700 --> 3:09:20.580]  Mr. Salk wrote a famous book called The Survival of the Wisest.
[3:09:20.580 --> 3:09:23.940]  When we get back from the break, I'm going to tell you more about that.
[3:09:23.940 --> 3:09:27.500]  But you are listening to watching the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:27.500 --> 3:09:30.740]  I am Jay Dyer of jasonalsus.com.
[3:09:30.740 --> 3:09:32.580]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you about Jonas Salk.
[3:09:32.580 --> 3:09:35.140]  I'm going to tell you about Jacques Attali.
[3:09:35.140 --> 3:09:36.140]  You know that is?
[3:09:36.140 --> 3:09:38.300]  He's the Kissinger of France.
[3:09:38.300 --> 3:09:42.860]  You know there's a Kissinger of France who trained and raised the modern presidents?
[3:09:42.860 --> 3:09:43.860]  France.
[3:09:43.860 --> 3:09:44.860]  I'll tell you about that in a minute.
[3:09:44.860 --> 3:09:49.180]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast, I'm not patting you on the head.
[3:09:49.180 --> 3:09:54.940]  I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard who finds a life raft to get on or a piece
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:09:55.940]  of driftwood.
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:09:57.700]  I am clinging to you.
[3:09:57.700 --> 3:10:00.980]  So when you call the show and thank me, listen, I'm thanking you too.
[3:10:00.980 --> 3:10:01.980]  We are in this together.
[3:10:01.980 --> 3:10:06.220]  Now, I try to bring you things that I know are amazing, that have helped me and my family.
[3:10:06.220 --> 3:10:07.220]  So you get a great response.
[3:10:07.220 --> 3:10:08.900]  You order it again.
[3:10:08.900 --> 3:10:10.660]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:11.660]  It's not a science.
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:12.780]  It's not a plan.
[3:10:12.780 --> 3:10:13.780]  It's just the way to do it.
[3:10:13.780 --> 3:10:14.780]  It's just common sense.
[3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:17.980]  And if you get one product, it's bodies.
[3:10:17.980 --> 3:10:22.580]  Now our big Fourth of July Supercell is going right now through Fourth of July.
[3:10:22.580 --> 3:10:24.620]  And bodies have been sold out for over three months.
[3:10:24.620 --> 3:10:25.620]  It's now back in stock.
[3:10:25.620 --> 3:10:28.940]  It is the strongest tumeric concentrate we could find out there.
[3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:30.780]  It may be the strongest on the market.
[3:10:30.780 --> 3:10:31.780]  Somebody might have one stronger.
[3:10:31.780 --> 3:10:32.780]  We don't know about it.
[3:10:32.780 --> 3:10:33.780]  Or we got it.
[3:10:33.780 --> 3:10:35.460]  It is back in stock at 50% off.
[3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:39.340]  I want to encourage you all to get bodies, ultimate tumeric formula while you still can.
[3:10:39.340 --> 3:10:40.900]  50% off for the Fourth of July.
[3:10:40.900 --> 3:10:41.900]  And find the M4.
[3:10:41.900 --> 3:10:42.900]  The M4Shor.com.
[3:10:42.900 --> 3:10:45.220]  My salute and thank you all.
[3:10:45.220 --> 3:10:48.980]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, my second cup of the day.
[3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:49.980]  It's really strong.
[3:10:49.980 --> 3:10:52.540]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates are jacked.
[3:10:52.540 --> 3:10:56.220]  A really aggressive boy and the coffee adds to it, but mmm, wake up America coffee there
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:10:58.820]  by loves, highest rated in the choppers mountains.
[3:10:58.820 --> 3:11:01.020]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:02.020]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[3:11:02.020 --> 3:11:04.860]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[3:11:04.860 --> 3:11:05.860]  Hand selected.
[3:11:05.860 --> 3:11:06.860]  It's beyond organic.
[3:11:06.860 --> 3:11:07.860]  Wildcrafted.
[3:11:07.860 --> 3:11:08.860]  Wake up America coffee.
[3:11:08.860 --> 3:11:10.260]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[3:11:10.260 --> 3:11:14.420]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[3:11:14.420 --> 3:11:15.420]  Yes, folks.
[3:11:15.420 --> 3:11:16.420]  We've been selling it 10 years.
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:17.420]  Never raised the price.
[3:11:17.420 --> 3:11:24.620]  $15.95 is that big old bag, 99% reviews, 598 reviews, 4.9 stars on third party sites.

[3:11:27.580 --> 3:11:29.140]  to get it each month or every two months.

[3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:33.620]  15 days at the nine months.
[3:11:33.620 --> 3:11:40.220]  Patriot blend medium roast only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[3:11:40.220 --> 3:11:41.700]  It's not as popular.
[3:11:41.700 --> 3:11:48.180]  Anyways, it's all at infowarsstore.com.
[3:11:48.180 --> 3:12:01.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:20.300]  I was talking before the break about Jonah Salk.
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:24.700]  There's a reason I'm going to go into Jonah Salk because he wrote a couple books, one
[3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:30.620]  of which was extremely revealing as I mentioned called survival of the wisest.
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:31.620]  Why is this book so revelatory?
[3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:37.540]  Wasn't he a great hero of the arm stabbies and the butt stabbies?
[3:12:37.540 --> 3:12:42.540]  Not necessarily if we read his books, which most people don't do because he's actually
[3:12:42.540 --> 3:12:47.620]  out of print, very rare books, but I tracked them down and I was blown away by what I read
[3:12:47.620 --> 3:12:52.580]  because Mr. Salk is very candid about what he was really up to.
[3:12:52.580 --> 3:12:58.460]  You see, he says that since life is merely a random mutation, there's nothing wrong with
[3:12:58.460 --> 3:13:02.980]  randomly mutating the lives that exist quite literally.
[3:13:02.980 --> 3:13:08.740]  The survival of the wisest is really the continuation of this radical social Darwinian neo-Darwinian
[3:13:08.740 --> 3:13:17.580]  scheme that the technocratic priest class, the science class, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill
[3:13:17.580 --> 3:13:22.820]  Nye, these weirdos, these creeper-deepers, they're going to be the ones who can decide
[3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:28.020]  who lives and who dies, who gets what in the future, who has a right to have kids, this
[3:13:28.020 --> 3:13:29.020]  kind of stuff.
[3:13:29.020 --> 3:13:33.980]  But it gets even crazier than that because Salk tells us what his real religious views
[3:13:33.980 --> 3:13:34.980]  are.
[3:13:34.980 --> 3:13:35.980]  Yes, religious views.
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:40.860]  You would think he's a scientist, he's probably an atheist, no, no, no, he says that God is
[3:13:40.860 --> 3:13:43.860]  actually nature as a whole.
[3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:49.260]  Nature as a whole is in this constant flux process and since it's in this constant meaningless
[3:13:49.260 --> 3:13:56.060]  flux process, it's up to the scientific priest class to commandeer evolution and do whatever's
[3:13:56.060 --> 3:13:58.900]  necessary for the survival of the species.
[3:13:58.900 --> 3:14:00.780]  Now, who is the species?
[3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:06.740]  Well, it's not every man, okay, because to him, anybody below a certain IQ range is
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:07.740]  not a man.
[3:14:07.740 --> 3:14:10.420]  You don't have a soul, you're not really an entity.
[3:14:10.420 --> 3:14:16.820]  You're just kind of this random, you know, this pimple on Gaia's breasts, right?
[3:14:16.820 --> 3:14:24.780]  So you can be dispensed with, but instead he says what we need to do is mutate man.
[3:14:24.780 --> 3:14:30.420]  Now toxic, avenger level mad scientist stuff, we need to mutate man into becoming more than
[3:14:30.420 --> 3:14:37.420]  man, post man, right, post human, and he says that we will do this through all kinds of
[3:14:37.420 --> 3:14:46.580]  secret experimentation, injections, injunctions, diet, literally pages 44 and 45.
[3:14:46.580 --> 3:14:53.980]  He says, because man is just a manimal, isn't that a muppet, manimal, I don't know.
[3:14:53.980 --> 3:15:01.940]  But he says that this mystical evolutionary process can be controlled and can be commandeered
[3:15:01.940 --> 3:15:03.660]  by the scientific priest class.
[3:15:03.660 --> 3:15:11.580]  So there you have the, he literally says death is just as holy and pure as life.
[3:15:11.580 --> 3:15:15.700]  He says there are two complementary necessary forces, they're flip sides of the same coin,
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:19.020]  a literally a Gnostic Luciferian perspective.
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:22.420]  And he says that since death needs life and since life needs death, there's absolutely
[3:15:22.420 --> 3:15:28.380]  nothing wrong with mad scientist just commandeering and injecting death for the purpose of mutating
[3:15:28.380 --> 3:15:29.980]  the species.
[3:15:29.980 --> 3:15:32.860]  But I mean, this guy is off the charts, like he doesn't stop there.
[3:15:32.860 --> 3:15:36.020]  He goes on to say that we can actually just engineer mass death.
[3:15:36.020 --> 3:15:41.900]  We can engineer experimentation on children even in the womb.
[3:15:41.900 --> 3:15:42.900]  Yes, he says that.
[3:15:42.900 --> 3:15:44.460]  And who does he say is the enemy?
[3:15:44.460 --> 3:15:51.180]  Who's the enemy of everybody in this great final revolution, anybody with a traditional
[3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:54.180]  objective truth worldview?
[3:15:54.180 --> 3:15:56.660]  Anybody who believes that their position is correct?
[3:15:56.660 --> 3:15:57.660]  Anybody who's a Christian?
[3:15:57.660 --> 3:16:01.620]  Anybody who has a religious worldview where you believe in objective truth?
[3:16:01.620 --> 3:16:02.620]  That's literally what he says.
[3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:08.260]  He says anybody who's dogmatic, quote unquote, must go, you're out, get out of here, down
[3:16:08.260 --> 3:16:09.260]  the garbage you.
[3:16:09.260 --> 3:16:14.180]  But now wait a minute, who's more dogmatic than Mr. Salt?
[3:16:14.180 --> 3:16:15.180]  Nobody.
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:16.660]  He's like the most dogmatic guy.
[3:16:16.660 --> 3:16:21.300]  So I mean, self-refuting at a fundamental level, but that's the reality here.
[3:16:21.300 --> 3:16:25.180]  And I think that when I show people that book, when I show people this stuff, most people
[3:16:25.180 --> 3:16:27.020]  have a really hard time processing it.
[3:16:27.020 --> 3:16:32.980]  They can't fathom that you would have this open plan, that it would be that open.
[3:16:32.980 --> 3:16:37.580]  Even though H.D. Wells wrote a book called The Open Conspiracy saying, here's what I'm
[3:16:37.580 --> 3:16:42.580]  going to do openly, not just him, but him and everybody else in his cadre, but what
[3:16:42.580 --> 3:16:47.540]  I'm trying to show you is that from 100 years ago, it's the same plan.
[3:16:47.540 --> 3:16:54.700]  It's the same plan from then, and bolder than that even, up until now.
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:55.700]  There's no divergence.
[3:16:55.700 --> 3:16:57.820]  They have like their own 10 commandments.
[3:16:57.820 --> 3:17:00.580]  You have to adhere to all the 10 commandments.
[3:17:00.580 --> 3:17:03.300]  And as I was mentioning last time, there's a couple more characters we're going to get
[3:17:03.300 --> 3:17:04.300]  to here.
[3:17:04.300 --> 3:17:10.940]  We're going to get to Arthur Kessler, and then we're going to mention Mr. Atali.
[3:17:10.940 --> 3:17:16.260]  Now, we've moved from older British Empire period up to the 20s.
[3:17:16.260 --> 3:17:20.340]  We've looked at guys in the 650s and 60s, so I'm just looking at another person in the
[3:17:20.340 --> 3:17:21.820]  60s period.
[3:17:21.820 --> 3:17:24.420]  Mr. Arthur Kessler goes to the machine.
[3:17:24.420 --> 3:17:26.860]  He's another important figure that everybody overlooks.
[3:17:26.860 --> 3:17:33.300]  People forget this guy, but he was crucial to the philosophy of the global elite.
[3:17:33.300 --> 3:17:37.460]  In fact, many of the modern day global elite will cite this book.
[3:17:37.460 --> 3:17:42.180]  They'll cite him and his philosophy of how we're all part of this generic collective
[3:17:42.180 --> 3:17:44.620]  that's evolving.
[3:17:44.620 --> 3:17:48.020]  The perennial philosophy, if you don't know, Huxley has a book called The Perennial Philosophy
[3:17:48.020 --> 3:17:52.940]  where he says, we're all part of this giant glob, and we're all just evolving to be the
[3:17:52.940 --> 3:17:53.940]  Godhead, right?
[3:17:53.940 --> 3:17:57.980]  We're going to evolve to become the Godhead through technology.
[3:17:57.980 --> 3:18:02.500]  But before we get to that, let's look at this fascinating chapter on the Thuggy.
[3:18:02.500 --> 3:18:03.500]  Yes.
[3:18:03.500 --> 3:18:11.940]  Remember Temple of Doom, Kalimah, Kalimah, Shakti, right?
[3:18:11.940 --> 3:18:13.580]  Everybody remembers Temple of Doom.
[3:18:13.580 --> 3:18:16.740]  These guys love Temple of Doom in the real sense of the Thuggy.
[3:18:16.740 --> 3:18:21.780]  In fact, he has a whole section on the Thuggy, and he says, you know, the Thuggy represent
[3:18:21.780 --> 3:18:30.420]  this older, this is page 236, this older idea of man evolving and the fittest amongst men
[3:18:30.420 --> 3:18:36.260]  in the ancient world, obviously just eight other men, right?
[3:18:36.260 --> 3:18:41.260]  They were cannibalistic, and yeah, I mean, it might sound a little taboo to us today,
[3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:42.420]  but really, it's not that bad.
[3:18:42.420 --> 3:18:44.580]  I mean, it's just part of the evolutionary process, right?
[3:18:44.580 --> 3:18:49.500]  I mean, the predators eat the prey, and that's just natural, you see.
[3:18:49.500 --> 3:18:54.980]  And so he says, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the human sacrifice cannibalism,
[3:18:54.980 --> 3:18:58.700]  cults of the ancient world, the Aztecs, et cetera.
[3:18:58.700 --> 3:19:01.860]  It was purely natural, and by the way, it was noble.
[3:19:01.860 --> 3:19:02.860]  The nobility ate people.
[3:19:02.860 --> 3:19:07.180]  Are you going to say that all the nobility were bad because they were chomping down on
[3:19:07.180 --> 3:19:08.500]  their cousins and their brides?
[3:19:08.500 --> 3:19:10.100]  No, I'm not going to say that.
[3:19:10.100 --> 3:19:11.100]  That would be bigoted.
[3:19:11.100 --> 3:19:12.100]  It can't be bigots.
[3:19:12.100 --> 3:19:14.620]  Don't be a bigot.
[3:19:14.620 --> 3:19:18.580]  Eat your cousin, or you're a bigot.
[3:19:18.580 --> 3:19:25.140]  And so he says, this sacrifice religion actually was what propelled man's evolution.
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:29.460]  It propelled man's evolution to the next phase, and he says that now in our day, guess what?
[3:19:29.460 --> 3:19:32.740]  This all got to come back for us to go into the next phase.
[3:19:32.740 --> 3:19:33.740]  We got to go into the next phase.
[3:19:33.740 --> 3:19:34.740]  I'm not kidding.
[3:19:34.740 --> 3:19:35.740]  You think this, oh, that's crazy.
[3:19:35.740 --> 3:19:36.740]  That's crazy.
[3:19:36.740 --> 3:19:40.060]  That would never be talking about eating people and cannibalism.
[3:19:40.060 --> 3:19:41.060]  That's crazy.
[3:19:41.060 --> 3:19:46.660]  No, really, really, is that the last four or five years, has that shown you how crazy
[3:19:46.660 --> 3:19:47.660]  things are?
[3:19:47.660 --> 3:19:51.420]  Does this really sound that crazy now?
[3:19:51.420 --> 3:19:56.620]  He says, look, at the end of the book, he says, we're in a crisis.
[3:19:56.620 --> 3:20:02.260]  We are in danger because the population is getting too big.
[3:20:02.260 --> 3:20:04.620]  Mother Gaia, we're all in the back of some giant turtle.
[3:20:04.620 --> 3:20:10.460]  This turtle is going to flip over unless we kill everybody, except for our little precious
[3:20:10.460 --> 3:20:11.460]  cult.
[3:20:11.460 --> 3:20:14.220]  And by the way, if everybody in the cult is a bunch of human, they're just going to be
[3:20:14.220 --> 3:20:15.220]  eating each other.
[3:20:15.220 --> 3:20:16.220]  This is crazy.
[3:20:16.220 --> 3:20:17.220]  This is madness.
[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:22.300]  But what it actually shows is that we are in a spiritual battle, right?
[3:20:22.300 --> 3:20:27.940]  And that's why he says, death is just one of the natural processes that we must commandeer
[3:20:27.940 --> 3:20:33.540]  to get rid of the evolutionary freaks of nature, which are man himself, right?
[3:20:33.540 --> 3:20:39.460]  Man is an evolutionary freak of nature, he says, on page 330.
[3:20:39.460 --> 3:20:43.700]  He says that death and disease are therefore good, moral net, when we come back.
[3:20:43.700 --> 3:20:48.580]  Customers are saying what I was privately saying to the crew last night.
[3:20:48.580 --> 3:20:52.540]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story in Info Arts history, but one of the
[3:20:52.540 --> 3:20:54.540]  biggest stories, period.
[3:20:54.540 --> 3:21:02.100]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system where anyone that
[3:21:02.100 --> 3:21:09.220]  has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone COVID-19 is then
[3:21:09.220 --> 3:21:14.340]  added into the database as having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19.
[3:21:14.340 --> 3:21:15.340]  It's in the NIH documents.
[3:21:15.340 --> 3:21:19.140]  It's at the state level, we confirmed it in Texas, we're now confirming.
[3:21:19.140 --> 3:21:20.140]  It's in other states.
[3:21:20.140 --> 3:21:25.100]  This is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people to die on shot wounds and stuff
[3:21:25.100 --> 3:21:28.340]  in the COVID column and the false positive test.
[3:21:28.340 --> 3:21:29.340]  That's all huge.
[3:21:29.340 --> 3:21:33.940]  This is beyond that mega criminal activity.
[3:21:33.940 --> 3:21:37.340]  And we've got these different county commission videos where they're just freaking out over
[3:21:37.340 --> 3:21:41.540]  it, saying what in the world is this, the full video is supposed to be banned on video.
[3:21:41.540 --> 3:21:44.260]  Get it out and expose the hoax.
[3:21:44.260 --> 3:21:53.780]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[3:21:53.780 --> 3:21:58.780]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[3:21:58.780 --> 3:22:01.540]  Super male vitality.
[3:22:01.540 --> 3:22:08.580]  Really designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[3:22:08.580 --> 3:22:09.580]  in males.
[3:22:09.580 --> 3:22:15.540]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[3:22:15.540 --> 3:22:20.540]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[3:22:20.540 --> 3:22:21.540]  Yes.
[3:22:21.540 --> 3:22:26.700]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[3:22:26.700 --> 3:22:31.900]  Combined together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb
[3:22:31.900 --> 3:22:32.900]  packed formula.
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:34.400]  So what are you waiting for?
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:36.420]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[3:22:36.420 --> 3:22:39.340]  Never been a better time than right now.
[3:22:39.340 --> 3:22:43.660]  Super male vitality at infostore.com.
[3:22:43.660 --> 3:22:45.740]  What can I say to the viewers and listeners?
[3:22:45.740 --> 3:22:46.740]  Thank you for supporting us.
[3:22:46.740 --> 3:22:48.060]  You've done a great job.
[3:22:48.060 --> 3:22:50.060]  We've done amazing things together.
[3:22:50.060 --> 3:22:52.420]  The war is now out in the open.
[3:22:52.420 --> 3:22:58.340]  You can see that InfoWars world vision of who the globalists are and who we are has
[3:22:58.340 --> 3:23:00.140]  been very, very accurate.
[3:23:00.140 --> 3:23:05.540]  We're not just some little Hollywood New World Order rabbit trail trying to distract humanity.
[3:23:05.540 --> 3:23:10.420]  We're the zeitgeist and the spirit of liberty together in this symbiotic relationship that
[3:23:10.420 --> 3:23:13.060]  believes in humanity.
[3:23:13.060 --> 3:23:16.740]  And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[3:23:16.740 --> 3:23:23.220]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from
[3:23:23.220 --> 3:23:26.540]  the guest, the callers, the host, we will fail.
[3:23:26.540 --> 3:23:27.540]  I'm stating the obvious here.
[3:23:27.540 --> 3:23:32.660]  I just want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support, no matter what color you
[3:23:32.660 --> 3:23:33.660]  are or where you came from.
[3:23:33.660 --> 3:23:37.420]  If you love human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together and I salute
[3:23:37.420 --> 3:23:38.420]  and thank you all.
[3:23:38.420 --> 3:23:46.700]  Now share those links at band.video and crush the globalist murderers.
[3:23:46.700 --> 3:23:59.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:59.140 --> 3:24:00.620]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:00.620 --> 3:24:02.620]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:24:02.620 --> 3:24:07.620]  If you want to get my books, you can go to my shop at the website jasonalsis.com.
[3:24:07.620 --> 3:24:09.100]  You'll see a shop there.
[3:24:09.100 --> 3:24:11.620]  You can also subscribe to my archive.
[3:24:11.620 --> 3:24:16.980]  You get access to years of lectures on the topics that you're hearing today.
[3:24:16.980 --> 3:24:21.860]  A lot of people don't have time to read these massive, boring tones and I don't blame you.
[3:24:21.860 --> 3:24:22.860]  And so that's what I do for you.
[3:24:22.860 --> 3:24:29.820]  I read these for you and then I distill them into spastic, entertaining presentations.
[3:24:29.820 --> 3:24:36.740]  I was mentioning Mr. Kessler and finishing up with him, Kessler says, look, it's time
[3:24:36.740 --> 3:24:39.940]  to utilize mass mind control on the population.
[3:24:39.940 --> 3:24:43.580]  It's literally what he says on pages 332 and 33.
[3:24:43.580 --> 3:24:49.780]  He says that mass mind control as a result of the CIA sponsored conferences in the 60s
[3:24:49.780 --> 3:24:56.460]  at the University of San Francisco Medical Center, Holger Haydn, by the way, who I covered
[3:24:56.460 --> 3:25:01.700]  in my book, at this conference, they talked about how they could use mass media for mind
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:02.700]  control.
[3:25:02.700 --> 3:25:06.300]  They talked about how they could manipulate RNA and DNA.
[3:25:06.300 --> 3:25:08.500]  Yes, back in the 60s, right?
[3:25:08.500 --> 3:25:10.020]  Kessler wrote about this.
[3:25:10.020 --> 3:25:15.100]  He says that we can increase suggestibility through the mass media and at the same time
[3:25:15.100 --> 3:25:19.300]  we can go in and manipulate people's RNA and DNA.
[3:25:19.300 --> 3:25:24.940]  He says we'll use binary weapons, that's what he says on 334, and that this will all
[3:25:24.940 --> 3:25:31.140]  be combined with the poison in the tap water, yes, poison in the tap water.
[3:25:31.140 --> 3:25:36.660]  So all this stuff that you've heard, people talking about John P. Holder and the science
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:40.100]  are under Obama, Paul Ehrlich, right?
[3:25:40.100 --> 3:25:43.580]  It's all going back to 50s, 60s, all the way back to person Russell, but I'm just showing
[3:25:43.580 --> 3:25:47.300]  you the continuity through the decades of this unified plan.
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:52.740]  He says that big pharma will have to take a lead role in this, in this first phase,
[3:25:52.740 --> 3:25:58.220]  he says back in the 60s, beginning to promote large scale pharmaceuticals in that brave
[3:25:58.220 --> 3:26:00.740]  new world mindset.
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:03.900]  And he says eventually we're just going to have to give everybody uphill, everybody will
[3:26:03.900 --> 3:26:09.340]  have their soma and he says the whole of the tap water will be poisoned, literally, that's
[3:26:09.340 --> 3:26:10.340]  the end of the book.
[3:26:10.340 --> 3:26:18.580]  And he says this will all be alchemy, literally says alchemy for the process transhumanism.
[3:26:18.580 --> 3:26:24.140]  So they want this mass die off, this mass kill off before transitioning into the next
[3:26:24.140 --> 3:26:28.020]  phase of the post-human era.
[3:26:28.020 --> 3:26:33.860]  Now I mentioned earlier, Mr. President Henry Kissinger, I would like one baguette, give
[3:26:33.860 --> 3:26:36.380]  me one baguette made of dead babies from France.
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:42.060]  Who is the Kissinger of France, Jacques Attali, right?
[3:26:42.060 --> 3:26:46.340]  He's the brains behind some of the recent presidents of France.
[3:26:46.340 --> 3:26:51.620]  And he wrote a really interesting book, let's fast forward up to 2006, Mr. Attali wrote
[3:26:51.620 --> 3:26:55.020]  a book called Brief History of the Future.
[3:26:55.020 --> 3:26:59.460]  This is an overlooked global elite book, people forget this guy, they forget that he wrote
[3:26:59.460 --> 3:27:03.540]  everything in his book.
[3:27:03.540 --> 3:27:07.260]  And the first four or five chapters, really boring, I'm going to breeze past those, but
[3:27:07.260 --> 3:27:13.780]  basically just says, look, all of history is evolving to be a collective, right?
[3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:18.620]  In the ancient times, you had these empire, man came out of mock suit, whatever.
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:24.940]  Now we've got these empires and they've given way to the final empire of global democracy.
[3:27:24.940 --> 3:27:29.380]  We hear this term all the way, we're a republic, we're not a democracy, but regardless as the
[3:27:29.380 --> 3:27:35.900]  news clip at the beginning says, this democracy now has to give way to more freedom, no, to
[3:27:35.900 --> 3:27:38.260]  a planetary empire.
[3:27:38.260 --> 3:27:39.260]  What?
[3:27:39.260 --> 3:27:40.660]  A planetary empire.
[3:27:40.660 --> 3:27:41.660]  Yes.
[3:27:41.660 --> 3:27:49.580]  He says by 2040, he says, we're going to have little assistant robots that will be rolling
[3:27:49.580 --> 3:27:54.820]  around your house, little bitch bots, bitching you around, doing who knows what, being
[3:27:54.820 --> 3:28:01.780]  your companion perhaps, going around grabbing butts, little gross perv robots, running everything
[3:28:01.780 --> 3:28:06.300]  in your household, literally says every household will have one of these little bitch bots running
[3:28:06.300 --> 3:28:13.420]  around, bossing you around, telling you what to do, telling you to clean your room, right?
[3:28:13.420 --> 3:28:14.940]  Because he won't do it, right?
[3:28:14.940 --> 3:28:18.060]  But he's going to teach your kids and that's what he says is these little robots, little
[3:28:18.060 --> 3:28:22.420]  bitch bots rolling around, they're going to be preaching and teaching you everything that
[3:28:22.420 --> 3:28:25.340]  you'll know about the external world, right?
[3:28:25.340 --> 3:28:32.260]  This is beyond Skynet, this is not just, this is like, is every dystopian story, they picked
[3:28:32.260 --> 3:28:38.060]  up the worst elements and said, let's make the mega dystopia, right?
[3:28:38.060 --> 3:28:44.740]  Imagine something worse than a Roomba, a little dictator Roomba, right?
[3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:49.140]  And he says these bots are going to control your perception of the external world.
[3:28:49.140 --> 3:28:52.900]  All of your education will come through your little house bot, your little coffin apartment
[3:28:52.900 --> 3:28:53.900]  bot.
[3:28:53.900 --> 3:28:56.380]  He says America has to go away, right?
[3:28:56.380 --> 3:28:58.300]  We've got to get rid of this stuff.
[3:28:58.300 --> 3:29:03.260]  This is the old thing, America's going away, that's old school.
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:09.460]  America he says in all nation states have to be dismantled.
[3:29:09.460 --> 3:29:17.220]  Every nation state, every firewall has to be completely dismantled so that the giant global
[3:29:17.220 --> 3:29:20.620]  system can come into place and he calls it a global brain.
[3:29:20.620 --> 3:29:23.020]  In fact, he calls it a golem, right?
[3:29:23.020 --> 3:29:26.300]  If you remember the mystical story of the golem, this is this creature that can be created
[3:29:26.300 --> 3:29:32.260]  and it doesn't have a soul, it's given reality and it's controlled and he says that the whole
[3:29:32.260 --> 3:29:40.300]  world will be like this giant golem brain that everybody's jacked into, right?
[3:29:40.300 --> 3:29:42.780]  And that you will get your daily download.
[3:29:42.780 --> 3:29:45.940]  He says slavery will return, right?
[3:29:45.940 --> 3:29:52.940]  Yes, slavery will return, but it will be a slavery to the bots and to the giant AI global
[3:29:52.940 --> 3:29:53.940]  brain.
[3:29:53.940 --> 3:29:58.980]  And he says all of the things that you've seen rolling out in the last decade, now remember
[3:29:58.980 --> 3:30:03.780]  he wrote this in 2006 and he says that in the next few years what you're going to see
[3:30:03.780 --> 3:30:07.420]  is the rollout of the importance of the cell phone.
[3:30:07.420 --> 3:30:09.900]  He says that's just one phase though, right?
[3:30:09.900 --> 3:30:14.300]  He says because what the cell phone would do would cause everybody to become rootless
[3:30:14.300 --> 3:30:19.900]  cosmopolitan, he says the cell phone would make everybody into nomadic losers where you
[3:30:19.900 --> 3:30:23.900]  would no longer be grounded and rooted in anything in terms of your heritage, in terms
[3:30:23.900 --> 3:30:27.220]  of your history, in terms of your background, your religious philosophy, he says all that's
[3:30:27.220 --> 3:30:33.620]  going to be destroyed by the cell phone, he says but that's just one phase, you see.
[3:30:33.620 --> 3:30:40.460]  That's going to go away and what will give rise to this global culture will be a global
[3:30:40.460 --> 3:30:49.700]  pop culture, sports ball, all of that will be made global, there'll probably be Hunger
[3:30:49.700 --> 3:30:51.300]  Games type stuff on a global scale.
[3:30:51.300 --> 3:30:57.140]  He says he intimates that there will be things like that, like Hunger Games style, death
[3:30:57.140 --> 3:31:02.140]  race type stuff going on and that what that will do is get everybody into a global mindset
[3:31:02.140 --> 3:31:06.620]  through the pop culture, through the sports, through the globalized, whatever the new version
[3:31:06.620 --> 3:31:11.460]  of Hollywood's going to be, you know, streaming services or whatever, and he says we'll even
[3:31:11.460 --> 3:31:17.940]  take the churches, the churches, this is key, these big world council churches, new
[3:31:17.940 --> 3:31:24.020]  AG churches, he says we're going to co-opt all of those into being engines and arms
[3:31:24.020 --> 3:31:27.860]  of this global order, remember it's a full spectrum dominance plan so that means every
[3:31:27.860 --> 3:31:33.260]  area of life has to be converted over into this big plan.
[3:31:33.260 --> 3:31:36.860]  He says especially the Catholic Church, he says this one is key because it's so big,
[3:31:36.860 --> 3:31:43.500]  he says we have to turn that into an engine of the global technocratic order and that
[3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:46.500]  would go for the other religions as well, right, I'm not saying that the other religions
[3:31:46.500 --> 3:31:50.780]  are exempted, no it's all, it's the subversion of all of the major religions to turn them
[3:31:50.780 --> 3:31:59.260]  into engines of this religion and the greatest of the quotes in this book, now I'm not saying
[3:31:59.260 --> 3:32:03.660]  greatest in a good sense, I'm saying greatest in terms of importance, is he says there's
[3:32:03.660 --> 3:32:08.940]  a vanguard to this group and he calls it hyper-democracy, right, he's talking about
[3:32:08.940 --> 3:32:14.220]  the social justice, hyper-democracy, radical equalitarianism and all this stuff, he says
[3:32:14.220 --> 3:32:22.220]  the vanguard of this group are called the transhumanists, he says on page 260 he says
[3:32:22.220 --> 3:32:27.660]  that the transhumanists are a vanguard of the new world order and they're going to create
[3:32:27.660 --> 3:32:35.660]  a universal brotherhood, right, a universal brotherhood, he says among these transhumanists
[3:32:35.660 --> 3:32:42.620]  we could cite Bill and Melinda Gates, Mother Teresa and many, many, many new age weirdos,
[3:32:42.620 --> 3:32:51.180]  right, so he lists all these different weirdos and he says by 2100 we'll have all of the
[3:32:51.180 --> 3:32:58.300]  world converted over to this thing, right, 2030, 2050, 2100, these are the key actuary
[3:32:58.300 --> 3:33:02.940]  years, right, and by 2100 he says there'll be all mega cities, you'll all have to be,
[3:33:02.940 --> 3:33:07.180]  you know, piled into these cities, have you seen that movie Code 46 with Tim Robbins,
[3:33:07.180 --> 3:33:11.020]  have you seen this, right, this movie actually exemplifies what I'm talking about right here,
[3:33:11.020 --> 3:33:15.740]  right, Children of Men, same idea, these films show that the giant mega cities where everybody's
[3:33:15.740 --> 3:33:19.740]  forced to live, you can't live on the land anymore, you can't be on the country, you can't
[3:33:19.740 --> 3:33:26.140]  be a country bumpkin anymore, country boys cannot survive in this global order, you've
[3:33:26.140 --> 3:33:30.780]  got to be moved into the mega cities, he says that will all be in place along with the giant
[3:33:30.780 --> 3:33:37.900]  global brain by 2100, that's what's coming, this is future history being written right here,

[3:39:09.660 --> 3:39:14.460]  needs a religion everybody needs something to believe in it's it's one of the easiest tools
[3:39:14.460 --> 3:39:22.140]  from the elite perspective right or how to manipulate the population so 75 million dollars
[3:39:22.140 --> 3:39:30.220]  back in the thirties that's you know basically a zillion dollars today according to accurate
[3:39:30.220 --> 3:39:36.060]  mathematical formulations imagine how much money and so and what was the purpose of this to create
[3:39:36.060 --> 3:39:45.180]  the global fake ecumenist movement right and so the rockfellers not only did that they also set
[3:39:45.180 --> 3:39:52.300]  up the riverside church which had these statues to people like darwin and moses and just a bizarre
[3:39:52.300 --> 3:39:58.540]  mix but the whole chapter ends here page 155 by saying that together with the money donated to
[3:39:58.540 --> 3:40:04.780]  countless seminaries across the country 75 million dollars would be given everywhere to
[3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:11.660]  spread out throw and making it rain everywhere right to create a national council of churches
[3:40:11.660 --> 3:40:18.060]  and this national council of churches will be an engine to promote liberation theology right
[3:40:18.860 --> 3:40:23.500]  yes liberation it's a rockefeller did you know that the rockfellers are big fans of liberation
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:29.740]  theology now why would they be found why would they be fans of communist ideas i just can't
[3:40:29.740 --> 3:40:34.780]  figure out why anybody with a lot of money would like communism that doesn't make any sense because
[3:40:34.780 --> 3:40:41.180]  the communists are against the people with money right no they're not always always always always
[3:40:41.180 --> 3:40:45.420]  always all the way back to quigley go back to quigley right when he's talking about the french
[3:40:45.420 --> 3:40:51.020]  revolution those commies in the french revolution guess where they got their money from banking
[3:40:51.020 --> 3:40:58.860]  elite from wealthy protestant and swiss and other families there's a whole chapter quigley has on that
[3:40:58.860 --> 3:41:04.220]  the french revolution getting all this money to destroy the country do you think it's any
[3:41:04.220 --> 3:41:11.580]  different now well no it's not any different right who are the protesters in the street right
[3:41:11.580 --> 3:41:16.140]  they're fighting the system and the entire system's giving them hundreds of months of dollars i mean
[3:41:16.140 --> 3:41:21.980]  it's ludicrous but once you understand that the richest people on the planet love communism i mean
[3:41:21.980 --> 3:41:27.820]  they love it it's their favorite thing right they lick their lips at communism they want to lick
[3:41:27.820 --> 3:41:32.460]  marx's beard they want to lick to eat the food out of carl marx's beard that's how much they love
[3:41:32.460 --> 3:41:39.580]  communism right and they openly say it right in the 1978 or nine editorial from a china traveler
[3:41:39.580 --> 3:41:46.540]  by david rockefeller there's also a lesser known essay by the way in yale there's the old yale publication
[3:41:47.420 --> 3:41:56.780]  about mao mao was a yali did you know that yale in china and this essay talks about it's yale's
[3:41:56.780 --> 3:42:03.020]  publication that the skull and bone society wanted to put mao into power to have this revolution in
[3:42:03.020 --> 3:42:10.300]  china to completely basically rewrite the country that's why as i'm sure you've heard alex mentioned
[3:42:10.300 --> 3:42:16.380]  many times chang ka shek they discarded him get him out of here and let's put our our full weight
[3:42:16.380 --> 3:42:21.820]  and support behind mao in fact i've got bill donovan right founder of the osus i've got his
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:27.420]  autobiography he type rax about he says yeah uh we wanted to put mao in right this is this is a great
[3:42:27.420 --> 3:42:33.660]  thing right to destroy this whole country it was so great then fast forward you've got in the middle
[3:42:33.660 --> 3:42:39.820]  of the rockefeller's memoirs he says yeah uh the whole nixon thing remember nixon going to china
[3:42:39.820 --> 3:42:45.980]  right he says no no no that was actually me he says this he says i wanted to put chase bank
[3:42:45.980 --> 3:42:53.340]  in communist china so that it would be the bank and he brags about them that's why he writes the china
[3:42:53.340 --> 3:43:00.860]  traveler editorial bragging and saying that was all engineered so that david rockefeller could get
[3:43:00.860 --> 3:43:08.380]  his thing going in china now i mentioned the religion earlier in terms of older plans with
[3:43:08.380 --> 3:43:13.020]  hg wells and these character characters i didn't even know about this book and this is what i do
[3:43:13.020 --> 3:43:19.580]  all the time read all these nerdy boring books and what do you know hg wells has a book about the
[3:43:19.580 --> 3:43:24.620]  coming religion it's called god the invisible king and you see that title and you think well that
[3:43:24.620 --> 3:43:31.180]  sounds good i mean hg wells he believes in god right hg wells was a hardcore communist who said
[3:43:31.180 --> 3:43:37.900]  the family it's gone we got to end the family that's the enemy number one right traditional
[3:43:37.900 --> 3:43:45.100]  religion enemy number two nation states enemy number three right i mean just total lunatic
[3:43:45.100 --> 3:43:49.980]  and all of his science fiction by the way he transmits the same idea throughout all of his
[3:43:49.980 --> 3:43:58.060]  science fiction but he wrote this obscure book that i came across and he outlines what the
[3:43:58.060 --> 3:44:02.220]  coming religion is and it might surprise you because you think well he's going to say it's
[3:44:02.220 --> 3:44:09.820]  like a atheistic thing and it's all fake actually he says that we do have a personal deity that we
[3:44:09.820 --> 3:44:16.060]  believe in now he does say it's like personified generic nature and evolutionary process yeah
[3:44:16.060 --> 3:44:21.260]  but on page 101 he says that we're not talking about jesus we don't want to let jesus get that
[3:44:21.260 --> 3:44:28.220]  out of here that's not what we're talking about he says our god is prometheus what yes it's like
[3:44:28.220 --> 3:44:36.780]  that angel of light lucifer he says that's our real god literally lucifer now you can debate
[3:44:36.780 --> 3:44:40.860]  whether he thought that was a real entity or whether it was just some sort of symbolic thing
[3:44:40.860 --> 3:44:45.420]  but he kind of goes back and forth in the book he doesn't seem to say for sure whether he thinks
[3:44:45.420 --> 3:44:50.300]  it's uh but it's basically it's an antichrist type of thing i'm trying to get out here right i mean
[3:44:50.300 --> 3:44:54.700]  he's it doesn't matter whether he thinks it's a real entity or not he's basically saying i serve
[3:44:54.700 --> 3:45:00.300]  this antichrist spirit that i'm going to call lucifer that's going to erect the scientific
[3:45:00.300 --> 3:45:05.820]  star trek utopia literally he says the star trek he says he says in the other book uh uh
[3:45:05.820 --> 3:45:11.340]  either open conspiracy or new world order he says you've all got to die for our star trek future
[3:45:11.340 --> 3:45:16.060]  we're going to have a a federation of planets and all this kind of stuff and you all got to die
[3:45:16.060 --> 3:45:19.660]  but look at least you're going to die for something good at least you're i'm going to give you
[3:45:19.660 --> 3:45:26.060]  something to die for don't you appreciate that so i can go be captain kirk right flying around
[3:45:26.060 --> 3:45:30.780]  having sex with the green space woman right that's what he says he doesn't say the space women but
[3:45:30.780 --> 3:45:36.540]  you know what i mean and so look what i'm trying to get across is that whether we go back a hundred
[3:45:36.540 --> 3:45:41.420]  years or whether we go back to or whether we fast forward to the present day what i mentioned last
[3:45:41.420 --> 3:45:48.220]  time with alex right the head of davos claus schwaab claus schwaab he writes a whole book
[3:45:49.020 --> 3:45:55.580]  saying exactly the same thing that the people 100 years ago said here it is right the shape of
[3:45:55.580 --> 3:46:01.420]  things to come they've ever watched that movie it's hard to watch because it's really grainy bad but
[3:46:02.140 --> 3:46:08.460]  hg wells he made that well the story was written before world war two and what does it predict it
[3:46:08.460 --> 3:46:15.100]  predicts a big world war with flying space masonic ships bombing everything literally that's what he
[3:46:15.100 --> 3:46:24.300]  says and so you fast forward to claus schwaab and we have the internet of things we have biotech we
[3:46:24.300 --> 3:46:32.700]  have geoengineering all listed all public and i'm going to give you one last obscure book that a lot
[3:46:32.700 --> 3:46:38.620]  of people don't know about and they have forgotten um and it's part of this inner cadre this inner
[3:46:38.620 --> 3:46:46.220]  cult his name was charles galton darwin he wrote a book called the next million years i don't know
[3:46:46.220 --> 3:46:50.700]  how he knew what was going to happen in a million year that's a pretty big number a million years
[3:46:50.700 --> 3:46:56.780]  right it's like when they talk about how atelier has this chapter about 11 million years ago a monkey
[3:46:56.780 --> 3:47:01.900]  jumped out of a tree and that's how human started walking was because it was 11 how do you know what
[3:47:01.900 --> 3:47:07.100]  happened 11 million years ago give me a break come on but regardless even though it sounds like
[3:47:07.100 --> 3:47:11.500]  science fiction in their mind they're writing future history by putting out the science fiction
[3:47:11.500 --> 3:47:16.220]  right so what does he say now you might think again well he's going to be talking about
[3:47:16.220 --> 3:47:23.020]  you know science and the importance of science yeah he does say that but who does he say the future
[3:47:23.020 --> 3:47:31.100]  will belong to he says dna rna tracking tracing all of that literally he says will tell us who
[3:47:31.100 --> 3:47:39.020]  the superior bloodlines are what yes bloodlines he says the elite have known about and and worship
[3:47:39.020 --> 3:47:44.140]  the bloodlines all the way back to tolamy and ancient dynasties he says these royal bloodlines
[3:47:44.140 --> 3:47:50.700]  will be will be tweaked so that you'll have breeders and specified breeding
[3:47:51.260 --> 3:47:59.020]  so that only the elite bloodlines can go into the future what do we see in the news now kovipas
[3:47:59.900 --> 3:48:05.420]  right bill gates we got to get these numbers down here's my uh chart for the numbers and if we get
[3:48:05.420 --> 3:48:10.780]  all these numbers down uh you know the day i can corner the market on new balance sneakers with my
