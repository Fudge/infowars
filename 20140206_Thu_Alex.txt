[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:32.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Bonnie Hari the food
[00:32.360 --> 00:45.500]  wave is on with us on Tuesday now it's Thursday the 6th day already of February 2014 and she
[00:45.500 --> 00:55.480]  talked about the chemical emulsifier plastic that is in the subway bread and two days after
[00:55.480 --> 01:00.960]  she launched that on our show and after you took action we're a big part of this I'm not
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.240]  even taking credit I'm just saying we're able to have an effect you deserve credit for taking
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.880]  action subway has now announced USA Today that they are to remove chemical from the
[01:10.880 --> 01:16.920]  bread that's up on Drudge Report dot com and we should have one of the great writers up
[01:16.920 --> 01:24.000]  here maybe Gucci Artie or Mikhail Thalen they're more of our health news people Thalen and
[01:24.000 --> 01:36.080]  good shardy run store story leak dot com and story leak dot com has been really on top
[01:36.080 --> 01:40.720]  of all this so maybe one of those two guys and they're worth listening I guess Thalen
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.880]  from Washington state and good shardy from his office downtown one of those two should
[01:44.880 --> 01:50.720]  do an article about how info warriors took action the people took action and our subway
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.440]  is to remove this out of their breads and the reason the food babe is so smart is she
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.920]  targeted one company that's doing this of hundreds of fast food chains and different
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.240]  places there are a plastic emulsifier fluffers basically that are in the chicken McNuggets
[02:10.240 --> 02:16.880]  you name it and now by getting them to do this it'll be a domino effect just like Cheerios
[02:16.880 --> 02:24.000]  going organic as well non GMO this is a big deal and they'll be cheating and other things
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.840]  involved but the point is we have the moral high ground we're winning we're voting with
[02:27.840 --> 02:33.000]  our dollars we're voting with our time and energy speaking up and we have power that's
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.360]  why the system is always trying to shut us up that's why they'll go after sheriffs that
[02:38.360 --> 02:43.560]  don't enforce unconstitutional gun laws in the case of Liberty County Florida where the
[02:43.560 --> 02:49.120]  law was actually ambiguous the person's traveling from work or home they're allowed to carry
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.280]  a concealed firearm in their vehicle well why did you arrest this guy well the statute
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.240]  written where maybe I could interpret it that you know he was violating it no you're gonna
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.480]  let him go we're getting rid of this police report this is BS well they went and arrested
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.440]  that sheriff but you know what he then went to court the jury said not guilty because
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.720]  you judge the facts as well as the law and it's it's actions like that sheriff Richard
[03:14.720 --> 03:20.680]  Mack refusing to enforce the Brady law and then they came after him he took the Supreme
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.160]  Court and one look all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women
[03:25.160 --> 03:34.240]  do nothing Thomas Jefferson and this is a big deal I am so excited about this because
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.160]  it only took two days for this to happen now look they're gonna add some other emulsifier
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.720]  guaranteed that's a similar molecule and then we'll have to make a big deal out of that
[03:42.720 --> 03:49.880]  that that's part of the fight is you've got to do this over and over and over again and
[03:49.880 --> 03:55.240]  things like this are really a dream come true for me to be able to be I'm not bragging it's
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.560]  just a fact to show how my taking action and you taking action help Rand Paul was not gonna
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.040]  run for Senate when he started that exploratory committee a year before he ran and our show
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.120]  when he came on and said well donate to the exploratory committee and they raved up off
[04:09.120 --> 04:14.480]  this show about a half million dollars in two day period off one plug and I talked to
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.160]  Rand off air and also on there later and he thanked the listeners and he said no that
[04:20.160 --> 04:28.800]  pushes over the edge I'm gonna run for the Senate this show was the straw that pushed
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.440]  him over the edge was the straw that broke the camel's back you are the reason Rand Paul
[04:34.440 --> 04:40.840]  was in the Senate you and you are the reason subway is now a great part of it for living
[04:40.840 --> 04:46.200]  this so don't ever think you don't have power and I could go on case after case of how I've

[08:53.120 --> 08:57.840]  about to remove a chemical from its breads that raise the ire of an influential health
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.440]  activist and food blogger who launched her campaign here on the broadcast with us on
[09:03.440 --> 09:11.400]  Tuesday the food babe and continuing subway one of the world's biggest bread makers is
[09:11.400 --> 09:16.080]  about to remove a chemical from its breads the world's biggest sandwich chain says it's
[09:16.080 --> 09:24.080]  in the process of removing the chemical known as hard to pronounce a z o d i a carbomide
[09:24.080 --> 09:32.080]  from its sandwich breads a chemical that vanny harry who runs the site food babe dot com says
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.280]  is commonly used to increase elasticity and everything from yoga mats to shoe rubber to
[09:37.280 --> 09:45.000]  synthetic leather it's used for the same reason in bread she says as a dough conditioner quote
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.720]  we are already in the process of removing it as part of our bread improvement efforts
[09:49.720 --> 09:55.240]  despite the fact usda and fda approved the ingredient the company said in a statement
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.840]  the complete conversation and conversion to have this product out of the bread will be
[09:59.840 --> 10:06.760]  done soon let's just start with the facts here this is banned in china banned in russia
[10:06.760 --> 10:11.800]  banned in japan banned in england banned in germany banned in brazil this is all part
[10:11.800 --> 10:25.440]  of these plastic emulsifiers just search silicone in chicken mcnuggets remember the fda uh four
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.160]  five years ago when the whole melamine situation from china was big in the news and they were
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.080]  executing executives in china who put melamine in the milk and and baby formula because it
[10:35.080 --> 10:42.200]  can fool the protein testing uh that the government does and it was causing organ failure kidney
[10:42.200 --> 10:48.080]  failure well the fda responded by saying some melamine is safe that guy show it it's us
[10:48.080 --> 10:56.400]  today as well type it in the search engine fda says some melamine safe think about that
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.360]  so our government says melamine safe our government says these plastic products in the food are
[11:02.360 --> 11:10.160]  safe this is insane and the larger issue here is that we're the dumping ground for all this
[11:10.160 --> 11:18.320]  stuff no one else is allowing this to go on and we've absolutely got to take action and
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.400]  speak out and we've done that now with her launching her campaign here on our broadcast
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.280]  we retweeted it our listeners really helped so i want to salute the listeners of our broadcast
[11:28.280 --> 11:33.800]  for taking action there's a headline fda to allow trace levels of melamine in baby formula
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.200]  and that's out of the washington post but and the wall street journal also reporting
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.520]  on that but if you actually go find the other ap headline at the time i remember it some
[11:44.520 --> 11:51.200]  melamine safe in baby formula and that's how they pitch it that's how they sell it that's
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.440]  what they do and and and now they say radiation is safe and higher levels and and do you say
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.000]  for the trips to use even though until 1990 they said don't let them use it it's deadly
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.080]  it's a death sentence and they always said don't get pregnant women vaccines it's known
[12:03.080 --> 12:09.000]  to cause all sorts of deformities miscarriages problems autoimmune disorders in children
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.240]  going back to the h1n1 five years ago they said you know what it's safe in fact women
[12:14.240 --> 12:21.760]  should take more vaccines when they're pregnant fda sets safe levels for melamine and baby
[12:21.760 --> 12:28.440]  formula cnn there it is if you're a tv viewer this is so frustrating ladies and gentlemen
[12:28.440 --> 12:37.480]  show it's not allowed anywhere in the world this plastic emulsifier this fluffer makes
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.960]  the bread look more delicious and and i guess fake why not why not actually eat plastic
[12:42.960 --> 12:47.160]  food never gone into like a restaurant a cafeteria and they'll have whatever the day special
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.840]  dishes are in plastic in wax wax food why don't we just make all the food wax and just
[12:52.840 --> 12:58.760]  say it's safe we can all eat it and die of kidney failure and die of diet diet of diverticulitis
[12:58.760 --> 13:06.920]  it'll be fun so the good news here ladies and gentlemen is that we've taken action and
[13:06.920 --> 13:10.640]  the food bay but emailed us this morning saying she'd be happy to come on today we've now emailed
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.920]  her back so she may be popping in sometime during the three hour now two hour forty six
[13:17.920 --> 13:24.640]  and a half minute transmission that we have lined up for you today now that said here's
[13:24.640 --> 13:29.880]  some of the other headlines up on info wars dot com this is really an important one one
[13:29.880 --> 13:37.400]  that curtain emo just did that just went live corporate media says syrian terrorist
[13:37.400 --> 13:43.680]  threatened jihad in britain and the u.s. and what's amazing about this is these are the
[13:43.680 --> 13:52.400]  very jihadist that have been funded by nato the group which is western backed takes to
[13:52.400 --> 14:00.960]  facebook states it has no intention to target britain this is unbelievable it's a great
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.480]  little barb kurt put together breaking it down that this is the group that's been funded
[14:05.480 --> 14:11.000]  by the west but we probably should just add that to the sub headline that you know groups
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.640]  backed by nato against syria say they have no intention but it's it's it's just simply
[14:17.640 --> 14:25.160]  mind boggling that again they can say they need to take our rights away when they're
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.040]  actually funding and protecting these groups it doesn't mean they completely run them on
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.160]  explain that it means they protect them they fund them they open doors for them they let
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.280]  them attack us bare minimum and then take our rights away when it happens it's kind
[14:39.280 --> 14:43.160]  of like the government helps grow the opium from seven percent of world production in
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.900]  afghanistan in 2001 the 93 percent now of world production on 11 12 13 fold increase
[14:48.900 --> 14:54.560]  depending on how you look at it flooding the world with deadly heroin killing people and
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.600]  then the actor hoffman shoots it up the ace of spades out of afghanistan that's what the
[15:00.600 --> 15:07.200]  heroin was called and he dies and they go raid the people that sold it to him and again
[15:07.200 --> 15:13.480]  I don't like those heroin dealing rats the whole point is you can't arrest them a maximum
[15:13.480 --> 15:21.880]  law if their bosses go free it's it's a it's it's a abomination it's a it's a hypocritical
[15:21.880 --> 15:31.120]  joke and there's one of Kurt's articles about it group backed by nato against syria takes
[15:31.120 --> 15:37.400]  to facebook states that has no intention of targeting britain well he updated that instantly
[15:37.400 --> 15:42.040]  that what a team what a team and I'm not correcting the guys on there ask them to correct me in
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.360]  my ear when I make mistakes which I do because you're thinking on your feet you don't have
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.320]  a teleprompter and the same thing as I'm kind of the master editor why things don't work
[15:50.320 --> 15:57.000]  too well I'm joking and then I sit here and make little little tweaks on the fly as they
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.040]  say but continuing here with the news this is a huge article up on info wars dot com
[16:04.040 --> 16:09.920]  cop handcuffs firefighter for trying to protect crash victim that was like the footage that
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.240]  came out last month in england of the car overturned in the water and the cop won't
[16:16.240 --> 16:20.800]  help as five bystanders try to get the woman out who still died who was upside down in
[16:20.800 --> 16:29.160]  the water begging for help thrashing around caught in the vehicle and again I've seen
[16:29.160 --> 16:36.480]  the footage the the firefighters vehicle is not blocking the road and he's going down
[16:36.480 --> 16:41.120]  to try to save the person who's pinned in the vehicle upside down in the gully and the
[16:41.120 --> 16:46.920]  cop comes over and says move your truck and the firefighters says no and so he arrest
[16:46.920 --> 16:56.200]  him and then that reminded me of this viral video that came out in 2009 troopers suspended
[16:56.200 --> 17:00.880]  for five days for scuffle with paramedics I love how they call it a scuffle you've
[17:00.880 --> 17:07.480]  got on a rural two lane road the state police fly up behind an ambulance has his lights on
[17:07.480 --> 17:13.560]  with a person who turned out having a heart attack on board and so the guy pulls over
[17:13.560 --> 17:19.640]  and the paramedic first the driver gets out and then the the actual paramedic taking
[17:19.640 --> 17:24.200]  care of people there's a better res of this guys if you look but it doesn't matter I think
[17:24.200 --> 17:27.520]  paul's must have found a low res one the guy gets out and says look this person's having
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.880]  a heart attack what is your problem so they assault him and then they call it a scuffle
[17:32.880 --> 17:39.600]  as they choke the guy in fact we're gonna play that audio coming up later the whole
[17:39.600 --> 17:47.640]  point is is that they they they pull the ambulance over it's one one state police guy then more
[17:47.640 --> 17:53.000]  arrived minutes later as the driver says look just please let us get on the way this person's
[17:53.000 --> 18:00.120]  having a heart attack this is all on video it's like 20 minutes of it total and finally
[18:00.120 --> 18:03.680]  more troopers arrive and and and the and the paramedic the back with the lady having
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.160]  a heart attack it sound goes what in the world is going on here you said you had to get
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.800]  somewhere so quick and we wouldn't pull over when there's no shoulder they let me say that
[18:12.800 --> 18:17.600]  bam start choking and they go don't resist and you just stand there going I'm not I
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.200]  don't think I could control myself these are people who believe their God and believe everything
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.560]  is about them and I'm not saying the average cops are like this but you're seeing this
[18:27.560 --> 18:34.040]  more and more where you'll have a news crew you know 80 yards away videotaping some wreck
[18:34.040 --> 18:39.160]  not blocking track and the cop goes over goes leave and they go no we're we're news they
[18:39.160 --> 18:45.440]  go leave all right that turns around no you know I'm gonna rescue and the camera guy it's
[18:45.440 --> 18:52.120]  craziness I mean let me tell you something I've been in an ambulance before hurt and
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.600]  wanting to get to the hospital and I mean I would get really mad if I was in the back
[18:56.600 --> 19:01.800]  of a ambulance having a heart attack and they've got me on the side of the road for 15 20 minutes
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.760]  because because I mean he runs up on the end of this ambulance and there's a and there's

[24:32.800 --> 24:38.320]  as a joke that's a little inside baseball I was told by folks involved in the production
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.440]  of this he just come out with a whole record he thought was great and the record company
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.960]  didn't like it so he wrote this in like five minutes as a joke about how they wanted mindless
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.960]  pop stuff and it was a huge hit just a side issue again Alex Jones here live if you just
[24:51.960 --> 24:59.760]  joined us a cop handcuffs firefighter are trying to protect crash victims but to tell you one
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.240]  of our firemen in the middle of an incident is ridiculous it's more than ridiculous it's
[25:04.240 --> 25:09.600]  a total power trip where police have been told they can give any order they want and
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.360]  God himself would need to follow that order it's like in the movie full metal jacket where
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.800]  the Marine Corps general says all I ask of my troops is that they obey my orders as if
[25:18.800 --> 25:25.520]  it was the word of God but the problem is is that police now just coming houses without
[25:25.520 --> 25:29.920]  warrants they just do whatever and say you didn't mind my order I'm gonna come in your
[25:29.920 --> 25:35.200]  house I'm gonna do whatever I want and we know what happens this this is part of the
[25:35.200 --> 25:41.960]  authoritarian march by design the police have changed and are changing and the police are
[25:41.960 --> 25:45.640]  incrementally told that it's okay they're doing this they're the most brainwashed people
[25:45.640 --> 25:52.200]  out there that's why we focus so much on the police so cop handcuffs firefighter in California
[25:52.200 --> 25:57.720]  stunning video shows California Highway Patrol officer handcuffing a firefighter who is trying
[25:57.720 --> 26:03.160]  to help victims of serious car crash in Chula Vista now my problem is I have other videos
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.400]  of this the cops are cussing so much on it we're gonna try to bleep it out live on air
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.280]  as we play it but we've got a CBS news report on it that's been cleaned up and then we've
[26:15.280 --> 26:22.440]  got the one out of Oklahoma but this one in California just happened and the ambulance
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.320]  on the two lane road is waving the cop around him he pulls him over says I don't like those
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.840]  hand gestures you can see it all in the squad car video and I can't believe how calm the
[26:31.840 --> 26:35.920]  ambulance driver and the paramedic are the paramedic says don't talk to my driver like
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.360]  that he goes you get your bleep back in that vehicle right now and then it just goes on
[26:40.360 --> 26:44.760]  and on and on and then justifying it while the woman's having a heart attack in the back
[26:44.760 --> 26:51.000]  I mean it's crazy and if that woman would have died they would have said she had a preexisting
[26:51.000 --> 26:58.840]  condition and nothing to do with us stopping and I mean it's crazy town absolute crazy
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.200]  town and it means we live in an authoritarian country where they do proctology exams on
[27:03.200 --> 27:07.760]  the side of the highway they take money out of people's wallets now even $1,000 and say
[27:07.760 --> 27:15.120]  prove it in for drugs I mean it is nuts it is crazy it is un-American by any stretch
[27:15.120 --> 27:21.840]  of the imagination it's authoritarianism let's go to this CBS news report out of California
[27:21.840 --> 27:34.120]  it's up on infowars.com here it is thousands of comments on the CBS News 8 Facebook page
[27:34.120 --> 27:35.120]  and website outranged about a handcuffed firefighter in Chula Vista Chula Vista firefighter Jacob
[27:35.120 --> 27:41.040]  Gregoire calls for his supervisor only CBS News 8 has this heated exchange between the
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.960]  veteran firefighter and an unnamed CHP officer about the safety of where the fire truck is
[27:46.960 --> 28:02.360]  parked during a rollover accident CHP has guidelines to safely clear the road but you
[28:02.360 --> 28:09.640]  see it's up for debate who was in the wrong legally now the issue here is the fire department
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.920]  knows what they're doing you've got a three lane highway right there and you've got a
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.760]  tiny shoulder so for everyone's safety they park the fire truck on the shoulder and then
[28:19.760 --> 28:26.600]  out into one lane and most police departments do the same thing so people don't get run
[28:26.600 --> 28:33.600]  over you've got a flipped over car there there's cops it looks like on infowars.com going I'm
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.360]  sick of these firefighters I'm glad they arrested him you're not supposed to block a lane of
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.720]  the road we want the road open this is insane it's like people that thought it was weird
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.680]  that we saw a burning car and John bound pulled over on 360 and told the lady get away from
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.360]  the car when she's standing two feet from a car that had fire under it and then blew
[28:53.360 --> 28:58.280]  up two minutes later and the cars are all driving right by it it's like oh big deal
[28:58.280 --> 29:03.720]  this is this whole attitude of don't help anybody don't get involved and then also arrest
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.480]  paramedics arrest firefighters let's go back to the report after the break and then I'll
[29:08.480 --> 29:16.480]  get into the whole situation in Oklahoma just to show the crazy mindset and again this is
[29:16.480 --> 29:22.000]  not reflect all the police but it but it it's a minority of police who've been told they've
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.440]  all been told this but it's the minority that then act on it that you can do whatever you
[29:26.440 --> 29:31.640]  want and just look for an excuse to arrest somebody and you're above everyone maybe all
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.320]  the government ships in the narcotics and runs al-qaeda that's my frustration is the
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.440]  government at the top is criminal no one can deny it it's illegitimate it's bankrupt in
[29:40.440 --> 29:45.920]  the country by design we need to wake the police up so they don't become imperial enforcers
[29:45.920 --> 29:51.480]  for the new world order that's why we talk about the police we're on the march the empires
[29:51.480 --> 30:04.080]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network the facts are in the studies are legion sodium

[33:30.240 --> 33:34.600]  of the majority of regimes worldwide currently are there to keep the general public in line
[33:34.600 --> 33:40.920]  and tax them and generate revenue they are not there to hunt down criminals in the last
[33:40.920 --> 33:47.840]  20 years the FBI the IRS have gotten rid of almost all their white collar fraud investigators
[33:47.840 --> 33:52.960]  and now the FBI a month ago officially said they're not even going to focus on white collar
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.000]  issues period their main focus is terrorism that means power grabbing and fighting imaginary
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.280]  enemies that they actually financed that's the bottom line going after reporters going
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.520]  after leakers going after the press and you've got more news out today I'm going to be getting
[34:07.520 --> 34:13.000]  to with members of Congress and others calling for the arrest of anyone that reports corruption
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.800]  saying that Snowden and Greenwald especially is a criminal that needs to be arrested when
[34:19.800 --> 34:26.560]  Greenwald exposed the stolen data of the American people that the government is stealing illegally
[34:26.560 --> 34:35.640]  they exposed the crime remember senior congressman attempts to get FBI director to say investigative
[34:35.640 --> 34:42.440]  journalism is a crime he basically says it is he calls Greenwald a thief stealing stolen
[34:42.440 --> 34:48.800]  material close quote that's a representative Mike Rogers of Minnesota I mean with Republicans
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.000]  like this who needs Democrats I mean this is just unbelievable that they're talking
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.520]  about stolen data you're the ones that are stealing and all in public plain view and
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.120]  have been caught lying saying you weren't and you've got the nerve to call people criminals
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.320]  and traders who they've only released the fact that you're spying on everybody and how
[35:10.320 --> 35:16.200]  you're doing it which was already known from previous NSA whistleblowers the only difference
[35:16.200 --> 35:20.960]  is is that the Guardian was willing to publish this stuff and that Snowden went to Hong Kong
[35:20.960 --> 35:29.640]  and then to Russia and because he went to Russia the media tried to spin it and thought
[35:29.640 --> 35:34.680]  they could demonize leakers to try to tie it to Russian cloak and dagger clandestine
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.920]  garbage the Russians don't need to know from Snowden what's going on it's all hardwired
[35:39.920 --> 35:46.160]  into all the internet infrastructure if I knew all about this by 1997 more than what
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.960]  you've heard from Snowden exactly what I've told you about the NSA has now been all confirmed
[35:51.960 --> 35:57.560]  because I know real NSA whistleblowers people that would meet me at the rodeo at the car
[35:57.560 --> 36:05.080]  show at the book signing at the video signing people would meet me in the show in the parking
[36:05.080 --> 36:11.080]  lot and give me stuff that was so classified I didn't even know what I was getting and
[36:11.080 --> 36:18.000]  I would shred the stuff and I got death threats over as well it's all on record it's all on
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.720]  record I told you it's all for economic espionage it's to predict the future in mass movements
[36:22.720 --> 36:27.240]  individual movements it's wired into everything it's watching it's listening it's collating
[36:27.240 --> 36:32.520]  it's the smart grid we told you we told you everything the Russians know all this
[36:32.520 --> 36:40.760]  and then I had James Bamford on in 98 and 2000 the former producer of Nightline who
[36:40.760 --> 36:45.880]  got all the classified documents and Wayne Madsen in the late 90s right through to now
[36:45.880 --> 36:53.800]  interviewing Madsen for 15 16 years and and what I'm getting at here is I'm not bragging
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.800]  saying oh we covered all this and nobody else did that's not what I'm doing I'm saying it's
[36:58.800 --> 37:07.240]  not a secret it's not a secret it's not a secret it's not a secret that our military
[37:07.240 --> 37:14.560]  since Vietnam at least ships in the majority of the heroin the majority of the cocaine
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.280]  the Nazis took over the heroin trade when they were able to take over Italy and Greece
[37:21.280 --> 37:32.880]  at the time and other areas there in the Mediterranean Cyprus and then when when when the when we
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.120]  invaded to take it back from the Nazis that they just took over the criminal networks
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.320]  and the criminal keys and the argument was if they didn't work with the mafia they would
[37:42.320 --> 37:49.360]  have started with the Nazis but from day one that's why the CIA uses Italian hit men so
[37:49.360 --> 37:54.960]  often is because they're from overseas they're in a code they'll never talk and they don't
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.360]  even know who hired them they're ordered by their bosses to go kill people it's the perfect
[37:58.360 --> 38:02.480]  go-between and then and then the media uses the ignorance the public and goes well was
[38:02.480 --> 38:09.360]  it Italian hit men or was it was it British hit men or was it CIA hit men I mean they
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.400]  say it's the CIA the Italian mafia the British jackal I mean who was it it's all the same
[38:17.400 --> 38:26.080]  group it's organized crime folks grow up stop being naive I have had multiple members of
[38:26.080 --> 38:33.800]  my family who were in the US Army and were officers that were involved in serious stuff
[38:33.800 --> 38:39.440]  and they didn't even tell me much of it just oh yeah you're on target you're right I have
[38:39.440 --> 38:46.200]  a great uncle who recently died who was an army officer and was brought into the CIA
[38:46.200 --> 38:50.520]  and got out of it would not do the stuff they wanted to do he did a lot of stuff but wouldn't
[38:50.520 --> 38:56.480]  do what they wanted him to do in Chicago in Chicago and by the way this be my family some
[38:56.480 --> 39:02.680]  special family folks you talk about Texas South Texas West Texas East Texas Central
[39:02.680 --> 39:09.320]  Texas it's like CIA recruiting area because they all know where to look at Audie Murphy
[39:09.320 --> 39:13.360]  all the Texans I mean the government got it in its head the Texans will get the job done
[39:13.360 --> 39:18.120]  heavy recruiting out of Texas the Midwest as well and I mean let me tell you it's a
[39:18.120 --> 39:24.640]  giant army of people folks most army officers that have been in combat and been in multiple
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.320]  decades are not really even army officers ladies and gentlemen they're in the shadow
[39:29.320 --> 39:37.000]  government and I am so sick of how mindlessly naive the general public is you need to grow
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.600]  up and you need to wake up ladies and gentlemen you want to know how it really is they make
[39:42.600 --> 39:46.560]  it funny and stylized it so I didn't like the movie but the information was actually
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.880]  very accurate other than the fact that it made it very cartoonish two guns I saw that
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.280]  a few months ago and you know who was in the audience when I watched two guns special forces
[39:56.280 --> 40:01.160]  police and FBI agency you could tell that's FBI that's a federal marshal those guys are
[40:01.160 --> 40:04.360]  military when the movie ended I'd walk over and talk to them they're like yeah how do
[40:04.360 --> 40:10.120]  you know that oh give me a break you all guys all look like what type you are and they were
[40:10.120 --> 40:14.160]  all they're laughing and smiling during it because it was like some revelation of the
[40:14.160 --> 40:22.000]  method to mark woolberg Denzel Washington movie I'm not going to give the whole movie
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.360]  away but but it's just every element of the government is dealing drugs every element
[40:27.360 --> 40:34.000]  the CIA the DEA the FBI the Marines the Navy because folks let me explain some to you that's
[40:34.000 --> 40:44.920]  how it really works and it is unbelievable and guess who runs the whole thing the State
[40:44.920 --> 40:53.720]  Department State Department runs the whole show the CIA the NSA the Pentagon everything
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.600]  because State Department's been around the longest it's got all the tentacles in all
[40:57.600 --> 41:04.720]  the command points and the reason I go off into that whole diatribe is this shadow government
[41:04.720 --> 41:12.040]  is now absorbing the economy and has put out directives to ban bake sales and kids selling
[41:12.040 --> 41:18.600]  lemonade and little girls baking cupcakes and telling people that you can't have eight
[41:18.600 --> 41:26.600]  kids over for a birthday party in your own rural farmhouse that was in the news Monday
[41:26.600 --> 41:31.440]  you go why is this happening Forbes ask the weak ask all these publications go why is
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.320]  there a war directed by the feds to the states because they were in a prison folks I don't
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.760]  want to live under a Pentagon and a CIA that wants to ban lemonade stands I mean you people
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.720]  are scum and you know it and it's not cute like two guns where everybody's out killing
[41:47.720 --> 41:53.000]  each other and everybody's a gangster and has all this money you are wrecking the country
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.800]  and I'm sick of it and I'm sick of the naivete of the police out there to the arrogant level
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.960]  of arresting and beating up and choking paramedics because after 15 minutes on the side of the
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.120]  road they go that's it you pulled us over because we didn't get out of your way when
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.320]  we can't and then they start choking them and then they go well he assaulted us we're
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.680]  going to charge him and the public saw the video and it was such outrage they backed
[42:18.680 --> 42:27.040]  off they were going to put the paramedic in jail and charge them they were going to charge
[42:27.040 --> 42:33.760]  until there was backlash and a camera the firefighter they're going to I mean this is crazy land
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.440]  crazy land and the cops says I got to go around you in Oklahoma and then pulls them over for
[42:40.440 --> 42:47.400]  15 minutes if you had to get somewhere so bad this is all about I'm a gangster do what
[42:47.400 --> 42:53.880]  I say and you've been given this illegitimate power because the country has been taken over
[42:53.880 --> 43:01.200]  period you need to wake up to that you need to understand that ladies and gentlemen and
[43:01.200 --> 43:07.480]  stop being so naive now let's go ahead and go back to that CBS news report out of California
[43:07.480 --> 43:13.840]  where the highway patrol officer public servant arrest the other public servant firefighter
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.120]  for parking on the shoulder out into one lane of a three lane highway you see the traffic
[43:18.120 --> 43:23.400]  flying by it's not stopping traffic plus they're going to stop anyways if you park on the shoulder
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.360]  because everybody wants to rubber neck and look but plus you couldn't park the fire truck
[43:27.360 --> 43:34.360]  on the on the little shoulder the cops obsess over safety all day and then they just tell
[43:34.360 --> 43:39.000]  the fire truck move it's crazy let's go ahead and go to this video firefighters say they
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.120]  park at an angle to protect emergency crews patients and drivers we're in the middle of
[43:44.120 --> 43:48.080]  patient care with patients on the freeway so putting them in handcuffs this time and
[43:48.080 --> 43:53.080]  walking them away we spoke to the union president for Chula Vista fire who says Gregoire did
[43:53.080 --> 43:58.160]  the right thing to protect the public very proud of Jake he made all firefighters look
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.080]  good in that situation because he was there to protect the citizens and he was willing
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.120]  to take a stand to do that this isn't the first time a firefighter has been detained
[44:07.120 --> 44:13.600]  we found it happened in Santa Barbara involving a CHP and a firefighter in Missouri a firefighter
[44:13.600 --> 44:20.680]  was arrested by police and he was awarded 17 grand in a civil suit back here in Chula
[44:20.680 --> 44:25.240]  Vista we're told that this isn't the first time that this type of dispute has happened
[44:25.240 --> 44:31.120]  just never handcuffed until this moment I truly believe in my heart that this is going
[44:31.120 --> 44:39.240]  to get solved now Gregoire was released about a half hour after being detained in the handcuffs
[44:39.240 --> 44:44.840]  brass from CHP and the fire department met this morning they released this joint statement
[44:44.840 --> 44:50.520]  in summary it assures this is an isolated incident and both agencies strive for public
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.040]  safety and this should not happen again we have reached out to firefighter Gregoire but
[44:55.040 --> 45:00.320]  he did not answer I mean you've got a car flipped over in the road and you got the fire truck
[45:00.320 --> 45:03.360]  could not park on the shoulder with the highway divider out in the road and what are they
[45:03.360 --> 45:08.440]  supposed to do this is crazy land and this is exactly what I'm talking about now let's
[45:08.440 --> 45:11.840]  go back it's got a bunch of cussing we're gonna try to bleep it out if not we'll delay it
[45:11.840 --> 45:15.560]  out on the radio stations but you listen in PR they play cussing when it's documentary
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.640]  just like PBS because if we're not putting this out you know cussing out just so we can
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.520]  play cussing we're documenting like in a court what's going on but nevertheless we're gonna
[45:23.520 --> 45:29.360]  bleep it out video viewers people watching our streams audio and video you'll actually
[45:29.360 --> 45:38.880]  see the unfiltered but this is the police in Oklahoma pulling over the ambulance that
[45:38.880 --> 45:42.280]  has a woman in the back having a heart attack and the families following the ambulance they
[45:42.280 --> 46:12.120]  get out and start video taping here it is
[46:12.120 --> 46:39.240]  it goes on for 15 minutes and by the way they they got into town by the time that he pulled
[46:39.240 --> 46:44.520]  them over because he couldn't pull them over it's a country road two lane and they're getting
[46:44.520 --> 46:49.520]  into town and then he pulls them over there and and so that's why there's now a shoulder
[46:49.520 --> 46:55.160]  there and and then it goes on and on more show up and he's like this is crazy we got
[46:55.160 --> 46:58.720]  to get this woman to the hospital and they're like no we're gonna make a big scene out of
[46:58.720 --> 47:07.040]  this failure to yield to an emergency vehicle you're you're pulling over an emergency vehicle
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.760]  see it's it's it's a government agency out of control trying to tell other groups trying
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.960]  to save people's lives firefighters and paramedics what to do it's out of control there's not
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.120]  even professional courtesy going on here and by the way he's mad at him about quote hand
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.320]  gestures you can see it on the full squad car video this 20-something minutes long where
[47:25.320 --> 47:30.600]  you see the arm out the window going come on around this man then the ambulance tries
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.560]  to get over starts running into the grass to let him by he doesn't go by it's all about
[47:35.560 --> 47:43.440]  he's got a point to prove and he's going to show them and then more show up and he fast
[47:43.440 --> 47:49.080]  forward when they start choking him I mean it is just simply amazing and I'm only bringing
[47:49.080 --> 48:07.200]  this up to just talk to him government mentality here it is yeah let's go back to it I'm over
[48:07.200 --> 48:22.200]  here
[48:22.200 --> 48:28.280]  you're not running there's a there's a family video where the choking starts okay thank
[48:28.280 --> 48:38.280]  you
[48:38.280 --> 48:53.280]  you're not running there's a there's a there's a there's a there's a there's a there's
[48:53.280 --> 49:07.160]  a your name in dying life
[49:07.160 --> 49:07.880]  you understand
[49:07.880 --> 49:17.060]  it's like you join the marine corps
[49:17.060 --> 49:22.000]  they're wearing marine corps drill Sergeant hats it just goes on and on and then they're
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.400]  going to scream at you like you signed up for boot camp. I mean it is so
[49:27.400 --> 49:30.960]  ridiculous. Now they're like looking for something in the ambulance to go after
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.000]  people for. Now here's where the choking starts. Go ahead.
[49:40.560 --> 49:47.240]  Yeah, here's the police jumping on the paramedic now and choking it.
[49:47.240 --> 49:54.080]  We've got the cell phone footage up on info wars.com in the article where you
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.080]  could see it where the family shot it from 10 feet back where they're choking
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.800]  him and saying don't resist. I mean it's just a complete joke. It's a bunch of
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.240]  because by the way the trooper was scared of the big guy who was bigger than
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.080]  him when he was by himself. So when four more troopers show up then they start
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.760]  choking him. I mean it is just the height of cowardice, the height of weakness.
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.960]  And I mean I just think God this stuff has never happened to me because there's
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.160]  I literally flip out when a bunch of bullies are there starting a fight with
[50:22.160 --> 50:25.960]  you and saying that you're the one causing the problem. Look at him choking
[50:25.960 --> 50:31.600]  this guy and the guys being totally calm. The state police just wish just wish
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.480]  that he would fight back so they could kill him. But you know what the public
[50:36.480 --> 50:45.560]  all saw this? Look at this. I mean talk about cowardice right there. This guy
[50:45.560 --> 50:49.400]  really wants to dominate the paramedic who wants to take the woman having a
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.560]  heart attack to the hospital. I mean what a punk. What a disgrace. What a piece of
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.000]  crap. What a coward. What a coward. I bet he wouldn't get in the boxing ring with that guy.

[54:23.760 --> 54:28.920]  The men and women of the force are out there battling paramedics, firefighters
[54:28.920 --> 54:33.040]  and writing old ladies tickets. Now they're becoming federalized under
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.880]  Obama and trying to take on the Tea Party. Stand behind them. Stand against
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.160]  George Washington. Stand against the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Stand with
[54:44.160 --> 54:55.120]  the New World Order. We're here to help. Being a little bit sarcastic again I
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.600]  want to be statistically accurate here for everybody. The most await group is
[54:58.600 --> 55:01.120]  the military that's because they are in the real world they know what's really
[55:01.120 --> 55:04.920]  going on they're not stupid. The next most await group is police officers on
[55:04.920 --> 55:08.600]  average police officers some of the best people I run into some of the best
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.440]  people I know it's a really hard job but they are trying to warp them and turn
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.680]  them into mindless enforcers show that they will follow any order it's like
[55:18.680 --> 55:24.560]  zero tolerance where a kid has a cupcake that looks like a gun the icing looks
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.320]  like a gun so you're kicked out of school or you bring a Lego gun that's a
[55:28.320 --> 55:31.960]  half-inch long you know for your Lego toy where it's in your lunchbox and the
[55:31.960 --> 55:37.560]  police come it's all about just mindlessness or the neighbors you
[55:37.560 --> 55:41.480]  know you're shooting a gun on your 200 acre ranch yet and the neighbor doesn't
[55:41.480 --> 55:44.040]  like it and calls the police and they still come out and still arrest you
[55:44.040 --> 55:47.320]  that happens in Texas all the time well they felt threatened hearing the gun
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.560]  shots sorry you're going to jail that is happening all the time and that's why
[55:53.560 --> 55:58.080]  they have quote zero tolerance is so that the police have no discretion and
[55:58.080 --> 56:01.520]  then they can have whatever federal edict they want rolled out of the local
[56:01.520 --> 56:06.480]  department with federal grants and now the police are robots there's a war on
[56:06.480 --> 56:09.680]  the press everywhere there's a war on people filming in public and we're sick

[59:11.400 --> 59:16.720]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on

[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:18.960]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.440]  Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:36.520]  coming up my son did a five-minute report for info wars nightly news and I've
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.720]  given them a plus he's on about six seven reports for us he's been sort of in
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.960]  him every week he's in about six seven reports over the last few years and
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.960]  mama's mama's letting him come to work on me one day a week so we're gonna be
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.680]  having Rex come up with the ideas of what he wants to cover what he wants to
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.760]  get into I'd say he contributed about 50% to the writing and finding the
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.320]  articles and then learning how to edit with John Ballin who's taking him under
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.680]  his wing doing a great job here in the office some people say hey his mic sounds
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.160]  overdriven or you can hear him breathing well I mean he came in here with the
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.680]  script that he wrote with us and read it pretty much in one and a half takes
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.160]  he had to reread a few things a couple times and you know this is him doing it
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:28.400]  I mean soon I plan in six months to have Rex my son able to do the editing the
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.920]  audio everything I mean we're training him to be a reporter at age 11 and yes
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.320]  he wears a guy Fox mask because mama don't want his face seen yet which I
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:44.920]  agree with I mean I say no guts no glory fortune favors the bold our fortune
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.120]  is liberty so I just say show his face but we'll see what happens I mean she's
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:56.320]  probably right airing herring on the side of prudence is probably the best
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:05.480]  best way to go boner a Boehner claims the man who I'm gonna say it let's just
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.880]  say likes Obama Boehner has a for Obama and the whole point here is that these
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:20.280]  guys play what CJ you're right you're supposed to keep me in check family
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:26.960]  show I apologize I didn't say it though the whole bunch I did think it anyways
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.680]  and you were all thinking it and the I mean Boehner has a for Obama and for
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:40.280]  treason I mean he has a for treason he looks I mean he looks like a with a
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:46.760]  good tan so does Obama Obama kind of looks like a dog wiener or something oh
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:55.560]  I'm sorry I'm gonna stop right there I mean you know like a hot dog a dog can't
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.120]  handle these people anymore I apologize ladies and gentlemen I gotta have some
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:06.280]  humor I'm gonna go crazy I am gonna go crazy I am gonna go crazy when we come
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.520]  back I'm gonna give the number I could some stations don't care the first five
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.680]  minutes I want to give the number out for everybody to just call in and
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.440]  basically plug whatever you want and sound like you are drunk at 12 noon and
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.960]  just a mumble down joking we want to go to first-time callers who actually have
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.320]  something to say about all the incredible news we've been breaking down
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:34.600]  but the fact is Boehner is saying he's dropping amnesty for the illegals
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.840]  that's only to kill opposition so they can try to sneak it through that's a
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.400]  standard trick of this is not an assault as the tank rolls over your
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.800]  position so Boehner says no immigration deal until Obama enforces laws of course
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.320]  how do you enforce the laws when the illegals have already been legalized by
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.920]  fiat which is true and I mean that's what's crazy about this is again if we
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.800]  had 30 million illegals and they weren't gonna be put on welfare a lot of them or
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.240]  vote to turn us all into California I mean let's say there was a shade of
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.880]  people that was green because we mainly talk about Latin America that's the
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.760]  majority if there were green people and I mean I'll be honest if there were
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.040]  Martians that were humanoid and they liked guns and freedom and everything I
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.680]  would actually invite them to our planet and of course they would then give us
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.680]  space travel advanced technology I would go hang out with them on Mars but if
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:32.040]  they were like the commie liberals I would declare war on Mars and you know
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.360]  that's really what this comes down to is that don't run we are your friends
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:42.400]  remember in the Mars attacks basically what it's like don't run away your
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.960]  friends I won't sign in the AA okay you disintegrate because it works they say
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.040]  don't run so they stop they shoot them don't run

[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:37.360]  Alex Jones well we've got some good news speaker of the house John A. I love
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:44.420]  Obama Boehner says no immigration deal until Obama enforces laws that's
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.520]  probably rhetoric to get the opposition to die down because they're gonna
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.600]  legalize 30 million illegals at least many of them aggravated felons on
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.840]  record it's the same plan Bush had same plan the Republican leadership's
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.440]  always wanted to fully drive down wages to accelerate the giant second sound
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.640]  that Ross Perot told us about now listen Larry this is not a good deal for
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:10.240]  America and then they'll go it is a good deal Larry well we all know it isn't a
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.200]  good deal but you cannot legalize all these illegals and then let them have
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.040]  bank accounts with no ID and all the rest of it all citizens are literally
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.160]  under the gun you know how to get around the police license plate readers a lot
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.720]  people have suspended licenses don't have insurance you wonder why you're
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.720]  constantly getting pulled over because they're phasing into almost all the
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.160]  police cars license plate readers little bitty camera that's reading your
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.080]  license plate instantly now if you put Mexican plates off a salvage yard on
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.680]  your car you are God I mean I've gotten a bunch of people that are friends and
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.760]  family that do this now I mean we're not just playing games I don't have
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.520]  Mexican plates on my car or you can simply get online they're not even fake
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.040]  just like Christians license plates that are in Latin and the police think
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:09.000]  that's Spanish and you are invisible invisible God like you are now an
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.960]  illegal alien you are now God it's diplomatic immunity because the globalist
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.080]  want open borders they want to drive down the wages they want a political
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:22.520]  group to become a new political action committee for the new world order and
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.480]  that's why you go to the emergency room with top of the line insurance you're
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.760]  gonna wait an hour the illegals just walk right in front of you happen to my
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.920]  buddy Shane a few weeks ago with his daughter when she was sick happened
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.680]  with me when my finger was cut off and again nothing against the illegals
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.240]  except I don't like having to sit at the back of the bus so the answer is you
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.880]  put your own plates on your car and as long as it's in Spanish you are now
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:57.040]  God level because the judges will tell them I don't want any legals in here
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.000]  for drunk driving I don't want illegals in here for no license registration we
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.600]  give them $5 fines $10 fines I've talked to the high levels of the of the
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.040]  district attorney and the county attorney's office they've been here
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.000]  insiders have been to my office repeatedly over the years asking me to
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.080]  do investigations on it do investigations already know where the judges are told
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:28.920]  let the illegals go so the answer is buy a Mexican car or get Mexican plates from
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:38.360]  Chihuahua or wherever you want and you are now invincible gotta love how dirt
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.560]  bag this country is and how corrupt and how the American people that follow the
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:47.480]  rules follow the laws bow to the government that now the police are
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.880]  choking paramedics when they pull their ambulance over because they wouldn't get
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.720]  out of the way on a two-lane rural highway where you can't even get off with
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.560]  gullies down the side and the ambulance tries to pull over for him into the
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.800]  grass and grass is flying up you can watch the whole tape and the cop pulls
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  him over and then starts choking the paramedic in the back on camera saying
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.160]  don't resist as the guy stands there while he chokes him obviously wanting
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:24.800]  the guy to fight back so he could take him out I mean how cowardly is that why
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.920]  don't the police run people like that out of your profession because the people
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.880]  on top want someone in there just like that they want to get rid of Andy
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.360]  Griffith and they want to put in Judge Dredd who serves Obama in the new world
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.480]  order now I want to hear from you on all these issues there's an article up on
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.400]  drugsreport.com right in the middle column US Postal Service announces
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.280]  giant ammo purchase it's from info wars.com

[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.000]  archive in the top story archive on the right hand side of info wars.com it's
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.400]  so important to click on that top stories archive because we have so many
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.040]  articles they scroll off that's why I say go to drugsreport.com it's easy to
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:20.360]  find third or fourth links right in the middle column and that ties into the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:26.520]  Aberdeen news ammo shortage explodes ammunition still difficult to find in
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.080]  wake of Sandy Hook shootings as citizens believe that the government is
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.320]  attempting to restrict the Second Amendment we're not attempting to do it
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.280]  it's it's it's happening now I want to give out the toll-free number on that
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.000]  front I want to talk about immigration also Russia is seeking to soothe
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.560]  security fears and jitters well I mean al-Qaeda is Western NATO run and al-Qaeda
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.640]  has been blowing stuff up I think there is a real terror threat over there the
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.200]  but still statistically got a better chance dying on a car wreck over there
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:02.200]  being mugged or dying of food poisoning they'll probably be 50 people of the
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.280]  million that show up at the Olympics I've guaranteed the diet of food poisoning
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.000]  I was just that's a random guesstimate number but I mean tens of thousands die
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  in the US and Russia every year look up the numbers from food poisoning but are
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.160]  you all scared of that you should be I am I've had food poison a couple times
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.520]  everybody else I know gets it all the time listen I don't eat at dirty
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:28.960]  restaurants and I don't eat leftovers I mean I'll eat leftovers like all I'm
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.160]  Thanksgiving I'll eat food right then at like noon and then I'll eat it again at
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.800]  nighttime and then I'm done with it and I don't get food poisoning knock on
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.720]  wood but the bottom line is I don't eat in big chain places here that's where
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.960]  you get food poisoning oh I hate it and I'm digressing Putin's moment at world
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:54.520]  podium that's why the globalists want to embarrass him the hotels are falling
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.040]  apart I mean it's really a bad area Russia that they're hanging out in
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:04.960]  feds warned associate flights about toothpaste tube bombs there's a race to

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.280]  have is that nepotism or crony ism I guess that'd be crony ism we're gonna
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.400]  skip this network break and play Rex Jones's report here and I'd give it an
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.640]  A plus other than the fact that the audio is over driven but we're gonna fine
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.280]  tune this each time just quite frankly I just came and turned the mic on and
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.680]  walked out or I should have been listening that he was over driving on the
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.280]  mic my fault but it just shows how he's pretty much you know doing this on his
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.040]  own with the help of John bound with the editing and his report breaks down the
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.480]  fact that they're they always try to condition the youth to be servants of
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.960]  the authoritarian state now they're trying to neutralize youth and turn them
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.560]  into mindless people out of the movie Wally who just lay around all day and
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:00.800]  watch television and don't understand entrepreneurial enjoyment and so we're

[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.200]  entrepreneurship the war on barter the war on us communicating with each other
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.440]  outside of a Walmart here it is throughout history authoritarian regimes
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.120]  have wanted to control the youth and condition them to spy on their parents
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.040]  and to join Hitler youth publications like Forbes and the weak have asked the
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.320]  question why is there a war on lemonade stands we're gonna answer that important
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:06.800]  question an 11 year old girl's lucrative cupcake business is in limbo she was
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.880]  prohibited from selling cupcakes that were made in her home and had not made

[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.240]  police her crime she had been selling lemonade at 25 cents a cup for less than
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.560]  half an hour and probably didn't make much more than $5 police informed her
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:33.840]  that a permit would cost $400 in protest this kooky and insane attack on an
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.600]  American tradition August 20th is now unofficially National Lemonade Freedom

[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.600]  General Assembly it states local officials who abuse zoning authority
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.120]  powers to power citizens into submission and deprive landowners of
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.520]  constitutional rights in the enjoyment of their land must be subject to fines and
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.680]  actual damages that they cause including attorney fees Colorado students and
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.280]  their parents are furious at their high school after administrators rejected
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:32.760]  their request for spirit week day honoring America because it might offend
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:38.600]  Americans in essence the high school lean on the side of racism rather than to
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:44.080]  allow patriotism to flourish an 11-year-old Oregon girl Madison root
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.200]  tried to help her father pay for expensive braces by selling mistletoe
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.800]  over the holidays according to her father the private security guard hired to
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.840]  oversee the Portland security market told her to simply beg for money rather
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.080]  than to sell a mistletoe her father stated he does not want to encourage
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.120]  begging and wants people to earn their living she is so keen on high work ethic
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.960]  Madison confirmed this I don't want to beg I'd rather work for something than
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.360]  beg people are selling stuff this is a public place despite this reprimanding
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:21.760]  of her business she now has 38 and I did say 38 people working for her at a
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.160]  decent nine dollars an hour the answer to these attacks is to buy local and
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.960]  support small businesses in your community the establishment would have
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.400]  you buying big box store goods from Foxconn slave factories fought with

[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:37.520]  and most of that was his own research that's incredible to see how he's 11
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.440]  and has a much greater grasp of adult things the most adults I know I've taken
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:49.120]  him out to some meetings with pretty high-powered corporate people and he
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.760]  sits there and holds conversations with them for hours these are adults owners
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.480]  of major companies you name it and they're just completely blown away hey

[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.080]  ready I'm having a lot of problems day after day now with this system I think
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.680]  it's going out so for now I'll just go without headphones all right continuing
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.920]  here with the news and information again I said I would take your phone calls
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:22.000]  we'll do that at the start of the next segment again going over the news that
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.840]  is on info wars.com Rand Paul Obama is transforming US into a socialist
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.240]  nightmare that's what I like to hear that is exactly telling it like it is you
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:39.660]  know we have this predisposed idea that if something's real radical it's
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:44.640]  almost rude to say it or to just spell it out like yeah the government ships in
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:50.280]  most the drugs but that's really no big deal let's still arrest people that get
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.440]  caught using them or yeah the government is funding most of the Taliban
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.600]  al-Qaeda and other groups but you know so what they're trying to keep us safe
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.800]  taking our rights away we just have to have a break with the system and tell
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.080]  it like it is Obama is frightening and dangerous Obama is becoming a dictator
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.480]  Obama is a con man for foreign banks robbing people through Obamacare that
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.280]  does double triple quadruple prices that does get rid of your doctor he is a
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:18.440]  liar he is a plague he is a fraud he is a scam he is a disease he represents the
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:26.200]  takeover of our society by trendy con artist and fraud it is anathema so we're
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.560]  gonna be playing that video coming up Rand Paul Obama is transforming US into
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:36.600]  a socialist nightmare yes turn up the rhetoric to meet the level of the fraud
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:41.800]  that we're dealing with that is the answer in a recent interview with Newsmax
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:49.200]  Kentucky senator Rand Paul headed out at president saying that his policies are
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.000]  stifling freedom in America and creating a socialist nightmare well he
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.080]  struck back at the tyrant told it like it was it's hard to imagine exactly what
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:05.120]  his goal is because when you talk to him one-on-one he sounds reasonable and
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.120]  like he's not trying to transform America into some socialist nightmare
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:13.840]  Paul stated the senator described Obama's policies as transformative adding
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.760]  that he is changing us from a country that was a marketplace and freedom of
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:26.080]  choice to a country that is stifled by coercion and mandates Paul has a huge
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:30.320]  issue with the way Obama seems determined to continually bypass Congress
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:34.400]  and take executive action to do blithely whatever he wants and thinks he can get
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.320]  away with close quote pointing specifically to Obama changing aspects of
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.440]  the Affordable Care Act without congressional approval yeah that is 100%
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.800]  dictator activity Paul said basically he pushes the limit to whatever he thinks
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.880]  he can get and won't be rebuked and finally what is Boehner saying because
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.360]  of pressure you'll Boehner put out that meme a few weeks ago about Obama has his
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.640]  pen and phone we have the Constitution everybody went well then why aren't you
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:06.040]  stopping him Boehner aren't you stopping him buddy so now Boehner is out today
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.800]  saying no immigration deal until Obama enforces laws exactly we're gonna
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.320]  legalize the tens of millions of illegals that are here and give you all
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.440]  benefits and give you a driver's license and let you vote illegally they've been
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.720]  caught doing it everywhere that'll fix the immigration problem yeah they already
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.760]  admit since they announced this in the last year that it's record level he
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.160]  legal's pouring across and Obama has already by fiat legalized most the
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.120]  illegals and is not deporting him and I know there's sad stories I know it's
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.160]  rough if I try to go to Mexico and live there and be on welfare they deport me
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.120]  after they shut me down I mean we have the most open borders the most open
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.840]  policies in the world and then we've been guilted by people like Sotomayor to
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:52.880]  say that to call illegals illegals is racist and mean no it's not no it's not
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.520]  I can't go to Mexico and have a baby paid for at the hospital US citizens
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.080]  whether you're Hispanic black white Asian I don't care if you're a US citizen
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.440]  you don't get all that stuff for free I am sick of it there's the quote Sotomayor
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.920]  labeling illegal immigrants criminals is insulting you you anti-gun
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:18.240]  communist which are the one that's insulting by the way she's not even a
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.280]  communist ladies and gentlemen she was she's the fake left for all these
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.400]  ultra-rich or above-the-law tax exempt they write the laws to be exempt and then
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.880]  you use the laws to shut down their competition that's what the new world
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.760]  order is but now Baynard says listen there's widespread doubt about whether
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.520]  this administration can be trusted enforce our laws Baynard you've been
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.760]  supporting the immigration thing that Obama wants because it's the Republican
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.680]  plan of Bush see notice how he plays both sides and notion of the public
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.720]  ignorant so I mean this would just be legalizing the illegals so then he's
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.560]  acting like this plan would actually enforce the law but he's just worried
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.800]  Obama won't enforce it but there's no teeth in it to begin with see it's
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:06.000]  fraud within frauds that's what it is to be a politician a scam artist you know
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.360]  to say something that sounds like it has substance when it has the opposite
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:15.200]  quoting a boner I mean Baynard listen there's widespread doubt about whether
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.160]  this administration can be trusted enforce our laws and it's going to be
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.520]  difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes the
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.160]  Ohio Republican told reporters there's weekly press conference that came
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.360]  exactly a week after Baynard had appeared to jumpstart the debate by
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.680]  releasing principles for an immigration deal that included granting most illegal
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:36.920]  immigrants legal status and giving younger illegal immigrants a specific
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.760]  pathway to citizenship but this week mr. Baynard has seen much less optimistic
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.160]  yeah that's the kill opposition that they know is mounting now we come back
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:49.560]  from break we're going to talk to Peter Ed Joe Richard Corey and many many

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.480]  White House Press Secretary Carney calls freedom a buzzword this is out of the
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.560]  examiner we're acting to reports that says Obamacare will lower work hours
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.560]  because it lowers the hourly threshold and Americans must work harder to obtain
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.960]  healthcare White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called freedom a buzzword
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:56.200]  freedoms just another buzzword for nothing left to lose and you ain't got
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:03.160]  nothing if you ain't got buzzwords isn't that how the song went it's not
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:09.240]  anything but an added choice that they have that allows them more freedom to
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:14.800]  use a certain buzzword more choice he said talk about double-speak by the way
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.600]  you brought that in yesterday and I meant to show it Chris Jordan they have
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.960]  new new new Obama ads for the Affordable Care Act notice how it is the
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.920]  opposite of affordable the Patriot acts the opposite of patriotic it's all a
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:34.280]  sick joke folks and it's like ads about yeah help should get more talking about
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.960]  sex and then there's other one like mama loves her genes and she loves her
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.400]  Obamacare and then I went to the website and they're really putting out this
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:50.160]  cheesy weird trendy stuff like hey we like handlebar mustaches too and socks
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:56.800]  that don't match that's the ultra trendy thing right now of course everybody's
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.840]  got big beards too I'm not against facial hair folks I just don't get all
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:05.480]  these guys that have beards I guess the movie 300 made it popular and they
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.240]  always bug their eyes out of you like their beard's gonna kick your butt or
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.160]  something I could grow one hell of a beard look like Gandalf I wanted to but
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:19.160]  I just itches and stuff yeah there it is that's from healthcare.gov mom loves
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.800]  her comfy jeans she also loves it when you have health insurance and that was
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.320]  like that ad they produced where the parents want to talk to their kid and
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.680]  they call her over they go you really need to do this and then she's like oh I
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.600]  agree they're like oh my gosh that was it's like so cheesy and so opportunistic
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:42.760]  and so fraudulent I mean look at how horrible Obamacare has been do you see
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.480]  Boehner trying to repeal it no you've got the Republican leadership trying to
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:54.360]  suppress the libertarian Tea Party on immigration on Obamacare on everything on
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:36:01.120]  on the power grab by the executive I dread if they get a Chris Christie in or
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.960]  a Rubio and they are just gonna run over us with police state and suddenly all
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.960]  the conservatives who hate Democrats so much they'll go well that's alright if
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.720]  Rubio wants my guns because he leased it in Hillary Clinton Alex get with the
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:28.200]  program man so stinking frustrating now the one on screen now is a parody
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:34.440]  Obamacare the Empire knows best and it's got the Obama rising Sun symbol of
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.560]  Tulsa doom maybe Obama really is Tulsa doom and David ice right and he turns
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:45.960]  into a snake all right ladies and gentlemen Tulsa doom on his mountain of
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:54.840]  power she have a dagger from my heart Max von Sydow start quoting Max von
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:02.760]  Sydow we ought to play the intro from Conan the barbarian after the sea
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:08.840]  swallowed Atlantis and before the rise of the Sons of Arius there was a time of
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:15.360]  great adventure well let me tell you something folks you are living in a
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:23.680]  time of great adventure let's go ahead and take your phone calls Peter in
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:30.200]  California you're on the air go ahead Alex how you doing pretty good brother
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:35.440]  man I'll tell you what you weren't joking about 6th Street down there I was
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:42.960]  just down in your parts about week and a half ago actually met up with Leanne
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:50.080]  McAdoo and John bound at the protest protest there at City Hall against the
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.600]  floor I did you guys ever find out what happened with that by the way we are
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.240]  fighting to try to get it out there's lawsuits being followed a lot more it's
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.320]  just an ongoing process but floor I was getting pulled out major cities from
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.520]  Canada Europe the United States so we're on the March overall but yeah I would
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.400]  advise everyone like to have a travel advisory finally not go to Mexico
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:17.560]  anywhere it's so dangerous I would say anywhere on 8th 7th and 6th Street where
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:23.240]  it meets 35 if you're looking to be mobbed stabbed rolled in the old days
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.320]  people would go roll gaze because I guess they thought it was acceptable they
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.840]  weren't human to beat them up and rob them and people did something about it
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.720]  they should now they roll white people and I mean I'm just gonna tell you black
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.360]  folks because I don't work people to live down there work down there it goes on
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.160]  almost every night roll whites and I don't blame them because if you see a
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.760]  trendy long haired liberal they walk over and test them and call them names
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.760]  and then they beg and go come on bro I'm down I hate white people too then they
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:57.760]  know they're defenseless and they attack I mean it would basically be like lions
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.440]  would go after gazelles with no legs or horns and I kind of like a cheeseburger
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.840]  out the window and then they beat them up on the ground they beg and roll around
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  while they kick them they don't even fight back it is the most pathetic
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  display ever and then they've got news reports this is happening a lot so if you
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:17.280]  want to get stabbed or you want to get mugged go down by the police station
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.000]  because the cops are all in there you know doing whatever they do and just
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.520]  right in front of police station if you want to be attacked see they can't see
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.680]  it though because blacks cannot do anything bad to whites racism is only
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.920]  from white people it's kind of like the black folks drug a white guy to death
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:40.160]  till his head came off as well in the same stretch of road a year after the
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.280]  white guys drug the black guy to death and the white guys all got the death
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.640]  penalty but but the issue is no one ever knew there was one article in local
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:54.360]  paper that was it and I agree dragging a white person to death is not a big deal
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.280]  and you know if you don't go out there and help tie them up to the vehicle then
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.880]  you're racist so I think all white people should be drugged behind vehicles
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.680]  so they're dead and so again I want to advise everyone if you want to go down
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.440]  and be racially attacked and prove that you're sad that you're white go down to
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  or 6 7th 8th and 5th right there go down there at about midnight right where it
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.600]  meets high 35 and just go stand under street light and you will be stabbed
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:28.680]  beaten and and and Rob and I think it's wonderful so going down there and I'm
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.720]  sorry Peter you said what'd you see on 6th Street was it was a lot of fun I
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:40.640]  mean it was just it was mayhem I mean it was it was Bourbon Street meets you
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.120]  know part of all or something down in Brazil it was just every other night I
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.800]  was there for about a week and a half and like you said I mean every other night
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:54.960]  there was just huge fights I mean thankfully I was on my survival shield
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:00.120]  so I think the people were just part and parting like the Red Sea when I was
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.440]  walking down I was just feeling so on fire but well you know also I don't
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:10.280]  think you didn't need any supermail vitality well I have the survival
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.040]  shield right now and that I mean I'd love to do the supermail vitality but I'm
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.080]  I'm not sure I would I'd stay on the ground if I had that stuff in me well
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.960]  thank you for coming down and joining Leanne and the crew down there to
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.440]  protest the fluoride God bless your brother Ed in Canada you're on the air
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:32.920]  go ahead hey Alex how you doing I'm doing all right brother excellent been a
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.200]  long time fan ever since the day of the senior on waking life and been following
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:42.040]  you ever since and I just I really love how you provide relevant news in a
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.440]  historical context well God bless you brother what is on your mind today do
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:53.800]  you think freedoms a buzzword I do at the police state is on my mind I you know
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.840]  I'm concerned about it like everyone else I've had run-ins like many people and
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.200]  once you do and once your rights are violated your eyes are really open to
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.200]  how frequent and easy it can occur well that's right and they're violating the
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.120]  fourth amendment 5th 10th a lot of police departments don't but a lot do and
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.560]  the point is the system wants them to be like that it's a trend it's getting
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.760]  worse and why do we have a bill of rights then if you guys think it can be
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.600]  trampled on go ahead exactly well I you know I like to think on things and come
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.760]  up with any solutions I can and I'd like to propose what could be a potential
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:31.560]  solution all right brother Tom cool I'm a bit of a web developer but it would
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:37.480]  basically be a website that would basically be the premise would be
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:43.120]  almost like baseball cards of violating police officers that just give down
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.880]  their stats give their names and then incorporate some type of form where
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:53.040]  people could petition or people of that town could get awareness and then and
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.880]  then potentially bring that officer to charges or at least removed from duty no
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.120]  no I get it we can make like a digital baseball card and throw the stats up
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:03.520]  there and that's the kind of thing that would catch on with the public to try to
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.900]  but I mean it's so arrogant now like out out where they killed that you know
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.360]  homeless guy the son of the cop after they were found not guilty the police
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.160]  basically celebrated it and arrested people protesting peacefully so I don't
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.040]  mean the cops would probably try to do worse things some of them to get more
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.080]  baseball stats I mean have you ever thought about that sadly yeah but I
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.520]  think I think the real benefit would come in and like it is disgusting that
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.440]  anyone can be murdered or violated by a police officer without recourse to the
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:38.240]  to the criminal officer but I think the real benefit would come in as creating a
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.560]  record of all the incidents is that usually just get lost in the in the you
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.360]  know so much news nowadays and then people get on their free will stumble
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.840]  across these things or just check it out sir you just said a unauthorized FCC
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:57.760]  banned word you just said get ready to delay get ready to delay I'm gonna say it
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:05.400]  though for the internet streams free will as dirty dirty dirty yeah it's
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:11.520]  almost as dirty as saying John Boehner you know if you ever you know now like if
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.920]  you find rotten mayonnaise in the back of your refrigerator it's now called John
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:20.120]  Boehner I don't know why it's just something gross and Obama what should we
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.080]  call Bob Obama we should have him some disgusting nickname because it was good
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.880]  to denigrate and and desecrate these idols of the state what do we want to
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:36.800]  call let's let's call Obama henceforth dog vomit how's that sound yeah
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.640]  president dog vomit I'm serious it's important to defile the enemy what should
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:49.040]  we call him the the the lying serpent the the snake king what should we call
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.880]  I don't know something to do with a pop it or Pinocchio or who knows I guess
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:58.400]  Pinocchio is a good name for my appreciate your call very interesting
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.120]  and Richard in Canada you're on the air worldwide sir how many serve you how are
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:09.000]  you doing Alex I'm an extremist I admit it well you know you're very
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.400]  entertaining and sometimes when you get on a roll it's pretty funny but we want
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.760]  to thank you from up here for all the good work you're doing and oh by the
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:26.960]  way the perfect name for Obama is Obama yeah Obama's a good name
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:35.080]  oh vomit oh liar oh fraudster oh scam artist kind of rolls off the tongue just nicely what
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:38.800]  I wanted to talk to you today about Alex if I could just for a moment is free
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.920]  energy devices I don't know if your listeners have watched the two hour
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:53.000]  video on the thrive calm site but the guy no we still we still we sell the film
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.200]  thrive on DVD it's excellent yeah he states on there there had been about
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:04.200]  5,000 devices suppressed by you know world power well I've seen the
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.120]  documentary and I've been down there we did a news report on it years ago we
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.920]  ought to dig that up or go back down there the University of Texas has
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.880]  created with magnets in their research laboratories were one of the main
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.520]  centers near free energy devices the problem is how do you put them in a
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.880]  car how do you mobilize them how do you roll them out and there's no government
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:30.120]  funding behind it basically the UT stuff is privately funded and absolutely
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.400]  there and there's another problem though there's so many con artists involved in
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.920]  it knowing the public's interested in it there's so many frauds where people
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:39.960]  collect money claiming they're gonna build it and deploy it and they don't
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.880]  that gives it a bad name the only way it could work is that there was given away
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:49.960]  for free yeah the blueprints for it the blueprints but then but then who
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.880]  builds these systems and then how do you deploy them into households well if
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.160]  everybody you know there's a lot of little handymen who build stuff in
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.880]  their garages and basements if you had people starting to build this stuff it
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.960]  would eventually get around it would be disseminated to everyone and this would
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.840]  totally destroy the world financial structure big oil big banks they would
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:22.480]  all go bankrupt well my issue is I just want to absorb them and evolve energy
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:26.880]  wise out of these old toxic systems and and they know we want to get out of the
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.120]  system so they come out with all these fake green initiatives that are just
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.040]  more boondoggles you know electric cars that get their power from coal I mean
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.120]  it's a total joke and they get special parking spots are on high horses what a
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:44.080]  joke that social engineering is failing they've got the cylindra scams the wind
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.760]  mills that don't work and kill all the wildlife and are absolute eyesores and
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:54.680]  then just you know I mean it absolutely it's crazy and we should get more real
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:01.120]  people on about some of the new energy systems but look at wind power it doesn't
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:06.040]  work to have it 50 miles away and try to have giant power but if it's on batteries
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:10.560]  at your house you control it use it as supplemental it's incredible in places
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:16.720]  like Texas but that's a windmill for you or a windmill to pump water or a you
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.880]  know windmill to supply you say you're air conditioning that is the answer but
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:25.840]  when you try to do that they send regulators out to harass you they want
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:32.840]  you to have windmills and hydroelectric thermal on the grid let's
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.480]  thank you Richard from Canada let's talk to Joe in Texas go ahead sir what's on
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:43.760]  your mind today you're doing infidel this afternoon I am kind of an infidel I
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.960]  don't worship the government so well I'm an infidel myself I'm a stay-at-home
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:53.920]  dad these days but I'm retired military medically of course served in 2007 I just
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:56.920]  kind of wanted to talk to you about the different experiences I've had waking
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.760]  people up as I've been awake myself since before 9-11 been watching you for a
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:08.160]  little longer than that you know both good and bad probably the most important
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.440]  one I sat down with this gentleman and a friend of mine both of us were awake he
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.880]  was he was kind of coming to he'd been doing his research for a couple weeks
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.960]  it doesn't matter let him talk go ahead yeah so he he basically told me
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:27.280]  straight up I understand the situation I'm going to join the winning team to our
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:34.760]  face and so we never spoke to them where where he is these days but I mean are
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.120]  you saying he knew about the New World Order and he made the decision to join
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.160]  with Sauron what when we had first started discussing it he was skeptical
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.040]  after a couple weeks of us discussing it and showing him different videos and
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:50.600]  and him doing his own research that was his answer yeah I know a lot of people
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.400]  and I respect that it's it's better than people that just say it doesn't exist
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.360]  and still sell out lying to themselves knowing that they're joining with evil
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.320]  but but but you're claiming to themselves it's okay I don't like people that join
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.560]  with evil but I respect them good you've chosen the team you think's gonna win
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.920]  which by the way is the losing team but go ahead the second instance I go to a
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.600]  PTSD group I was like I said in the infantry I kicked in the doors I've
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.640]  ruined people's lives I regret that to this day well as long as you ask God for
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.800]  forgiveness and I mean you should not have any guilt yes sir a gentleman from

[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:19.560]  by the way folks if you want to wake people up we sell the infowars magazine
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:26.120]  in bulk in groups of 10 up to a hundred or more at cost big color glossy
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:31.920]  magazine full of graphics documents news articles you can get these as low as a
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.040]  dollar a piece when you buy them in bulk to give to friends and family and wake
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:41.840]  people up and the current issue is the police state issue and it's got yours
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:47.520]  truly on the cover in a SWAT team outfit just to get people talking and it's got
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.480]  the good the bad the ugly of the police now we have to reach out to them in the
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.320]  info war to decompartmentalize them so they understand what's going on and
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.000]  they're actually easier than anybody I found to wake up other than military
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.640]  because when you give them the info then it all makes sense they start to listen
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:07.000]  to you okay because they just want the police to do oppressive things that make
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.600]  us all hate them so then it becomes a gang mentality us against them we have
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:14.600]  to go through that line and deprogram them just like we got to deprogram
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.920]  ourselves in the general public and then of course we have the info wars
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.680]  full throttle liberty centerfold with the race cars and fire and american
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.880]  eagles and 50 caliber rifles and let's just say this any trendy communist
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.720]  socialist anti-human fake feminist is gonna really through it gonna get very
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:38.200]  sick looking at this and I don't even know why we put Leanne McAdoo right in
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:41.080]  the middle of the shot I mean I guess she just fits in with the guns and the
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.080]  cars and everything but I'm being sarcastic ladies and gentlemen the point
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:48.600]  is our great reporter Leanne McAdoo with a double 50 cows we got to get her
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.720]  out shooting sometime with the rest of the crew get your car out shooting and
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.160]  get David Knight out shooting the 50 cows with my buddy Steiner but there's the
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:04.600]  cover info wars store.com to get the magazine to get the wake of america
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.320]  coffee that I think is the best coffee out there bar none and remember your
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.320]  purchase makes the broadcast possible okay so we got a former military vet said
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.040]  he was a door kicker and I guess the Iraq was at Afghanistan gun
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:20.680]  confiscations he can tell us that he was saying he was a PTSD group with an FBI
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.880]  counter-terrorism guy probably there to spy on all you guys or I don't he might
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.520]  be a nice guy on FBI guys are actually not bad people but tell us what he told
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:35.320]  you go ahead just a little backstory I was in Salter City Iraq and it was a
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.760]  year after they had put a ceasefire up through the British and all the criminals
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:44.160]  and Iranians had infested but this gentleman I didn't speak for a year
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.280]  going to that group I was in a pretty bad spot so I got to know everybody before
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.480]  I opened my mouth and boy things all changed when I did because when I started
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.760]  bringing things up he became a gate gatekeeper really quick for instance you
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.320]  know I'll give a couple examples the whole donor issue he had an excuse for
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.520]  everything including shooting up the the vehicle which I believe those cops are
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:09.800]  now going to be possibly reprimanded for other other issues yeah like a car
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.720]  that doesn't even look like the truck they're looking for with white women in
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:16.920]  it in broad daylight they shot up what three cars full of people that weren't
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.000]  even I know why black guys were wearing shirts saying I'm not donor I'm sorry go
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.600]  ahead the first thing you learn is trigger discipline in the military so
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.920]  they just don't I'm dumbfounded with that and how he could defend it being from
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:34.840]  a military and civilian law enforcement you heard me guess before you told me he
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.320]  was there spy on you guys probably I haven't made up my mind yet it's been a
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:43.240]  couple years but like I said he's a gatekeeper and we have you know different
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.200]  gentlemen come there from different backgrounds every every era even World
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:51.640]  War two vets and so if anybody brings anything up that's against the
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.560]  establishment you know who's going to answer at this guy and he's going to
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.920]  answer with the party line and it's that's matter of fact never changed this
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:04.560]  man's mind but he comes off you know as a nice guy truly believes it so I mean
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.760]  again I can't make up my mind with him but on the same token I've stood at
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.760]  parade rest in the military in a battalion formation and discussed how
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:19.200]  we were going to have any more discussion about mutiny than heads
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:23.240]  would roll so I mean that we come from very different backgrounds apparently
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:31.200]  but the third thing I wanted to bring up to him like I said was a third
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:35.320]  example would be Fukushima and the Navy sailors we have Navy gentlemen in
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:38.320]  there as well hold on I want to hear this let me guess the FBI guys says
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:44.920]  radiation is probably a mess of furious was good mangosi was good government
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:50.080]  shippin the drugs and it's good I mean these guys have joined with sorrow

[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:40.920]  between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the sons of
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:50.120]  Arius there was an age undreamed of and on to this Conan destined to bear the
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:57.800]  jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow it is I his chronicler
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:04.160]  who alone can tell thee of his saga let me tell you of the days of high
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:20.040]  adventure Robert E. Howard great writer but who actually wrote that is an even greater writer in my opinion and that of course is Oliver Stone who is a
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:24.040]  listener of this show I've confirmed but won't come on because of controversy
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:33.120]  all right that's an awful stop right there I just mentioned that earlier come I got I mentioned
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.800]  idiocracy so I thought I'd play a clip of that by the way did you get the Mars
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:39.360]  attack clip or they're like don't run we are your friends we used to have that as
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.760]  an outro get a cue up don't run we are your friends because this is this is like
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:49.600]  Obamacare don't run no death panels don't run you keep your doctor I mean and
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.360]  of course they're then attack shooting people the laser beams and laughing
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.880]  because they they don't run when you say don't run Joe finishing your story
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:03.200]  oh we have it oh good so bomber supporters helping I mean I mean we are
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.000]  your friends
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.280]  let me tell you the most spied on group it's veterans and the minute he said
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.240]  there was an FBI agent in there I said let me we came back from break and I
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.520]  said let me guess he's spying on you and messing with you and I've actually had
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:26.560]  some FBI people give me stuff before that was good I've had federal marshals
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.440]  give me stuff so I know they're not all bad but they're all compartmentalized and
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.400]  they do what they're told they're convinced they're good because they're
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:37.720]  compartmentalized and they're all about how they manage everyone so they're the
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:42.760]  winners it's a game to play along with the system and say you're in control of
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.240]  it but go ahead Joe finish up your points brother if anything I would I would
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:52.000]  liken him to the clergy response team the real threat is the doctors 30 minutes
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.320]  or less better than dominoes you're gonna walk out with some mind-altering
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:03:01.640]  drug they do that so they can then take your rights away down the road the new
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.240]  freedom initiative wants to put half of Americans on drugs by 2020 fighting that
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:13.560]  battle I've been forced on every single one of them beside the point about
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.360]  Fukushima and the clergy response team was the only thing that he couldn't
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:22.840]  rebut so you can play a newscast where the clergy response teams that we that
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.760]  we documented with Pastor butch Paul at three or four was in the news they
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.000]  literally go to the FEMA camp turn your guns take the inoculations and then now
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.120]  we have the preachers on TV going go to the camp take the shots of the Lord and
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:39.920]  there's just these little soft lazy guys that work two days a week and they're
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.760]  going to hell I mean I'm not trying to judge them but I'm telling you their
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.520]  Pharisees and if Christ was here he beat him with bullwebs go ahead I'm
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.600]  tracking on that the guy was dumbfounded last week because they gave him a
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.120]  letter in the mouth that he couldn't have guns anymore he come to our group
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.840]  asking why basically he said you know a neighbor had been bothering him called
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.920]  the cops on him and he said boy come on my property and I'll take care of you and
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.320]  so his preacher who he confessed that to you because they're religious man of
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.560]  course I basically called the cops on him and now they've removed his right
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:15.200]  tone yeah psychologists now will not keep the info doctors and they'll twist
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.240]  anything and a lot of them are government operatives listen every dentist my
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.680]  dad knows in the last three years they tried to recruit him for Homeland
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.920]  Security and when they try to recruit my dad he goes just because who my son is
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:30.200]  they didn't even know that they're like no Dr. Jones you know I've been coming to

[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:40.920]  look at how good try oxygen is it turns everybody into zombies what's wrong with
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:47.600]  having plastic softeners in the subway red
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:56.040]  well ladies and gentlemen we are joined by Ms. Hari the food babe who was on
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:59.960]  with us two days ago when she launched her big national campaign she's had many
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.280]  helpful campaigns and I would say our audience contributed to that so I'm very
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:08.160]  proud of our audience very thankful for her here's us say today stories up on
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.080]  info wars dot com also on the left-hand side of drugs report dot com it's the
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:22.320]  fourth story down the left-hand column subway to remove chemical from bread it's
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:27.720]  amazing Vani Hari has done it again subway one of the world's biggest
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.120]  bread bakers is about to remove a chemical from its breads that raise the
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:40.520]  ire of influential health activists and food blogger the food babe com and she
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.880]  joins us right now now they're responding saying we'll take it out but
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.000]  the FDA says we're allowed to have it in well I mean Hitler said they were allowed
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.720]  to line Jews up and shoot them and our government once said it was okay to have
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:58.360]  blacks and slaves pulling plows down the road so just because the FDA says that
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.840]  melamine can be in the milk they execute you for that in China and that for me is
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:07.400]  the big issue here if you go back just five years ago we could not have
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.800]  victories this fast it is a collapse of the system I go to even mainline
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:14.960]  grocery stores now and everything advertises we have real sugar in our
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:21.360]  ketchup we're non-gmo organic they're not even trying the natural scam anymore
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:27.920]  which means you know absolutely nothing so Bonnie Hari joins us aka the food
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.440]  babe to talk about this huge victory to the bottom of the hour then I'll go back
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.080]  to your calls Corey and Thomas and Dave and Jonathan and Clarence and everybody
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.480]  that's holding but this is a big deal because less than 48 hours after she
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.240]  launched her campaign what was she on Tuesday when she launched it she launched
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:46.160]  it that day was it Tuesday
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:52.800]  it was Tuesday amazing so here we are on Thursday and they've now announced as of
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.240]  last night in USA today came out with it today that they're gonna do this but but
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:01.400]  it's no big deal well the key is this is banned in every other country its own
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:05.520]  only authorized here and there's so many other plastic emulsifiers and silicone
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:09.960]  derivatives and precursors in the McNuggets you name it it's all falling
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:15.360]  like a house of cards and it shows the power of we the people to change what's
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.760]  happening in civilization we can do it ladies and gentlemen we can expose that
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:25.680]  st. John's wort in double-blind studies for 20 years is better than Prozac why
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:30.400]  are they putting people on Prozac and all these other drugs because they want
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.520]  to take your rights away later folks we have a revolution against that a
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.040]  revolution against federalization of police a revolution against the fake
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.640]  drug war a revolution against globalism and banker bailouts a revolution
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.920]  against Warren Buffett and the big tax and spend fake liberals promoting higher
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:50.120]  taxes because they're exempt from them and get the taxpayer money we're having
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:56.480]  a revolution a renaissance of awakening and I am so excited I thought it
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.680]  take a few weeks for her to have a victory on this but she is she is so focused
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:05.360]  and has got such a great grassroots support base on her Facebook and Twitter
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:10.760]  and on her website and you know shows like ours that that that she was able to
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.080]  hammer this out there and they're running scared great job tell us about
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:19.160]  what's unfolded and what's happened well thank you so much Alex you know what was
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.800]  so critical you know I launched the petition right about noon on Tuesday and
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.920]  I was on this program I think within the next hour or two and it was really
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:34.360]  fascinating to see all of your supporters and everyone coming over to join
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.040]  the petition and I can't tell you how many personal emails that I got from the
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.080]  info wars folks to say you know they heard me on this program they're so
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.080]  upset about plastic and their subway sandwiches and that they were going to
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.080]  speak out about it so I just want to personally thank you and all of your
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:56.240]  listeners and everybody who follows info wars Alex your team and your support
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:02.000]  has been amazing it is absolutely unheard of that any company has has
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.080]  responded this quick in history not to mention get 50,000 signatures on a
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.760]  petition within 24 hours people were very visibly upset about this once they
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.480]  found out that subway wasn't using this chemical for everybody else across the
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.760]  globe but only using it for us they were really upset about this double in
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.400]  standard not to mention that this chemical in bread is the same stuff in
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.760]  yoga mat on the bottom of your shoes it causes cancer because when it's heated
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.000]  it degrades into a carcinogen it compound that it's linked to lung problems
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.080]  and it asmatic trigger people were very upset and there is no way for subway to
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:48.200]  hide and hide undercover even of the FDA because they realized that they've
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:51.640]  already taken this ingredient out of all of those different subs across the
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.280]  globe and not us and so they had to respond and the funny thing is is they
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:00.000]  said that they were going to do this all along but it's really interesting
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.720]  because I contacted them 10 days ago on their customer service line and through
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.600]  email and they didn't tell me any of this they wouldn't even tell me anything
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:12.640]  about this ingredient back then and they wouldn't tell me it a year ago when I
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:18.280]  released a video about about this substance me even eating a yoga mat out
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.120]  of pure comedy and reaction and to get people thinking about what they're
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.040]  eating and in a year before that in 2012 when I released the full
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.880]  investigation on subway how it wasn't really eating fresh so it's really
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:35.840]  interesting that they are coming out finally saying that this ingredients
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.080]  going to come out of their bread but if anybody thinks that they can eat this
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:45.040]  now think again this is not a subway sandwich you want to be eating first of
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:48.720]  all all of the subway sandwiches right now currently have this ingredient as
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:54.840]  well as a slew of other ingredients that are plasticizers that are GMOs that are
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:01.480]  non-organic that are hidden MSG in the form of yeast extractor natural flavors
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.760]  or even have caramel coloring in it which is considered a carcinogen as well
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.680]  so I would really like to have subway invite me to their headquarters and
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.840]  talk to them about the ingredients they do plan on using now to create their
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:18.440]  bread and let's take a look at them and see if they're going to be really safe
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:25.520]  and also I would expect that they provide a timeline publicly especially to the
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:32.120]  over now 65,000 people who have signed the petition we owe that they owe that
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:36.720]  timeline to us to know when we are going to be seeing the removal of this
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:42.080]  chemical well again I am so excited people get excited when their team
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:46.960]  wins the Super Bowl or they get excited when you know somebody says oh cool car
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:53.720]  I get excited about reversing the trend that America is a dumping ground for
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.840]  Agent Orange for plastic and the food for melamine and the milk I mean it's a
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:04.160]  joke what they get away with and it needs to stop and then meanwhile they'll
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:07.880]  try to shut down a municipal water supply of it's got one part per billion of
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:11.040]  arsenic or something that studies show doesn't even do anything so the
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:15.440]  government on one end will harass people using standards that are too high if
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:19.640]  it doesn't make sense but if there's a lobby a corporate lobby out there they'll
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:24.840]  use over regulation to tax and control local governments and people but then
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:28.640]  when it comes to big agra they've just been given a free reign I mean talk
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.440]  about some of your an expert on this Monsanto and how they own the courts and
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:37.080]  the revolving door in Republican and Democratic administrations and how they
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:42.360]  can infect people's crops and then go sue them in court and you get in trouble
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:48.160]  because their crops got into your crop it's incredible it is absolutely
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:56.200]  incredible and you know in 2007 when when Barack Obama stood up before the food
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.040]  democracy now crowd and everyone and said that they we all deserve to know
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:03.680]  what's in our food and that he would fight for labeling them GMOs and then
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:08.080]  turn around and hire the Secretary of Agriculture to be Tom Bilsack someone in
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:13.040]  the back pockets of Monsanto and the corn refiners Association that was a
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.880]  real big slap in the face and and that's why I stood up at the DNC and why I
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:21.280]  ran to be a delegate so that I could make all of our voices heard around this
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:27.480]  issue because it's really sad that the U.S. government is allowing seed life
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:32.920]  food to be patented by companies and then owned and controlled and then
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:38.080]  furthermore owning and controlling farmers who have no control over how
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:42.880]  seeds fly in the in the wind and how they cross pollinate and and end up on
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.040]  different land and then allowing these companies to sue these farmers for their
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.240]  farmland to get back money to these big
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:57.680]  clobber chemical companies and let's just remember why you know who's who's
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:03.000]  creating these genetically engineered engineered seeds it's it's all of the
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.240]  big chemical companies is Monsanto, Dow, Singenta, BSAF they are all in the
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:12.680]  business of selling chemicals so if you think that they're gonna create a seed
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.320]  that doesn't involve their chemical the the Agent Orange the Roundup all of
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:24.600]  these different toxic life-threatening type of chemicals on the on these seeds
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:28.520]  you've got something else coming because that's exactly what they're trying to do
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.200]  they're trying to sell more chemicals and they're trying to put more on the
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:36.520]  land and pollute the earth and what's really sad is that ever since GMOs have
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.520]  been introduced over 400 million more pounds of herbicides have been sprayed
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:46.240]  on our land and I can't even imagine what is gonna happen to Iowa in the
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.520]  future if it's gonna be a toxic wasteland or not oh it's it's in all the tap
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:54.400]  water all over the place it's a nightmare Vani Hari the food babes with us for one
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:57.840]  more segment but before we go to break I wanted to ask you a lot of times when
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:02.280]  they take one emulsifier plastic out softener I noticed they'll just add
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.120]  another one like they'll get rid of aspartame but then put in basically the
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:09.680]  same thing under another name do you expect them to really try to clean their
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:13.160]  food up because I'd like to be able to eat it subway well I would too you know
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:16.760]  it'd be so nice to be able to stop there on the road or you know because
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:20.280]  they're every nice to have fast food that wasn't poison yeah cuz I mean a lot
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:24.400]  of times you're on a road trip where is there yeah and really honestly the only
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:27.900]  place to eat right now is Chipotle because they are removing GMOs and you
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:32.280]  can get a nice organic black bean salad with some guacamole and avoid GMOs and
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:37.680]  they have mostly organic ingredients but but with subway it'll be really hard
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.320]  to eat there unless they really clean up all their breads and take out again the
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:47.720]  GMOs the yeast extract the hidden MSG that makes sure that kills your brain
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:51.480]  cells that that makes you addicted to their food remember that tastes neat
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:56.240]  more than you should and and the caramel is a conspiracy stay there let's come

[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:21.080]  I used to be such a sweet sweet thing till they got a hold of me with their GMOs
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.880]  and their bifocates all their red dye number fives and the cancer rate went up
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.760]  3,000 percent
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:43.720]  till monstern told me I bought all the government's bull but
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:59.200]  no more mr. nice guy
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.680]  ladies and gentlemen it's time to be mean when it comes to this and get in
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:09.360]  their face and point out what they're doing and our guests the food babe is
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:13.560]  simply amazing we got five minutes left of the short segment I got a very
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:16.280]  special video coming up ever that and then right back to your phone calls and
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:21.280]  some breaking news as well but Vani Hari joins us and folks we have victory
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:24.600]  every time we take action together because what the globalist you're doing
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:28.800]  is so outrageous and used to they would just go oh this plastic's good for you
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.760]  now they go the government said we're allowed to so you can't sue us but we're
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.920]  taking it out and what she's doing what others are doing is the blueprint of
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.520]  victory Vani Hari other key points you'd like to relate to people and give us an
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:46.680]  idea of what's next because I can't wait to have you on about that yeah
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.680]  absolutely so you know what I want everyone to realize is that you know
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:55.640]  there is a lot of power when you make your voice heard when you share this
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:59.320]  information with your friends and family when you tell someone who may not know
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:04.640]  maybe you're walking by and someone's about to walk walk into a subway what if
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:07.880]  you were to just take the second and say hey did you know there's plastic in
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:11.600]  their bread and just open people's eyes because that's what's really going to
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:15.520]  change this world imagine everybody becoming aware of what's really in their
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:20.040]  food and the amount of change that can quickly occur I mean this change happened
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:27.040]  in 24 hours you know this announcement and imagine if so many more people were
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:31.600]  to really become awake so what I want to challenge everyone listening here today
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:36.520]  and viewing this is you know voice your concerns about the food system when you
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.040]  see a petition that you resonate with and you agree with that hey we shouldn't
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:46.560]  have GMOs and Cheerios or we shouldn't have you know plastics in our in our
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:55.040]  bread or caramel coloring or any of these other ingredients or MSG or or you
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.120]  know flame retardants in the case of Gatorade you know Gatorade you set flame
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.120]  retardants in it until a teenager in Mississippi spoke up about it and
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:08.760]  started a petition so we are really powerful when we speak up and we bind
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:13.880]  together and we make our voice heard and I think what was so amazing about this
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:18.520]  action is not only people did they go sign the petition but people went inside
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:22.640]  the subway restaurants and started questioning the franchise owners and
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:27.040]  the managers and the people working there and those people got upset and
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.560]  started contacting the headquarters when what what are we selling here you know
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:36.000]  they didn't even understand that they were selling plastic to their people so
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.760]  imagine us doing that for every single chemical we encounter at the grocery
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:46.280]  store and at fast-food restaurants and in other places we really have the power
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.920]  to change and like I said last time I was on that the the most critical thing
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:55.760]  you can do is what you decide to put in your mouth every single day and if you
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:00.000]  make that decision vote with your dollars you really can change the world I
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:05.560]  tell you I just get so excited about everything that's going on and it's
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:12.240]  just a beautiful thing to to see you taking action and all the success you've
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:16.960]  had resonating with the people and all these other great activists I'm not
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:21.520]  trying to get people a pep talk here it's true we could really turn society
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:26.520]  around if more people just start taking action like every time I'm in a gas
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.760]  station or convenience store my kids want some candy or some gum and let's
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:34.000]  say we've been hiking so they deserve it or whatever it's so hard to find
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.280]  anything that doesn't have all the new aspartame derivatives in it it'll make
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:41.640]  my kids go blind on record and brain damage them and it's an excitotoxin and
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:44.360]  there's all these other chemicals and I look up what it is and it's always
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.360]  petrochemicals I mean just and then other countries don't allow it sometimes I
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:52.400]  got a whole foods I can get like German candy and stuff that's actually good and
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.480]  doesn't give you a headache I mean it's like can't we just have normal food here
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:03.080]  exactly you know it kills me you you mentioned gum every time I go past a
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:07.800]  counter at you know the CVS the Walgreens the drugstore or at the normal
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:11.520]  grocery store and I see all of those things that are marketed towards children
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:17.160]  that are real low on the shelf full of all these chemicals not only plastics
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:23.000]  and MSG and aspartame but BHT that really nasty ingredient that's banned all
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.480]  over the world and all the artificial food dyes that require a warning label
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:31.560]  for for you to have it in other countries it's really frightening and I
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:37.400]  guarantee you know we really are changing the world faster than we even can
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.640]  imagine if we start to speak up so I just hope everyone joins me come over to
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:48.160]  foodbabe.com see what's going on all right you're awesome thank you so much

[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:16.320]  are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:20.880]  population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.720]  been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get

[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:08.560]  renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the
[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:15.800]  Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:22.120]  United States to take action and reply. Dr. Martin Luther King the also of
[02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:25.800]  non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:44.400]  Memphis, Tennessee. People calling themselves members of the weather
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.480]  underground last night planted farms and federal office buildings in Washington
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:52.520]  and Oakland, California. They took the babies out of incubators and left the
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:56.680]  children to die on the cold floor. Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:34:00.640]  congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgment that the
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.040]  Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence Navy ship. The death of
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:08.760]  bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:13.080]  effort to defeat Al Qaeda. The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:17.280]  a US helicopter more than 30 people were killed and there are reports this
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:21.840]  morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs. There may be a false flag incident
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:27.000]  where a ship goes down and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.240]  war. If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.280]  everybody in between is that we all hated the bank bailout. The Department of
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.960]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree. It comes out to
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:46.280]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. Today it is infinitely easier to kill a
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:50.680]  million people than to control a million people. They estimated that they would
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:55.160]  have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers. And when I
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:59.400]  say eliminate I mean kill. I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:09.040]  isn't a game. From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. That's
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:12.520]  right we're going toe-to-toe with the New World Order and I'm going to Corey
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:16.280]  Thomas, Dave, Jonathan and Clarence here in about five minutes and then to all
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.320]  the news we haven't gotten to yet. But first off you've heard about clergy
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:24.760]  response teams in regard. Millions of people have now been recruited to be
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:29.880]  spies against the public. And it's not being done to stop terrorism. It's not
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:33.360]  being done to stop crime. It's part of an authoritarian takeover. We need to be
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:40.200]  honest about that. So we produced this training video and I've decided to join
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:45.920]  the dark side and join Karenning. But I'm a coward deep down so I'm not going to
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.680]  admit that to myself consciously. Out of fear I'm going to join the New World
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:54.160]  Order and so I've rationalized that I'm really a hero fighting Al Qaeda even
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:57.600]  our government runs Al Qaeda and then I'm spying on everyone because I'm a
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:05.160]  hero. And so we've produced a video to kind of rationalize my decision to
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:09.840]  endorse Obamacare, to endorse open borders, to endorse forced inoculation, to
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:17.000]  endorse GMO and to endorse roundup in our water so we can die of cancer. And I
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.600]  just endorse Monsanto, I endorse plastic in the McNuggets, I endorse kidney
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.200]  failure, I endorse melamine in the baby formula, only country in the world allows
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:31.520]  it, U.S. I've decided I've been wrong all along. Everything is fine. I think the
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:35.000]  police, if they see an ambulance driving should just open fire on it and blow it
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.680]  up with laws rockets. I mean don't just beat up the ambulance drivers because
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:44.600]  they dare have flashing lights like theirs. You know, it's, it's, I mean I
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:49.760]  just support big government now. I support tyranny and I've decided to join
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.280]  because I'm a hero with the system. So here is the actual training video. You're
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:58.880]  ready to listen, you'll be able to hear it. I'll have this video reposted to
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:08.440]  infowars.com right now for folks. But ladies and gentlemen, here is the
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:15.680]  video. This is a Homeland Security declassified training video of how you
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.960]  induct yourself into total paranoia and false reality to overthrow freedom. Join
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:25.280]  evil in the name of fighting terrorists that are publicly run by the hijacked
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.040]  government. So here, here is my mental breakdown joining Homeland Security
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:32.160]  right now. Exclusive. Here it is.
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:37.040]  Artifil Relax, let's listen to that music.
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:48.040]  Even though I'm just a lowly person and aren't part of the greatest supreme
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:53.520]  homeland, people in black uniforms that I look up to. I'm still part of the federal
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:59.000]  family that Janet talks about because I snoop for them and that's what America's
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.280]  about total schizophrenic paranoia absolutely thinking terrorists are hiding under every table
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.520]  just think they all look normal but you know any of them could be a terrorist
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:19.640]  don't trust the public only trust janet big sis napolitano and homeland security
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:23.480]  that's what i've learned and that's what i do
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:31.720]  yeah it's in the communities against terrorism alerts they put out hundreds of them they say
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:37.000]  people wearing blue jeans are using cell phones of the terrorist i work at a local internet cafe
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  coffee shop and it told me that there were people doing stuff like trying to have privacy or using
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.160]  voice over ip or communicating through pc games man there's nothing these terrorists won't do
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:55.560]  but the number one thing they said was they use cash or credit cards that's a really scary part
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:39:01.640]  there's a lot of them come in there a lot of them using cash and some of them even want to be anonymous
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:07.640]  and have privacy when they surf the web those are the ones you gotta watch it makes me realize that
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:15.560]  most the population are terrorists there's so many people using cell phones there's so many people
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:21.560]  who've got screen blockers so i can't read what they're saying there's even more using cash
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:29.320]  the terrorist the terrorist figure hold yourself together you can do it
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:35.400]  you can do it for america do it for janet finally my life means something
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:47.800]  i have the fbi now trust no one but janet don't be on the politano no one but her
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.640]  you've always wanted to be part of an elite team
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:40:04.600]  team you've got responsibilities now now get out there and start spying

[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:27.320]  all right a little bit of dark satire there folks but this is really a serious situation
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:32.440]  where the government's running around trampling the bill of rights to fight terrorism and they're
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:36.520]  running the terrorist and funding them and protecting them on record i'm just gonna keep
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:42.760]  hammering that till the cows come home quarry in colorada you're on the air i've now exposed myself
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:49.720]  sir actual homeland security training video what do you think well i did have a topic picked out
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:55.720]  but after i saw that i was just like i don't know but anyway i just call him because i mean it's
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:01.160]  not rocket science what you got to do in this country to get it back it's proven that obama
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:07.000]  really don't care the thing i'm calling about is how dumb down the people are going to criticize
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:13.320]  obama call it as it is uh i used to live up in the mountains i was forced down to live in a city
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.720]  for a while i no longer go to the zoo i go to the local supermarket to see these people act the way
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:27.720]  they do is unreal it's crazy and i'm dumbfounded by it with all the evidence out there and these
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:35.160]  people just don't see it now as for the cops and the firemen it's clearly chemical imbalance i think
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:40.680]  they need to get off the gmo's get off all that stuff well no that's why people are acting so weird
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:46.200]  is we're dying of cancer mental illness is up i mean we are poisoned and then the system poses as
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:51.720]  the saviors while they're poisoning us i mean it's very very simple and then don't things only get
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:56.760]  worse they're absolutely right and it's just getting crazy and crazier so i think everybody
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:01.560]  should just go to the grocery store and stick warning labels on all the chewing gum i mean and
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:05.800]  i mean all of it's got aspartame it's good luck finding it that doesn't and that's really going
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:10.520]  to be the answer to all this it's just all of us getting aggressive it'll feel weird the first time
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:16.280]  you um go to the supermarket and are sticking stickers on things or sticking in fours magazines
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:21.880]  inside the newspaper racks or whatever but it will drive the enemy insane it's like people
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:26.840]  all went into subways started freaking out on them why is there plastic in here banned worldwide
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.280]  people are having a normal response and i'll never forget there was a case in
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:37.320]  Missouri or Tennessee it was like 10 years ago there's been a bunch of these and they had the
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:43.160]  the 11th uh well the girls were 11 years old whatever that is eighth grade or whatever it was
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:49.240]  seventh grade basketball team and they had cameras in the showers for their safety that was watched
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:54.360]  by the quote staff at the field house well other girls from another town who hadn't been conditioned
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:58.520]  freaked out when they saw cameras the dads all got mad it was almost a fight with the police
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:03.560]  and then the the principal came out and said well this is normal there could be theft or
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:08.680]  problems in the showers and then it turned out sacramento was doing in in california
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:16.920]  but it was the girls had the normal response ah there's a camera in the shower you see we
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:20.440]  had to have the normal response that man our cancer rates are exploding and
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:24.440]  man diet coke song record making people go blind you know we've got to
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:31.240]  get around to understanding this go ahead i'm sorry well that's okay i i agree with you totally
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:36.600]  alex and it's it's very stupid stupid out there i mean people are not waking up with all the
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:41.240]  evidence out there i actually got kicked out of my house for what i believe in uh she actually wrote
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:45.400]  you down in a report to the judge that i listened to alex jones and i think the government's poison
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:52.360]  this oh my gosh how evil so so what your wife got you kicked out because you're uh oh you listen to
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:59.160]  the show oh has a motto why die by your own hands and she's referring to the poisons in the food my
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:05.960]  eight year old okay she tries to educate her mother mother blows it off but anyway i'm getting to that
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.520]  and i'm taking care of it but i'm just dumbfounded by the people all the evidence out there it's
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:16.520]  clear as day so your wife used it as evidence in court of your thought crime that you listen to a show
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:24.200]  that's in the top ten in things like talkers magazine i mean we're award-winning broadcast
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:29.400]  on record everything we've been talking about's come true has been documented and and she still
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:36.200]  is in her own world believing that this is some kind of evil broadcast exactly and you know what
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:40.440]  my little girls cried when i told them they're not going to have McDonald's anymore they literally cried
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:46.200]  well that sounds like you well i mean you're a bad father you don't want to give them a plastic
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:51.400]  emulsifiers i mean what is your problem better watch out because i give them nasonite i'm too so
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:58.040]  oh my god oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh folks i want to apologize right now for here in this
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:03.560]  extremist i appreciate your call god bless you extremist um this is this is incredible i mean
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:08.200]  um actually i go on road trips sometimes and all the reasons mcdonald's and i think i ate some
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:14.680]  four years ago and got a huge headache close to a migraine and then i started thinking back
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:20.360]  to times i've had migraine headaches is when i've been eating fast food which i haven't you know like
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.440]  in 10 years i've done like probably 10 times but it was sometime about a year ago i was on a road
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:35.000]  trip and i ate uh sonicers yeah and i mean i felt like i'd been run over by a car and i'll go in
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.920]  chinese food restaurants and i'll go listen you don't i don't want to miss you they go no msg
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:45.000]  and i'll go now listen and the food comes out and i can stick a fork in it i can taste it it has that
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:51.960]  once you're used like i'm not eating this they go oh sorry uh then they'll go back and cook it
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:55.800]  without it because you know the chefs back there slinging on the food and they do that because the
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:00.200]  meat's been frozen they know i'd rather taste frozen meat okay i'm out on the road somewhere you
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:04.760]  know the frozen meat taste than eat this stuff developed by the japanese military in world war
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:10.920]  one to make people eat rotten meat okay i don't want it eating my brain it kills brain cells it's
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:18.120]  worse than jack daniels folks for your family i mean i love how they got all these toxic substances
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:24.680]  like alcohol that's okay but then they'll take something you know 20 times worse and and pushing
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.760]  on people like i'm just ranting i don't even know what i'm talking about anymore which makes me want

[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:42.280]  the cc in r and up to 80 million grams were dispersed that's enough to overdose every single
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:49.400]  person on the planet over a hundred thousand times but what's wrong with dying it gives the
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:57.080]  earth over to the elite well the elite they can't run from this no one can run from this the plutonium

[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:33.400]  stuff you see in credit cards being released is the government doing it that didn't claim they
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:38.360]  need more funding and power and it's now in a new snowden document one reason they're so mad a new
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:43.880]  report from mbc news confirms quote that the federal government through cyber security launched
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:53.960]  their own false flag operations and then blamed it on their enemies as part of an excuse to take

[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.800]  launched attacks and then blamed it on other hackers they launched stux net for heaven sakes
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:34.520]  and then used it to say we need cyber security when they launched it it was stuck snug we need to
