[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:37.360]  Texas Alex Jones we have another incredibly important worldwide broadcast
[00:37.360 --> 00:43.600]  lined up for you on this Wednesday the second day of May 2012 transmission I'm
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.800]  Alex Jones your host we're gonna have dr. Steve Pacinic joining us in the
[00:48.800 --> 00:52.560]  second hour and we're gonna open the phones up for most of that hour I'm
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.200]  I'm really trying to get to more your calls because they're always so
[00:55.200 --> 01:01.440]  informative but I'm gonna open the phones up for US military in the second
[01:01.440 --> 01:07.160]  hour specifically Afghan vets because I can't tell you how many emails come in
[01:07.160 --> 01:11.680]  I'm gonna be honest with you I don't have an email they set me up emails
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.520]  somehow it gets out I end up spending all my time trying to read my email I
[01:15.520 --> 01:20.200]  don't know how other big websites do it how does the drudge report that
[01:20.200 --> 01:24.120]  probably gets you know five times the traffic we get how does how do they do
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.440]  it how does the daily caller how does world that daily how do they do it so I
[01:29.440 --> 01:37.440]  just use text messages on my phone and I use I am to the crew and they've all
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.800]  got email so what happens is they bring me in big piles of interesting emails so
[01:41.800 --> 01:45.400]  when I say I'm getting emails I am I'm just reading everybody else's and I get
[01:45.400 --> 01:48.760]  into everybody's accounts I just you know use everybody else's email around
[01:48.760 --> 01:56.240]  here it's quite a quite a mess quite a mess and I'm really digressing into a
[01:56.240 --> 01:59.480]  big frustration point in my life I don't know how I manage the information
[01:59.480 --> 02:05.560]  quite frankly I don't and that's why I've told my crew that we're putting out so
[02:05.560 --> 02:13.480]  much info that I want to pull back and focus on quality not even quantity and
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.760]  even our stuff that isn't our best quality is better than my best quality
[02:17.760 --> 02:21.000]  ten years ago so we're we're moving in the right direction but it makes my
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.480]  head spin but I'm digressing it's one reason the show is good one reason it's
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.280]  bad I started thinking about troops sending me emails and then it turns into
[02:30.280 --> 02:33.160]  a whole discussion I was having this morning about the nightmare of email
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.800]  but hundreds of emails have come in it's a meme because we weren't even talking
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.400]  about troops in Afghanistan saying none of them by the bin Laden killing
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.560]  I told you I've talked to a Navy SEAL who has a friend who's in SEAL Team 6 they
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.720]  believe their helicopter was blown up both of them the one at the site of the
[02:53.720 --> 02:59.360]  staged Easter Bunny killing I mean bin Laden killing and it's love to say
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.320]  Easter Bunny I don't know why some will have like Tourette syndrome and stuff I
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.920]  guess I have Easter Bunny syndrome but anyways continuing here just ridiculous
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.640]  all this new world war bull is just a total mythology is my point and nothing's
[03:15.640 --> 03:20.120]  more ridiculous than the Easter Bunny but every head family gets mad at you
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.040]  because you won't lie to your kids about Easter bunnies and Santa Claus and
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.120]  tooth fairies side issue I guess you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't
[03:28.120 --> 03:33.080]  believe in Santa Claus but I'm digressing now completely off the
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.320]  reservation I've got all these emails from troops that are not buying it but
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.680]  if troops agree with the bin Laden story or if Navy SEALs want to call in and
[03:41.680 --> 03:47.520]  correct me see I'm so busy I was put in touch with former and current Navy SEALs
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.560]  that wanted to expose a bunch of info by former head of the screen actors guild
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.640]  you know pretty high-powered media person and I never even called the guys
[03:57.640 --> 04:04.480]  number that's my problem I I'm just going in too many directions it's I just
[04:04.480 --> 04:08.400]  remembered that ball I dropped and now it's gotten to the point of all I think
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.360]  about is all the balls I'm dropping and I've never really been like that it's
[04:13.360 --> 04:18.640]  just that now all the information is coming in and it's like I'm Robbie the
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.160]  robot with smoke coming out of my ears and I know that's how you are as well
[04:22.160 --> 04:29.480]  with your children and work and taxes and and illnesses and trees falling on
[04:29.480 --> 04:35.840]  your house and the dog biting the neighbor and cats and dogs living together
[04:35.840 --> 04:41.760]  biblical end-of-the-world type stuff to quote one of my favorite comedies

[08:20.240 --> 08:24.640]  we hope is going to happen I am going to right now just go over news headlines
[08:24.640 --> 08:30.920]  and complete the ritual of failure when I get two or three in and begin a rant
[08:30.920 --> 08:33.880]  and then I'm going to give the phone number out and then everyone's going to
[08:33.880 --> 08:37.280]  sit on hold and then I'm going to get into the second hour and start

[08:46.840 --> 08:50.560]  interesting transmission today we are going to have open phones for the
[08:50.560 --> 08:58.240]  military namely Afghanistan veterans when Steve Pacinac is on the broadcast
[08:58.240 --> 09:04.880]  Dr. Pacinac psychiatrist government overthrow or assassin and of course
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.760]  co-author of many Tom Clancy books and he has talked about here on the air the
[09:10.760 --> 09:18.720]  fact that bin Laden was dead back in 2002 and of course the CIA and the meeting
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.160]  with him at the American hospital in Dubai all of that came out on CBS news
[09:23.160 --> 09:29.680]  after Dr. Pacinac had talked about it then Walter Cronkite came out and said
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.120]  they had him on ice and we're gonna roll him out and so did Madeleine Albright
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.360]  former Secretary of State so very credible and there was a giant
[09:37.360 --> 09:45.040]  disinfo operation last year when we came out within an hour of Osama bin
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.120]  Obama and announcing that he was a superhero and had directed this SEAL
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.280]  team with live cam feeds of course two days later they admitted that was a total
[09:54.280 --> 09:58.840]  live and that the situation room photo was live but they did throw his body in
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.480]  the ocean along with a Loch Ness monster and you should believe them you
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.400]  really should believe a group of people that ship hang grenades and fully
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.440]  automatic machine guns by the tens of thousands to Mexico to blame the second
[10:12.440 --> 10:16.200]  amendment and still blame the second amendment even when caught I mean these
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.760]  are nice people so they they they wouldn't like to us and of course just
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.320]  asked the Navy SEALs oh the helicopter blew up on the ground witnesses said
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.360]  that they saw him get on board and blow up but the government says nobody died
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.200]  but then there was another helicopter went down with the rest of SEAL team
[10:32.200 --> 10:37.080]  six who'd been on the mission and they they died and and of course they lied
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.840]  about that mission and said that they had we're sitting about to save Rangers and
[10:42.840 --> 10:46.280]  and then it just blew up but of course there wasn't a mission to save Rangers
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.560]  because the Rangers and others said there was no mission to save Rangers oh
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.000]  you guys didn't go along with a lie well we don't know why we packed him on a
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.520]  old National Guard Chinook and flew him out there or why we broke protocol and
[11:00.520 --> 11:05.000]  packed him all in one aircraft just just never mind all that you know it's like
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.240]  Pat Tillman he died fighting Al Qaeda charging up a hill the SEALs died going
[11:09.240 --> 11:14.920]  to save the Rangers doesn't matter if at every step the stories a lie doesn't
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.600]  matter if they murdered Pat Tillman because well we know because the Army
[11:18.600 --> 11:23.600]  Colonel the coroner wouldn't lie oh will he end up like one of the guys working
[11:23.600 --> 11:28.880]  on Breitbart's case dying of poisoning but that's not suspicious again I should
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.920]  just believe known liars I shouldn't be a conspiracy theorist in question known
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.560]  liars does that mean the government and corrupt corporations are always doing
[11:38.560 --> 11:46.240]  something bad no and I wish it was just good old-fashioned incompetence and
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.640]  things and there is some of that but so many times it turns out the worst is
[11:50.640 --> 11:56.560]  actually the case I want to believe things aren't this bad I want to believe
[11:56.560 --> 12:02.320]  things aren't degenerating I live in this country I love this country I don't
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.400]  want to eat my horn but it doesn't I'm in my entire family on both sides it
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.400]  doesn't get any more Americana Mayflower 1776 Battle for Texas Independence
[12:13.400 --> 12:20.080]  raising Colonel Travis's son and on and on and on it's ridiculous how much of my
[12:20.080 --> 12:24.320]  family's been in the military and intelligence and every other system for
[12:24.320 --> 12:30.960]  this Republic going back on both sides I am a thoroughbred Americana died in the
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.520]  war American it doesn't you just you you just can't beat it and I say that
[12:36.520 --> 12:40.840]  because I'm sick of people saying I'm anti-America because I don't like the
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.440]  criminals running our government I'm sick of people wrapping themselves in the
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.640]  American flag and lecturing me all day about how my basic liberties that people
[12:50.640 --> 12:57.560]  fought and died for are a bunch of trash and I'm angry about it and I'm sick of
[12:57.560 --> 13:03.360]  it and I want my Republic back I want my due process and my private property and
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.160]  my family rights and my prosperity and my religious rights I wanted all and I
[13:09.160 --> 13:15.480]  demand it now and I will fight for it you better believe and to quote John Paul
[13:15.480 --> 13:22.320]  Jones the Scott people say Jones as Welsh he took the name Jones to quote
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.440]  that great Scott I have only begun to fight well let me tell you we got t-shirts
[13:28.440 --> 13:34.760]  coming out and popper stickers with we have just begun to fight info wars.com
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.360]  because this is it see there I didn't get to one article before I started
[13:40.360 --> 13:47.800]  ranting it's just overwhelming it's overwhelming the amount of insanity and
[13:47.800 --> 13:51.600]  I've self-analyzed I know why I get so angry and start the show because I read
[13:51.600 --> 13:54.560]  this stuff all night I read it in the morning I get in here they bring me
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.720]  piles of other news and it's just like there's no way to cover all this there's
[13:57.720 --> 14:04.800]  no way but let's let's give it a try. Rupert Murdoch's Fox broadcast
[14:04.800 --> 14:08.880]  license targeted by US ethics group which is basically a Clinton needs to
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.560]  front the Washington based ethics watchdog is calling on federal regulators
[14:13.560 --> 14:18.640]  to revoke news corporations 27 Fox broadcast licenses and they're talking
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.720]  about arresting a son and others now this is the same Justice Department caught
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.680]  shipping hand grenades and machine guns into Mexico and the memos said to blind
[14:27.680 --> 14:31.640]  the Second Amendment gee like I needed to know that two years ago when we
[14:31.640 --> 14:35.800]  first started covering this actually six years ago but then hardcore a year and
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.600]  a half ago it was all in the federal documents see and then every time I
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.480]  talk about this I see comments and people saying Alex how dare you defend
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.320]  news core you pig look if they can bring down news core they can shut down
[14:51.320 --> 14:53.720]  Rush Limbaul they've been trying to do you notice this is happening everywhere
[14:53.720 --> 14:59.560]  they're going to be able to shut down everybody who isn't basically totally
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.680]  anti-gun look news core acts like they're conservative because they understand
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.640]  that's a market I get that I know that his properties overseas you know push
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.200]  globalism all this stuff I understand it I could care less for Rupert Murdoch
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.920]  but let me tell you something the fact that they're trying to destroy him right
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.560]  now means there's no counterbalance I'm with the left right paradigm is a fraud
[15:21.560 --> 15:25.760]  but within the power structure it is a left-right debate and left-right system
[15:25.760 --> 15:30.360]  and if we get a total one-party system if they're able to shut down news core
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.320]  or basically take it over and turn it into globalist light look out and you
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.840]  notice you're seeing the internet censorship now the syspa all of it's
[15:39.840 --> 15:43.920]  happening now they're moot you suddenly see the checkpoints on the highways you
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.040]  suddenly hear about the 450 million hollow point you know soft tip 40 cows and
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.880]  and and military checkpoints and TSA searching bags on highways it's here
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.800]  and they're probing they're testing oh we're going to secretly arrest you and
[15:57.800 --> 16:01.920]  under NDAA but but we're not going to implement that well maybe we will well
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.680]  yeah we are watching you without warranty legally yeah we are launching wars
[16:05.680 --> 16:09.280]  though congressional approval yeah we did set up a rural council yeah we are
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.040]  going to ban farm kids doing chores yeah we are going to shut down your local
[16:13.040 --> 16:16.480]  power plant without law just as we're gonna make more money off of it once
[16:16.480 --> 16:21.280]  the competition shut down I mean I could go on and on I mean it is it is a
[16:21.280 --> 16:27.880]  all-out offensive right now and you see the attacks on media and the attacks on
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.960]  anything that's alternative and sure to those of us who are really awake Fox News
[16:31.960 --> 16:36.840]  is not an alternative the only thing that you could call alternative that is
[16:36.840 --> 16:41.200]  giant and old and big as the drudge report and I noticed the White House is
[16:41.200 --> 16:44.880]  angry the drudge report wouldn't take down their link that Obama was in
[16:44.880 --> 16:49.080]  Afghanistan and said no he's not and then of course he was and they're
[16:49.080 --> 16:51.760]  freaking out over something they don't control there they don't control in
[16:51.760 --> 16:55.480]  full wars.com they don't control prison planet.com and they don't fully
[16:55.480 --> 17:02.800]  control Newsport and I told you remember last year those memos came out from
[17:02.800 --> 17:07.440]  media matters George Soros funded White House gives him you know meetings every
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.680]  week saying we're gonna infiltrate and destroy alternative media and Fox was
[17:11.680 --> 17:15.840]  at the top but but but guess who else is in there guess who else they attack me
[17:15.840 --> 17:22.480]  because I'm pro-gun pro-family anti-abortion anti-globalist I mean we
[17:22.480 --> 17:25.360]  now have the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation responding to us you think
[17:25.360 --> 17:28.480]  that makes me happy well in a way it does that we're having an effect but it
[17:28.480 --> 17:35.440]  also is super creepy we're in danger folks this is a real fight and if they
[17:35.440 --> 17:41.160]  can take over news core you better believe info wars.com and the drudge
[17:41.160 --> 17:47.080]  report drudge report.com and Limbaugh and Michael Savage and everything else and
[17:47.080 --> 17:51.520]  then they're gonna shut down all the leftist things they don't control they
[17:51.520 --> 17:59.000]  don't want anything that's not under globalist control it's happening and look
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.640]  even if I disagree with somebody's free speech if they were trying to shut
[18:03.640 --> 18:10.760]  down the Huffington Post that's AOL if Republicans were in office and saying
[18:10.760 --> 18:15.240]  let's shut down the Huffington Post because of their lies or their unethical
[18:15.240 --> 18:23.240]  or whatever I would defend the Huffington Post and even AOL look last year
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.680]  Homeland Security and I'm barred from giving everything out because I'm told
[18:27.680 --> 18:31.160]  things of confidence and then but then I'm like oh and I'm not allowed to tell
[18:31.160 --> 18:35.160]  people what happened I mean I could tell what Ventura's told on air and what
[18:35.160 --> 18:41.880]  Michael Braverman big producer for TV a couple hit shows right now I can say
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.960]  what they said that Homeland Security members of Congress called and threatened
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.800]  Time Warner to ban that show and they did but the other stuff is just
[18:50.800 --> 18:57.640]  incredible incredible and I cannot tell you so let me explain something ladies
[18:57.640 --> 19:00.720]  and gentlemen when I live in the real world that's why Breitbart drops dead
[19:00.720 --> 19:03.840]  the day he's supposed to release all his powerful stuff and I said watch in two
[19:03.840 --> 19:09.600]  or three weeks if they've been compromised or something's happened if
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.640]  people been threatened over there they're gonna release some milk toast thing
[19:12.640 --> 19:17.840]  and they did and it did not match what what what he'd said and how this would
[19:17.840 --> 19:23.000]  destroy Obama now maybe he died of a heart attack I'm sad he's dead but I
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.240]  hope he actually got of a heart attack you know what my gut tells me he didn't
[19:26.240 --> 19:33.720]  and now that one of the coroners is dead poisoned so again how do you have a
[19:33.720 --> 19:43.160]  Justice Department that shipping hand grenades and guns into Mexico to demonize
[19:43.160 --> 19:47.720]  our rights how do you have them going after news corps and the answer is they
[19:47.720 --> 19:51.520]  can't that's like I'm for the death penalty but you but you can't have it
[19:51.520 --> 19:55.520]  because these states and the feds have been caught framing people see what I'm
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.560]  saying we'll be right back stay with us
[19:59.560 --> 20:05.000]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was

[20:13.480 --> 20:18.360]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[24:25.480 --> 24:30.080]  curtain I'm gonna do an article about the insane hypocrisy of a criminal
[24:30.080 --> 24:38.400]  executive judicial legislative tyranny who exempts itself extra
[24:38.400 --> 24:43.800]  judicially from law saying they're gonna try to shut down news core and
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.800]  talking about arresting Rupert Murdoch and his son or all these people and I
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.720]  told you that's where all this is headed and if people cower and give into
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.440]  this and people say all good you know I'd love to see news core shut down I'd
[24:59.440 --> 25:06.680]  love to see people like Rush Limbaugh off the air ladies and gentlemen when you
[25:06.680 --> 25:12.840]  get governmental collusion with attack dog groups trying to shut people down
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.440]  do you understand if they can shut down any media they can shut us all down we
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.600]  hang together or hang separate you know back when I defended Rush Limbaugh
[25:21.600 --> 25:27.120]  making the point that this woman wants people to pay for thousands of dollars
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.800]  of condoms a year why doesn't she pay for that herself and then they made this
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.640]  big deal out of it I mean it's a ridiculous spectacle a woman in
[25:36.640 --> 25:40.440]  Congress asking somebody to buy thousands of dollars of condoms for him I
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.400]  don't want to pay for that and I shouldn't have to I'm sick of paying for
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.600]  everything and they make this huge history fit out of it and then I did a
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.160]  show about it we posted the video of the radio show and a lot of the commenters
[25:53.160 --> 25:58.840]  on info wars calm we're like oh I hate Limbaugh I hope he dies I you know I hope
[25:58.840 --> 26:03.480]  he goes and takes some oxy cotton I hope he loses his show don't you
[26:03.480 --> 26:09.760]  understand that they are bringing in so pa they're bringing in that that system
[26:09.760 --> 26:14.480]  through the new bill syspa that they're openly saying they want to censor
[26:14.480 --> 26:19.600]  everybody and then if they get away with this none of us are safe I don't
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.560]  like a lot of the things Rush Limbaugh does I don't like him running defense
[26:23.560 --> 26:29.280]  for the Republican establishment I don't even really listen to Rush Limbaugh but
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.360]  I recognize that the system wants to set the precedent to shut down what they
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.760]  see as libertarian conservative constitutional opposition and that's
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.400]  how the establishment sees me I see myself as just somebody who wants
[26:43.400 --> 26:47.640]  freedom and I judge an issue by an issue by issue base and try to get away
[26:47.640 --> 26:50.480]  from labels but I've still got to communicate with people through the
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.960]  labels they know so it's kind of a catch 22 you've got to use the labels people
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.920]  know and then define them in a way that you think more explains in a deeper
[27:00.920 --> 27:06.880]  definition or depth what's happening but it's so common sense for me it's so
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.960]  common sense that if the government was trying to shut down MSNBC of course it
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.960]  wouldn't shut itself down that's a pure government operation that I would be
[27:16.960 --> 27:21.440]  wow this is a dangerous precedent even because something like that might be
[27:21.440 --> 27:25.800]  staged where they go along with being shut down just to set the precedent you
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.200]  see when I'm saying this is dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.800]  stuff we're talking about here and so you've got the old dinosaur media who's
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.480]  always still had the instinct to defend free speech because journalists are
[27:39.480 --> 27:43.400]  taught that's what's important because it is finally getting the idea that oh
[27:43.400 --> 27:47.000]  if they're gonna survive they won't come out and tell the truth on real issues
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.560]  that the people want to hear and give people real investigative reporting
[27:50.560 --> 27:53.720]  no they'll just merge with the big corporations in the government who are
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.880]  threatened by real media and call for a new dark age an electronic Berlin wall
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.560]  of regulation and fairness doctrine crud and and copyright persecution without
[28:05.560 --> 28:12.560]  due process to shut down the internet as we know it so make no mistake the the
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.960]  gelding bare minimum this is that this is the harassment the cornering the the
[28:17.960 --> 28:24.040]  political warfare of the Soros slash feud with Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes
[28:24.040 --> 28:30.720]  this is a battle going on right now and they're gonna use this to decide the
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.320]  future of the rest of the media so you better circle the wagons around free
[28:36.320 --> 28:42.240]  speech I mean I don't like the stuff the Ku Klux Klan says as long as they're not
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.680]  calling for killing somebody they got a right to say it I don't like what the
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.520]  new Black Panther Party says about whites being the devil and all being racist
[28:50.520 --> 28:55.280]  and it's when they start saying kill people go out and kill whitey that's
[28:55.280 --> 28:57.840]  when they should be arrested of course they weren't because it turns out the
[28:57.840 --> 29:01.200]  Justice Department was infiltrated and actually leading the protest and trying
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.640]  to get violence going no kidding no you the same folks that ship guns into
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.200]  Mexico to try to create total anarchy down there to then blame the Second
[29:10.200 --> 29:14.480]  Amendment which they still did again you got to wrap your mind around the fact
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.440]  we've got a real criminal government at the top and we better as a country people
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.120]  across the board government out of government media you name it say hey
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.880]  you know what this is out of control back off stop it right there the
[29:29.880 --> 29:36.080]  preservation of this Republic common sense is on the line right now and
[29:36.080 --> 29:43.360]  people better stand up for liberty and better be thinking about just how much
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.200]  danger we're in okay I'm gonna cover a bunch of news go your phone calls when

[35:15.000 --> 35:21.080]  denial of Cass Sunstein just admit what you have written he's now denying or
[35:21.080 --> 35:24.320]  saying he doesn't remember writing all these public papers calling for

[35:29.360 --> 35:37.480]  to criticize the government and to say the government's lying amazing so we're
[35:37.480 --> 35:40.600]  gonna be breaking that down also Hugo Chavez and officials caught in huge
[35:40.600 --> 35:47.040]  drug money laundering scandal our own Max Cabrera is from one of our great IT
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.200]  guys is from Venezuela and he tells the horror stories of living under Chavez
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.880]  and so he wanted to do this report and I see these idiots and they're going you
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.840]  must work for the system because you don't like Chavez just because our
[36:02.840 --> 36:06.440]  systems corrupt doesn't then mean something else is good see it's this
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.960]  idea of Iran's good and we're bad or we're good and Iran's bad no there's bad
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.200]  corrupt people in charge everywhere that's history that's the problem that's
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.840]  why Liberty is that rare jewel that Thomas Jefferson talked about speaking
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.280]  of the cash issue let me just cover this cover this now Tennessee man arrested
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.680]  in prison for using cash it was an older $50 bill they arrested him and kept
[36:31.680 --> 36:37.960]  him in jail and then finally the evidence area said I think this is real
[36:37.960 --> 36:44.440]  money and they told they released him but said you better go cash this in at
[36:44.440 --> 36:49.160]  the bank for something new so it's it's it's he's bad and I see articles
[36:49.160 --> 36:55.240]  routinely where people just showed well I had a friend Chris Athanas and talked
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.680]  to him in years I think he still lives in Austin software engineer well to do
[36:59.680 --> 37:06.280]  middle-class guy a patriot knew him down at Access TV and he went to prison for
[37:06.280 --> 37:12.600]  years he was down on the edge of UT and he was talking about silver this is like
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.080]  six seven years ago and he showed it to some people and they called the police
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.400]  on him thinking it was illegal to have a silver coin and then it turned out he
[37:22.400 --> 37:26.080]  wasn't even on the UT campus but they came off the campus saying well there's
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.320]  a buffer and he had his concealed carry and so they came they got him for the
[37:32.320 --> 37:36.600]  silver tried to charge him for that and ended up trumping up stuff for being
[37:36.600 --> 37:43.120]  near a college campus with a firearm no criminal records software engineer part
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.640]  of the community developing all sorts of you know software that's well known out
[37:46.640 --> 37:51.800]  there and that's that's the American dream now but I see these cases where
[37:51.800 --> 37:59.240]  what one case I remember was a few years ago a guy goes into Best Buy and he had
[37:59.240 --> 38:05.120]  things like film or a memory stick or something you pull up the article guys
[38:05.120 --> 38:09.080]  tight man arrested for using $2 bill at Best Buy and then we can pull up the
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.480]  original info it's like five six years ago so I forget the details but all I
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.840]  remember about it was is is that he had done something with Cub Scouts where he
[38:16.840 --> 38:19.560]  was teaching about the Declaration of Independence because that's on the back
[38:19.560 --> 38:26.160]  of $2 bill beautiful engraving I know because I went to the US Mint once when
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.760]  I was a kid in DC and I bought a whole sheet in fact it's somewhere around here
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.360]  I need to get it framed and it came in a red tube of $2 bills that they were
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.800]  selling as one sheet uncut and I guess I can get arrested for that I bought up
[38:42.800 --> 38:51.680]  the US Mint but see I digress any stories and he had been teaching the Cub
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.720]  Scouts about it and he was showing it to him at Memory Serves and then he had
[38:58.720 --> 39:02.080]  some left he'd been handing him out teaching about Declaration of Independence
[39:02.080 --> 39:05.400]  so he went into buy something at Best Buy and they said this is illegal this
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.120]  isn't real and then the managers and all of them were so stupid I would have
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.560]  just walked out with a security guard walked him that they thought it was
[39:14.560 --> 39:18.760]  illegal and the cops were so ignorant that's what's so dangerous about the
[39:18.760 --> 39:23.960]  public's not even so much evil they're just dumb ignorant morons not just the
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.440]  police the general public are just dangerously stupid and he went to jail
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.800]  he went to jail in fact you guys found the article he put it up man arrested
[39:34.800 --> 39:39.760]  cuffed after using two dollar bills Best Buy customer on being jailed at this
[39:39.760 --> 39:45.000]  point I'm a mass murderer and let me see if I was right about the Cub Scouts
[39:45.000 --> 39:52.080]  let's see how good my memory is that is from what year is that from 2005 so see
[39:52.080 --> 39:58.000]  I said six years ago actually like seven see if I'm right about the Cub Scout
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.560]  thing I know it was some youth deal about the Declaration of Independence but
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.400]  but the point is that this is what America is where they're just constantly
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.320]  looking for something I see articles where a parents get arrested because
[40:10.320 --> 40:14.880]  their child gets a sunburn I mean then everybody's parents would have been
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.520]  arrested when I was growing up it's just any excuse to throw the book at the
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.080]  public but then meanwhile the Justice Department can ship guns into Mexico
[40:25.080 --> 40:29.920]  okay so there's that article info works calm Tennessee man arrested and in
[40:29.920 --> 40:35.080]  prison for using cash read the whole story it is crazy there's other story
[40:35.080 --> 40:40.400]  victims of communism day and communists have killed almost 200 million people in
[40:40.400 --> 40:47.400]  the last hundred years this is not that's non-military deaths but this is a
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.920]  very dangerous group you know when I see a swastika I feel threatened by it and
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.200]  know it's a symbol a lot of death under its belt but nothing like nothing like
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.800]  communist and it's it's they got all these restaurants in town with
[40:59.800 --> 41:02.720]  communist signs out front all the trendies go there and they've got mal
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.360]  restaurants everywhere and you see all these yuppies that are into communism
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.920]  are you in to get and put in a collectivist barn and working like a
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.880]  slave and having people in black uniforms rape your wife if they feel like it
[41:14.880 --> 41:20.840]  I mean you people are just begging to be enslaved so we've got that let me just
[41:20.840 --> 41:23.960]  run through some more and I'm going to your calls
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.840]  I'll get into the whole bin Laden thing next hour in the third hour I'm gonna
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.160]  play the amazing video Luke Radowski got Obama informations are confronted
[41:33.160 --> 41:38.840]  over banned conspiracy theories paper and he sits there and plays stupid and
[41:38.840 --> 41:41.320]  says I don't remember writing that even though it's been a huge national
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.920]  controversy they've talked about he may not be able to be Supreme Court justice
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.640]  you know Obama says he's gonna probably nominate him at the next vacancy and he
[41:49.640 --> 41:56.040]  just says I don't remember that so incredible footage and audio of that
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.080]  coming up there's this story I saw yesterday and didn't cover and I meant
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.320]  to get one of my writers to write on it more but world that daily of course
[42:04.320 --> 42:11.560]  picked it up it's the pilot newspaper out of Norfolk, Virginia and and they
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.560]  don't even say to the second page that it was black on white crime a beating at
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.240]  church and brambleton and the story is for two weeks the paper refused to
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.600]  report on whites in their cars being attacked by hundreds of young black
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.160]  people and this is happening all over the country it's epidemic and the police
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.080]  when they complained and went for help were told shut up and get back in your
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.600]  car we're not gonna help you what do you want us to do and the paper agonized
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.680]  over even reporting on this happening now again my issue is this is very
[42:45.680 --> 42:51.000]  dangerous the globalist want to foster this so it boils up and gets really big
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.000]  the Justice Department tried to cause race wars as you know NBC edited the tape
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.160]  of Trayvon Martin regardless of whatever you think if he was right or wrong
[43:00.160 --> 43:05.560]  towards everman the point is the Justice Department had faux menors in there the
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.480]  media tried to push this to get us fighting with each other and now the
[43:10.480 --> 43:13.520]  media feels like they can report on it because the youths are bragging on
[43:13.520 --> 43:18.480]  Facebook about it and some are saying you know it's not very nice to beat up
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.120]  white people you know some black folks they're saying oh yeah well they deserve
[43:22.120 --> 43:27.320]  it because of Trayvon and so what's gonna happen is the average yuppie that's
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.320]  self-loathing and everything is now going to start not being racist but
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.840]  fearing all black people and this will not be good for black folks socioeconomically
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.440]  it won't be good for anybody but that's what the globalists want they want to
[43:40.440 --> 43:43.880]  keep you on their poverty pimp reservations and they want through the
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.360]  culture the hip-hop all of it to sell that it's cool to talk about about
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.880]  white people and young punk white kids may make it intimidated by that and go
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.360]  grovel at the feet of it but most people go well I mean I I don't hate
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.960]  somebody because of the color of their skin but wow I better look out and this
[44:01.960 --> 44:08.520]  is socio-economic divide and conquer going on and it goes on many blacks beat
[44:08.520 --> 44:13.240]  white couple media berry attack the outrage in northern Virginia today after
[44:13.240 --> 44:16.680]  a white couple was attacked by dozens of black teenagers in the local newspaper
[44:16.680 --> 44:19.920]  did not report on the incident for two weeks despite the victims being
[44:19.920 --> 44:26.320]  reporters for the paper oh yeah I forgot that these are reporters at the paper and
[44:26.320 --> 44:30.440]  the only reason it is being reported now is because they are reporters down the
[44:30.440 --> 44:34.960]  road and the people that did it bragged about it but it's happening all the time
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.680]  now reportedly there in that town alone and all over the country at fairs and
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.520]  other events and it's like oh there's some white people they deserve to be
[44:43.520 --> 44:49.560]  beat up and robbed you know what it's a good thing that it wasn't somebody like
[44:49.560 --> 44:54.160]  me because and of course it always happens a little enclaves of yuppie them
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.520]  I guess that's what I mean ladies and gentlemen it if you attack say one or
[44:58.520 --> 45:03.120]  two cars it's about 50 50 chance that it's people are packing and they go to
[45:03.120 --> 45:07.120]  the shooting range every week and they're gonna and then it'll again it'll be
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.480]  another race war because if you're being attacked and beat up and you shoot
[45:10.480 --> 45:17.000]  somebody oh my gosh another devil whitey did this and then whites get
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.440]  paranoid and then some innocent people are gonna get killed I mean I'm not
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.800]  looking forward to a race for the feds are really trying to start one so they
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.360]  can come in and attack the second amendment just like they ship guns into
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.760]  Mexico to create total bad women thousands of dead down there and hundreds
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.720]  of dead here including six law enforcement officers conservatively three
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.960]  police three border patrol you better believe there's not big parades for
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.440]  them it's kept down low when cops get killed by the fed guns so it just goes
[45:46.440 --> 45:50.640]  over all of it yeah I forgot that little part about how how they were
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.560]  reporters for the paper okay we've got our own article on that in full wars
[45:54.560 --> 46:01.080]  calm as well again this is in the hill ethics watchdog as FCC to revoke Fox
[46:01.080 --> 46:07.440]  broadcasting license okay how can the government revoke somebody's license I
[46:07.440 --> 46:11.240]  don't like that can we revoke somebody's license for shipping guns into
[46:11.240 --> 46:14.720]  Mexico we're given salandra a half a billion dollars they never built
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.120]  anything or can I can we get a watchdog on Obama shutting down power plants
[46:19.120 --> 46:24.600]  not owned by GE to increase their profits can I get a watchdog on all the
[46:24.600 --> 46:29.560]  terrorist Obama was financed by Chicago and the Chicago mafia oh I'm sorry the
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.880]  Justice Department's part of that
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.000]  DHS again to release bacteria in Boston subway they say it's safe but we look
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.200]  we've looked into it it's been known to cause spontaneous abortions in mammal
[46:43.200 --> 46:46.360]  species I know that from the last time we caught him doing it over Oklahoma
[46:46.360 --> 46:49.480]  Paul doesn't have that in his article something else fell through the cracks I
[46:49.480 --> 46:54.120]  need to tell him about we got a bunch of other news it's all coming up in the
[46:54.120 --> 46:57.520]  second and third hour let's go to your calls we get to some of those Brad Aaron
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.160]  Stephen Tom Roy and others Brad in Idaho you're on the air welcome a long
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.920]  time listener and disseminator of your work and I really appreciate you me my
[47:06.920 --> 47:14.680]  kids pray for you every day and your crew my question to you is concerning
[47:14.680 --> 47:20.400]  something to make the pure of heart met question it seems to be like what would
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.000]  Abraham Lincoln have done should he just have left the South to see from the
[47:25.000 --> 47:31.360]  Union and the question also would be like Hugo Chavez should he seems like a
[47:31.360 --> 47:38.680]  hard war to deal with that these guys are in well I mean Hugo Chavez is power
[47:38.680 --> 47:44.040]  grabbing giving people's businesses to his buddies I mean it's on record I mean
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.720]  like five six years ago he was saying no to the you know Pan-American Union I'll
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.360]  go that's good but he's definitely gotten worse and worse that's what happens
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.160]  when somebody stays in and basically gerrymanders things and manipulates
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.400]  things to stay in power as for the Civil War that is an incredibly complex
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.040]  question the the British were manipulating the south and but using
[48:05.040 --> 48:09.720]  real grievances of the north that had written the tariffs to hurt the agrarian
[48:09.720 --> 48:15.120]  south not the industrial north but then the British put troops in Canada they
[48:15.120 --> 48:19.960]  tried to menace both sides so that's a very complex issue all I know is Abraham
[48:19.960 --> 48:23.840]  Lincoln said over and over again that it wasn't about slavery he did that near
[48:23.840 --> 48:29.960]  the end of the war it was all about tariffs and Western expansion and the
[48:29.960 --> 48:35.320]  British did want to break up the Union so it's a it's a complex issue from
[48:35.320 --> 48:41.960]  many different sides his cardinal sin was issuing US money not banker debt
[48:41.960 --> 48:49.240]  back money but actual government fiat money to finance things so I appreciate
[48:49.240 --> 48:52.680]  your call thank you for your prayers my friend Steve in Florida you're on the
[48:52.680 --> 49:00.280]  air hey I want to say first of all you were mentioning earlier about how you're
[49:00.280 --> 49:06.000]  always you know referring to the globalist and their agenda by referring
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.200]  to the Easter Bunny you might want to change that to the what I call we call
[49:11.200 --> 49:16.280]  the truth fairy because that's what they're putting forth a fairy tale that
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.720]  they're calling the truth but it really isn't no I hear my point is I was just
[49:22.720 --> 49:26.800]  saying you know oh they killed bin Laden Thrim in the ocean might as well be the
[49:26.800 --> 49:30.080]  Loch Ness monster the Easter Bunny I mean it's that stupid and then we're

[54:23.680 --> 54:27.080]  the break I was talking to John Bowne in there and he said it is crazy that we
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.280]  we lie to our kids we're taught tell them Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy the
[54:32.280 --> 54:39.120]  Easter Bunny all of this is real and then people sit there and lie to their
[54:39.120 --> 54:44.760]  children people get mad if you tell your children Santa Claus isn't real and
[54:44.760 --> 54:48.800]  then they tell other children I've had parents say come on don't don't tell your
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.080]  kids that they're telling you know friends that if that Santa Claus isn't
[54:54.080 --> 54:59.440]  real and I'm just like I'm not lying to my children and telling them that Santa
[54:59.440 --> 55:03.480]  Claus is real I mean I'm not doing it when they were really little and I just
[55:03.480 --> 55:06.520]  can't believe and I'm a conspiracy theorist because I don't believe in
[55:06.520 --> 55:13.240]  Santa Claus and that's really what this comes down to I don't believe in the
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.680]  bin Laden thing in fact I know it's a fraud in the hoax and I told you what
[55:17.680 --> 55:27.640]  happened years before and it's it's simple with known certified liars have
[55:27.640 --> 55:35.040]  to be removed this entire government at the top is just rotten as a dead dog in
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.240]  the ditch a dead dog's been dead for a week and a half I mean this thing is
[55:39.240 --> 55:44.720]  crawling with maggots and it stinks and it looks like every other tyranny we've
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.120]  ever seen with an icing of high-tech which makes it even more dangerous and
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.000]  there's a bunch of people out there saying oh I don't want to hear that
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.520]  Alex Jones well listen folks if you think the main line Republicans and the
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.480]  main line Democrats are gonna give you anything else than what you've always
[56:03.480 --> 56:06.760]  seen and if you don't think it's and don't worry it's not gonna be business
[56:06.760 --> 56:13.120]  as usual it's gonna get a whole lot worse a whole lot quicker going back to
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.640]  Stephen Florida so you're talking to this lady and she we had ended with I'm
[56:18.640 --> 56:23.560]  not gonna listen to Alex Jones go ahead yeah and of course you know I got
[56:23.560 --> 56:29.200]  into about you know the election and line on and see this was just this is a
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.760]  classic case of someone who's been subjected to the new world order
[56:33.760 --> 56:37.520]  psychological programming and manipulation doesn't even realize that
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.200]  through their media outpost you know I talked about Ryan Paul oh he's a nutcase
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.560]  no you're gonna be wasting your vote he can't get elected all the typical stuff
[56:47.560 --> 56:51.960]  that's been put out no they repeat what they've been programmed with and it's
[56:51.960 --> 56:55.040]  like a baby with a blanket they think they're smart because they repeat
[56:55.040 --> 56:58.880]  talking points and of course now it's admitted he won those first states but
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.280]  they just said he didn't to create the idea he couldn't win I mean they let
[57:03.280 --> 57:10.120]  the government media force feed them and so when I brought up about 9-11 you
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.360]  know I said okay so I brought up the TSA and how they're rolling them out and
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.860]  putting them at checkpoints and then you know all these other places and I said
[57:17.860 --> 57:21.160]  to her okay why don't live in that fantasy world and believe what you're
[57:21.160 --> 57:25.160]  being told that's a bunch of lies when it comes to your door don't say you
[57:25.160 --> 57:28.920]  weren't one that's not gonna come to my door I said boy you're in for a rude
[57:28.920 --> 57:32.520]  awakening it's already coming with the shots in the fluoride in the GMO that's
[57:32.520 --> 57:35.520]  how they like to kill these people is real quiet so they don't know who did it
[57:35.520 --> 57:42.160]  but look here's the headline out of the USA today Obama in Afghanistan Al Qaeda
[57:42.160 --> 57:47.120]  defeated hand see it's the new talking point the war on terrorists over but the
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.000]  TSA is on the streets and gonna grope you you're now the terrorists I told you
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.560]  the branding's here so ask them Al Qaeda is put in Libby and all these other
[57:55.560 --> 57:58.680]  countries the government now says they're good guys what's all this
[57:58.680 --> 58:04.440]  homeland security for well you see but somebody like her whole response that's
[58:04.440 --> 58:07.600]  just Obama in the liberal that's got nothing to do with the previous
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.120]  administration exactly and as soon and there's been total continuity of agenda
[58:12.120 --> 58:17.800]  total continuity of agenda Bush came out for the power plant shutdowns under
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.200]  carbon taxes Bush was for the assault weapons ban of course he was why is
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.920]  Mitt Romney identical to Obama in his actions as governor because the same
[58:27.920 --> 58:32.280]  people that bought and paid for Obama have bought and paid for Mitt Romney
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.360]  it's just that he'll be a lighter form of it and we'll actually get more through

[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.280]  the first-time caller and you know I found you on the internet and what I
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:03.320]  wanted to call and tell you is my son is a force recon sniper and he was just
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.520]  got out of his deployment in Afghanistan and now he said they're having him
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.640]  fill out all the deployment paperwork again and I asked him I said why why
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.440]  are they doing that are you going back he said no they're going to deploy us
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:21.320]  into Syria on the turkey border well the media says that you know a turkey won't
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.680]  allow us to go on the border whatever but he said his company is the first no
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.080]  that's already going on they're on the Jordanian side to you it's admitted that
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.920]  US troops are surrounding and funding the peaceful al-qaeda and again I'm not
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:41.200]  saying Assad's good but I gotta have TSA stick their hands down my pants because
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:48.560]  of al-qaeda but al-qaeda works with NATO I mean come on yeah and another thing I
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.240]  was wondering you probably already know about this but the freedom group that's
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.240]  been buying up these gun manufacturers like Bushmaster Marlin Remington DPS
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:03.720]  they're owned by service I can't pronounce it capital management who is
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.560]  run by George Soros they bought up like six gun manufacturers so far yeah that
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.760]  was even in the New York Times a few months ago very very scary and that's
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.560]  why you see so much anti-gun stuff from the big manufacturers not defending
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.120]  themselves that's why it's important to buy from the smaller and mediums that
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.000]  are being harassed by the globalist to make sure that we because you gotta vote
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.680]  with your dollars and the system's coming after the Second Amendment what did
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.160]  Obama promise Sarah Brady last year it's on record the Washington Times he
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.560]  said don't worry I'm gonna get their guns under the radar I mean these are
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.720]  terrorists must say that again criminal terrorist I'll tell you he has courage
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.680]  you gotta agree with him I've said it before he said it and I know he's a
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.000]  listener we've had him on but Ted Nugent when he says these are criminals
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.080]  these are anti-American criminals they have been caught doing this anything
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.120]  else certain yeah one quick thing I have a new name for you for the media the
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.600]  mainstream dis info propaganda machine my 14 year old son kind of had a funny
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.760]  story this morning he came up with a little there was a woman standing at
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.520]  the door during Halloween and there was a pirate a ghost and a little kid
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.560]  standing in a suit and she said oh I can see you're a pirate and I can see you're
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.520]  a ghost but what are you the little kid in the suit looks up and says I'm the
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.720]  government I'm the biggest monster of all well said it is the greatest monster
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.960]  God bless you sir say hi to your son for me good joke Tom and Georgia you're on
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.880]  the year hey Alex I'm calling from FEMA region for two quick points that I'd
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.960]  like you to look into piggybacking on one of the stories you did a couple weeks
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:52.880]  ago I have a cousin who's married to a soldier stationed out at Stewart home
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.200]  brigade homeland who told her that the guys that blew up that fellow's house
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.960]  in Roswell they were wearing Fulton County Marshals uniforms which is why
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.320]  you're Roswell police all those guys were off duty that day but that they
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.240]  were actually soldiers from Stewart that did it you look into that number two
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.720]  the former Viper squad that had been hanging out on interstate 40 as you go
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.320]  into Memphis in the little cutoff there where it goes down from 70 to 55 have
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:31.880]  moved eastward and now on all of their vehicles it says district 23 police so I
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:37.000]  stopped and asked a guy at the rest area hey where's the 23rd district in
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.680]  Tennessee and he said man I don't know what that is there's no such thing those
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.680]  are TSA guys on the interstate in Tennessee on interstate no no no stay
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:52.280]  there exactly it's like in romancing the stone where Colonel's Zulu or whatever

[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.760]  all right we're going to Steve Pachennick Dr. Pachennick here in just a
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.480]  moment with breaking analysis how it ties into Obama's visit to Afghanistan and
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.000]  a lot more we're gonna be taking military phone calls I'm gonna give that
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.480]  number out but let me just stop right there we just got a caller Tom in
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:37.480]  Georgia and I want him to recap what he said a few weeks ago a mr. words was
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:44.680]  killed in a town outside of Atlanta a pretty big town Roswell we sent our
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:52.400]  film crew there the house was was was was basically blown up and burn out they
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.280]  wanted the land for for an environmental biosphere they'd already
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.920]  taken a bunch of other land he'd been legally having a few dozen chickens for
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.880]  a long time on this acreage they kept citing him he kept winning then
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.400]  somebody poisoned his chickens then the house blew up our guys get there because
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.040]  there's been some discussion of foul play and they won't say whether it was the
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.040]  police or the sheriff's department but witnesses say it was younger men in
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.840]  sheriff's department outfits they call them marshals there in that county but
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.440]  the sheriff says on record I have the local papers that he had no deputies
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.440]  involved now this caller says he has a military source I want him to repeat
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.640]  this because it rings true with my information we had the police basically
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.760]  threatened to arrest our crew they said they couldn't tape the courthouse the
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:48.120]  city building the city hall couldn't go in it this is on video can't tape it
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.440]  threatening them like it's it's North Korea or something Darren McBree and
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:58.000]  Marcos Morales acting very suspicious saying we were all off duty that day the
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.320]  entire police department says they're off duty this is a big town I mean their
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.400]  the city hall looks like a capital in many states so all of this is going on
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.440]  the big marble steps whole nine yards and then everybody says it's the sheriff's
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.280]  department but they say no they weren't there now the caller said he talked to
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.480]  brigade homeland and that that's where it's based there at that fort he's
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.400]  going to repeat it that are going to operate domestically you see a mass
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.080]  shooting marines are out armed marines at DWI checkpoints army in the army
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.520]  time saying yeah we're going to pull triggers on Americans that's a quote
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.400]  we're going to expand out from 4,000 this is in 2008 in the next five years
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.560]  here we are you pull up these quotes and we're going to Dr. Pachina but this is
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:46.200]  breaking we're going to expand out to 379,000 troops in America to deal with
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.840]  civil unrest now Obama has NDAA now he tells Congress they'll launch wars
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:55.000]  without approval we're not in Kansas anymore they're getting this country
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.400]  ready I don't think they're going to get away with it because the military is
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:03.840]  waking up the police not so much the military is now that said he calls in
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:09.320]  and says yeah the person I know at the base says look into this Alex it was
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.920]  really troops from there folks I've got in road to tyranny army and marines one
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.240]  Marine Corps captain later became a software engineer and you know lives in
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.960]  a mansion point is he ran to an army checkpoint and got mad and spoke to me
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.080]  in 2000 showed me photos all of it he was a marine in 88 they would in Norfolk
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.080]  Virginia they would raid gun dealers homes with marines in police outfits
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:39.440]  this is a long-term program now confirmed totally illegal and my gut told
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.080]  me send reporters there and I from this information we need to check into it we
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.280]  need four years all of it I'm putting tension on this it could folks there's a
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.120]  very good chance that again they're trying to test and see can they get when
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.720]  people are dug in in their houses have the military kill them just like to use
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.800]  Delta Force at Waco and blow up the church records vault in there with a
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.000]  shape-charge general parton former head of Air Force weapons development broke
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.480]  that down I'm gonna go Dr. Pachennick I apologize from having to hold but this
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.040]  is breaking news so hold a little bit in the next hour to catch up on time to
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.640]  take military calls as well but sure repeat everything you just said on air
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.800]  because some stations don't carry that first five minutes who this person is
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.080]  the fort where brigade homeland is based everything you said like tumblers
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.720]  just clicked as as that I believe you but we've we've got a ferret this now
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.560]  this is this is chilling the police act like they are scared to death there in
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:39.080]  that town so does the sheriff go ahead absolutely Alex I have a relative who's
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:45.080]  married to a soldier stationed at Stuart in the brigade homeland now this is
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.440]  why I would say I wanted you to check into it there's a lot of soldiers there
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:54.280]  that want to have an outlet to talk about this they're training and another
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.200]  story that you're telling about the DNR up in Michigan coincides with what's
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.880]  going on they're taking these guys from from Fort Stuart all over the country
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.040]  because you think about it people in DNR in Michigan they're the neighbors of
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.600]  these guys these pig farms they're rating what they're training the guys it's
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.400]  no no no no no no I know what they're exactly it is the governor's council and
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.480]  the rural council that is the Pentagon it's it's military occupation with local
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.760]  cadres of goons this is hellish this is red dawn in slow motion it's happening I
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.680]  can't believe it but what they're training the guys at Stuart to do in
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.520]  their day-to-day training is where police uniforms of these different parts of
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.040]  the country like Fulton County Marshals they're training in these local
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.160]  uniforms and the soldiers are like why are we doing this you know do you have a
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:48.560]  lot of dissent within the ranks out there at Stuart if you can get guys out
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.360]  there to interview them you'll have and I'm not just I'm already aware of it I
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.320]  was already when you mentioned this this district you know 23 group and all
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.400]  that Tennessee's the major testing ground but now it's expanding they have
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:08.680]  TSA in fake local made-up outfits now I mean this is this is directly out of the
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.960]  worst Communist dictatorships I mean this is so hellish this is where they're
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.240]  the secret police aren't just wearing masks they're putting on different
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.280]  uniforms I mean this is this is so evil so listen yes we'll have a show tomorrow
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.200]  an hour or so where we have Fort Stuart troops call in and why frankly that's a
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.320]  lead we already had and the police were looking like they'd killed people when
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.720]  we bring this up I mean and the sheriff says he wasn't there and his people
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.880]  weren't this is so evil and they probably killed that guy anything else I
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.640]  mean are they saying the military killed him or are they just saying they were
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.320]  there all the like I said this is from the why I'm related to the wife of this
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.960]  soldier they were deployed he wasn't in the group that was deployed but they
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.160]  deployed to that incident they're deploying all over the country in local
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.840]  law enforcement uniforms are training in the uniforms at Stuart that they're
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:06.120]  gonna no no no let me stop you I the FBI by accident pulled up to us in 98 on the
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.440]  day it was Thanksgiving north of Austin and said okay stop filming the
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.800]  military at this checkpoint but here's the press release it was not a press
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.680]  release it said do not destroy maybe the guy was a friend but it was an FBI guy
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.760]  gave my cancer my camera guy the document that said do not give to the
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.880]  public this is restricted we're here to respond 24 hours a day to warrant service
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.720]  whatever you need helicopters anything yeah no it's it's very old program
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.120]  they're just now getting ready to roll it out God bless you thank you so much
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.400]  sir dr. Pachennick I want to compartmentalize this now I want to come
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.120]  back from break and get into bin Laden fable I don't want to mix things here
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.000]  and I want to tell folks who dr. Pachennick is but I want to get a few
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.120]  minutes from you okay okay so we lost his phone okay he's on a cell phone it
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.040]  was dropping but we're gonna go back to dr. Pachennick because I want to break
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.800]  this down with him but but I had to go to that because this is breaking and this
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.840]  is a big story hope you didn't get mad at me on hold for five six minutes while I
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:07.000]  did that but it had to happen we have to cover this information I mean let me tell
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.280]  you you know when people are acting suspicious and they use military to kill
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.960]  the Davidians it's like well they're a cult they deserve it see that's how they
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.720]  do this and now it's everywhere and they're planning to use the military in
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:26.520]  local police uniforms to take out people and this is so evil it's so illegal it's
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.960]  so off the charts now let me do this now I'm gonna clear the phones out for
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.720]  military to call in about the bin Laden fable but you'll have to hold a little
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:44.720]  bit while Pachennick breaks it down and then we'll do that but the the toll free
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:54.280]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 but I want to shift gears as
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.240]  we go to break here and I want to play this video of Luke Radowski Obama
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:05.440]  informations are confronted over banned conspiracy theories paper this is a big
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:12.120]  big deal claims to have no memory of saying free speech should be taxed but
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.280]  then we have the links in our article and in the video to where he wrote papers
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:22.320]  for the University of Chicago and also Harvard just in 2008 before he got in as
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.000]  the regulations are saying this do we have that tape okay let's go ahead and
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.320]  roll that right now here it is my name is Bill from Brooklyn College and I know
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.200]  you wrote many articles but I think the most telling one about you is the 2008
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.400]  one called conspiracy theories where you openly advocated government agents
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.360]  infiltrate activist groups of non-loving truth and also stifled a set online I
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.120]  was wondering why do you think it's the government's job or why do you think the
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.160]  government should go after family members who have questions about not 11
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:58.520]  responders who are lied to about the air survived survivors whose testimony
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.280]  commits and also government whistleblowers that were gagged because
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.840]  they released information that contradicts the official story why do you
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.920]  think the government should do that I think as Ricky said hundreds of articles that I
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.920]  remember some and not others not what I remember very well I hope I didn't say
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:22.560]  that but whatever was said in that article my role in government is to
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:30.080]  oversee federal rulemaking in a way that is fully disconnected from the vast
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.080]  majority of my academic writing including that so I know I'm just asking
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.560]  because you may be the next Supreme Court justice
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.040]  didn't write those things and that's why I'm bringing them up to you so all I
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.920]  can say is that there are a lot of things that I've written I've written I guess
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:53.200]  there are more things I'm sad to agree that I may agree with some of the things
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:19:15.880]  I've written I'm not exactly sure I just want to know is it safe to say that you
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.720]  retract saying that conspiracy theory should be banned or taxed for having an
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.280]  opinion online is it safe to say that remember that I don't remember the article very well
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:33.880]  so I hope I didn't say either of those things you did and it's a written do you

[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:03.440]  the job of your list last question a little over a year ago I began to do a

[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:12.000]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.920]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.200]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:24.560]  that as a surprise but I guess we've never had on the show before the guys
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.640]  pop in my ear on the microphone but they never talked loud enough for me to
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.640]  able to hear what they're saying it's just kind of like I I hear the mic open
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.320]  up and then I'm by the way Steve Pachinick which is just classic he is
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.400]  such a character he's like I don't want to talk about a chicken farmer I'm here
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.960]  to talk about bin Laden so have me on another time I'm like okay he's like
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:48.360]  this is big stuff but then it is big that they've got troops confirmed running
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.240]  around in police uniforms I know that's true and I know they send to people's
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.240]  houses they see that are high threat to take out the enemy that's the American
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.240]  people and that is about as big a news as it gets and so I went into a whole
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:06.520]  rant about that but we'll try to get Steve Pachinick on tomorrow or the next
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.840]  day and I because I know Steve's listening and he's a great guy he
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.880]  certainly is a character and I wanted to get his breakdown on bin Laden and take
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.200]  your calls on that subject and I'm still going to do it I want to hear from
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:27.360]  military who been in Afghanistan do you buy the bin Laden story and do you like
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:35.240]  what Obama is doing with this story a toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:44.360]  800-259-9231 what did you think of part of the clip the full videos up at
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.920]  info wars.com Obama informations are confronted over banned conspiracy
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:54.280]  theorist paper he wrote this in 2008 wrote two of them it's on record he's
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.640]  talked about it before but suddenly he's got amnesia he won't retract it but he
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:06.560]  won't say that he wrote it that's part of the total disdain that's like when one
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.800]  of the heads of the Heart Rubin Commission former senator Gary Hart gave
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.920]  you know speeches about it but he also sent a letter to Ahmed energy I don't
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.360]  know five years ago and said will stage terror attacks and blame it on you like
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:23.760]  the Gulf of Tonkin the USS Maine you better do what you're told don't think
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.760]  just because the American people aren't wanting to have war with you that we
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.000]  won't stage something so we are change goes to one of his speeches brings it
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.600]  up says your letter to Ahmed energy to last year was years ago it's in truth
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.160]  rising the film I made amazing video you know you said this letter he goes no I
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.960]  didn't I don't think we have it right here I don't remember that so they
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.800]  will start reading it to me goes oh that letter and he starts sweating and
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.040]  freaking out it's like you're not any publicly publish this but they they're
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:57.360]  so used to the public not knowing how to tie their shoelaces not knowing what
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.800]  country they're in not knowing what government they're under you're just
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.400]  having no idea about anything that when you actually confront them he's like

[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.480]  reality remember the quote of Carl Rove he's talking to the New York Times
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.640]  Washington Post and other reporters the cocktail party they said come on you
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.360]  know there's no WMD's you guys lied on purpose and Rove goes it doesn't matter

[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.960]  a good little doggy and you'll I'm paraphrasing and go read it and I'll
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.280]  change that reality and you'll follow it I'm history's actor we're history's actors
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.000]  we're an empire now says we're an empire now and you will dutifully do what you
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:07.640]  are told you will dutifully do what you are told you will dutifully do it and
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.680]  they said yeah I guess we will there's like that's right we pay you don't we

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.040]  conspiracy theorist which means you don't get establishment approval and they
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.600]  said okay in fact it took a couple years for that quote to come out and then
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.160]  and then there was a debate about whether he said it and then other writers
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:57.320]  said yeah we were there he said it I mean imagine the chief advisor of the
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.240]  president on paper he wasn't he was the assistant but but in reality he was
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.520]  just going hey you guys are nothing you'll do whatever we tell you will
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.200]  change something completely tomorrow and you'll believe it we control reality and
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.560]  you know what when you get the public that's like O'Brien when he's torturing
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.720]  Winston in 1984 he says you don't dig our scientists and come up with
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.520]  mathematics to show that there is no gravity but still have another set to
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.280]  have gravity to navigate ships and aircraft you don't think we can't do
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.760]  that Winston we can and we probably will it's all about destroying reality
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.840]  Winston now I'm gonna torture you some more pal till you get that straight to
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:39.520]  your little noggin because we control reality and the general public's like
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.400]  you bet Carl Rove says jumping into a meat grinder is good for you we'll do
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.520]  it because we like to be patted on the head by the mainstream media we're on

[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:38.640]  Coast Guard military people chiming in we're about to talk to on Obama or
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.280]  Barry Saturo or whatever his name is this week whatever citizenship he is
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:51.320]  this week Kenyan Indonesian he says you know he killed bin Laden and threw him
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:55.240]  in the ocean and that they were watching and commanding live feeds of the seals
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.640]  turns out they said well that isn't true and yeah that's a fake photo but
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.640]  everything else is true yeah the helicopter blew up then the rest of
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.040]  seals blew up but the seals were going to save Rangers oh but they weren't going
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:13.240]  to save Rangers but Pat Tillman was charging Al Qaeda oh actually we had him
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:19.560]  killed oh but Jessica Lynch was saving people that was fake too and people died
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.280]  once they got back to the US because they wouldn't go along with they got
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.200]  killed assassinated oh there's nothing going on and people say well why are you
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.800]  still alive Alex because I'm a public figure and because if they kill me it
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.240]  will make a big issue out of it but they might and I'll tell you I'm not looking
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:44.160]  forward to that but this is Obama's reelection strategy and he said he
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.160]  wouldn't spike the football wouldn't use it when you heard that you knew it was a
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.520]  lie because we're the enemy he works for the bankers he wants to socialize
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:01.120]  things so that we're dependent on them and then once we're dependent on the
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:10.120]  system they can totally control us okay let's go to your phone calls and after
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:16.040]  we go to this first round I am just polaxed by the man talking about the
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.200]  military at Fort Stewart which is one of the main brigade homeland centers and
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:24.120]  talking about military and playing clothes raiding the chicken farmer who
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.200]  got killed because it all fit into place people say it with Sheriff's
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.640]  Department outfits but nobody else but the Sheriff's Department said none of our
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:40.800]  deputies were there and the sheriff says we didn't do that and then all the
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.640]  police deputies or police officers were off that day and look totally freaked
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:55.760]  out I mean I've got articles here out of the pilot newspaper the official
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.480]  Virginia pilot there in Norfolk where their own reporters were racially
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.240]  attacked by a hundred black youths and others are being attacked and the police
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:09.360]  will not respond and the newspaper wouldn't let them report it until the
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.640]  youth began to brag on Facebook about it so I mean the media talk about control
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.440]  political correctness it's more than just political correctness it's total
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:26.520]  like CIA level black ops because you they won't even report on racial attacks
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:30.200]  all over Norfolk, Virginia and they won't report on the military that I've
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.600]  confirmed he's been playing clothes raiding people's houses for decades and
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.080]  now it's expanding so I want to hear from military that's been part of this
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.640]  I've interviewed people I've seen the documents I've gotten documents where the
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.840]  FBI goes okay here's your press release and it's not it's a secret document
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.800]  and the FBI guy jumps in his car and drives off didn't you know wasn't an
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.720]  accident wasn't on purpose that is in my film police state to the takeover and
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.240]  those documents are online and it says this is restricted don't let the public
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.960]  see it Fort Hood you know we'll respond anywhere in Texas we'll send helicopters
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.520]  SWAT teams warrants service within hours you need us the US Army stands ready
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:21.080]  they tell the public oh it's bomb disposal no it's not that's the cover
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.000]  and another drill they did I had the army come up and say turn your camera off
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.120]  and I said no I'm not going to and the guy started bowing up and I just do
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.640]  whatever you're gonna do man this is what's happened in America I mean this
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.800]  is how far we've gotten all right I'm gonna go to the military we're gonna go
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:44.080]  to Bob in Wisconsin it was airborne in Afghanistan then Aaron a Minnesota
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.680]  National Guard Stacy Navy man's wife has information Patrick Coast Guard in
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.440]  Texas Steve New Jersey was an Army in Afghanistan we'll go to all of you and
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.640]  I'll try to shut up this is just blowing me away and it's not being reported
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.120]  you're like well how can that happen they won't allow racial attacks to be
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:10.840]  reported all over the country I mean it's bad let's go to Bob in Wisconsin
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.480]  first Bob you're on the air
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:25.000]  um yeah I was the third brigade 101st 9-11 that morning we watched it or I
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.160]  went to work we never went back to work and the 20 thing they said to us that
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.440]  day was we packed your bags we're going somewhere we don't know where and we
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.320]  don't know when well we ended up over there in our first battalion and second
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:44.840]  battalion we're in Anaconda well I got got there towards the end of
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:51.000]  Anaconda right when they're coming out of the battle well I ended up going to
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.800]  coast Chapman hair field there's only two two platoons of us and we were
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.000]  working directly for the special forces and the big joke was you know we're
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.280]  gonna get bin Laden and a lot of the SF guys that sit there and get right at you
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.320]  and they'd go are you kidding oh yeah right you know but they won't say
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:19.360]  nothing but um mostly we played with like the Hikani faction you're looking at
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.000]  like take a lot of warlords on the border right there and it's all a fight
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:31.080]  over opium yep yep I'm not now you don't as early as I was there oh it was a
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.640]  chess match you'd be you'd sit there and play chess with the day go on patrol at
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.120]  night now that's early early early 10 years ago now it's 40,000 guys they're
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:46.760]  no when I was there there's 3,000 of us now I watched everything go over that
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.640]  border less than right every day of the week and there is no control in that you
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.800]  know I just sit here and grit my teeth 10 years later and I agree that's why I
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.720]  listen to you it's a joke I walked across the street I saw bin Laden dead I
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:09.560]  cried for the 10,000 guys that died over there because of it you know any let me
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:18.240]  ask you a question do you believe any of this I believe when I came home going
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.400]  through the TSA was a joke you know but you got your special operations command
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:30.600]  that he's subject to that you know it's a horse it's scary there's no
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.760]  oversight you know I'd come back after supposedly fighting al-Qaeda and they
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.880]  want to grab your genitals meanwhile it's on the news that al-Qaeda openly is
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.680]  supposedly the good guys now in Libby and all these places God bless you sir good
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.560]  to hear from you let's go ahead and take another call here let's talk to Steve in
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.640]  New Jersey who was in the army in Afghanistan what's your take on the one
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:01.080]  year anniversary of him being killed and thrown in the ocean Alex greetings to you
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:07.200]  how are you good you know I I don't even know where to start to be honest with
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:15.360]  you I mean you see how far we've got the greatest you know as society as America
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.240]  as a principle it really just is bad you know I think for me I haven't been
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:26.200]  home from Afghanistan we started hearing the the inkling that we're going
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.360]  somewhere it was Iraq and I think after having been home I didn't go to Iraq
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.520]  but having been home and listening to the news stateside and having been on the
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:38.000]  other side of the fence in Afghanistan when these weapons of mass destruction
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  didn't show up I think that's when I woke up and I really started to wake up
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.080]  at least and you know with the whole cat's home and death and the chest ones
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.680]  like you mentioned it really opened my eyes that's in this is really a politicized
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:57.680]  the war I mean I think it's sad you know when when you know it's funny I
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:04.160]  often think of the lyrics from the Black Sabbath song Warpigs using people as
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.240]  pawns and chefs and I get angry I get mad as hell and it's really the thing
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.960]  that I was essentially you can myself to my commerce reduced before these these
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.400]  political agendas which have absolutely nothing to do with them by the time you
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.880]  figure it out they've always got a new crop to breathe do you to be given
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.480]  experimental shots and to be tested on and now to have the death benefits
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.920]  stolen and in America you're supposed to just put a flag out front your house
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.960]  bow down to the government and that's patriotism well if that's patriotism I
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.800]  don't want any part of it talking to your buddies from the military are any
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.440]  of them buying this bin Laden thing well it's funny I have I was an MP when I was
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.960]  in the army so you know we tend to be the redheaded children of the army but
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.680]  so buddy of mine decided you know what I want to go to special forces out and you
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.800]  know when it's been been a lot of was killed you know you know I openly had
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.760]  conversation I said so well you know doesn't seem real fishy that this has
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:14.960]  been so nightly nicely you know gets wrapped and swept under a rug so to speak
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:18.360]  well you know it doesn't seem a little fishy but the Intel you know I have
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.360]  access to the supernet so the Intel I read is different from what you guys
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.480]  read yeah but that's where the greatest propaganda is is inside those secret
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.200]  news chains where they can get away with more ridiculous lies it's like
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:36.200]  everybody I know in the military was the fake bin Laden photo and then they say
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.240]  oh I saw in a secret one and I go really is this it I go that's a fake one I
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.760]  never want to admit they got duped the worst brainwashing is within those
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.960]  compartments because see when it has to go public it can get debunked when they
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.840]  keep it chambered I mean it's well known that the biggest brainwashing goes on
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.840]  inside the military you know I mean because of the way if he that's that
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.760]  line of communication is secured there's no way to tell whether it's true or not
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.800]  you have to take it at face value and assume it's accurate here's an example
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:15.800]  one time I was at a land rights rally at the Capitol no one the Capitol it was
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:20.800]  at the police station or down by the old city hall the point is I was walking
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.200]  back from my car and heard the police on their radio is going yeah yeah it's an
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:28.800]  extremist group it's Republic of Texas they're here trying to cause trouble and
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:34.080]  we weren't Republic of Texas they just made that up and just fed it to the cops
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.120]  to like you know say these are bad guys I'm not saying Republic of Texas is bad
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.720]  my point is is that they just throw labels on so just because it came down
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.640]  the radio that doesn't mean or just because you're in an internal group
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.000]  that you're being given the truth is my point I agree with you all hardly not
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.960]  fortunately I think I think a lot of these guys are still drinking the
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.120]  coolie you know in terms of we're here for America and defending our freedom
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.920]  but you know and I think they're just naive to what's actually happening you
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.120]  know I just to me the fact that his body was so neatly dumped over over the side
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:14.320]  of a boat and you know it's never gonna be seen from again especially I just
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.680]  don't get it like how do you not it's a mean screaming that there's much more
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.960]  to it than what we're being told but what about I'm changing the story there
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:27.880]  was no video feed the situation room's photo photos fake he didn't do a
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.360]  firefight he didn't use his wife as a shield the helicopter with the seals
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:37.960]  getting on it blew up I appreciate your call God bless you sir let's go to we've
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.560]  got Minnesota National Guard infantry army let's talk to Stacey who's a Navy
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.640]  man's wife with information Stacey what info do you have for us on the one year
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.720]  anniversary of the slaying of the dragon by Obama I mean the slaying of the the
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.800]  goblin I mean the slaying of the devil I mean the slaying of the Easter Bunny I
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.520]  mean bin Laden what do you think about this hi Alex well I can tell you one
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:09.240]  thing for sure my husband recently returned from being deployed to Afghanistan
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.920]  and no he does not believe that we killed bin Laden over there in the raid and you
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.920]  know he thinks the whole thing was just completely made up and obviously we've
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:23.200]  been given no evidence whatsoever to prove it in any way shape or form so no
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.560]  he doesn't believe that but there's something else I can tell you about that
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:32.320]  he experienced while he was on his deployment in Afghanistan and that is
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:40.640]  the fact that the idea of 9-11 being an inside job was openly discussed amongst
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.360]  the troops while they were there and that this happened with him even with men
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.240]  of much much lower rank that you know I thought that really said something that
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.200]  they were comfortable enough to talk about that with him in particular to you
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  know openly discuss that idea that 9-11 was an inside job I thought that was a
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.800]  pretty good sign of you know where the military stands in terms of what the
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.600]  troops really believe in you know how our troops feel about this war and see
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.920]  what they're doing is they're filtering out people that aren't smart or aren't
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.000]  sophisticated to be this brigade homeland for years they just filter them out
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.160]  make them police or keep them in domestic military formations for war with
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:27.480]  the people because the vast majority of the military I mean I'm not I've never
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.800]  really done this the last few years because I've always seen it as a threat
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.520]  because it's under globalist control but more and more the statistics show it the
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:42.000]  numbers what I see the military is more awake than any other group across the
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.160]  board there's one other thing I can tell you also and this just happened in the
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:53.680]  last week or so we actually have a couple of battalions at our base that are
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:59.160]  being redeployed that just got back and so this is quite a shock obviously to
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.280]  these guys because they just recently got home and they've been given almost no
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.040]  notice this is a very unusual thing so you know I don't know what what it was
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.200]  Obama said about oh he's supposed to be pulling troops out of Afghanistan when
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.920]  apparently they're turning right around and sending a couple of battalions
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.640]  back out that's a blackout military tactic you're charging the Davidian
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.320]  compound ramming it with tanks machine gunning you say come out we're not
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.480]  firing come out with your hands up you're gonna sign the NDAA you say
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.920]  you're not you're gonna sign Syspa you say you're not you say you won't use the
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.800]  killing of bin Laden as a spike the football campaign a year ago of course
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.040]  he's using it if they lie even when the truth serves because you need to be fed
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.960]  a diet of lies it is a system in psychological warfare they talk about
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:56.480]  of creating an entire false reality a fog of lies until people finally just
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.680]  disengage so of course they're sending more troops in while saying they're
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.280]  pulling them out because I'll tell you the globalists just want to sit on top
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.120]  that 500 billion a year in opium and menace and make everybody angry at us
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:15.800]  and demonize America and chew up our troops and no bid contracts and so the
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:20.720]  Afghans want that smack money this is fight over drugs just like in Mexico and
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.440]  it's not about politics religion any of it they want the goods they want the
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.920]  money and so the United States is starting to lose see the the so-called
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:37.120]  US wanted to sit in Southeast Asia and get all the smack money again back then
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.600]  90% was produced there not in Afghanistan so they just moved there and they got
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.360]  finally run out over the goodie you know goodie-goody gumdrop stuff because the
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.000]  troops figured out this was about opium was it was about heroin well now it's
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.240]  the same thing there and so the war is being lost and the drug dealing bankers
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.920]  are like my gosh we start a bigger war with Pakistan we want our drug money
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.240]  you know we're not going to just have this crop delivered to somebody else or
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.520]  like to let the Pakistanis of the Ruskies have it I mean is your husband
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.960]  concerned about all the opium being grown well I mean he's aware of it
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.080]  obviously in his particular job while he was over there he didn't get to
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.520]  witness that much of that type of activity going on but he was aware of it
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.760]  but yeah I mean the reasons why we're there are not the reasons why we're
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:31.880]  there well I mean from from every analyst I've seen the the globalist using
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.520]  our military are starting to lose the war I mean is that what your husband's
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.360]  telling you oh yeah it's it's you know he believes we shouldn't be there at all
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:44.400]  and it's you know we should have gone in the first place and it's long been past
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.000]  time to go yeah and and look all the propaganda in the world's not going to
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.880]  stop those Taliban from wanting their their their heroin money and so just
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:57.640]  like Alexander the Great and everybody else the United States will be thrown
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.480]  out of Afghanistan
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.800]  I've seen the ungevity products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.560]  them started using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.680]  regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.120]  when I saw those results I said I'd better follow my own advice I started
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:23.320]  taking the ungevity products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:28.120]  our bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift but if our body
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.280]  doesn't have the tools it needs all of the vitamins all of the minerals and the
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.960]  other key essential trace elements we're not gonna be healthy folks is hidden

[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:35.360]  be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been

[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:11.560]  peace of mind use fake TV it's on record what the system does it takes our best
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:18.040]  soldiers and deploys them two three four five six seven eight times knowing that
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:22.200]  it's gonna wreck psychologically more than 30% of them
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  World War I World War II they would not make you serve more than one term my
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:35.040]  grandfather only had to fly 22 missions over Europe and never wanted to talk
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.880]  about it and told everybody he was a cook in the Army Air Corps and he was
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:43.240]  after his 20-something missions he was made the head cook you know over a
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.880]  group but after he of course he died and years later dig into his stuff so if
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:51.240]  these soldiers it's not fun I mean I mean the old-timers I knew never want to
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:56.280]  talk about World War two one year I mean some of them volunteered to go longer
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:06.160]  one year overseas imagine year after year after year after year after year after
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:14.080]  year and then they put them on Prozac like that Bales sergeant and they're
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.800]  gonna put him in prison and I'm not saying what he did is what do you do when
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.960]  somebody's on a psychotropic drug and been in four tours and had part of their
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.280]  foot blown off and says I don't want to go back oh let's just send you right
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:36.320]  back over there then I mean it's the drugs that are doing this and it's a
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.840]  time bomb you you know the government says the troops the number one threat in
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.200]  terrorism they're not saying number one threat going postal there is that
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.440]  problem because a small percentage will but you get a small percentage of
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.000]  millions of people that have been in these different tours of the last decade
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.320]  there's a couple million that have been in and out it is a time bomb by the way
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.920]  it's a time bomb for police and others because the police have got post-traumatic
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.440]  stress disorder most of them veterans the veterans are pulling over just had a
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:13.680]  bad day at work or a bad day with the wife time bomb but the government's not
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.040]  talking about that it's saying no no no they're gonna be terrorist and the
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.080]  number one threat is troops detonating improvised explosive devices that's
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.920]  what they teach in the public manuals we broke it back when it was still secret
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.640]  every police department's trained that you will I could open the phones up to
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.360]  police they'll call in and tell you you will face veterans with bombs and I
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.040]  guess when they start hyping it up enough and do a few that'll put the idea in
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.240]  people's heads there might actually be some real ones see I've also studied the
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.240]  psychological warfare system the Globals are able to hype things and then
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.320]  actually prime the pump and do a few of their own terror attacks and then
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.240]  actually get some copycatters kind of like school shootings you advertise it
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.040]  enough talk about it what do you do when you're upset about your life you're
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.360]  14 well get daddy shot gun and shoot some people just like death education
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.440]  starting federally in the early 90s massively there's mainline you ABC news
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.520]  even reported on this massive increases and people come in suicide yeah you
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.400]  think 12 year old girls are thinking about how to commit suicide till it
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.200]  becomes a big drama queen thing and let us show you in the death education class
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:28.600]  how to commit suicide that's what they've shown with sexual education it's one
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.640]  thing you were doing it to people you know 13 14 50 and just give them the
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.440]  facts in health class and hey here's some diseases you better look out but no
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.880]  when they start teaching five six seven eight nine ten year olds those kids
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:49.280]  were never even thinking about sex now it's in their mind now it's in their
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.560]  mind and it's the same thing just like police will tell you when some nut
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.880]  jumps off a famous building they know to station people in the next few days
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:00.240]  because other people are gonna see it in the news and go I'm gonna do that I'm
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:06.280]  gonna do that that's how this works and all these movies and stuff about how
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:10.040]  right-wingers are gonna kill cops and hyping it that's putting it in people's
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:16.840]  minds I want to come back and go to it's been holding the longest here Aaron in

[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:04.760]  thank you hey thank you Alex I'm in that disagreement not with you this time but
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:10.240]  with Paul Watson's article from yesterday about US troops in Minnesota I have
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:20.120]  some very good information to let me tell you about it let me finish okay okay
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:25.840]  here's the thing that article was very misleading I thought I would do some
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:32.280]  fact-checking so I contacted some people I know at Northcom and also people at
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:36.760]  Minnesota National Guard they took a look at the article they thought it was
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:42.200]  a little bit biased a little bit misleading so they got a hold of the
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:48.000]  Lieutenant Colonel that actually was in the command of that Minnesota operation
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:54.560]  that you guys are reporting on and he made a unclassified response and about
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:01.200]  what actually you sound like a total moron twit put him on hold he made an
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:07.240]  unclassified statement oh we have to have classification things have to be
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:11.640]  classified when we're talking to the enemy American people what does that
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.600]  mean an unclassified statement about Minnesota National Guard troops

[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.000]  it and you're calling in saying I'm misleading saying Bull Watson's doing
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  all this we get things wrong every once in a while but you're just it just you
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:48.320]  sound so arrogant and just so classified like and you smack look there's more

[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:26.520]  they believe in this fable that some have been lauding was killed so a guy
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:31.880]  calls in says Minnesota National Guard info I said I'm taking calls on the
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:36.880]  subject you believe in the bin Laden thing the guy is obviously upset and he
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:40.200]  plays these little mind games and that's the quickest way to get me just angry
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:45.120]  he's like okay I've got some information you're wrong if you'll just be quiet and
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.920]  then he pauses about four seconds and I'm wondering is the guy's phone gone and
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.880]  then as soon as I talk he jumps in it's like a mind game I'm like okay it's like
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:57.360]  sticking your hand out and when somebody goes to shake it you pull your hand back
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.960]  I'm not five years old son and then he goes into your disinformation Paul Watson
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:10.440]  Minnesota troops up there yeah well do between active duty and not active duty
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.520]  and I'm like listen he goes and the colonel made a non-clause about statement
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.240]  like getting off creamily I'm talking about classification this whole
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:21.560]  religion when they get on the air and they talk about the CIA and everybody
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:24.800]  starts getting all excited speaking of CIA we got Michael East Coast does he
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.760]  CIA everybody gets all excited oh CIA oh I mean CIA that's like saying you work
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:38.400]  for FedEx or something it's a gigantic huge army and side issue the point is
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.200]  is that I start blowing up at him and calling him a punk so for that I
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.320]  apologize it's just there's army checkpoints all over the country TSA in
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.240]  San Antonio they've got MPs out at the Riverwalk trying to search people they've
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.680]  got police all over the country arresting people for filming them in public
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:02.120]  total surveillance the CIA director says they're using appliances to spawn people
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.000]  without warrants Google puts out press releases admitting they're using cameras
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.240]  and onboard microphones to watch people Google has been caught now stealing
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.640]  username and passcodes with wireless trucks and cars told you that years ago
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:20.200]  everything is beyond insane world governments being shut up I can't go

[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:29.680]  come after my genitals the TSA pervs searching bags without warrants they're
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.440]  confirming that they're dressing up in weird made-up local police jurisdiction
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.880]  outfits I mean this is right out of romancing the the stone where Colonel
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.160]  Zorro or whatever his name is is always wearing a new uniform I mean that this is

[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.240]  the military dressing up he's very upset here in the military call in and say

[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:16.320]  are you in the Minnesota Guard why are you so upset about us exposing the fact
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.720]  that we're all being acclimated to different types of military occupation
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:26.440]  okay first off I'm not upset but anyways what am I I am a reporter in the
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:31.000]  alternative media just like you and I think a reporter has a duty to get both

[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:06.040]  all this and I want the goods what did Paul say that wasn't right tell me in
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:09.400]  general that they aren't militarizing this country and that we aren't in
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.000]  trouble now just bring the goods deliver the goods or is this just about you

[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:08.320]  Marines at DWI checkpoints I've had it's so incredible the point is is that
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.440]  they've already federalized the National Guard under the states and the
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:15.120]  governor they federalized the National Guard yes the governor still has some
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.480]  control I've actually read the John Warren Defense Authorization Act 2007 that
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.440]  began to federalize them I mean I guess gun confiscation didn't happen in
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.680]  Katrina and it was a joint operation with regular Army big Army and I'm sorry
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:32.360]  go ahead continue go ahead and scream at me I like that I like that that's good

[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.160]  another thing you don't understand all the details I know I'm not into the
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:52.160]  classification and I haven't been died in the wool with your spree decor I'm a

[02:15:53.560 --> 02:16:04.920]  you in Michael well yes I'm this this is very nice percent of all high school
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:12.320]  graduates do not pass the armed forces and exentrance exam and when you think
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:16.960]  of how they have compartmental stupidity in the military and other
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.880]  agencies across the United States you wonder what's going on and when you
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:27.800]  find out what is going on at Camp Perry otherwise known as the armed forces
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:33.200]  experimental training activity they've had unprecedented infrastructure growth
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:39.360]  fiber-optic lines advanced communication systems and it's full of all these
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:46.480]  independent contractors that have watered down America's mission as far as
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.560]  Osama bin Laden when you think of the time from Bush to Obama why do you think
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:56.520]  it took so long and they're dragging their feet to prop up the military
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:01.840]  industrial complex how many agents do you think are in Iran that are trying to
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:08.440]  disrupt and use guerrilla tactics none hardly maybe 50 at the most and that's
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:14.280]  the thing America's future is in the balance right now and the mindset in
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:18.840]  Washington our elected officials could care less of what's going on with America
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:23.120]  because they've been manipulated by the lobbyists and they're not doing what's
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.120]  in the best interest of America especially when you look at the
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.680]  manufacturing base in America in the 1970s 25% of all jobs were in
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:37.880]  manufacturing and now we're looking at 9% and the 9% is mostly military
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.600]  industrial complex we've got to do something to bring up this economy we've
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.520]  got to have a politician that's going to inspire a nation with down-to-earth
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:54.040]  concrete ideas so I take it you don't believe that they just they killed the
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:59.400]  Easter Bunny last year in Pakistan yeah well the biggest thing about these
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.440]  military jackbooth state stuff that you talk about they're putting a lot of
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.640]  armed forces people in police positions if they come back and they don't have a
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:10.840]  job they're gonna drink and take drugs and they're gonna shoot people up they've
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.120]  got to have something to do and if they've got to shoot up the American
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.880]  people I agree and the next thing you know and the next thing you know we're
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:22.640]  gonna have a 10 to 15 percent real unemployment rate and we've been
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.760]  propping up nations with our bases across the globe we're subsidizing
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.840]  economies across the world with our military when we sir I hear you great
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.360]  points we've got active police will in Texas has info on a farmer an interesting
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:44.520]  call sir okay will you're a police officer what's your news hey Alice good
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:49.600]  afternoon are you enjoying the ranting yeah I always enjoy a good rant
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:54.600]  especially on info wars I'm originally from Metro Atlanta in Georgia and I
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:57.620]  worked in law enforcement it's where I cut my teeth and law enforcement was
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:02.280]  actually in the Roswell area in Fulton County and one of the things I want to
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.520]  point out is Fulton County and Metro Atlanta is unique that they have a
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:10.760]  sheriff's office and a Marshall's office okay that's what it is yeah they
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:13.640]  there's actually two different divisions of law enforcement the sheriff is an
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.000]  elected constitution of your constitutional official and the
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.200]  Marshall is an appointed position from the board of commissioners and the
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.800]  Marshall's position and his deputy Marshall's mainly what they're there
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:31.280]  for is the movement of inmates from pretrial detention centers to going
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:35.160]  forward for trial and this sort of thing if you can imagine when they leave jail
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.720]  and go to the courthouse the Marshalls are kind of the ones who kind of fit and
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:42.360]  babysit the inmates as they're awaiting their arraignments or court hearings and
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  this sort of thing it's it's highly unusual to me that the Marshalls would
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:52.080]  be the one doing the civil process on the chicken man and Roswell you know my
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:56.760]  issue is is we've called all these groups and the papers say everyone
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:00.400]  denies they did it and then now this fella called in who sounded credible and
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.360]  everything he said tumbled into place because I know this goes on and said no
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:09.960]  brigade homeland rated the house a little more info towards you Alex when
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.600]  when your reporters went to what you're calling it they look like a
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:18.080]  capitol building Roswell City Hall you encountered some officers that were not
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:22.120]  Roswell police officers proper what they actually are a municipal complex
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:25.960]  police officers they work for City Hall they do not work for the police
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:31.160]  department if you can imagine they're kind of trumped up bailiffs that work
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:34.600]  for the city I understand they were wearing the same uniforms and we were
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:39.800]  wondering why the captain was saying we'll talk to this sergeant he's in
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:46.760]  charge we're like what exactly it didn't make sense right so I actually know
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.520]  someone trained and worked with someone who works at the municipal complex as a
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:54.720]  municipal complex police officer and I put a call into him after hearing your
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:58.560]  reporting because to tell you the truth I'm out of contact with home I didn't
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:01.720]  know this kind of stuff was going on I knew the chicken man he was a good guy
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:06.240]  I used to get three eggs from it I mean he was a real nice fellow and I made a
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:08.920]  phone call to this gentleman that I know that works with me this municipal
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:13.800]  complex and asked him hey what the hell is going on and pretty much what he told
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:19.960]  me was we had nothing to do with it and that's as much as he would tell me what
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:24.600]  do you think about everybody acting scared and no one's saying who actually
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:29.480]  went there or what happened and we say well yeah go ahead no a lot of times
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:34.600]  when you have guys that have 15 16 years invested into the retirement system
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:39.000]  they're gonna not rock the boat they're gonna go in and there's gonna be a
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.280]  parting line usually there's interoffice memorandums that come out saying hey
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.520]  listen refer reporters or whomever to this person and you're not to say
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.040]  anything and I think in this particular case that's what happened but I will tell
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:57.000]  you knowing how it works at the Fulton County Georgia it is it's real
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.040]  suspicious to me that the Fort County Marshals would be out doing civil
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:05.040]  service especially when you add into this factor Alex supposedly the chicken
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:09.320]  man had you know I guess said that he wasn't going to be taken alive at least
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.400]  that's kind of the party line of what's being said why in the world would you
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:17.200]  not send the sheriff's office to deal with criminal situations that there was
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.840]  going to be some sort of barricade situation or that kind of thing why
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:24.880]  would they not go out let me say this I've got the documents I've talked to
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:29.400]  the people are you aware have you heard about the Fort Hood because you're
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:34.560]  saying you're calling from Texas did you know Fort Hood responds covertly with
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:40.760]  troops to aid police on a routine basis all over the state I not from Fort Hood
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:46.360]  Alex but I have been part of situations where we've had troops from Camp
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:52.480]  Bullis and Fort St. Houston coming out in quote-unquote support missions there
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:56.080]  have been several incidents that I know personally of of down in the Valley of
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:23:01.840]  Texas where local law enforcement on the county level and federal troops and I
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:04.320]  know you had the one guy who was trying to make the differentiation between
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:09.240]  National Guard Reserve and active duty troops where they were all working
[02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:13.440]  side-by-side so yeah my cousin before he got deployed again he's been in the
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:19.040]  army 20-something years his job is merging the National Guard with big army
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:22.760]  out at Berksstrom I mean they're merging I'm sure they got different
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:26.520]  different patches but they're merging that's why I started blowing up with
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:31.400]  the guy because he was just he didn't I mean he was just making stuff up it
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:35.200]  basically saying well they're just National Guard under the governor there's
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:38.240]  nothing wrong with this the point is we got military coming on our ears now
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.880]  they're getting us ready is my point this is my opinion I guess you would
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:49.000]  say but the traditional mission of National Guard you know from the time
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:53.760]  of Eisenhower up has been they answered to the governor well of course that's
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:57.280]  changed over the last 40-50 years something that we have to keep in mind
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:02.880]  though is with the centralization of these council of governors you have to
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.440]  understand that there are governors in this country that no longer answer to
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.800]  the people of the state they're actually answering to federal authority no
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:14.160]  that's what the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says it it's turning
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:18.120]  the National Guard from the governors into this federal system and it says
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.840]  that council's in control and it's got language in there about insurrection
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.480]  states and even legislatures and things that why is the central government
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:31.440]  gearing up to take over the states I mean they admit they are now this is not
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.480]  the look Texas when that when they unanimously voted in the House to arrest
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:41.400]  TSA that grab people's private parts it's illegal the feds threatened a
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:47.720]  blockade and said they'd back it up with force I mean what is that well I
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:51.560]  think you also have to look at the guys you know like Rick Perry and Lieutenant
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:54.520]  Governor Dewhurst that pretty much answered the federal authorities anyways
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.240]  the people spoke their representatives spoke and the central government came in
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:03.120]  and squashed it and that's why I get so mad at that guy I mean the issue is I
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:06.480]  have to sit there and argue with my wife about not leaving this country I mean I
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.640]  believe all this I know it's real I've been driven crazy by it I understand that
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:15.440]  but the point is I can't believe this is gonna happen I mean you really it's
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.800]  gonna get bad I'm you tell you they didn't set all this up for no reason is
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:23.120]  all I'm telling everybody is we have got to get the word out somehow so this
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:29.960]  doesn't happen I'm gonna say things that you already know Alex but there in in
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.040]  my time I just went into my 12th year of law enforcement and in my time I have
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:37.800]  seen a dramatic change really over the last decade of kind of an old guard
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:42.720]  that's going out and kind of the militarization of law enforcement and one
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:47.240]  of the things that I have noticed is it's it really has been an ever-encroaching
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:53.880]  federalization of law enforcement so we're now there is a area of training
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:59.920]  through FEMA that's managing civil unrest and threat this is becoming required
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.640]  training for all new law enforcement that are going through the academies not
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:09.080]  just here in Texas but really kind of nationwide that it is teaching there
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:13.880]  will be civil unrest there there is going to be people in the street and the
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.600]  appropriate ways according to FEMA of how to deal with them well and that's the
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.160]  general training before when I've seen in the news and documents they the
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:24.840]  intelligence units and the SWAT teams at least they said this in the news in the
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.200]  last six years are all getting training that they quote will face veterans with
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:36.920]  IEDs so you've correct yeah but something else too is and to me it all
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.040]  comes back to money and through federal grant programs Alex and one of the
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.560]  things that I have seen is especially with kind of a large agencies regional
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:50.040]  agencies and I'm talking like you know your city of San Antonio and this sort
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:56.840]  of thing that have large SWAT teams there is a federalization of SWAT teams
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:02.280]  into becoming what are called tier one agencies tier one SWAT teams and pretty
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.480]  much this means that you're going to have like an EOD team like the bomb tax
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:10.640]  you're going to have two ready an A team and a B team of SWAT teams this sort of
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:17.280]  thing and they answered to in this in our region at least region six they
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:22.520]  answered a FEMA and say for example and this is not going under what we have
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:28.480]  protected in our state here in Texas of mutual aid this is through FEMA so if we
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:34.440]  had a natural disaster this same city of Austin FEMA would tell City of Austin
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.680]  hey report to and you can fill in the blame what happened in New Orleans they
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.080]  wouldn't go under FEMA command so as the storm hits they this is CBS News they
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:49.640]  jam cell phones of the police then they go cut the tower down on the radio the
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:55.120]  police have to guard it and then FEMA orders everybody to stand down and then
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:58.920]  says oh look the city couldn't respond and then they show film footage of a few
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:04.120]  of the crazy cops robbing Walmart to make the image of only FEMA can save you
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:08.520]  oh and then FEMA screws up so they need more power see the problem reaction
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:12.600]  solution blocking the Coast Guard bringing in the fuel blocking all the
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:15.880]  local police that came to help and firefighters from all over the country
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:21.120]  and then letting it turn into a hellhole for five days and rolling in behind
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:27.600]  that the military to take guns I mean that that is what they did well I think
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:30.840]  a lot of people get you know and having conversations recently and me
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.680]  referencing fault flags you know you don't have to have a Gulf of talk in our
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:39.600]  World Trade Center for a fault flag just inactivity in itself is provoking the
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:44.880]  fault flag and like it was the example that you were just giving the inaction
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:51.120]  local authorities at direction of FEMA in itself creates the 20 years ago two
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:57.080]  days ago was the LA riots the police stood down and pulled back and said
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:00.880]  well we'll get blamed if we do anything and let them shoot firefighters who
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:05.200]  still went in and I've got articles breaking that down today where the
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.880]  media and the police will not respond when whites are attacked and it's on
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:15.080]  record now see and again this is if this is very dangerous because they're
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:20.400]  trying to elicit some type of major crisis right now so the feds can come
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:23.640]  fluttering in as everybody's savior thank you will great call great

[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.200]  the entire crew because I know Tucker tried and other people try I want us
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:27.240]  ourselves to be refused booking because I want to be booked in earlier when they
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:32.040]  refused us those days which Tucker says they've already tried as well I want to
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:36.040]  confirm myself though trust but verify and then regardless get me like at least
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:40.640]  the day before so they can accuse me of trying to still vases and pull fire
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:43.640]  alarms you know that they do it and blame me and then cuss at me and threaten
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:48.120]  me and everything else they do so I want to make sure we're there for that fun
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:56.760]  before we move to the next hotel let's thank you let's go ahead and go to Terry
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:06.080]  in Arizona welcome sir hello Alex oh wow that was classic that count Dracula deal
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:12.720]  I was laughing my toe off I to it was such coincidence that you mentioned the
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:20.120]  National Guard the LA riots because I was there in 91-92 red in that area and
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:26.600]  at the end right prior to going into the into the LA it was told on the media
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:34.560]  that we had no ammo we did have ammo we have 40 rounds of peace okay because
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:39.520]  martial law has said in the whole city now I don't I don't I couldn't
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:42.920]  understand why it was reported in the media that they didn't have any ammo
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:48.080]  because that caused people to rise it up and of course martial law has set in
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:54.120]  well you would have got shot and at the end of the riots there was another thing
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:59.200]  that happened that I found very very strange and I've done my homework too
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.200]  with the IMF the World Bank you I have I did my own homework just like you have
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:09.880]  and at the end of the riots two big bus loads this was reported on the news
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:17.440]  please I didn't know about it two big bus loads of generals all over the world
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:24.600]  and I'm sure they had a lot to do with the UN and one of the generals asked why
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:34.320]  did not we come into LA with blaring okay now these are I'm sure our allies okay
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:38.200]  it would be any enemies there but I just thought that was very strange that they
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:45.160]  asked our generals that during the LA riot another thing that I want to make
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:48.360]  known to you and I don't know if you heard about it I have not heard you
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:54.560]  mentioned it on your show but the national security strategy have you heard
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:46:01.120]  of it yes they put a new one out every year well this national security
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:07.040]  strategy was written by President Barack Obama of 2010 May 10 yes so what he
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:11.040]  called I read the whole report well they say the new threat is not al-qaeda it's
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:16.040]  domestic terrorism I didn't see that right right well I totally believe what
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:19.840]  you're saying there they're paralyzing everything it's it's happening I see it
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:23.640]  there's only people that educated on it we'll see it but my point is about the

[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:46.040]  dialogue he it was a sound like a central office he I verified that it was

[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:54.560]  available he asked me if I was with a conference I said that I was with the
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:00.440]  Council of I was with the Council of America's and he said he'd never heard

[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:17.240]  Guys with headphones went they thought I was out of the hotel I was still
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:25.160]  sneaking around in there. Oh my gosh truth is so much crazier than fiction come
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:38.960]  on hello hey I would like to check in to the Westfields Marriott on the 29th of
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.480]  this month and stay through the third and I'd like a I guess it's only two
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:48.640]  three stories of like a high floor and king-sized beds in both both rooms. Oh so
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:53.160]  you need two rooms? Yes ma'am. Have a circumference or anything you're coming in
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:59.240]  for? No I just want to play golf nearby. Okay and I'm showing that the hotel is
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:09.760]  totally sold out. What? The hotel is completely filled? The hotel is. Oh you. Is it the
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:19.160]  Build-A-Bug group? I'm sorry? Is it the Build-A-Bug group coming? I don't know. How can it be
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:25.960]  completely bugged? I'm supposed to tee off with Lord Rockefeller. Well you know
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:30.560]  what you're gonna have to get a little bit more to hold with Mr. Rockefeller than
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:35.760]  I could. Well we'll be we'll be seeing how to him don't worry. Okay because what I
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:44.240]  have the closest Marriott I have is the Fairfax at Fort Fair Oaks which is six
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.960]  miles east. Hey last time I was there during Build-A-Bug the NSA had taken
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:52.320]  over all the major conference rooms they weren't using. Are they already shipping
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:57.760]  in the equipment right now? I have absolutely no idea. Alright let me ask
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:01.680]  you a really serious question. Do you believe that Osama bin Laden was really
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:07.080]  killed last year by Obama? I have absolutely no idea but they say so so. Well
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:13.360]  they say so they never lie do they? Well you never know. Well ma'am we really
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:19.200]  appreciate it. Hey can I book the 28th? Can I can I check in the day before?
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:32.280]  No. I can't oh I can't even get in the day before? No. Just double check and see. Oh
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:38.840]  they've even booked that now. Okay I can get this tool on and let's see how many
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:44.960]  nights I can get you. Oh my gosh. You can get me one night right? Is it just the
[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:54.880]  night before? Let me just double check. I've gotten I can get two nights. I can get three nights.
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:58:00.920]  But I thought it's all sold out if I get in on the 28th. Okay so what I can do is
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:08.320]  I can get three nights coming in on the 28th to the 31st. When is it closed for
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:14.080]  the conference? Are you coming in for a conference? No but you were saying that
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:20.360]  the hotel was sold out then. Well it is sold out for the five nights but I can do
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:27.040]  the 28th, the 29th and the 30th. Oh wait I thought it was closed. I thought it was
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:34.640]  closed the 29th through the 3rd. It is but I'm able to see I put it in for the
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:38.600]  five nights so all those nights were sold out that I wasn't able to get all five
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:45.640]  nights in a row. Oh okay great. Hold on one moment. Thank you for listening to GCN.
