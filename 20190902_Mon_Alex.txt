[00:30.000 --> 00:53.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, August 21, 2019, transmission.
[00:53.360 --> 01:12.360]  And all hell is continuing to break loose. We've got three of our intrepid reporters, Gregory, Savannah, Hernandez, and others on the ground right now in Hong Kong, where hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops are threatening to invade.
[01:12.360 --> 01:26.360]  They're going to be on with us coming up in about 15 minutes. Then, Carpe Dongtum, one of the top memers on the planet, goes and visits Trump at the White House. He launches memeworld.com, starts getting banned on Facebook and other platforms within hours.
[01:26.360 --> 01:41.360]  All part of election meddling, 2020, and Trump's aware of it. And speaking out against it, he needs to take action. Speaking of Carpe Dongtum, here's a nice little three and a half minute trailer that got him in so much trouble.
[01:41.360 --> 01:50.360]  I just came outside to try to process all this.
[01:50.360 --> 02:05.360]  I want you to create the best memes the world has ever seen. With your help, we are going to make America break again.
[02:20.360 --> 02:35.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[02:35.360 --> 03:01.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[03:01.360 --> 03:12.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[03:31.360 --> 03:52.360]  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not.
[03:52.360 --> 04:12.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[04:12.360 --> 04:32.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[04:32.360 --> 05:00.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[05:00.360 --> 05:14.360]  It's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube. We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[05:14.360 --> 05:30.360]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here.
[05:30.360 --> 05:59.360]  We're going to make America break again.
[06:00.360 --> 06:17.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.360 --> 06:40.360]  It's August 21, 2019 on this Wednesday edition of The Transmission. I'm here.
[06:40.360 --> 07:01.360]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for joining us today. Well, we've got a full raft of guests. We've got three of our reporters and camera crew in Hong Kong where the Chai comms have already sent in paramilitary police.
[07:01.360 --> 07:12.360]  The Chinese military is massing hundreds of thousands of troops, tanks, armored vehicles threatening to invade Hong Kong over the bridge the Chinese built in the last few years.
[07:12.360 --> 07:21.360]  They said for commerce, but now it's all known that's for the invasion. So Savannah Hernandez, Gregory's and others reporting from there.
[07:21.360 --> 07:31.360]  He was banned by Facebook two hours after he officially launched memeworld.com.
[07:31.360 --> 07:43.360]  Last time I was talking to him off air during the break, he said, hey, in a few months, we're going to launch a big meme site because the Reddit, Donald been frozen, still frozen.
[07:43.360 --> 07:57.360]  All these other meme sites are getting taken down on Facebook off Twitter. 200 million users just a few weeks ago on Twitter and on Facebook and a bunch of other platforms like Instagram got taken down in just one day or two days.
[07:57.360 --> 08:05.360]  So it's just huge the way they're just exterminating human communication if you're a Christian, if you're a conservative, if you're a nationalist.
[08:05.360 --> 08:20.360]  And it's exactly the same stuff that communist China is using against its people, not letting them share emojis of Winnie the Pooh, not letting them share emojis of the Taiwanese flag or the Hong Kong Independence Party.
[08:20.360 --> 08:40.360]  And Big Tech works hand in glove with them to carry all of that out. So the global Chinese social credit score is now here. And they're already using it to affect millions of millions of people in China. And they're out face scanning the people in Taiwan and in Hong Kong if they're at the demonstrations
[08:40.360 --> 08:50.360]  and then they're learning that they can't buy and sell on the Chinese controlled systems. So that's why we need real independence and banking real independence and computing.
[08:50.360 --> 09:07.360]  Because this police state system, this Mark of the Beast system is unfolding worldwide. And then we've got Zach Voorhees, the Google engineer, the Ed Snowden of whistleblowers as others have described him from inside Google.
[09:07.360 --> 09:23.360]  He's going to be in studio for two hours with us. And then we also have another guest joining us from the UK. And that's Jada Franson, one of the main leaders, resisting the globalist, very well spoken, lovely lady.
[09:23.360 --> 09:40.360]  She'll be joining us coming up for part of the fourth hour as well that I will be hosting because Paul Joseph Watson is getting ready to also go on another trip to report from another hot bed location.
[09:40.360 --> 09:54.360]  And I'll leave it at that. And that's going to be kicking off starting Friday. So a lot of surprises, a lot of interesting curveballs to get thrown at the globalist that are going to be coming up and they're going to be unfolding here in the next few days.
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.360]  Let me get into some of the other news.
[09:57.360 --> 10:11.360]  Remember, I had Ted Nugent on about two weeks ago, and he said, look, you need to trust President Trump. He's not going to sign expanded background checks. And Trump announced that that shelved.
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.360]  Yes, Ivanka is running around pushing it.
[10:15.360 --> 10:27.360]  She's never touched a gun. And that's all politics, hoping that that takes heat off Trump. It's the wrong thing to do. They need to come out and say it's mental illness. It's people on Prozac type drugs that caused you to do this.
[10:27.360 --> 10:38.360]  The inserts admit it. It's the fact that almost all these shooters were already telling people they were going to go kill, whether it was Parkland with the scumbag crews or this other individual up in Ohio.
[10:38.360 --> 10:47.360]  They were Antifa. They were devil worshipers. They said what they were going to do. But now the article just went live on info wars.com. We have the quotes here.
[10:47.360 --> 11:00.360]  The NRA and Trump have said that he thought maybe expanded background checks that he learned that wouldn't have helped because these people all passed background checks or it was never computerized.
[11:00.360 --> 11:10.360]  That they'd already been in a mental institution, but they'd already been adjudicated not to be able to own firearms. So Trump submit stance on wide ranging background checks and call with the NRA.
[11:10.360 --> 11:26.360]  CNN is very unhappy to have to report that that is not going forward with the unconstitutional red flag loss. So good job, folks, putting major heat on Trump so that he would not listen to the Koch brothers.
[11:26.360 --> 11:36.360]  It's a faction of Republicans that are inside his administration and are trying to undermine him. Speaking of trying to undermine.
[11:36.360 --> 11:51.360]  Scarimucci has totally completely sold out. He was probably a mole from the beginning of the establishment, but now he's trying to organize and lead the opposition to take down President Trump.
[11:51.360 --> 12:00.360]  Turns out the mooch betrays the president in America joined Clintons and the Rothschilds at Martha's Vineyard last weekend.
[12:00.360 --> 12:12.360]  So it's a Clinton scheme to cook up a way to take down the president. We're going to be getting into that as well here today.
[12:12.360 --> 12:21.360]  And then something I think is a great idea to spur the economy because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates all those times to hurt the economy.
[12:21.360 --> 12:30.360]  And the Democrats admit they're trying to kill the economy to stop the populist awakening from firmly cementing itself.
[12:30.360 --> 12:39.360]  Well, we now hear that Trump wants to cut the payroll tax a day after the White House denies it.
[12:39.360 --> 12:50.360]  And it's now confirmed that they want to cut some of the payroll tax. The average worker has matching money taken out and then employers have to put money in there.
[12:50.360 --> 12:59.360]  But then instead of the federal government on top of everything, and if you want to spur the economy, you cut part of that payroll tax.
[12:59.360 --> 13:09.360]  China has 0% taxes on corporations. Trump got our stuff from 40 to 15. Again, people say, oh, you're trying to make corporations more money.
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.360]  They wrote the laws to keep the jobs over in China to make it one-sided and screw us over.
[13:15.360 --> 13:26.360]  Look at the Washington Post's very revealing article. Z's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[13:26.360 --> 13:35.360]  Oh, Z is the savior of America if he can only defeat Trump. Wow, sick. But that's like Debo's two and a half years ago where he came and said, I'll defeat Trump.
[13:35.360 --> 13:44.360]  We'll defeat their economy. But now there's the rebranding that China's good. And now I'm going to tell you the rest of the story about the situation.
[13:44.360 --> 13:51.360]  I was talking to one of my longtime crew members. He's worked with me for 16, 17 years.
[13:51.360 --> 14:00.360]  He didn't want to say his name. He didn't want to go on air. His sister lives in Minnesota and is a big leftist.
[14:00.360 --> 14:11.360]  And his sister will not even talk to his mother. And they've always had a good relationship because she's a Trump supporter.
[14:11.360 --> 14:26.360]  And she barely talks to her brother because he's a Trump supporter. But she's withholding the children. And when this crew member saw her last, she's gotten more radicalized.
[14:26.360 --> 14:39.360]  She was saying China is the hero and will defeat the evil America and that white people are inherently bad and that white people are the problem and that white people are the enemy.
[14:39.360 --> 14:47.360]  Now, these folks are blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Norwegian, German stock, like a lot of Minnesotans are.
[14:47.360 --> 15:03.360]  And so I want that to sink in, that this is someone I've known actually 17 years, friend of mine, met his family before, and the family's being torn apart because the sister is so brainwashed.
[15:03.360 --> 15:22.360]  So brainwashed, and his dad died a few years ago, so brainwashed that she won't even let the grandchildren see the grandmother and believes that whites need to basically be gotten rid of.
[15:22.360 --> 15:40.360]  Now, I can't even put these clips together anymore because there's so many every day. But I'm going to go back and ask some of the crew to try to just get the last few weeks of seeing an MSNBC saying whites are inherently evil, whites are inherently bad, and it's going to be great once whites are gone.
[15:40.360 --> 15:52.360]  I mean, just Anderson Cooper said it last week, there's two new clips today that it's just, it is the most hitlerian ideology but inverted onto white people. The left is pure evil. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:52.360 --> 16:11.360]  And if you're new to the news, please visit us at newswars.com. The only way the articles get out is you. Please help us help yourself.
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.360]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:52.360 --> 17:10.360]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:10.360 --> 17:24.360]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:24.360 --> 17:36.360]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:36.360 --> 17:48.360]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:48.360 --> 17:59.360]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:59.360 --> 18:11.360]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead. Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is your brain on 5G.
[18:11.360 --> 18:31.360]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man. Totally changed my life. I use turbo force, bodies, album power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days. Now what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[18:31.360 --> 18:34.360]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[18:34.360 --> 18:44.360]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the Coke U10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it.
[18:44.360 --> 18:54.360]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now you can build the big strong temple with these products I take when I religiously remember to take them.
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.360]  It makes my life so much better. And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[19:00.360 --> 19:14.360]  Super male vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it. It is a award winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[19:14.360 --> 19:25.360]  It is cold pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this. It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried.
[19:25.360 --> 19:34.360]  It's taken from fresh herbs. That's why it's so strong. That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[19:34.360 --> 19:48.360]  And I'm so excited about super male vitality and carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of super male vitality at 25% off a free bottle of carnivore digestive enzyme.
[19:48.360 --> 19:59.360]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly, but it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are. Secure yours at infowarstore.com today or infowarslife.com.
[20:18.360 --> 20:29.360]  Music
[20:29.360 --> 20:38.360]  Music
[20:38.360 --> 20:47.360]  Music
[20:47.360 --> 20:56.360]  The Zuhai Macal Bridge. That's where they're going to be going tomorrow for one of the biggest bridges in the world, the Communist Chinese, so they were building it for commerce.
[20:56.360 --> 21:04.360]  But others warned the bridge that just got completed a few years ago was being built so they could invade Hong Kong and take it over.
[21:04.360 --> 21:13.360]  That's where everybody ran in 1949 when Mao Zedong took over the country and began killing tens of millions of people.
[21:13.360 --> 21:19.360]  When they were all done, over 115 million people were dead.
[21:19.360 --> 21:34.360]  We're going to put on screen for you images of that bridge so you can get an idea of all of this and that there are massing, massing hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops and armored vehicles and tanks.
[21:34.360 --> 21:42.360]  That's on the news. They've already sent in thousands of men on motorcycles to beat and attack men, women and children with metal rods with metal poles.
[21:42.360 --> 21:52.360]  This is where the real rebellion against tyranny is going on, ladies and gentlemen. This is where 70 years ago, millions and millions of people escaped.
[21:52.360 --> 21:59.360]  Hong Kong was a bustling center of commerce, but nothing like it is today and millions have demonstrated.
[21:59.360 --> 22:06.360]  Over half of the public in polls does not want to be part of Communist China. That's why they're waving American flags.
[22:06.360 --> 22:12.360]  They're going to be talking to the demonstrators as that happens over the next few days. The Chai comms can invade any day.
[22:12.360 --> 22:18.360]  They're going to be showing folks the bridge and talking to others about what is it like in a country that's about to be invaded.
[22:18.360 --> 22:26.360]  It will be much more explosive than Tiananmen Square in 1989 and Trump's being criticized by the Washington Post.
[22:26.360 --> 22:41.360]  These choice to destroy Trump or save him and weaken America. And again, leftists that I know and that others know are being told by other leftists that Communist China is our savior.
[22:41.360 --> 22:47.360]  They're the good guys in America and Trump and the Taiwanese and the Hong Kongese. They're the bad people.
[22:47.360 --> 22:56.360]  So Savannah, it's midnight out there where they're past midnight. She's there in Hong Kong. Others side of the world are the miracle of the internet.
[22:56.360 --> 23:04.360]  She talks to us now. Give us your take on what you've seen so far and what it's like to be somewhere that's already a war zone.
[23:04.360 --> 23:13.360]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on. So we've seen a lot of activity this week on here just this morning. Of course, as students we got here, we're cab driver, locals on the streets.
[23:13.360 --> 23:17.360]  They notice that we're married to me and they're really interested.
[23:17.360 --> 23:23.360]  Okay. Well, hey, Savannah, like I said, the miracle of the other side of the world. We'll talk to you guys later today. Having a technical problem there.
[23:23.360 --> 23:32.360]  Can't wait to get them back on later in the broadcast. But again, these are just live pop-ins on the show. It's the amazing HD footage they've already shot.
[23:32.360 --> 23:40.360]  The incredible interviews they've already gotten because I've seen some clips of them and the fact that they're going to go on that bridge and go right up to where that military's at.
[23:40.360 --> 23:45.360]  We all volunteered for this. So we're very, very excited that they are all there.
[23:45.360 --> 24:01.360]  And again, the massive censorship and things that we see going on over in the Middle East, in Europe, and in Communist China is all being cheered on by the corporate media here in this nation.
[24:01.360 --> 24:11.360]  Think about that and think about that invited to the White House a month ago, one of the top memers in the world, Carpe Donkton. That's his handle so he doesn't get harassed by the left.
[24:11.360 --> 24:16.360]  But they've already doxxed him and his family. They've already threatened his family. But he keeps moving forward.
[24:16.360 --> 24:28.360]  So now they have done a lot of other things like kick him off Facebook and memeworld.com, the new site he was launching, because all the meme sites are getting banned on Facebook, Twitter.
[24:28.360 --> 24:37.360]  You name it. So he's launching his own system, memeworld.com. It's already getting tweeted out about the White House, a lot of other folks.
[24:37.360 --> 24:47.360]  But will Trump act? He says Google should be sued for meddling with 2016 election. Top professors have proven that the numbers show it.
[24:47.360 --> 24:53.360]  But what about now? We're not just meddling the election. They're meddling with all the information, fixing all the different results.
[24:53.360 --> 24:58.360]  I think we've got her back now audio wise from the other side of the planet. Savannah, let's see if we got you this time.
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.360]  What's it like there being in the middle of what's already a war zone?
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.360]  Hi, Alice. Can you hear me a little bit better?
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.360]  I sure can. Welcome.
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.360]  All right. Perfect. Perfect. So as I was saying earlier, it's been really, really interesting being here.
[25:11.360 --> 25:20.360]  As soon as we got off the plane, our cab driver, a lot of locals, they know that we're American media and they're really happy that, of course, people are coming and bringing light to everything that's going on here.
[25:20.360 --> 25:27.360]  We talked to you about how this could potentially be another tenement square and a lot of people have come forward and try to tell us their stories.
[25:27.360 --> 25:34.360]  They really want us to get the word out about, mainly in China, and how they're trying to impose their role over here, how they're trying to come in here.
[25:34.360 --> 25:38.360]  Like you were talking about previously, too. We've seen the military amassing at the border.
[25:38.360 --> 25:46.360]  So we're going to be giving you coverage about that. And again, we've been hearing a lot about that on the ground here.
[25:46.360 --> 25:52.360]  Roughly one-third of the people, seven and a half million on that island, are already been demonstrating.
[25:52.360 --> 25:59.360]  Roughly half don't want to be under China's control. Imagine what it's like to be them where they're trying to pass a law where the Chinese government can arrest you.
[25:59.360 --> 26:03.360]  You can be disappeared to the mainland.
[26:03.360 --> 26:09.360]  Right. And we've already seen so many reports, Alice, of people who have been kidnapped who go missing.
[26:09.360 --> 26:16.360]  And they're found in China. China actually just came forward and said that they were holding a member of the Hong Kong consulate here.
[26:16.360 --> 26:25.360]  So we are going to be keeping up with that. And again, doing reports exclusively on those kidnappings and people that have been going missing.
[26:25.360 --> 26:43.360]  But I want you guys to be careful why you're there as well, because I've never been to Asia. And just knowing that the Communist Chinese have killed four times what Hitler did, twice what the Soviet Russians did.
[26:43.360 --> 26:55.360]  My mom and dad have gone to Germany. They've stood there at Nuremberg where Hitler stood. They said you can feel the creepy evilness. I don't think I even want to stand where Hitler stood.
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.360]  But just to be standing next to a billion, 400 million slaves, 100 plus million killed, where they sell organs, where they have animal human clones.
[27:00.360 --> 27:10.360]  I mean, you are really close to the center of hell right now. Can you feel it or what's the vibe? Because I know you're in Hong Kong and that's a more free marketplace.
[27:10.360 --> 27:20.360]  Well, definitely Alex. Like I said, more than anything, I've noticed that a lot of the people here, they're wanting these protests to be peaceful and they're very pro-democracy and pro-freedom.
[27:20.360 --> 27:27.360]  And I think we really feel that spirit from a lot of the protesters and locals here. So it is a good feeling. People are in good spirits.
[27:27.360 --> 27:34.360]  But of course, like you talked about, there is still that threat of mainland China imposing and coming in, being right there on the border.
[27:34.360 --> 27:39.360]  So that is still something that we are all very aware of.
[27:39.360 --> 27:46.360]  And I want you guys to be able to get some sleep, talk about jet lag, but also want to hear what Greg Reese has to say.
[27:46.360 --> 27:54.360]  So when we come back, I'll spend a few minutes with Greg Reese and then we're going to get Carpe Dantam on about this new memeworld.com.
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.360]  I was already on memeworld. I remember he said he was going to build it a few weeks ago and they were already building it.
[27:59.360 --> 28:05.360]  But I remembered he was coming on today because I heard he got banned. You're still on Facebook. I went and visited it.
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.360]  And it's just beautiful to see what's happening there and to know that that's banned in communist China and more and more being banned here.
[28:11.360 --> 28:17.360]  It just shows how close we are to real tyranny.
[28:17.360 --> 28:19.360]  Definitely, Alex. Definitely.
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.360]  Alright, we'll talk to Greg Reese quickly on the other side of the break and then go to Carpe Dantam.
[28:24.360 --> 28:34.360]  But if this doesn't make you angry, if this doesn't make you sick to your stomach to see communist China in the Washington Post as our savior,
[28:34.360 --> 28:40.360]  and Trump as the bad guy says, only Xi can save America.
[28:40.360 --> 28:43.360]  But he's got to destroy Donald Trump to do it.
[28:43.360 --> 28:48.360]  And now leftists are like, we love you, Xi. Crush him. He's the new Robert Mueller.
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.360]  Oh, Mueller could get him. China, Xi, get him.
[28:52.360 --> 29:07.360]  He's like, don't worry, I will, dirty Americans. Stay with us.
[29:22.360 --> 29:33.360]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:33.360 --> 30:01.360]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[31:06.360 --> 31:14.360]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[31:14.360 --> 31:22.360]  It is cold pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wildcrafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[31:22.360 --> 31:25.360]  It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried.

[31:54.360 --> 32:04.360]  Secure yours at m4store.com today or m4slife.com.
[32:25.360 --> 32:32.360]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos.
[32:32.360 --> 32:36.360]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[32:36.360 --> 32:44.360]  And we're a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[32:44.360 --> 32:50.360]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalist.
[32:50.360 --> 32:55.360]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[32:55.360 --> 33:21.360]  Look at and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[33:26.360 --> 33:30.360]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We are in a proxy war with communist China.
[33:30.360 --> 33:36.360]  China is allied with the globalists. They have openly bought up the majority of U.S. treasuries,
[33:36.360 --> 33:45.360]  the Big Six, Hollywood production houses, studios, and now the Washington Post today.
[33:45.360 --> 33:51.360]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.360]  So what that really says is China destroyed Trump to save America.
[33:55.360 --> 33:59.360]  That's what it says. That's his choice.
[33:59.360 --> 34:07.360]  Oh, our savior. Dick Dastardly's tied the young maiden down on the train track and then here comes the good guy.
[34:07.360 --> 34:15.360]  She's like, oh, Captain Fantastic, you're so wonderful, my hero, and she falls into Xi's hands.
[34:15.360 --> 34:21.360]  Who's a dictator for life. They estimate Xi's been in power.
[34:21.360 --> 34:27.360]  He's put over 20 million people in death camps. Many of them executed their organs sold.
[34:27.360 --> 34:33.360]  He's put 2 million ethnic Uyghurs, Mongolians in forced labor camps.
[34:33.360 --> 34:40.360]  That's all admitted. Oh, my gosh. But Trump, when unvetted people come across the border, he checks them.
[34:40.360 --> 34:46.360]  I don't want to keep you guys up until you get some sleep. A lot's coming up tomorrow. You're ahead of us today.
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.360]  I guess it's almost the 22nd or it is there now. But Greg Reese, a great reporter, great researcher.
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.360]  What's your first take being there now for the last 15 hours or so?
[34:56.360 --> 35:03.360]  Well, you know, I just heard what you were talking about about President Trump and the Communist Chinese coming to America's aid to help President Trump.
[35:03.360 --> 35:12.360]  That's right. To help bring down President Trump. You're right. And we met a gentleman today and we were talking about things and everything.
[35:12.360 --> 35:19.360]  And we asked him what he thought about Trump. And his first answer was, he said, well, Trump's kind of a little crazy.
[35:19.360 --> 35:28.360]  And then he smiled and kind of give us a funny grin. And then he said, but you know, sometimes when times are crazy, we need a crazy person.
[35:28.360 --> 35:35.360]  And he's the only guy who's ever held China to task. And he was very happy with Trump's attitude towards China.
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.360]  And I get the feeling that a lot of people here are too. There's a lot of unification here about that.
[35:40.360 --> 35:48.360]  Well, I've run into a lot of folks. Yes, sir, you are. We've run into a lot of folks from India and a lot of folks from Hong Kong.
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.360]  And they all just love the show because they're all sick of China pushing them around.
[35:52.360 --> 35:58.360]  And then our media saying they're bad, they stand up for themselves. You have India going into Kashmir that's always been part of India,
[35:58.360 --> 36:04.360]  that Pakistan and China are trying to take. They're finally standing up. You've got folks in Hong Kong, Taiwan saying no.
[36:04.360 --> 36:11.360]  So I can't wait to see the reports you file, Greg. They're always so powerful. What are some of the other angles you're going to be looking at while you're there?
[36:11.360 --> 36:20.360]  Well, we're going to get into a lot of what you were talking about today about the land bridge and the history and what in the past of the Tiananmen Square
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.360]  and what we're looking at here today. And also what I find very interesting is how Savannah was talking about,
[36:25.360 --> 36:31.360]  there's a great unity here right now amongst the people and there are, but they don't trust their police force anymore.
[36:31.360 --> 36:37.360]  And they used to, up until very recently, up until like maybe a month ago, they always felt their police was very fair and non-political.
[36:37.360 --> 36:45.360]  But everyone seems to be talking now that the local police are working for the Communist Chinese, working in tandem with the local criminal gangs,
[36:45.360 --> 36:53.360]  the triad gangs and everyone's talking about it, unlike in America where there seems to be a lot of love for communism.
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.360]  There's none of that here. The east is the new west and it's a beautiful thing to see.
[36:58.360 --> 37:05.360]  We also saw a gentleman from India when we were doing a shoot and he just walked up to us, he saw the camera and he just kind of introduced himself and asked what we were doing.
[37:05.360 --> 37:11.360]  And he was from India and I asked him about what's going on with Kashmir and Trump and the same thing like you were saying.
[37:11.360 --> 37:20.360]  He's very happy with what Trump's doing. He's very happy with taking the Muslims on in Kashmir and it's a global thing that's happening.
[37:20.360 --> 37:32.360]  Absolutely. The west and the east have all been pushed by Islam. Islam is only 1,400 years old and it's already taken over half the planet and hundreds of millions are dead and people are done.
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.360]  They're not going to be pushed around by the Chikoms or by the Islamists or by the left anymore.
[37:36.360 --> 37:42.360]  And there's a united front from Brazil to the United States from Greece to you name it and we're going to win.
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.360]  But you've got the big megabanks ally with China and radical Islam and it is quite a conflagration.
[37:46.360 --> 37:53.360]  Gregory's great job. You and Drew and Savannah now go get some sleep and then I can't wait to see you hit the ground running as those articles and videos.
[37:53.360 --> 38:00.360]  Get posted to news wars dot com and info wars dot com and I know Paul Watson's going to be covering a lot of what you're doing as well over at summit dot news.
[38:00.360 --> 38:01.360]  Thank you, Greg.
[38:01.360 --> 38:03.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[38:03.360 --> 38:09.360]  Now, in a moment, we're going to go to Carpe Duncan, one of the top meme makers in the world.
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.360]  Just recently having long meetings with President Trump at the White House when Trump warned big tech to stop censoring.
[38:15.360 --> 38:22.360]  Well, he's launched meme world dot com because on Facebook and Twitter and on Instagram, hundreds of millions of accounts.
[38:22.360 --> 38:29.360]  Yes, of meme sites and meme followers have been purged so that we can't communicate with this new modern form of communication.
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.360]  Beyond the emoji, it is the meme. It is art.
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.360]  And so he went up on Facebook with meme world dot com and within two hours, they had banned it.
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.360]  And so it reminded me, let me go see what's on meme world dot com.
[38:42.360 --> 38:48.360]  I literally hadn't looked at it since he told me he was building it a few months ago, but did not say anything that he wanted to talk about on the air.
[38:48.360 --> 38:49.360]  You know, once he launched it.
[38:49.360 --> 38:55.360]  And then boom, before I even remembered it was being launched, it's being censored, but you can find it at meme world dot com.
[38:55.360 --> 39:01.360]  Now, he's gotten together a collection of the best members. You can't say who the best is, but he's right up there.
[39:01.360 --> 39:02.360]  But something wicked.
[39:02.360 --> 39:06.360]  Another fellow Texan. I can't wait to meet him. I know he talks to two all the time.
[39:06.360 --> 39:34.360]  He put together this latest video, Trump 2020 ad, Ford commercial parody. Here it is.
[39:34.360 --> 39:37.360]  Well, the eagle has landed.
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.360]  Say hello to President Donald J. Trump. He ain't just making America great again.
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.360]  Trump's doing things no president has ever done before.
[39:45.360 --> 39:53.360]  He's keeping promises, hacking courts, defending the border, rebuilding our military and making Chuck Schumer cry like a schoolgirl with two skin knees.
[39:53.360 --> 39:57.360]  This president is six foot three inches of let's put America first.
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.360]  And oh yeah, immigration, jobs, drug prices. Nobody's got better numbers.
[40:02.360 --> 40:06.360]  The game has changed and the Democrats are officially crazy.
[40:06.360 --> 40:13.360]  So keep America great. Stand with Trump in 2020.
[40:13.360 --> 40:16.360]  Now we're going to break here in a few minutes, but wow.
[40:16.360 --> 40:23.360]  Carpe dunked him before I could even remember that you were planning to launch this when you just got out of the White House.
[40:23.360 --> 40:28.360]  We were talking on the phone off air before I even remembered you were launched this before I even knew it had been launched.
[40:28.360 --> 40:32.360]  It was already banned on Facebook. Congratulations.
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.360]  Thank you. Yeah, I don't know that it even took two hours.
[40:36.360 --> 40:44.360]  I was seeing messages almost immediately like within 10 minutes of it going up that it was banned on Facebook.
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.360]  So I don't know if they were preemptively banning it or what's going on.
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.360]  But as far as I know, you still can't share it in Messenger and you still can't share it on Facebook.
[40:53.360 --> 40:58.360]  Oh, they're not even letting you share it in the Messenger privately. So already they've gone China level.
[40:58.360 --> 41:08.360]  Wow. Yeah, somebody sent me a screenshot of they had put spaces between like the M, the E, the M, the E.
[41:08.360 --> 41:15.360]  They put spaces between everything and it still wouldn't let them share it in Messenger. So it's pretty insane.
[41:15.360 --> 41:18.360]  Well, you know, you're over the target when you're getting heat like that.
[41:18.360 --> 41:23.360]  I mean, when we launch new sites, they don't get banned that quick, but I know they fear you and the site looks great.
[41:23.360 --> 41:27.360]  And they fear this collection of memers you've gotten together.
[41:27.360 --> 41:36.360]  Apparently they're worried about people being able to share memes and they've already banned them on Facebook for the most part.
[41:36.360 --> 41:44.360]  A few get by the sensors every once in a while, but memes are they're definitely under attack on Facebook.
[41:44.360 --> 41:50.360]  They haven't gone full crazy on Twitter yet, but they're they're getting there.
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.360]  How long ago was it you were in the White House? Because I mean, Trump says he's going to take action.
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.360]  I keep believing he is. But we haven't seen it yet.
[41:58.360 --> 42:05.360]  I was there on July 3rd and July 11th. So it's a little more than a month ago.
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.360]  The summit was the 11th and I'm not sure when he's going to start taking action.
[42:11.360 --> 42:20.360]  I'm not sure what action he can take as long as Congress remains unwilling to do anything about it as well.
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.360]  Well, I know a bunch of heavy hitters are already tweeting memeworld.com.
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.360]  Did that happen after it was banned on Facebook? Because maybe that's what alerted the establishment.
[42:28.360 --> 42:33.360]  Because I mean, they're even banning Mitch McConnell being able to respond to people at his house.
[42:33.360 --> 42:40.360]  And I've got articles here now. Did you hear? In fact, we'll cover when we come back where Trump put out a thing about strong women.
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.360]  And they said saying the word woman is hurtful, so they banned the ad.
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.360]  It's very hurtful. I have to agree. Very hurtful.
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.360]  We're not a cult or anything. People aren't scared or anything.
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.360]  I'm trying to rip off Tucker Carlson. I think these people are nuts.
[42:57.360 --> 43:13.360]  It's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[43:13.360 --> 43:21.360]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the sensors are unable to block the signal.
[43:21.360 --> 43:32.360]  And it's now here. Band.video. Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals

[47:24.360 --> 47:39.360]  Here's the latest Carpe Donsom trailer from MemeWorld.com. We're going to play the whole thing.
[47:39.360 --> 47:48.360]  We played it at the start, but here's just a flavor of it. It's very well done.
[47:48.360 --> 47:54.360]  I just came outside to try to process all this.
[47:54.360 --> 48:19.360]  To create the best memes the world has ever seen. With your help, we are going to make America great again.
[48:19.360 --> 48:42.360]  And the best part is when Hillary and all the other Democrat candidates for president, the female ones, are cheerleaders.
[48:42.360 --> 48:51.360]  More of that coming up in a moment. It's good for radio, but really need to see it.
[48:51.360 --> 48:57.360]  So tell us about the plans for MemeWorld.com. It's got the establishment so scared.
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.360]  We still have websites. We're outside the electronic gulag that Matt Dredge warned us of.
[49:02.360 --> 49:12.360]  We'll obviously go into cyberspace and tell people a word of mouth about it, but the fact that Facebook isn't letting you instant message it.
[49:12.360 --> 49:23.360]  CNN just two months ago said, well, Joe's has been banned completely from Facebook and from Instagram saying his name or saying Infowars.com in a positive light.
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.360]  But how do we stop them from using instant messages like WhatsApp?
[49:28.360 --> 49:35.360]  So that's the new frontier. Imagine if you told somebody two years ago, oh, big tech that buys up instant message companies.
[49:35.360 --> 49:43.360]  They won't let you say somebody's name or send them a news URL because they got AI watching you when they admitted last week.
[49:43.360 --> 49:48.360]  Real people are watching in live time as well and coming in and watching what you do.
[49:48.360 --> 49:51.360]  I mean, there's the whole spying element as well.
[49:51.360 --> 50:07.360]  Right. I think that's what they promised that they wouldn't do when they bottled this stuff. But I'm going to alert you to something new is I can't share the MemeWorld link on Twitter either.
[50:07.360 --> 50:13.360]  Unless I remove the little preview, it won't let me share a link to MemeWorld.
[50:13.360 --> 50:25.360]  You can only share just the MemeWorld.com. But if you try to have it have the preview, which a lot of people use to click on, it won't let you share it.
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.360]  It'll just send it to your drafts and won't let you send the message. That's on Twitter now.
[50:28.360 --> 50:32.360]  So I thought that was just a bug last night, but it's still going on.
[50:32.360 --> 50:41.360]  Well, think about this. The EU says that they passed laws to try to regulate and tax and ban free flow of memes.
[50:41.360 --> 50:49.360]  And we know that big tech is working in consultation and coordination to ban and censor certain things.
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.360]  So out of the gates, my friend, you meet with the president. He likes to tweet your memes.
[50:54.360 --> 51:00.360]  You try to get a consortium of people together where at least you have your own site to post.
[51:00.360 --> 51:06.360]  Because what really triggered you in the last few months to start building this?
[51:06.360 --> 51:12.360]  I mean, I remember that conversation. Was it the fact that the Donald had just been frozen and you weren't sure it would ever be unfrozen?
[51:12.360 --> 51:22.360]  Well, it was it was multiple reasons. But yeah, the Donald was they were quarantined and they're still they remain quarantined now.
[51:22.360 --> 51:34.360]  They were quarantined and that basically means that no one can get to the site unless you type in the exact URL, you can't get to that community.
[51:34.360 --> 51:40.360]  And that was one reason. And the other reason is just that we're continuing to see censorship ramp up.
[51:40.360 --> 51:50.360]  And when I look towards 2020, I am imagining social media only tightening down more than they already have.
[51:50.360 --> 52:03.360]  And my goal was to create a website where meme creators like myself would have a place to post their their videos, their images and things like that.
[52:03.360 --> 52:14.360]  Even if social media takes them down, I mean, if YouTube blocks them, they could go to Bitshoot or another provider and still share the links.
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.360]  And those links would then be shared on social media as well.
[52:18.360 --> 52:25.360]  So I wanted to create a place where silence people could still post their content.
[52:25.360 --> 52:34.360]  And boy, I couldn't have been a day later. I mean, they are moving against everybody hundreds of millions of followers, as you know, on Instagram and Twitter.
[52:34.360 --> 52:45.360]  A month ago, just deleted from not being able to follow those sites. Some of them had 43 million followers, 36 million followers, all together over 200 million followers just gone.
[52:45.360 --> 52:52.360]  And they're even destroying mainline meme sites that have any type of pro America stuff. I mean, this is Scorched Earth.
[52:52.360 --> 53:06.360]  Well, and, you know, what is what is so ironic is that, you know, Snopes, Snopes is used by social media as a, you know, trusted source.
[53:06.360 --> 53:16.360]  And just this week, they spent like two days debunking Babylon B satire site content.
[53:16.360 --> 53:27.360]  So if you have, if you have a site like that that is a trusted source for social media and they decide what can and can't be on social media.
[53:27.360 --> 53:36.360]  It's just a matter of time before they start fact checking memes. I mean, CNN and MSNBC and all of those have already fact checked my videos before that.
[53:36.360 --> 53:40.360]  No, Joe Biden didn't actually grope himself in a video.
[53:40.360 --> 53:52.360]  But I mean, that's, that's where we're going. We're going to a place where if you post a meme, it's now fake news, you're trying to, you're trying to mislead.
[53:52.360 --> 53:59.360]  Oh, yes, Snopes is starting to fact check mainline comedians. And the comedians come out and say, how do you fact check a joke?
[53:59.360 --> 54:05.360]  I mean, they're at war with reality. I mentioned this and it's here in my stack to put it back on screen.
[54:05.360 --> 54:11.360]  Did you see where they just banned the Republican National Committee's ad because it said we're looking for strong women?
[54:11.360 --> 54:19.360]  And they said, well, someone that got that might not be a woman and hearing the word woman might trigger them. This is a war on language by design.
[54:19.360 --> 54:28.360]  That might be the most insane thing I've ever heard that someone might not be a woman. And so they might be offended.
[54:28.360 --> 54:35.360]  If, if you're that person that's offended by hearing the word woman, I don't know where to even begin with you.
[54:35.360 --> 54:40.360]  Well, I remember seeing this five years ago and now it's taught in schools everywhere. They put it on the entrance forms.
[54:40.360 --> 54:46.360]  Do not say you're a mother or father on the entrance exam because someone might not have a mother and father.
[54:46.360 --> 54:52.360]  And so that's misgendering. So if you send someone an image saying, we're looking for strong women, let's put that back on screen.
[54:52.360 --> 55:02.360]  This is banned by Facebook. Facebook stands by it. The women for Trump coalition needs the support of strong women like you.
[55:02.360 --> 55:12.360]  Add your name. So if women want to give their email to Trump and then this women's coalition and he's got this big, you know, agenda to put women in executive positions.
[55:12.360 --> 55:19.360]  If you want to be part of that, this is hateful. And that's not kosher either. I mean, if Trump doesn't act now, will he ever act?
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.360]  He says he's getting ready to. He's got to act now.
[55:22.360 --> 55:33.360]  You know, it would be, it would be a shame if someone were to go back and clip out all the times that Democrats said, we need strong women to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[55:33.360 --> 55:35.360]  That would be a total shame to anything.
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.360]  I'm imagining someone's going to do that.
[55:38.360 --> 55:41.360]  That might happen. I don't know. We'll see.
[55:41.360 --> 55:49.360]  You can even have like the place bond or pong pieces like strong woman, strong woman, strong woman. And then meanwhile show this.
[55:49.360 --> 55:56.360]  No, the truth is anything effective, real communication is being jammed with political correctness and it's gone to the next level.
[55:56.360 --> 56:01.360]  Well, tell us more about memeworld.com. How do people become a part of it? Or how does it work?
[56:01.360 --> 56:08.360]  Well, right now I've just got kind of the core of people that are, you know, have been friends of mine for a long time.
[56:08.360 --> 56:18.360]  But I'm looking to add as many creators as I can. I'm obviously looking for quality content and people that are going to produce on a regular basis.
[56:18.360 --> 56:26.360]  But really, I'm looking for anybody. You could be somebody that's unknown. You could be somebody that's well known.
[56:26.360 --> 56:31.360]  All you have to do is contact me. You can contact me at Carpe Donkton on Twitter.
[56:31.360 --> 56:38.360]  Or if you'd like to email me, you can email me at CarpeDonkton at memeworld.com.
[56:38.360 --> 56:46.360]  We'll be adding people, like the trailer video said, we'll be adding people weekly, monthly, daily, hourly, secondly.
[56:46.360 --> 56:53.360]  Whenever we get people that have quality content that want to post on the site, then we'll add them on.
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.360]  Right now there is discussion. You can talk in the comments and things like that.
[56:58.360 --> 57:02.360]  But it's not open for just anyone to post.
[57:02.360 --> 57:08.360]  And that's for obvious reasons, because they're going to send in Southern Harvey Law Center people posing as I say, Hal Hitler.
[57:08.360 --> 57:17.360]  Yeah, I'm going to try to avoid having just random trolls posting Hitler and, you know, Nazi salutes and all that kind of stuff.
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.360]  Well, you know what it'll be. They'll have an Antifa guy, you know, go in there and say something before he goes and shoots up a school.
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.360]  I mean, we know all their tricks.
[57:24.360 --> 57:32.360]  And that would be the first thing that they would do would be try to try to make it look like I'm trying to promote that stuff, which I obviously am not.
[57:32.360 --> 57:39.360]  Well, I'm really excited to do five more minutes with my friend. CarpeDonkton is his handle, secret agent of America.
[57:39.360 --> 57:45.360]  And there's a lot going on, ladies and gentlemen. It's going to be emerging very soon as well.
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.360]  But obviously the eye of Soran is watching closely.
[57:48.360 --> 57:57.360]  In InfoWars Live, we always try to bring you game changing products. Now, we've already been promoting and selling super silver wound gel for over a year.
[57:57.360 --> 58:03.360]  It's a best seller. It is the best you can get a 100% review rate on power reviews.
[58:03.360 --> 58:08.360]  Well, now we teamed up with them and came out with two different types of skin cream.
[58:08.360 --> 58:12.360]  One is naturally set up with grapefruit essential oils. The other is unscented.
[58:12.360 --> 58:18.360]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[58:18.360 --> 58:26.360]  It's got coconut oil and so much more. And this patented nano type of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[58:26.360 --> 58:32.360]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for your skin.
[58:32.360 --> 58:38.360]  If you're a woman, man, if you were a child, we are so excited about the new super silver skin cream.
[58:38.360 --> 58:44.360]  We have it in the smaller tube and the large tube. It's very, very affordable and it funds our operations.
[58:44.360 --> 59:09.360]  Check it out today and get yours at infowarslife.com.
[59:09.360 --> 59:14.360]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video.
[59:14.360 --> 59:21.360]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos.
[59:21.360 --> 59:32.360]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[59:32.360 --> 59:39.360]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globlest.
[59:39.360 --> 59:44.360]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[59:44.360 --> 01:00:06.360]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:19.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.360]  You know, I never studied psychology in depth. When I was first starting my broadcast off, I just innately loved Americana.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.360]  I was born and bred in it. And going to college and stuff, I saw how anti-American it was.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.360]  Now, anti-white it was trying to create race war that I had to get politically involved.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.360]  But I've got all these hundreds of news stories, literally hundreds of news stories, incredible guests.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:47.360]  But I can't get over the Republican National Committee on ads saying, we're forming a coalition of strong women.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.360]  And Trump's actually creating conduits into corporations to put women in charge of major things.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.360]  Except the Democrats talk about it, don't ever do. And the Democrats say, you're not allowed to put that out at misgendered.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.360]  Someone might have seen the word woman who wasn't a woman and that's like an in-word.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.360]  That's beyond 1984. That's beyond anything I've ever heard of.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360]  So I've got a thousand topics there to cover.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.360]  But this, next, they're going to say the color pink, that belongs to Democrats.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.360]  So you just said at Carpe Donkton, they've got to lose.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:27.360]  They've got to be stood up to because these people really are the closest thing to Mao Zedong or Hitler I've ever seen.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.360]  I mean, this is next level with Facebook and Twitter and all them are doing.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  And I know Trump's letting them go on for a long time so that when we finally drop the hammer on them, it's very obvious to everybody.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.360]  But I don't think we can wait that long. And I think a lot of folks are scared of big tech and are rolling over to it.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.360]  I mean, I think this is one of Trump's biggest failures and I'll go further than that.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.360]  He did come out and say, OK, we're not going to do the expanded background checks now.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360]  I was wrong. Wouldn't have helped anybody.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.360]  Well, he was playing politics there. I know the inside baseball.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.360]  I've talked to people that have been in the meetings with him where he tells them, don't worry.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.360]  I'm going to do it at first. That'll take the heat off.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.360]  And then we'll do nothing because we know it won't work.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  And he did it again. And I told people, people thought, Alex, you're letting him get the guns.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.360]  And I said, no, no, no, he's playing them. But still, it's a dangerous game.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:29.360]  It is. And I really think that as much as I support him and as much as I like to make videos about him,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:37.360]  I do think that it's very important for him to get on this issue and make a very strong stand on it
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:44.360]  because I don't think that he is going to be able to do what he needs to do for 2020.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:51.360]  If everyone's hands are tied behind their backs, all of the people that are trying to support him,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:58.360]  obviously, you know just how many people have been already removed from the platform, yourself included.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:09.360]  And they're only going to continue to add to that list meme creators and more personalities.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:16.360]  The large social media followings of these people are already being cut down.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:23.360]  Something that doesn't get talked about enough, I think, is all of the mid-level accounts that get scrubbed,
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  the 5,000 to 20,000 follower accounts that just disappear on a daily basis.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  Those are the ones that actually spread the message.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:41.360]  You have these very large creators and they spread messages, but it's all built off the backs of these mid-level accounts
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:48.360]  that are so frequently retweeting and reading the content of these big guys.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:56.360]  And that is how they are really destroying the message is to attack the people that are actually the message carriers.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.360]  That's right. And let's go further. We take the great things Trump says and the great things that happen
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:07.360]  and we take the Democrats lying and cheating and flip-flopping and we put it together to show people in a very compelling way.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.360]  And they can't beat us. The big corporate guys can't beat us. They're getting paid $10 million for an ad.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.360]  You're just putting together, you know, while you take care of your baby and your wife's at work.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.360]  They don't know how to counter that, so they just don't want to put your race car on the racetrack because you keep beating it.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:27.360]  And Trump's like, well, I can still blast through all this. No, they're bullying Trump supporters everywhere.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  People need to go out and see the memes and meet other people online and know that we're not alone,
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.360]  that we're giving aid and comfort to Trump supporters. The globalists see that as treason.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.360]  I want to come back and do five more minutes with you after this quick break with Carpe Donkton.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  He just launched memeworld.com. I guess the last week or so, it's already banned on Facebook, but you can share it.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:05:16.360]  For now, I guess on instant message or via word of mouth, memeworld.com. Memeworld.com. Memeworld.com.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.360]  Clean out your guts in a healthy way.

[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:19.360]  You are listening to an MFullWars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:29.360]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live. I'm Alex Jones, your host. But don't forget, David Knight.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:36.360]  The David Knight show is hard-hitting, focused, incredibly researched, cerebral, but also very fast-moving, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  Then Owen Schreuer and the War Room is fast-paced, hard-hitting, pure Americana.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:53.360]  And I will announce in the next five or six days two new shows launching that we'll be carrying.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.360]  So get ready for that and so much more.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:05.360]  Now, I've got Carpe Doctor here with me, one of the top meme makers in the world, just met with the president extensively on a lot of important things.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.360]  We have Mitch McConnell with people at his house saying, we're going to stab you, we're going to kill you.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.360]  He puts out on his official campaign site, this is wrong and the Democrats would decry this.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:22.360]  Facebook and Twitter leave it up and freeze his accounts and stand by it.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.360]  Stand by it.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.360]  Now, again, I've got hundreds of articles here, but I'm going to go back to this and I'm going to ask listeners and viewers.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:49.360]  How angry does it make you that the Republican National Committee put out an ad saying the woman for Trump coalition needs the support of strong women like you add your name?
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:55.360]  And all it is is a bunch of happy women cheering.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:01.360]  And they said you have misgendered. You are not allowed to do that.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:07.360]  This is on info wars.com Facebook bans Trump ad for assuming gender identity.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.360]  Even though it turns out the ad actually targeted women.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.360]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360]  Targeted female accounts.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.360]  The ad was bought fair and square, but just saying that oh, you're a woman.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:26.360]  California passed a law that if you misgender somebody, you can go to jail.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.360]  Or what is it, two weeks?
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  $1,000 fine, but let's pull back here.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  Let's pull back here.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.360]  You think, oh, okay, that's cute. Let's just play along with some guy with an axe comes in and attacks people.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:44.360]  Other people get life in prison. He gets six years because somebody might have misgendered him.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:51.360]  Think about how they're attacking the alphabet. They're attacking language saying, oh, you can't hit a list of women on Facebook.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  Because maybe somebody's going to be offended that they saw an ad for a woman.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:01.360]  That's like opening the newspaper and you see an ad for women's bras.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.360]  You know, when I was like six years old, I was like, I don't know what it is, but I like it.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:16.360]  You know, the National Geographics. The point is, oh my gosh, I'm offended. I saw a woman's ad for, say, women's tennis shoes.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.360]  But that's how mentally ill the left is, but it's by design.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360]  They're projecting this on everybody.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:29.360]  Where anything they want, they can then see the racism of the sexism and then they can selectively take it down.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.360]  If Hillary wants to make black jokes and say blacks all look alike, everybody giggles because she's anointed.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  If you do, you lose your job, which I don't think blacks will look alike.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:46.360]  The point is, it doesn't matter. Some black guys look alike, some white guys look alike. It doesn't matter.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:53.360]  The point is, is that this is projecting all of this to sabotage culture and they want full control of culture.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.360]  And so Carpe Donkton has reached conservatively with just one of his videos, 100 billion people.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  He's probably reached a billion people, a lot of them over and over again, but a billion or more.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.360]  I mean, I know when they banned us on YouTube, on our own five channels, we had five billion views.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.360]  So that's five billion times people watched our information.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  And it's up there in the data banks, even though we've been purged up those platforms.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:25.360]  But the magnitude now of in 1999, you'd never imagine this, even in a science fiction book about a dystopia,
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.360]  you'd say, oh, they'll never have a dystopia where you can't send out an email or a text message or something saying strong women.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  Because someone might have seen it. Someone might have been hurt. This is such next level.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.360]  And we're just here taking it like it's, oh, that's just the next level. And that's how tyranny works.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:50.360]  They incrementally get you to take more and more and more of the poison until you just finally have succumbed to the insanity.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.360]  So there's a total method of this madness. What do you say, Carpe Donkton?
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  Well, what I was going to say was, isn't it 1984 that says the revolution will be over when the language is perfect?
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.360]  And isn't that just exactly what the left tries to do?
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  They try to police language and make the wrong thing go away so that they can create this society where no one is offended.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:29.360]  And when they do that, they also remove all meaning from everything. That being said, I do have, before we run out of time,
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:42.360]  I have some homework for you. If you would like to join in the meme war, I need you to go in front of a green screen for about five minutes
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:51.360]  and do some spin arounds and do some stuff like that and do a bunch of things like that and then send me the video
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.360]  so that I can just easily put that into lots of clips.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.360]  Oh, like the famous fidget spinner thing?
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.360]  Yeah, well, just anything. Just be Alex Jones for five minutes.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  Five minutes of Alex Jones in front of a green screen would be a meme makers dream.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  Listen, you write it up. You've got my phone number. Text me my orders, a great one.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  And whatever you want, you will have a post-hace. But let me expand on that.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  You're right about 1984. George Arwell was a lead propagandist in the Office of Strategic Plans or Strategic Services.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:38.360]  And he wrote in 1984. I know he wrote essays before he died. He died here after the book was published.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.360]  That he was both O'Brien and Winston because he'd done both things.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  I mean, he's an incredible guy. He was an imperial secret police in India, tortured, killed people, everything.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:55.360]  He then fought for the communists against Hitler in the Spanish Civil War. He was a major propagandist.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.360]  And then he learned the communists were just as bad as the fascists and just wanted to dominate people and were just a satanic cult.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.360]  So that book is really a confession of where England was going at the end of the family, all of this.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:16.360]  And they said they wanted to finally reduce language down to grunts so that no one could ever communicate and understand complexities that up and down and down is up and that they were being lied to.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:25.360]  And so, yes. So you wonder, why is it like 1984? Hillary said her favorite book is 1984 because for her it's an instruction manual.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:38.360]  Right. Exactly. And what our media and what the left wants to do right now is to remove all context from anything.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  There's tons and tons of nuance to everything that someone on the left does and there's absolutely no allowance for nuance on the right.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  Take you, for example, anything that you say can only be interpreted in a negative way to the most extreme.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:14.360]  And the way that they do that is just they combine words, they conflate ideas, they put one group of people into this giant category and then lump all of these evils and wrongs into that category.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:22.360]  So that every time that you speak, no one has to even listen to you because they know what you are.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  They've been pre-programmed with stereotypes and knee-jerk reactions. I told the story earlier, you probably weren't listening.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:41.360]  But one of my great crew members, 17 years here, his sister will not let his mother see the grandchildren because she's a Trump supporter and says whites need to be gotten, whites are bad and China is good and going to defeat America.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  So liberals now think America's bad, China's good.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  That's the only thing that you could describe that is insane.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:15:03.360]  And you know, I've experienced that myself, maybe not to that extent, but I do have family members that are not very happy with me and haven't been happy with me since 2016.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:13.360]  I'm not sure what happened in 2016, but something happened. But that's the world that they've created.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  And I find it very funny that when you try to call out someone on the left for doing the exact thing that they are against, that they just throw it right back at you and they won't even listen.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:38.360]  Oh yeah, there's a death logic because they've decided they're the anointed ones, they've decided they're the elite and they've decided you're bad and so it's like smiting a Nigerian scam.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:46.360]  Once they get taken for the first amount of money, they stay in the scam like gamblers thinking, no, it's going to pay off and you tell your family, hey, it's a scam.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:53.360]  They'll hate you after they get scammed three or four times and will never believe that the Nigerian prince ripped them off.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.360]  There is no Nigerian prince. Hey, Carpe Dongton, we love you.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:08.360]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:18:52.360 --> 01:19:12.360]  So please check it out. The new products at infostore.com. 25% off as an introductory. It's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube. We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and were credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:22.360]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:20:10.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:38.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:21:04.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:33.360]  Authoritarianism is not just a word. It's a system of slavery. And we are facing biblical level mark of the beast, total surveillance, total control by nightmare control freaks obsessed with hurting children, obsessed with destroying families, obsessed with undermining culture and civilization itself as if they work for some off world alien spirit that is sworn to destroy human life.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:49.360]  And then you read the Bible and you say they either predicted all of this because they were warned by another off world entity, God.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:57.360]  Or they wrote all this as a self fulfilling prophecy to actually build it. But then who told them to build this.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:16.360]  Think about the mysteries of the universe ladies and gentlemen. Now I was a little late getting in here. I apologize during that break. I run around like a chicken with my head cut off because we have joining us in studio Zach Voorhees, who's a very well spoken, very focused,
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:34.360]  accomplished Google engineer. And we've had other big whistleblowers on they say no this guy is the Ed Snowden leak. This is the mother load. In fact I had my big giant stack of the data dump, not all 2000 pages but about 1000 pages in a folder last week.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:50.360]  You guys bring that into me thanks. And he's going to be with us for the next two plus hours as long as he wants to be here. If he wants to stay to the end I'm hosting the fourth hour so that'll be two hours and 40 minutes roughly.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:23:06.360]  And so he's waiting right out there he's coming in here. And so after he gets his chance to spill his guts with what he wants to talk about. We're going to do something I love because I've learned with the callers when we are on a specific issue.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:22.360]  We get amazing calls so they're going to be on big tech censorship is going to be on Google and it's going to be on any questions you've got how to stop it but it's not going to be on China. It's not going to be on the US economy. It's going to be on our ability to communicate in the 21st century.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:36.360]  And this technocracy that's swallowing up our lives so we're going to open the phones up next hour specifically for you to ask your questions and I really appreciate them coming here and having this courage.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:52.360]  So this is what InfoWars is all about. Now I'm going to stop right there. dredgerport.com is linked to this article on the left hand side. Epstein's cellmates told there will be price to pay if he talks bags to be transferred to another jail.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  The jail guards that were last with Epstein won't talk to the feds either. X cop Nicholas Tartaglioni basically says they're about to kill him.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:23.360]  This whole thing is so out of the open, so brazen, so crazy that stories on the left hand side of dredgerport.com. And then there's this headline from Medium.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:37.360]  We're posting it on infowars.com written by Zach Voorhees and I can't even think of the headline that's powerful enough. He's going to show you and he does it in this article how Google fixes the Clinton death count and other results.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:55.360]  Let me tell you something. Most of the time I try to search an InfoWars or a Breitbart or a Daily Caller or a Gateway Pundit headline. It isn't even available. I mean exact searches aren't available.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:05.360]  And they go up to Congress and go, oh, we're not blocking anything. They're taking control of the whole world's information system. Now there's a paradox here.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:19.360]  The more important and powerful the broadcast and the more larger the audience is, the less I plug. And everybody knows and talk radio. You're able to find yourself with the plugs that you have during live show.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.360]  And so our biggest problem around here funding things is me.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:33.360]  But I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that you've seen the ringer they put us through the persecution, the attacks, all of it. And because of you were still here on air and we're attempting to expand.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:45.360]  And it's easy. I just haven't got paid this year and I'm spending money I save and that's okay because I'm going to run this thing all the way into the ground.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:54.360]  It'll take a couple years to do it. I'd rather not do that. But I'm not if you're telling you that just as some little statement. You've seen what they've done.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  We need to be in place in 2020. And we need to be here to fight back. But folks need to realize your word of mouth spread the word is what overrides them.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:13.360]  That's why they now want to control instant messages and emails. And don't want you to be able to tell people about Alex Jones or info wars or Trump recruiting women to the campaign.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:19.360]  That's not allowed either. You see, it's going to be everything. It's outrageous. So it's really everybody's duty.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  Just spread the word about news wars.com and info wars.com and meme world.com and anything they're trying to ban.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:34.360]  Because they're really scared of Carpe Dongton and to realize that it's so easy when you go sign up for auto ship, you can cancel for free anytime one click.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  You get 10% off additionally for the coffee, for the toothpaste, for the fish oil, for the turbo force, for the protein bars, for the things that you're going to want to reorder
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:56.360]  and lock in that discount. That way you don't forget. And every 15 days, every month, every two months, every three months, up to every nine months is how far out auto ship goes.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:04.360]  Even stuff that sells out from time to time, when you go on auto ship, it gets saved in the warehouse. So it never runs out.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  Now, if I make the decision the next six months or so, maybe even sooner, whether I'm just going to sell out of all the inventory and have plenty of money to run for another year or so,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  at full power, and maybe even expand, like kind of burn out like a supernova, or whether I'm going to keep taking the money to order more product.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  And I mean, I'm right on the line right now, like, it's, it's, it's, it's, we can really just like turn on our afterburners, go in, attack the Death Star, no, we're not going to make it out.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  Or we can hopefully get in, get more fuel, attack Death Star, blow it up and still get away. But whatever, we're going in on the attack run.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  Okay. I'm going to use that allegory. Are you kidding? I'm foaming at the mouth to get this done. So I had a big old, you know what, for the new order.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  Raging, you know what, it ain't a nice one either. I want to get my hands around their neck. And I've already tasted so much of their blood, man.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  I mean, I'm in a shark frenzy right now. So don't feel sorry for me. I'm not a victim. My God, I'm blessed.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:07.360]  But I want you to support us. So when my political fist smashes into their teeth, I just drive all the way right through them. You understand?
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:15.360]  And it's literally like the allegory. I'm not saying I'm a God. I'm not even, it's an allegory. When you stop believing in the Greek gods, they die.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.360]  They go away. They fade away. Well, that's an allegory for life. When you believe in an idea, when you believe in something that gives it power, gives yourself power.
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:31.360]  When you give up, you have nothing. So America's not perfect, but I love the flag and I love America and it's been great compared to other places.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:38.360]  And so we need to believe in it and love it. It's the same thing for InfoWars. So World Awakens mega sale, 50, 60% off of all the top selling products.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.360]  This super sale has to end. There's a lot of the stuff selling out. We've already had to cut back to sale. Ultimate Creole Oil, Brain Force Plus,

[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  Let's go.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:06.360]  Hope, hate. You're hoping for hate? Is that what this means? What does it mean?
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  Why not? Don't you want to get your message out?
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:15.360]  Yeah, that's what we're all here. We're all here peacefully. What is your message then?
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:22.360]  Silent peaceful protest. What are you protesting?
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.360]  Okay. Where's the hate?
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:31.360]  I brought hate to your city, so you're calling me hateful. How am I hateful?
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.360]  I mean, you're protesting. I want to know how I'm hateful.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  I mean, you're saying a lot by holding your signs here, so I just want to make sure I understand.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.360]  You're saying that you're going against hate. You have this shirt on that says resist.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:50.360]  What exactly are you resisting? Because we love this country. We love America. Everyone should have their freedoms.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.360]  You were born in Africa. Do you hate this country? Do you hate this country?
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  Then why don't you go back? Then why don't you go back?
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:05.360]  If you don't represent this country, you don't like this country, you can go back.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.360]  If you don't like this country, you can go back. No one's keeping you here. No one can keep you here.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:21.360]  In Africa you represent America, then why don't you go back in? Why don't you go back? What's keeping you here?
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  What's keeping you here? What's keeping you here? What is keeping you here?
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.360]  What's keeping you here? Your people here. People like me, you don't even know the history.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  There it is. You don't know the history. You don't know the history. You don't know the history.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:47.360]  Do you hear yourself? You don't even hear yourself. One question. One question. One question. One question.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:37:04.360]  During slavery. Who on the homes for the underground railroad? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We'll get to that. Answer my question. Answer my question.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  See, he won't even answer it. It's a simple question. Who on the homes for the underground railroad?
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.760]  the civil war who owned the deeds to the houses for the underground railroad it
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.160]  was white people
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.280]  see when you think about it when you think about it then you'll know
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.720]  I see kids out here playing this and I see other people
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.560]  what about what about them over there what about them over there and T for
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:43.120]  seriously will you denounce antifa what will you denounce antifa
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.440]  there it is there it is there it is there it is
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.640]  do you think it's possible that you've been deceived is it possible
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.520]  I'm just asking is it possible it is possible that literally everybody on
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.160]  this planet has been deceived it is possible that this planet has
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.680]  literally just started this second one everything behind us there's no way you
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.080]  be able to disprove that so of course yes I could be
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.120]  are you talking about what you're afraid to you know
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.000]  what you never mind it's all right it's above your
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.440]  it's all right we are here to show our support for America
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:16.560]  and to say stop domestic terrorism stop domestic
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.760]  terrorism antifa the democrats they have been
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:25.120]  terrorizing people far too long you think my presence as a brown gay man
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:30.960]  I'm scared not at all not at all not at all not at zero if you've been
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.280]  told otherwise they've lied to you so I'm I'm trying to just ask them exactly
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.200]  what hate is it that they're referring to because
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:43.520]  I'm just kind of curious do you still do would you please just at least tell me
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.640]  what the hate is any comments
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.080]  any comments on what the hate is because it looks like the Obama symbol to me
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.680]  and Obama as far as black people represents complete total hate
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:01.920]  in this country because Obama was really want to really help destroy the
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.720]  black community in this nation let's get back to your sign here
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.000]  you're saying the alt right caused Heather yes
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.160]  to die yes when she wasn't invited why are you excited on the who's invited
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.680]  because you're blaming someone for something that they
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.680]  they weren't involved in so in your example okay in your example
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.840]  of the uh I don't remember this particular one but I
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.000]  sure let's say there's a a muslim attack with a new york
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.040]  I don't remember the new york one I remember other ones so whatever there's
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.480]  been multiple ones yeah there's been other ones in other countries
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.200]  it's been multiple ones let's go with new york but new york there was more
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.640]  and the muslim ran people down a home depot truck killed americans oh yeah
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.040]  yeah and it was americans fault that it took place what you're saying
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.160]  wait that is not the equivalence at all so you are saying
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.600]  that the people in the who he hit are at fault
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.880]  because that's that's the heather higher no no no you're saying that the people
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.720]  in new york that would happen to be around that area that didn't die
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.600]  it's their fault for being in new york people who are quoting the same
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.960]  ideology as him which is how is it their fault though
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.400]  it's still not their fault it's I mean it doesn't make sense
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.000]  the biggest amount of fault of course just like the just like just like the
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.760]  guns it's not it's not the directly killed anyone but it's not the law
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.200]  providing citizens fault for an idiot going out and shooting someone with the
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.920]  gun it's not even the guns fault it's to get it
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.920]  with the gun they're making this common sense and tifa does not stop
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.280]  if willer and the rest of these democrats do not denounce
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.640]  and tifa you got to know that the american person for the control room

[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.360]  perpetual maniac on twitter and i'm not going to even try to go over his whole
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.440]  bio here you've been on a couple times with us
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.800]  google is battling to suppress this information you're a major engineer that
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.160]  has released what they call the ed snowton level dump on big tech and
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.320]  their massive censorship you've written a new article for medium.com
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.920]  that details when they're rigging search results and when they aren't
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.640]  and how it's being done so thanks for being here thank you very much alex
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.400]  jones it's a pleasure being on your show today it's a pleasure to have you zack
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.000]  get into whatever you want because i really want to let you talk about
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.840]  the world why you did this where you see this coming what you think about the
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.440]  integrity of the elections what you think about all the new censorship coming
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.640]  out and happening uh now they're not even letting
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.240]  trump send out things saying we want to recruit strong women like you they say
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.680]  that's a triggering word because maybe a person that isn't a woman sees the name
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.240]  woman this is beyond mental illness this is a
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.440]  plan to kill the language and and and what you think trump should do because
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:41.120]  trump is listening and i and so is congress and when they
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.880]  bans the leader of the senate from being on twitter
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.000]  i mean i think they're really starting to understand that big tech is really in a
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.080]  in a power man yeah you know they are trying to
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:55.360]  sculpt the information landscape and they've been telling us
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.080]  you know in congressional testimony that they don't have any political bias
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.160]  and at this point the political bias is so strong that there's just they're not
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:10.880]  fooling anyone i mean they banned the the the facebook ad for women for trump
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.360]  because what they're assuming the audience is gender
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.920]  like what kind of clown rule is this that this sort of thing is allowed to
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.280]  happen and so you know google's been involved in
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.720]  election meddling for a while now and uh this is something that i discovered
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.400]  as an insider working for the company and so
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:37.600]  i decided that i was going to take the documents that were publicly available
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.520]  to the internal uh internal network and
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.160]  capture them and uh docs google to the world so that people could really
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.080]  understand what was really going on at google
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.280]  and uh again recap what you released how you decided to do it what it details
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.160]  yeah so um let's go back to like 2016 um
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.640]  donald trump got elected and the the the corporate culture of google like
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.040]  radically changed they did 180 degree like change and they went from like
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.320]  everyone should be able to express yourself to
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.680]  every uh there's a bunch of fake news and we need to start
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.920]  censoring that because that is unduly influencing people
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.080]  and also they they believe that russia hacked the election
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:32.320]  and so the executive um the executives didn't really uh see the opposing
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.200]  evidence that that the russians didn't hack the
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.720]  election that it was actually an insider that leaked this information
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:42.880]  and so we thought that well i thought that maybe this information would
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.000]  eventually reach them but it it didn't it they sort of like doubled down and
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.400]  they they kept on doubling down and so um you know
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.920]  uh a bunch of things started happening within the company a bunch of documents
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:57.920]  started being released and they started to create this design for
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:01.680]  this um censorship program called machine learning fairness
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.840]  and so uh when i disclosed this information i did it through
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:10.160]  uh project veritas which is an amazing
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.760]  uh journalist outlet uh they do undercover work
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.520]  and i gave the documents to them they did a sting operation
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.880]  on uh one of the executives uh jen jenai
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:28.240]  and jen jenai admitted um to the undercover that only google could
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.240]  prevent the next trump situation in 2020 and so
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:36.320]  um with that uh once they had that an undercover video
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.640]  um i decided to come out anonymously and give my perspective
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.960]  on what the company culture was like google then uh targeted me
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:49.840]  and um ended up swatting me at my house um and sending bomb squad people because
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.440]  they called in a wellness check and at that point i realized that um
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.880]  you know my life was in danger uh this wasn't going to go away and that the
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.200]  only way to um you know disclose the crimes of this
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.760]  company was to unveil myself uh come out publicly
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.080]  release all the documents that i had so that people could find out the truth
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:14.320]  so that's the story on on how this sort of unfold is the short version
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.480]  and now they've been caught red-handed and and so
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:24.000]  twitter again bans the senate leader majority leader mince mcconnell
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.840]  who just simply linked to video of people coming to his house saying we're
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.440]  going to kill you but left the accounts up that he was linking to
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.960]  on twitter and then now like you said facebook i want to put this on screen
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.280]  in color if we can for tv viewers uh facebook bans trump campaign ad this is
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.560]  today for assuming gender identity and it's the exact same ads hillary put out
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:48.160]  the women for trump coalition needs the support of strong
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.160]  women like you they said well maybe a someone who's not a woman sees this well
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.400]  yeah like thumbing through a magazine you see ads for weddings maybe you're
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.120]  not getting wet married the idea with this
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:03.600]  san francisco culture seems to be what it is projected through big tech
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.720]  that they can ban anything they want if someone's offended
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.880]  it's like a new language it's like a virus what would you call this where
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:15.440]  a grip of women supporting trump hurts people that aren't women
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.560]  like it's like saying the word mother and father is bad
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.240]  they really mean to impose this total war on language
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.520]  right and this is something that uh george orwell
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.160]  um talked about in his book 1984 and what he predicted was that the total
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.280]  terrians would be able to uh seize control of society
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:40.720]  through linguistical hacking and so uh they he had this word called uh
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.240]  doublespeak and double think double think double speak and uh this
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:49.440]  crime stop right yeah if you have a logical thought you got to kill that
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.840]  you got to kill that you got to suppress it and so
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.440]  what what these total terrians are doing is that they're attacking us at the
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.880]  language level and the thing is is that if they can change the definition of
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.000]  words so that they don't mean what they used to then you have to
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.520]  actually understand their their parallel definition of all the words in
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.120]  order to make sense of what they're saying so it's a coded priesthood
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.520]  i mean i'm just like gangs use codes yeah this is like a military it uses
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.760]  it uses scrambled communications right it's it's weaponized propaganda
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.560]  that is being pushed and the thing is is that it's not just one media outlet
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:27.920]  it's it's a whole bunch of establishment players oh they've all linked up
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.520]  yeah they all banned they're all banning twitter facebook meme world
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:35.760]  in meme world dot com in live time yes they are and and the reason why
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.640]  they're doing this is because contradictions to the narrative are
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.880]  very damaging um and this was proved in a study in the 1960s called the ash
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:47.040]  experiment in which um there was a volunteer
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.120]  that was a research person and he goes in and he
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.720]  sees a classroom with like seven other uh what he thinks are volunteers but
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:59.200]  they're actually actors and so um there is a instructor that goes
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.640]  onto the chalkboard and writes one line and then he writes another line he's
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:08.720]  like which line is um is larger and all the actors give the wrong answer
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  well guess what the volunteer what what the volunteers answer the wrong one
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:15.520]  he also gets the wrong one so he falls in line now here's
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.960]  here's the thing that's really crazy about this experiment if
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.640]  one of the actors gives the right answer then this
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:29.520]  consensus effect is broken okay and so in order for these totalitarians to
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.040]  be able to seize control of a society of a society
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:36.720]  they need to have a total lockdown on the information landscape
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:39.760]  and so people like you alex jones that come here
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.120]  and you know contradict the the narratives of this
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.440]  of these establishment establishment players um that breaks the consensus
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.000]  effect because people try to you know they start
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.880]  researching what you said what you say and a lot of the things that you say
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.720]  are actually true and that's devastating for these totalitarians they
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:59.360]  don't want true information to be coming out and so they've made a
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:03.840]  concerted effort to be able to um block information
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.320]  that uh that that contradicts their their establishment narrative i want to
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.480]  go back to this study because i'd read about that a
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.760]  few times i've never seen the video your tv viewer radio listeners can go to
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:17.200]  info wars.com or slash show will will post this archive later today
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.000]  i'd never seen the footage i didn't know there was footage
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  of where clearly uh these are lines that anyone can look at
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.800]  vertical lines i mean you know it's one thing that's horizontal
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.520]  some people aren't good at that these are clear vertical lines that any idiot
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.040]  could see which one is the tallest it's number two but if everybody else says
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.640]  the other line then the people via peer pressure go with it
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.320]  i guess that's the follower instinct but isn't it what leadership is
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.160]  is to do the right thing even when the mass isn't going for you
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:53.680]  right you know a sign of a good leader is one that has an allegiance to truth
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.920]  you know and honesty and um and so but but those those leaderships pose a
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.520]  threat to the establishment and so they need to be demonized need to be
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.560]  slandered by these giant and isn't that the essence of a successful
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:10.160]  civilization is allegiance to truth yes absolutely every
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.000]  society that has had allegiance to truth has been one that's been strong
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.280]  and every society that's fallen towards marxism
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.960]  um or fallen into marxism has established
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.560]  first this political correctness and this control over speech and this
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.720]  happened in russia this happened in china look how smart this google engineer
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:31.280]  is imagine they got a lot of other smart ones working for the bad guys that's
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.320]  scary yeah oh my god i'm glad you brought this

[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:59.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:31.760]  well i'm having a lot of fun and we had another great guest coming on but i've
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:34.560]  cleared the decks and i appreciate her coming on friday
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:38.720]  because we are covering the hardcore subjects right now
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:42.960]  with zack here in studio with us google insider shows how to
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:46.640]  detect when google is lying about autocomplace political bias it's up on
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:50.480]  medium dot com we have added it to info wars dot com he's going to get to that
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.000]  next segment and whatever he wants for the next two hours
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.920]  he's here till tomorrow too uh and he's a really smart guy and i've got a lot of
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:01.520]  questions too that are more parochial that i want to get to as well because we
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:04.480]  read about micro dosing lsd as fellow seiban
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.840]  other things in big tech and and you know kind of the weird things they're
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:10.960]  doing and the things that big tech's up to and what's going on with these tech
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.080]  executives eyes under the big white lights if you can't get into it it's okay
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.120]  but that's coming up you'll answer that question if you can bottom of the hour
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:20.560]  that's planting the hook there but you mentioned this experiment i'd read about
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.160]  it once i've never seen film footage they they pulled it up
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:28.400]  an experiment in conformity yeah so i learned about this experiment when
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.840]  um i was getting my major in psychology at the university of oregon
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.920]  and it was really a groundbreaking study like no one ever knew that
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.000]  the consensus was that strong at least in the public domain
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.480]  and so um i saw this experiment uh in my textbooks and then
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:48.480]  i looked it up on youtube and i saw the whole video on it and
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.000]  i was like wow this is this is really you know a fundamental
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.280]  um you know insight into human psychology and then
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.680]  things start to make a lot more sense like you need to have everyone within
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.240]  you know a contained overton window uh of acceptable political discourse and
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.000]  let's put the footage of that experiment back up i'm intrigued try go ahead
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.200]  yeah and so you know what they're doing is that they're taking the overton
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.560]  window of political discourse i kind of and then what they're doing is that
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.320]  they're narrowing it down to one wrong answer
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.080]  and then the person you know responds by going along with the consensus
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.920]  and this experiment has been repeated over and over and over and over again
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:26.960]  um and yeah it's it's it's one of the fun
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.400]  you know foundational studies if anyone wants to understand what's going on
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.280]  then what they should do is they should look at this experiment you know it's
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.720]  it exists on youtube and it exists on on bitshoots still
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.280]  and the old google model was based on what people liked and what they clicked
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.120]  it was a very honest thing of crowdsourcing and kind of the wisdom
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.640]  of the common man that hey everybody's going to that restaurant
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.000]  or everybody's drinking out of that well the water must be good the food must
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.920]  be good so they kind of jack into our own human consciousness that
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.040]  well these are real people and they all see it's the other length
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.040]  i must be out of my mind today i must have a problem my eyes
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:07.680]  so i'll go with them because i trust my tribe i trust my people but these were
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.520]  six mercenaries hired to all lie to you to make you feel alone
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:14.960]  this is gaslighting it is it is gaslighting um
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.640]  and it's it's it's too bad that it's happening and the thing is is that um
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.920]  what's really surprising is that eric schmitt in 2005 on charlie rose
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:29.840]  actually disclosed what they were planning on doing with google
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:37.280]  and what he did is he explained that um google had the most bugs of any company
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:41.760]  because when you do a search on google you get more than one result
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.880]  and what he said is that was a bug in fact every result other than the one
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.800]  correct result that that was given was essentially the incorrect answer
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.440]  and this is really like mind-blowing and for me i thought well you know i was
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.800]  admitting that we're getting you all hooked with with a with a real crowd
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.040]  source you're really interfacing with human intelligence
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.320]  through a machine all of us coming together saying this is best and once
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.960]  you are subconsciously hooked because you've been getting
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:13.360]  truth we're going to give you pure poison yeah that's that's correct and so
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:16.960]  i think that this was you know the censorship regime that's currently
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:19.840]  you know going on um was actually something that was
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:26.320]  put into a plan like a long time ago and it's really ironic that the company
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:30.720]  that's when the ipo'd had this mission statement of organizing the world's
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.560]  information and making it universally accessible and useful
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.000]  hold your horses start over back in 60 seconds all right with our gas ladies
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.040]  gentlemen you do not want to miss this google
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.640]  inside of on the whistle he's done the data dump what are the repercussions
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.400]  been where's he going now we'll get to all that and bottom of the hour i'm
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.760]  giving the number out you're gonna have an hour and a half specifically to
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:56.080]  ask him questions that's why he's here we really appreciate it
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:03.120]  band.video is the answer to censorship band.video is the answer
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.120]  for libertarians conservatives nationalists pro gun pro life
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:11.360]  pro human individuals to have their own platform
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:14.640]  where videos banned by youtube facebook and twitter
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:17.600]  are still available we've launched it ladies and gentlemen
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:24.000]  it's now live band.video band.video isn't just going to be a home for
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.240]  alex jones or david knight or oan shroyer or paul watson band videos
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:32.480]  we are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.840]  and we're a growing list of freedom loving contributors
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.200]  are able to have a home free from being shut down
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:42.880]  free from being censored free from being silenced by big tech
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.080]  the chai comms the hollywood scum and the globlest
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:52.320]  freedom of speech has a home it's called band.video america and the world is
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:57.040]  fighting back against tyranny at band.video
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:02.640]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:15.440]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:21.760]  professional maniac at twitter jack borges big time google whistleblower in
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:25.520]  studio with us and he was just talking about if
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:28.000]  he joined us we're going to pull the video up
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.800]  he just told us about it um the head of google the head of alphabet
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.560]  the real spider at the center of the web
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:41.920]  eric schmidt saying eight years ago on charlie roads
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:47.280]  that well google's got the most bugs of anybody because you get all these results
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.040]  we're going to give you the one right result that means whoever pays to the
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.920]  most money for a restaurant or for your tires
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:57.200]  everything in the final equation it won't just be all these searches and
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.480]  what you like and what you visit and what you vote on it'll be what we want to
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.520]  give you and so google had all this on the shelf it was
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:06.880]  being looked at i think when hillary lost they got scared
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.640]  and accelerated the authoritarian plan they were worried their own engineers
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.960]  and people will get upset because there was the old
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.880]  other maxim of not just organize the world's information to control it
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:23.200]  but to also do no evil or or google you know don't be evil
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:29.520]  well i mean now google's real logo or real definition or real catchphrase
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.120]  should be one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.560]  so zach you're on a roll here and once we have that video
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:41.200]  of schmidt will play it coming up but uh or put me put it on screen you got it
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.120]  ready thanks please continue yeah so um if someone
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:49.440]  to say that you know eric schmidt said this they would think you're absolutely
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.240]  crazy but the thing is is that we've got proof
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:57.680]  that he actually said this and so you have to just watch this video to believe
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:01.680]  that he's actually saying this and by the way for the crew
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:05.600]  as information accelerates i've gotten really ocd about info
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:08.960]  two minutes ago during break you said hey go to my twitter and grab the clip
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:12.480]  they got it in a minute and a half and i'm already like where's the clip
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:16.320]  give me the clip right now actually there's in my ear i couldn't hear what
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.480]  they were saying so we've got the clip here's the
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:22.320]  here's the here's the big spider at the bottom of the google
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:26.480]  alphabet well sun darpichage is to pump it like an angler fish puts a little
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.160]  light up there out front here he is and what i'm
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:34.240]  my question is leading to is help us understand where's the future of surge
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.760]  going well when when you use google um do you
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.360]  get more than one answer of course you do yeah of course well that's a bug
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:47.120]  yeah we we have more bugs per second in the world
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.560]  because we should be able to give you the right answer
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:54.800]  just once we should know what you meant you should look for information we
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:58.400]  should give it exactly right and we should give it to you in your language
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.480]  and we should and we should never be wrong okay i've never seen that
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:06.080]  it's incredibly profound i knew he's made statements like but to see it back
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:09.520]  it up again i am that actually made me dizzy
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.440]  he's saying we're not going to give you choice we're going to decide what you
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.720]  want and now i can't search a Breitbart headline
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.120]  i can't search an enforce headline with exact headlines they won't come up
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.080]  on news on web on it and now facebook blurs my face out
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  tells people you'll be banned unless it's negative so everyone
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.920]  is now sarcastically going look at this scum look at this filth this bastard
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.840]  he exposed epstein you know ten years ago so there's some sarcasm going on
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:41.120]  that's why they don't like memes because the ai can't understand it but don't
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:44.400]  worry they've got humans looking over your shoulders so zack vorhees
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:48.080]  what an incredible clip yeah what an incredible clip and the fact
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.160]  that a lot of people like can we just play that clip again is that a little
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.960]  because it's it's a lot to digest here it is playing it
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.920]  and one of my questions leading to is help us understand where's the future of
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:05.760]  search going well when when you use google um do you
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.360]  get more than one answer of course you do yeah of course well that's above
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:14.000]  yeah we we have more bugs per second
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.360]  in the world because we should be able to give you
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.600]  the right answer just once we should know what you meant
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.000]  you should look for information we should give it exactly right and we
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.880]  should give it to you in your language and we and we should never be wrong
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.160]  you should be god so let me throw this out at you that's like saying when you
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:35.440]  turn your radio on you should get one song one channel
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.040]  all the time because we know what you need and we're never wrong
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.320]  well the whole world's about differentiating and change and and finding
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.080]  new things and going through things so you talk about the ultimate safe space
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:49.680]  we give you the perfect answer always well there is no perfect answer unless
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:52.160]  you're god so they're saying we're going to play god or it's like saying
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:54.880]  when you go out to find your girlfriend or your wife or your husband
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.400]  we're just going to tell you who it is it's a programmed robot
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.560]  this sounds like hell this is like the ultimate authoritarian statement of no
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.520]  choice right and the thing is is that when he says
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:08.800]  we're going to give the right answer like what does he mean by the right
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:14.080]  answer like who makes that decision about what's right or not
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:17.360]  you know is is is there a bunch of social engineers they're
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:21.600]  they're trying to define what's right and therefore that one
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.200]  right answer is according to their definition of what's right
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.200]  so he just told us as a cult leader what his ultimate in game is and now
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.680]  they're trying it yeah and the thing is is that when he
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.680]  mentioned this it's like google's mission statement to organize the world's
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.360]  information and make it universally accessible and useful
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.720]  was in total contradiction to what he said on that chile rose show and so
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.880]  they're saying both things at the same time okay and
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.480]  you know how are you organizing the world's information making it you know
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:56.080]  accessible if you're only returning one search result
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.760]  one ring to bind them one ring to find them
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:03.440]  and then in the darkness bind them yeah he gets everybody to come to him
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.000]  for the power he's giving that's living lord of the rings
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.440]  they all join it and then oh by the way you're all my slaves now
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:14.160]  there's one answer we have the definition of the devil right there i
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.960]  mean that is like to take free will to take
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:19.920]  export take the colleges oh the place of ultimate learning
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:24.160]  any idea can be said here now the most orthodox controlled
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.720]  insane mother and father is bad expressed on facebook where the
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:33.040]  republicans can't buy an ad saying we're reaching out the strong women
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.120]  we believe in women now the very liberal ethos
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:40.800]  is martin luther king they're putting down they're attacking the original
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:43.760]  liberal ethos well the thing is is that i think that
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.040]  there's a misconception that the left is actually
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.800]  liberal i consider myself a liberal but liberal seems to be
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.160]  a conservative value now because like i grew up in the 1990s
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:58.240]  i believe on judging people by the content of their character and not
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.760]  the color of their skin but now like with safe spaces
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:06.480]  and this like new segregation that's moving in and demonizing one race
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:10.160]  for you know the white race for all the different problems i have a stack right
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.720]  here of the news today saying whites are inherently evil
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:16.080]  that is hit larry and to say a group is evil because of what color they are
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:19.760]  yeah i mean it's it's like it's like pre-world war two germany
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:24.560]  you know and and it's ramping up and they're like oh this is liberalism like
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.960]  what this is like like you know the the demonization of whites
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.400]  constantly through the new york times that represents liberalism i don't think
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.880]  so liberalism means we don't judge people by their you know immutable
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.600]  characteristics we judge them by what's in their head
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.360]  and we treat everyone equally under a liberal society and the left is
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.760]  completely abandoned that and replaced it with
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:49.920]  progressivism so because they believe racial fascism will win
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:54.800]  yeah i mean they are they call us nazis all day they are literally
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:58.400]  funded their main funder is a nazi collaborator yeah you can't make this
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:00.800]  up yeah george soros you know and there's there's
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.800]  there's videos of him i've seen two videos now where he's talking about
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:08.480]  um the exhilaration that he had sending jews
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.400]  off to concentration camps and what's really ironic is that
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:16.240]  if we criticize george soros then they call us
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.080]  anti-semites and it's like we're not criticizing him because
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.080]  you know he is criticizing he's a damn nazi collaborator
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.520]  yeah exactly you know but see it's that death of logic
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  it's it's really sad i i know i want to have you the floor because i'm gonna
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:36.960]  tell you you're smart man and you're i mean i want to get into
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.680]  whatever you want to cover like inside google without breaking into the rules
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:42.320]  and where you think things are going what you think trump should do what you've
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.920]  gone through since you did this and as you and others have told me there's a
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.680]  big resistance inside all these big tech by classical liberals that just
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.520]  believe in freedom yeah and this isn't freedom this isn't freedom
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.880]  i mean america is the most liberal country ever folks
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:59.760]  and prager university has an excellent four-minute video we ought to air
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.720]  tomorrow we don't have time and everybody should google it we can't do that
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:05.760]  being it is it's still bad but on as bad as google they're getting worse
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:09.600]  i guess dog dog go or duck duck go or whatever it is yeah that and start page
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:12.720]  start page is good so just look up prager university i think the
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:18.720]  headline is uh the you know leftists are not liberals i
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:21.680]  think it's the name of the video and it's totally true i've talked about a
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.200]  hundred times but the left means something totally
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.720]  different than liberal yeah they totally different they were liberals and then
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:34.000]  they got off the train as soon as they were able to win the culture war
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.400]  and now they're just fascist i mean i know yeah corporate total dominance with
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.880]  the government right and and and imagine that the antifa the anti-fascists
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:46.720]  are fighting people and not the big tech fascists

[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.960]  they're stealing our birthright they're stealing our telecommunications
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:12.640]  they're in live time i just had carpe dunked them on
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:17.120]  facebook isn't letting people on whatsapp share memeworld.com
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:21.440]  which just a side of memes i mean it's it's expanding to everybody
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.040]  these blacklist twitter is now blocking memeworld.com
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.080]  i mean they are so afraid of this this is so dangerous please continue
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.520]  um can i just kind of talk about what you just said with the with the memewars
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.160]  being blocked now a lot of people are like what the heck is going on and
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:41.520]  i want to give some comfort okay remember what happened with the music
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:46.320]  industry and mp3's and how the abster yeah and and and what was what
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.880]  happened right before the music industry collapsed
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.880]  they started suing everyone all right that was downloading
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:56.000]  you know mp3's and they tried to to stem the loss
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.040]  and everything got really scary we're like what's happening with all of our
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.920]  civil rights how are they able to just like go in and just like grab all of
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:04.960]  our our metadata about the things that we're
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:08.400]  downloading and um and it looked like we were like
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:11.680]  heading towards totalitarianism based off of mp3's and then all of a sudden the
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.320]  industry just collapsed right and so i've heard this thing that at
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:19.760]  the very end the last refuge of scoundrels
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:24.000]  is running to the law and so i i think that what's happening is that we're at
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.840]  the very end of this like of this thing and the
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.560]  i want that's one of my list of things i wrote down this morning when i
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:36.080]  remembered oh he's here um is is how do we fight back
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:40.320]  yeah so and then gut level what do you think their Achilles heels are
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:44.080]  so um i actually want to recommend a book um called
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:49.200]  sjw's always lie by uh vox day yeah um that's the only book that i would
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.680]  recommend that someone would read if they're gonna
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:54.720]  i don't mean to plug it but we do sell it in forestore.com that's one of the
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:58.080]  few books i've read the last year i've been so busy yeah they always lie
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:01.280]  they always lie and the thing is is that people that aren't familiar with the
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:04.160]  tactics you know because this is this is weaponized they don't
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:08.160]  understand what's going on and so they're likely to make a bunch of mistakes
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:11.680]  they think that they just capitulate and like apologize
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:14.800]  then it's just going to go away oh no a few years ago i'm like well i'm not
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:18.080]  really saying that about sandy hook but if you say i'm hurting you and sending
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:20.720]  people to your house i never did that but i apologize
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:23.760]  that's when they just full metal attacked yeah they doubled down and the
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.800]  thing is is that they're going to pray to apology around and say well
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.360]  you know he admits to this that he's like x y or z bad person and then they're
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.680]  going to use that and they're going to pray it around and
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:37.280]  this is not something that people like understand intuitively and so
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:42.000]  the thing is is that you know get this book sjw's always lie by
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:47.280]  vox day and read it it's a fascinating read and it goes by really quickly
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:51.600]  and um it's kind of a funny title but it the point is stop capitulating stop
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:54.400]  kissing your ass yes exactly exactly because i knew not to
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:56.320]  capitulate the political structure but i'm like
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:00.400]  oh the families i didn't really do this but if this is really happening i'm
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:04.400]  sorry and then they just all go out with talking points and then see
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:08.480]  and just attack attack attack attack attack yeah so i followed this book
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:12.240]  basically as a tactical operation manual on how i was going to
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:16.400]  leak this information so but but let's go back like what exactly did i do at
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:19.360]  youtube um what i did at youtube was i was a senior
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:22.480]  software engineer and i let's get you with vox day
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:25.120]  tomorrow you're still here tomorrow i am still here tomorrow can we get vox day
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:27.680]  on with him tomorrow great awesome
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:30.880]  yeah it's wonderful i apologize so um if anyone
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:35.280]  turns on like the television or you know playstation 4 or xbox or
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:38.400]  nintendo switch and they see the embedded version of youtube playing on
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:41.280]  their television that's the app that i was working on
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:48.640]  and it at the when i left youtube when i resigned um that app constituted 10
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:52.320]  percent of youtube's entire traffic wow so yeah so
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:55.360]  sure because i had other big engineers on they call singer and they go oh no
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.520]  uh no zacks the big big like like you are the
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.560]  biggest person to defect from google yeah i am
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.800]  and um and so um that was my role
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:10.400]  at google i've been at google for eight years
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:14.160]  and um and then the last three that's when everything
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:20.160]  was turning into clown world and so um i decided that uh that you know
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:24.400]  understanding how the marx's left works i realized that they don't even
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:27.920]  understand that what they're doing is appalling and reprehensible
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:32.240]  and as a result they just left all of their documents about what they were
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.760]  going to do all their plans available on the
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:39.600]  internal public internet that any full-time employee
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.720]  could um to to get so i want to give you an example actually there's a video
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:49.040]  of susan actually admitting everything that they're going to do
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:55.120]  um and this happened i believe in 2017 at the summer stream event for all the
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:00.560]  employees of youtube can we roll that yeah let's go ahead and roll that here it is
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:06.800]  or we can cliffhanger it and uh come back this is a hard area
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:10.560]  um you know a year ago we didn't have the term fake news now everything's about
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:14.880]  fake news we hear about it every single day um it's had a lot of um concerns
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:18.720]  about how it affected the election how it affects politics um news is important
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.000]  to us we are a platform with global distribution
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.960]  um we talked about the number of users are coming to us we have some
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:28.240]  responsibility to make sure that we are delivering the news when something
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:30.800]  important happens in the world when there's a crisis
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:34.080]  we think people could benefit from this news so it's news has always been
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.360]  important to youtube um we also see people in locations like
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:40.800]  syria where their traditional news organizations can't get to
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:43.920]  and people are talking about citizen journalism
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.440]  coming out of syria so what are we doing um basically
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.120]  this sounds easy but it's really hard to do we're pushing down the fake news
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:55.520]  we're demoting it um and we are increasing the
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:59.840]  authoritative news and promoting it um how do we do that um we have a whole
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.080]  system we came up with trashy news where we have
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:06.400]  build classifiers we identify it we look for salacious for clickbait
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:10.080]  content that isn't um that we don't think is is uh
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:13.440]  you know the authoritative news it's just kind of encouraging people to look
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:16.400]  at but it's not true um we're training we added these
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:21.600]  instructions to our um readers and we've updated our classifiers um and
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:24.400]  we are working to understand identify that with machine
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.360]  learning and then to push that down and then we're increasing our
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.280]  authoritative news we're doing that with things like um a breaking news shelf
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:34.880]  um we're treating it in the us in france in the uk and more countries coming
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:38.240]  soon where we have sources that come from reputable sources we work with google
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.920]  news on that um to define what those reputable sources are um it
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.520]  triggered last week in the london bridge attacks um it's also going to trigger
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.360]  on search when you type in something they covered up the muslims did that um
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:52.400]  news there we're also working with a lot more news
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.440]  publishers news publishers don't want to be in the technical business of running
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:59.040]  their own player we can do that for them um and we also want to get more news
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.640]  players on the platform we have the goal of getting over 100 new news
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:07.680]  providers on our platform this year so what's what's really interesting is
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.280]  that you know the stream event happened and i heard her you know say those words
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.120]  and i recorded that video um to leak it to the public so that they
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.480]  could see what was going on that was an internal that was that was an internal
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.720]  event it was kind of open to public insiders um but it was mostly for the
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.480]  employees and i started to ask myself well what
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.880]  exactly do they think fake news is and so i found their fake news like
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:34.960]  definitions uh in their design documents and it turned out that
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:40.480]  real events were being labeled as fake news let's come back and talk about
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:45.440]  google labeled real events fake news with insider zack vorhees
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:49.680]  who resigned from google and is now taking action in a big way and then i'll

[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.160]  celebrate this but we should celebrate it the fact that a major google engineer
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.120]  who is running you know ten percent of youtube's traffic alone with one thing
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:40.640]  he did has come out with the big ed snowden level data dump
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:44.000]  is takes a lot of courage and the fact that he's busting his butt going around
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.360]  giving speeches going on shows coming on this broadcast
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:51.440]  as one of the first shows really is amazing and it's the spirit
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.200]  that's infectious that needs to trigger more people
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:58.080]  to say i'm not going to be part of this cult because you think the brainwashing
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.040]  the general public's bad i've heard it's really bad and big tech and i know you
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.240]  want to get into documents you want to get into proof of all this i want to
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:06.400]  give the number out so people can call in as well
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:10.160]  we still got you for another hour and 20 minutes or so but
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:13.600]  specifically we should be writing notes there there's so much to get into
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:19.200]  about the cult inside and the mindset and are they really micro dosing and
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:23.280]  we'll we'll hit that next segment but let me give the number out
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:26.960]  specifically where we have hundreds of radio affiliates we still have info
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:30.480]  wars dot com and news wars dot com we still have millions of people
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:34.560]  a day that come and click the audio and and watch the video live
[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:37.600]  despite everything they've done in some ways were more important than ever
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:40.960]  because now the really big thinkers are tuned in once they heard they weren't
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:44.000]  supposed to listen to the show but if you'll just spread info wars dot com
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.360]  for its last show and that's censored i know so do news wars dot com for its last
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:50.240]  show it's not a censored gosh meme world they're so scared of that it's
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:53.520]  censored day one it got launched but word of mouth you can say
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.520]  hey we're all spartacus hey memeworld dot com that's not our site but we're
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.600]  promoting it uh because it's very very exciting and
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.040]  trump loves carpe donkton and they talk all the time i'm gonna leave it at that
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:09.360]  and you know just talking to trump recently and the word is just
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.920]  work with mr because there's last name where they've already doxed him
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:17.600]  so there's a lot of exciting things so they're directly blocking the senate
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:20.640]  leader they're directly blocking trump when they block
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:24.160]  carpe donkton i'm gonna just look the enemy knows that i'm not giving you
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:28.160]  a sequence but they are have reached a new arrogance level
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:31.200]  where they tell you they're not censoring and they're doing it in live time
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:34.320]  and lying to the president's face and he says strong action we'll talk about what
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.840]  that strong action should be so eight seven seven seven eight nine

[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:49.920]  engineer that left and has spilt the beans like no
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:53.440]  one ever else has done eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.200]  three nine on this live wednesday global transmission
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.720]  please continue mr vorhees right so where we left off
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:04.720]  before the break was um you know the issue of fake news and we had
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.560]  you know the ceo of youtube susan machowski talking about how they were
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.080]  going to take fake news and um suppress it
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:15.120]  and that they were going to start boosting authoritative news and so the
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.840]  question that i had was what exactly is fake news
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:23.760]  and so it's whatever eric smith says it is right and so
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:28.880]  you know they had a document uh available to all the full-time employees
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:33.360]  that defined what fake news was and so i want to
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.960]  um sort of show you that one of the things that was in this fake
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.400]  news as an example was actually something that happened
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:44.320]  which is you know the evidence that okay they
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:47.520]  are intending to become social engineers so
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:52.720]  um the the document this is part of the document dump that was released through
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:57.200]  project veritas um if the audience wants to to look at this they
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:00.480]  can they can go to project veritas and download this
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:04.400]  and this is called uh the the training global google efforts to address
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:08.800]  fake news and so on page five there's this document here
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.280]  and if you look at the second example and that is
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:17.600]  wikileaks confirms hillary sold weapons to isis then drops another bombshell
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:22.720]  breaking news okay and uh and then the second one is something
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:25.280]  similar hillary's isis email just leaked and it's
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.720]  worse than anyone could have imagined well
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:33.360]  hillary clinton was running weapons to isis through Benghazi
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.640]  i mean that's now been in congress yeah that's been in congress that's that
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:39.920]  that was a conspiracy theory now it's a conspiracy fact
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.760]  um and the social engineers are classifying that
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:49.200]  as fake news okay and which means that what they want to do is they want to
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:52.640]  start training their ai algorithms to find that and
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.720]  all the patterns that are similar to that and derank it because they don't
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.040]  want for some reason they don't want bad news about hillary clinton
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.080]  surfacing well we know from the wikileaks hillary's on the phone with the
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:08.000]  media and google bitching so it's almost like hillary centric because
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.200]  she had so much power as kind of the shadow president with obama but he
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.880]  watched he would watch sports center she was actually on the phone all day
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.720]  it's a wikileaks bitching at google saying hide this hide that hide that so
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:21.920]  so much of it is hillary yeah and so i created a medium
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:27.920]  post an article that describes um you know kind of like
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:33.120]  the main way that google was able to influence the 2016 election
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.040]  by hiding information about hillary clinton and this is the whole reason
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:40.400]  you came here today so i'm glad that we're getting into this right now it's
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.840]  up at medium.com it's on enforce.com everybody share this
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.640]  article continue yeah um is there a way we can pull this
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:50.000]  article up yeah it's google insider shows how to detect
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.440]  when google is lying about autocompletes political bias
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:41:01.520]  right um and so um the way that um google was able to influence the
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.600]  election is that they were deleting the search
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:09.440]  prediction results when people were trying to find information about
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.720]  hillary clinton now the thing is is that a lot of people
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:17.120]  went on and you know what we're searching for the clinton body count
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:20.880]  because there's a lot of people that have died you know related to
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:23.200]  hillary clinton and it's like Jeffrey Epstein
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:26.960]  yeah and it's it's it's all been cataloged and it's all been
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:30.800]  you know and some of them you know they were listed as suicides but they died
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.640]  through two gunshots to the back of the head and so
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:39.040]  you know um that information is out there it's been cataloged people can
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:42.640]  were able to find it but what was happening is that
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:46.880]  when people would go and try to type in like hillary clinton body count
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:50.800]  google the google search prediction was shut off
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.840]  and um and the thing is is that if you went and search for
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:59.360]  example trump body count that search result
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:05.920]  prediction was suggested to the user and the thing is is that google says that
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  their search prediction feature is based off of user data
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:14.560]  now i was able to use google's own services
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:18.880]  at trends.google.com to show the real search traffic for this search term
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:22.480]  and show that google was lying so either google is lying through
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:25.680]  one service or they're lying through the other and either way they're
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:28.800]  they're both lying all right you've got all the graphics it's in the article
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:32.240]  you've got the floor when we come back i want to walk through this
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:35.760]  for the president and for congress everybody how this works
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:38.880]  how they do it and how you can see it and then what is it where we have an
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.080]  exact headline and it won't show up because that's that's that's this new
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.760]  thing they're doing where stuff is totally put into the phantom zone
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:49.280]  Zach Voorhees the biggest google whistleblower ever

[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:27.280]  society we gotta stop it Zach Voorhees is our guest and he was just
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:31.360]  getting into his medium article that we've reposted info wars.com
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:35.360]  google insider exposes how tech giant is fixing
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.800]  the search results hiding the clinton death count
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:42.160]  it's up on info wars.com it's up on news wars.com
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:45.600]  you definitely want to share that that'll make folks at google and twitter and
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:49.360]  facebook think that you're done think that they can pull this you know are
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:53.600]  they pulling this massive censorship and exercise of social engineering
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.680]  because they're desperate or because they're arrogant.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:01.840]  I think that it's actually both they've elected themselves
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.160]  as the autocrats to decide what is true and what is not
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:10.080]  and that's what we're facing with right now
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:12.880]  and the thing is is i'm not entirely sure that the executives are really
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:16.240]  running the the company i suspect that there might be someone
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.160]  above them operating from the shadows you know operating through the
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:23.840]  executives and then they ordered them to bring in all the southern property
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:27.600]  law center 100 000 trainees who then on their off
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:30.960]  time as you exposed they had the back doors google gave them and they go in
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:33.280]  and do the sabotage and then we caught them
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.040]  last year even bloomberg said oh our employees weren't trained and some other
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:40.080]  people got in. Yeah yeah and the thing is is that
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:43.680]  i've noticed this pattern of insiders being able to hack
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:46.960]  google systems because i saw how they took down
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  jordan b peterson and he witnessed that here's the thing
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:54.480]  obviously something that's powerful is going to get abused i'm surprised google
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:56.960]  didn't do more abuse up until hillary lost i mean
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:01.680]  this is damn powerful and so it's i mean once it's going to get abused
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:05.360]  yeah well the thing is is that the establishment was in power
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:08.560]  in the united states and so they didn't really need to apply
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.480]  all of this control because they had control and it was when they started to
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:15.840]  lose control was when the mask got ripped off
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:18.880]  and as a result now we're seeing what they truly are
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:25.920]  and it's a really nasty ugly beast that is fighting for its life i think i mean
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.760]  that's what it sounds like to me is that you know from their behavior that
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:34.800]  they're really you know in a total war situation for the american mind
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.320]  big tech is in a total war for the american mind
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.880]  google insider there's the name of the whole interview
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:44.080]  and we put that clip you just said right up front because
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:46.960]  that's the thing is this is so epic and so real
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:51.840]  china about to invade hong kong and taiwan india going into cashmere
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:55.440]  all these geopolitical moves the washington post saying z will defeat
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:58.160]  trump and save america there's the headline you
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:01.040]  i mean this we're living like in a comic book
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:05.440]  uh movie right now this is that really the headline
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:11.600]  yeah oh my wow can can we show this to the yeah yeah because it says it but then
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:15.600]  if you read what it says it's saying g must crush trump or america will be in
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:19.040]  trouble it's it's like it's like how much more of
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.720]  a clown will like when i see this i'm like they can't get any worse than what
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:25.920]  it is and it's just now we've got now we've got the
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:32.800]  media rooting for our foreign adversary unbelievable one of my oldest
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:39.920]  he may be the oldest employee here 17 plus years his sister won't bring the
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:43.280]  grandkids over to see his mom in minnesota and his mom's great and she had
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:45.680]  a great relationship because she's a trump supporter and she won't even
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:50.000]  really talk to him now and she says she's on this morning he was like he
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.640]  goes you know she says white people are inherently bad and will be better ones
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:57.520]  that are all gone and and that basically you know that
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:01.040]  and he's like he's like honey that's evil and she's just gone
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:05.280]  yeah he's gone yeah i mean this is so we sit here and laugh at this
[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:09.040]  this is real programming i mean yeah this is working on some people
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:12.640]  and there's a slide in and i don't have it in front of me but google admits that
[02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:16.240]  you know there's a four step process and the last step is that people are
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:20.000]  programmed that's their words okay and it didn't just end up in one slide it
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.840]  ended up in two slides that i saw in different powerpoint
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:27.200]  presentations i should just be saying what what
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:30.720]  what shocked you most what was the process eight years you know become one
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:34.080]  of their top engineers from a junior engineer and you're just
[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:38.080]  looking at this versus what's on the news you're inside seeing the truth and
[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:40.160]  then you're seeing what they're saying on the news
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.280]  right like i'm i remember sitting at my desk
[02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:47.760]  listening to testimony by i think it was one of the executives
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:51.920]  saying that we don't employ blacklists and so i just go to the internal
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:57.040]  search engine called MOMA and i search for blacklist and up pops this huge
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:01.600]  42 or 40 page blacklist for youtube and i'm just like
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:07.120]  i'm like like the the lies are just so like in your face
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:11.600]  it that it's it's just it's it's ridiculous it needs to be confronted it
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:15.600]  needs to be exposed um so i want to talk about this clinton
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:19.120]  body count yeah please and and before you know i talk
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:22.800]  about clinton i wanted to let the audience members know that i am not
[02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:27.760]  suicidal and that i have no plans of killing myself
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:31.760]  or uh you know overdosing on drugs because i don't do that
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:35.760]  by the way you're not being a wimp here i've had known high-level CIA operatives
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:38.960]  that ran assassination of government leaders
[02:52:38.960 --> 02:52:41.760]  call up and say you better watch it you better shut up if you care about your
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:44.480]  family so i've been death-threaded by famous
[02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:48.320]  cia people right i mean so i mean this is real this is real this is real even
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:51.360]  dr robert eppstein just like made an announcement today that he's not
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:54.400]  suicidal because he just got into a fight with hillary clinton on twitter
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:57.600]  oh yeah that article's on info wars it's the most evil photo of hillary and
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:00.320]  there's a bunch i meant to start the show with that
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:03.360]  that's why there's so much info and it's like eppstein says
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:07.440]  and eppstein has fight with hillary and there's a photo of him with her
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:10.880]  when she's the most demonic looking joker i've ever seen yeah
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:14.560]  we're gonna find out i can't look at this photo it is haunting
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:19.360]  yeah and i absolutely sorry go get into it so let's talk about how google
[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:23.920]  suppressed the autocomplete for the clinton body count so um
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:28.400]  so this is a medium article that i wrote um can we put it up on the screen
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:33.440]  we'll put medium up um and so when someone goes to
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:38.000]  google search and they type in uh for example
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.760]  trump body the letter c what they'll get
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:46.320]  is a suggestion do you know do you mean trump body count right by the way you
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:48.400]  host i'm gonna go in there and get the medium pulled up because i know you want
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:51.440]  the medium specifically we need to we need to scroll down into the actual
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:54.240]  things you can show them the power point i'll be right back
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:54:01.040]  all right um i'll just send it to production um yeah so
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:04.720]  um there's this oh yeah there we go so there's this
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:08.560]  there there's this article that that i wrote um and
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:14.400]  if uh and if you type in trump bodies you know see it autocompletes to trump
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:19.280]  body count and now if we try the same thing for clinton body
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:25.360]  c um nothing autocompletes at all the search results are
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:29.280]  omitted and so you know what i'm going to do is i'm going to ask the audience
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:33.840]  at home to go to google search and try this
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.000]  right now okay go go to google search type in
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:43.200]  trump body c uh with spaces in between them and you'll see that
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:46.480]  yeah it autocompletes the trump body count now try the same thing with
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:50.240]  with the clinton body count and no search
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:56.640]  result will exist okay so you know according to google
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:00.160]  all the search predictions are built off of user search data so
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:04.560]  i want to quote them um from their own blog and they say predictions not
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:07.360]  suggestions you'll notice we call these autocomplete
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:10.240]  predictions rather than suggestions and there's a good reason for that
[02:55:10.240 --> 02:55:14.560]  autocomplete is designed to help people complete a search
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:19.200]  they were intending to do not to suggest new types of searches to be
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:22.480]  performed these are our best predictions of the query you
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:26.720]  were likely to continue entering how do we determine these predictions
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:30.960]  we look at the real searches that happen on google and show common and
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:34.240]  trending ones relevant to the characters that are entered
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:37.840]  and also related to your location and previous searches
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:41.520]  okay so you know according to these public statements
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:45.200]  if there isn't a search prediction then it's because there's no one searching
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:48.320]  for them okay and this would be fine and dandy if it
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:52.000]  weren't for the fact that we can go to trends.google.com
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:58.080]  and see the real search traffic okay so um in my medium article i took a
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:03.200]  screenshot where i compared the search the search traffic for
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.560]  the clinton body count with the trump body count now
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:10.320]  the clinton body count is in blue you know and
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:14.720]  if you look at trump's you know search query results it's almost at zero down
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:16.880]  there is red it's almost zero like no one's
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.000]  searching in relation to the so that's death valley trump's death valley
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.320]  below sea level but we're at the top of uh
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:27.520]  the highest mountain in the world at clinton body count right and the thing
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:31.040]  is is that the historical results from the trend services are much harder to
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:34.800]  erase and hide and this means that we can cross-reference search terms
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:38.240]  between autocomplete so you're bringing out smoking gun evidence they
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:42.480]  rigged us off their own data yeah and and what i'm going to
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:45.920]  ask is for the listeners of the show i want you to go and use
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:49.440]  google trends and compare it with the google searches
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.320]  and when you see the political bias i want you to post this to twitter
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:58.000]  and maybe a comment section on info world wars if it exists
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.200]  and we need to like spread this information around because
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:05.120]  each one of us can prove that google is lying we're all Sherlock Holmes and we
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:08.560]  all just show this to everyone hey look how you're being lied to
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:11.760]  look at and again congress is pregnant
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:15.840]  with action now yeah nine months pregnant it's about to happen
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.800]  we're back in two minutes can continue and we're gonna have the phone calls
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.720]  as you walk through this hey this great guy uh
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:25.920]  that boy he's just showed up today he's like doing all these
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.520]  presentations so uh it's powerful he'll be back tomorrow too
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:32.080]  he'll be more prepared you gotta come in here an hour before the show and tell
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:35.040]  us that we won it's a cruise break give everything you want they'll have it yep
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:37.760]  it's it's like medium lock this out that's what we're not able to show the
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:40.000]  medium version it's too bad it's okay but we got on info

[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:30.560]  with the coq 10 and bio pqq and all the rest of it all of these are things that
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.600]  are like rocket fuel on the body you take these bases together

[03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:11.440]  the phones are loaded we're live in defiance of the tech giants
[03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:16.400]  zack vorhees is our guest and all of a sudden
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:19.040]  zack looks over he goes are those all the guests and yeah those are all the
[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:22.560]  callers george at chase and linda and uh
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:26.800]  ryan and matt and john and christy and davin vernan and jeff and sarah
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:30.400]  one time we looked at how many calls came in during a show was
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:34.160]  27 000 that's how many are trying to get on the show
[03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:37.840]  and so we're gonna go to your calls next segment we've got so much here but
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:41.920]  he said he's one of these engineer tech guys he's showing you on radio and tv
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:46.560]  he's going through all the proof and uh it's amazing and he'll be back tomorrow
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:49.120]  we'll be even more prepared i thought he was just coming as a guest he was like
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:52.720]  all this research coming like i do so so you were showing people just now we have
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:57.040]  four minutes left in the segment right how how their own their own
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:00.960]  traffic dashboard shows their line because they're saying there's no
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:04.160]  traffic on clinton body count that's why it doesn't show up period
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:07.840]  no it's just the number one search continue right so if we go back to the google
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:10.400]  twitter showing like number one it still won't show up right they're
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:13.920]  suppressing trends on different platforms you know and different companies
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:16.560]  and they're doing it the same way they have the same biases
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:19.840]  they're suppressing the human will for freedom yeah but they can't fight it
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:22.160]  because they're fighting against a force of nature
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:28.800]  exactly um so um yeah so you know the the the crew here is doing a
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:34.640]  search for clinton body and type in oh yeah that there you go
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:41.040]  um clinton body count yeah just no just uh and when they hit return so just go
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:45.520]  ahead and do the whole phrase clinton body count not clinton body see you're
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:50.480]  gonna need to do the whole thing try stuff live it's a train wreck yeah
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.960]  anyways uh so you're gonna type in clinton body count
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:02:01.680]  okay and then when you hit enter trends.google.com is going to show
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:05.040]  that that traffic and that traffic is relative to
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:08.480]  historical trends now uh what you're going to need to do is you're going to
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.800]  need to compare it against another phrase to show the relative traffic
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:16.320]  so if you go to trump body yeah so trump so if
[03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:20.080]  you click the compare and then you you you type in the search term
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:26.560]  trump body count then what you're going to get
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:31.360]  is you're going to get both graphs on the same graph okay and so you could just
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:34.000]  show us we know you're telling the truth but now you've just shown us
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.800]  in live tv and radio with it on screen and boom just what you said right and i
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:42.880]  want you to do one last thing which is uh it's showing data for the past 12
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:45.680]  months you're going to want to do that for like the past
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:51.600]  five years okay and so that's going to give you more history
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:55.120]  on the relative thing of the search and there we go that's the same graph okay
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:58.080]  so clinton body count was big back during the last campaign cycle
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:02.160]  yeah and you we can see that and there's a spike in october november of last
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:06.400]  year right and so um so what's really interesting
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:09.520]  is that there's obviously a blacklist that's
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:14.000]  being utilized either explicitly or embedded in a neural network
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.600]  and what's really interesting is that the google executives
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:21.200]  uh specifically karan batia and my apologies if i
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:24.880]  pronounce your last name wrong he went up before under oath
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:32.000]  to congress and he said the following we do not utilize black lists or white
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:36.480]  lists in our search results to favor political outcomes
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:40.080]  we just heard the head of youtube a subcompany admitting in front of all
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:42.880]  their people they're doing it and you just showed their documents and you
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:46.880]  just showed their own feeds right so he says you know
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:50.640]  i you know we do not utilize blacklist or white list in our search results to
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:55.840]  favor political outcomes that's not doesn't happen
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:59.680]  he says this doesn't happen so you just saw total proof that they're lying
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:02.640]  right so is google lying or is google lying or is google lying
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:05.120]  you know we've got three points of reference they're lying somewhere you
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:09.280]  know and two out of three like which one is it okay and so um
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:12.560]  and the truth is they can't manipulate raw data in real time that's too
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:15.200]  hard because they still want the raw data they just
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.400]  manipulate the overall result the public gets they don't think people are
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:21.360]  engineers they go look at their raw data feed so clearly there was they're
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:24.560]  putting a blacklist in which their document shows right and it's funny
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:27.280]  because like i see this all the time but nobody knows about this service
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:31.040]  trends.google.com so you know now they do so let's talk
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:34.320]  about this they go to calls you said the leftist are the
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:37.520]  authoritarians the fascist are pulling their hair out right now
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.080]  right they hate the fact you're doing this they hate info wars more than anything
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:46.320]  and i can imagine that their heads are exploding they think that i'm a larp or
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:48.960]  that like i've invented all of this out of my mind
[03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:52.320]  or or whatever you know they have to maintain cognitive dissonance and
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:57.040]  whenever you're there band.video is the answer to
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:01.280]  censorship band.video is the answer for
[03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:05.040]  libertarians conservatives nationalist pro-gun pro-life
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:09.280]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:12.640]  where videos banned by youtube facebook and twitter
[03:05:12.640 --> 03:05:15.520]  are still available we've launched it ladies and gentlemen
[03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:21.760]  it's now live band.video band.video isn't just going to be a home
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:26.160]  for alex jones or david knight or owens shroyer or paul watson band videos
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:29.360]  we are building it to be a place where banned memes
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:32.880]  are able to be posted and we're a growing list of freedom loving
[03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:37.200]  contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down
[03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:40.880]  free from being censored free from being silenced by big tech
[03:05:40.880 --> 03:05:45.120]  the chai comms the hollywood scum and the globlest freedom of speech
[03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:50.880]  has a home it's called band.video america and the world is fighting back
[03:05:50.880 --> 03:06:16.000]  against tyranny at band.video
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.720]  making news we're going to get to the breaking news my compadre in a moment but first
[03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:24.560]  everybody wants to know about the inner workings at google are they microdosing
[03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:29.680]  weekly daily with hallucinogens dmt this video went viral a few weeks ago only
[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:35.840]  because drudgereport.com linked to it what's wrong with big tech's eyes
[03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:43.840]  you know the top nazi verner von brawn wrote a 1959 book or 1949 book i won't
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.080]  remember here called project mars where the elons
[03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:52.480]  are the aliens who end up taking over the earth beware the elons
[03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:56.480]  and the elon invasion dr warner von brawn wonder what he knew
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:07:00.800]  when i watched his promo about this with executives from his company
[03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:04.640]  they all look like they're on hardcore drugs i mean they're like sweating their
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:09.360]  eyes are like lit up like i mean they look nuts
[03:07:09.360 --> 03:07:12.560]  you know when somebody's on drugs you know they admit silicon valley is into
[03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:18.000]  hardcore speed and hallucinogens they're taking ivy drips at work of dmt
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:21.360]  they're taking lsd microdoses and a civil side of mushrooms
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:26.560]  and peyote every day who in the hell would want to join with these people
[03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:29.280]  i've seen people take like three hits of acid their eyes aren't that big what
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:32.240]  the hell are they on and one of the crew members said maybe they've already got
[03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:36.000]  this whole neural link wires hooked in their brain because this pkd pointed out
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:39.600]  philip k dick back in the 70s the cyberpunk future is where you can get
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:43.680]  any type of pleasure you want just plug in but no one wants to even get up or
[03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:47.600]  eat for weeks or days you just die because you just plug all this in and
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:51.520]  it's the matrix and now the matrix is here and you look at tim kook or elon
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:54.560]  musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage they'll be
[03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:58.400]  under white lights their pupils are 90 open
[03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:02.160]  zuckerberg all of them these people either have brain chips that's it
[03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:06.160]  these guys are wire heads something's going on
[03:08:06.160 --> 03:08:10.400]  i'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:13.920]  now zoom into the camera my pupils are tiny because i'm not on drugs
[03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:17.280]  i've had two cups of coffee today here let me show you my pupils okay
[03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:21.040]  my pupils are little they're supposed to close that's what happens under the
[03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:24.240]  sun or under bright lights but not these guys these are drug addicts and they
[03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:29.600]  want the hit of wires in their brains and all of them got those giant pupils
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:34.240]  because they've been there and they ain't coming back
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:37.680]  i want them shut down i want them silenced i want them muted i think they
[03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:41.440]  are horrible for our society why are they doing this now
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:43.920]  well it's a good question as to why they waited this long but
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:49.760]  yes exactly yeah i mean so alex's out jones has been banned
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:53.360]  from facebook for a long period of time but now they banned him they banned his
[03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:56.720]  like little underling paul joseph watson now that they kick them off the
[03:08:56.720 --> 03:09:00.640]  platform that's great for now but it doesn't roll back the clock
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:04.480]  but you have also excesses in the first amendment and the second amendment right
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:07.920]  now you know i don't think that the four the forefathers said well you can say
[03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:11.440]  you know all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world literally
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:15.200]  spread it through the internet i have no issue with it at all i want
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:18.320]  things shut down i want them silenced i want them muted i think they are
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:23.200]  horrible for our society i want them shut down i want them
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:27.040]  silenced i want them muted but don't worry these people aren't
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:31.040]  terrifying or anything
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:34.800]  well google and the big tech folks are playing a very
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:40.400]  very dangerous game they think that they're going to be able to
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:44.080]  abuse all this power and get away with it and then suppress everybody that
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:48.080]  doesn't go well in history and i just can't believe they're pushing this
[03:09:48.080 --> 03:09:50.800]  hard we're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment
[03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:55.360]  and you just saw that video uh that we aired what's wrong with big tech's eyes
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:58.400]  we've got some big breaking news here just briefly
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:01.360]  if you don't remember and i'm not bitching and complaining but
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:04.240]  we just keep delivering freedom we keep delivering bombshells
[03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:07.680]  whistleblowers we're in the zeitgeist and i am nothing but thankful to all the
[03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:10.640]  viewers all the listeners my family this crew
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:14.160]  and matt drudge uh there's the only person out there that isn't a coward
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:17.520]  in uh you know independent media that supports us because he supports
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:20.960]  himself and freedom and sanity uh and has a
[03:10:20.960 --> 03:10:24.240]  understanding of the destiny we're in because i was doing the numbers without
[03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:27.840]  matt drudge we'd be shut down a year ago or two years ago so yeah matt drudge
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:30.640]  literally is in full wars we're gonna get him in trouble but the enemy already
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:33.840]  knows that without your financial support listeners
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:37.360]  you need fish oil you need turmeric we got the best fish oil we got the best
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:40.480]  turmeric i go ahead and get the very best we've got the best new tropics we've
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:43.680]  got the best healthy stuff we've got it all just get a book get a video get a
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:46.080]  t-shirt sign up for something you're getting on all the ship
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:50.000]  show that i can continue because we're either going to expand or contract
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:55.600]  and uh we need your support the big super special is about to end 50 60% off
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:58.560]  on many items in the store we had to get rid of some because they were selling
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:02.960]  out almost all the water filtration sold out uh because all the stuff's coming
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:05.440]  out about fluoride in the water and brain damage and
[03:11:05.440 --> 03:11:08.560]  all these democratic candidates are admitting the water's poison it's like
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:11.840]  you weren't listening to me i mean we've got like five companies we sell
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:15.040]  whatever the highest rated is we sold out of three of the five companies right
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:17.760]  now at infowarstore.com
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:20.080]  other reason is people search it and they go wait a minute
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.600]  he really is selling a lexapure and pro pure at the lowest price yeah
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:27.760]  in fact that's the trap i put myself in is that we bring in tons of money
[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:31.680]  but because we sell stuff cheaper than amazon
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:34.480]  it's kind of like no wonder we're successful but we're not successful to
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:37.920]  get in the cash we need big numbers of money but small
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:41.280]  slice to fund it so please infowarstore.com
[03:11:41.280 --> 03:11:44.640]  their products you already need want to thank you all so you got they brought
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:48.480]  this in there in the break and you you got excited sort of waving your arms
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:51.040]  around uh and you wanted to read the article
[03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:55.120]  breaking news yeah tell us yeah okay so
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:59.280]  this is just in um google deep mine co-founder placed on leave
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:03.360]  from ai lab all right so can i read this
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:07.840]  on air okay so the co-founder of deep mine the high-profile artificial
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:12.800]  intelligence lab owned by google has been placed on leave after
[03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:17.200]  controversy over some of the projects he led
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:20.640]  so he runs the deep mines applied division which seeks
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:24.000]  practical uses for the labs research in health
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:31.840]  energy and other fields so um what is deep mine deep mind is google's
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:38.320]  ai manhattan project and it's being run out of china right now and
[03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:43.200]  this is really important because um uh peter teal
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:47.120]  did an article in the new york times you know asking
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:51.360]  whether google is committing treason by working with china's
[03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:58.320]  military for its ai manhattan project while at the same time
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:03.360]  cancelling projects with the u.s military you know and so
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:06.160]  the fact that the head of that's been removed that what what does that signify
[03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:11.120]  as a former google guy as an insider i mean something's big is definitely
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:14.000]  happening um symbolize shake up there's a
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:17.200]  shake up i'm not entirely sure what it means like google's been pretty good
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:20.960]  with um uh with with protecting its own like when
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:25.040]  we caught jenji and i um you know saying that she wanted to rig the 2020
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:27.920]  elections to prevent another trump situation google you know
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:31.280]  protected her and nothing nothing happened the fact
[03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:35.280]  that people are now trying to exit the company and this is breaking news is
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:39.680]  huge it's huge there's there's cracks that are beginning to form and again
[03:13:39.680 --> 03:13:42.960]  google is it just some search engine it's into thousands of companies it's
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:46.080]  buying everything up stifling free innovation
[03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.200]  and trying to push a global assistance that's why a lot of folks are like why
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:52.560]  don't use google why do you obsess on it because
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:56.000]  four billion people do it's the penopticon like
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:59.680]  it's the all-seeing eye everywhere like your email your
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:05.360]  your your your google chrome um every every kid's got like a chrome
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:08.880]  book it seems now for education everywhere you go
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:13.520]  there's a google product that you use and when i started let's just say it you
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:17.760]  know if my wife's not in the mood and i grab her ass she slaps it away
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:21.600]  well google's got their arm i don't mean to be gross up our ass i mean
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:25.360]  and a lot of us didn't ask for this yeah it's non-consensual right like
[03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:30.720]  it's non-consensual yeah so this is this is big news like it
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:35.040]  looks like something big is is trying to happen like the the wall street journal
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:40.000]  um yesterday uh uh my way snopes is fact-checking this they found it not
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:43.200]  true i was not right by mark zuckerberg it's not it's not a
[03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:47.600]  joke they just said it was fake wow we were trying to trick people i hope one
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:51.600]  day you can recover from that you know we're trying to trick them there
[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:58.480]  i know a doctor if you need one um yeah so um uh uh yeah so this this this is big
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:15:01.680]  this is big the fact that there's that there's someone leaving and the wall
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:06.480]  street journal just posted yesterday that the states are coming together in
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:11.280]  order to uh file an antitrust lawsuit against google
[03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:16.400]  for their improper censorship but what what the government's gotta get is
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:20.400]  we're now 15 months out from the election
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:24.400]  or less they've got the google gets it they're in a fight they're not giving up
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:28.320]  neither is the respect they're racing to steal it admitting they are we have all
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:32.480]  the internal documents we infiltrated them you came out i mean we've got a
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.760]  it's an open and shut case right so if we just keep like well we're gonna break
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:39.600]  you up or we're gonna they don't give a flying they're moving they're not
[03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:42.880]  giving up so what are you doing a crisis like that i think it's a national
[03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:47.200]  security issue as peter teal has said they're in bed with china so is apple
[03:15:47.200 --> 03:15:50.480]  i think you have to arrest leadership or let them steal the election and they've
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:52.480]  got the washington post saying china will crush
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:56.160]  trump in america when you have a pain in the neck

[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:42.880]  but you were you were explaining especially when you look at tim cook of apple's eyes
[03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:48.160]  that it's something else going on uh what's your experience uh there was something that
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:53.440]  i read somewhere in psychology where um one of the ways you can sort of lock someone into a trance
[03:20:53.440 --> 03:20:59.440]  is by like opening your eyes like this and continuing to continuing to talk so you'll see a lot of
[03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:04.320]  politicians a lot of people like open their eyes and just continue to talk and it's a good technique
[03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:09.120]  in order to deceive like people like i'm kind of doing it like right now look camera four it's over
[03:21:09.120 --> 03:21:13.440]  there can't camera four okay so you know if i'm if i'm wanting to tell you a lie then i'm going to
[03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:17.760]  open up my eyes real wide and i'm just going to talk to you and you're going to get locked into a
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:22.960]  trance and one of the key things is that you don't want to blink this is a little trick so is that
[03:21:22.960 --> 03:21:27.840]  why the info babes like on fox and stuff don't blink they're like they're licking their lips to
[03:21:27.840 --> 03:21:33.680]  the sexual thing they're doing that like literally trick our biology for a man to think mayan kelly
[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:38.560]  wants me but she doesn't yeah exactly and it's also the reason why they have like the spinning
[03:21:38.560 --> 03:21:43.600]  sigils like that basically they're trying to induce like a trance date to like prepare the person
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:47.920]  and you can actually see it like on the eg's you can see that people kind of like break into like
[03:21:47.920 --> 03:21:50.960]  i think it's like alpha waves or something they're trying to put you into a trance state yeah because
[03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:55.680]  the thing is is that as they get you into that trance state you they can give you you become
[03:21:55.680 --> 03:22:02.640]  more suggestible can we go back to the two minute video uh what's wrong big tech size i want to show
[03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:07.760]  tim cook size because i get what you're saying there it is i mean these under bright lights man
[03:22:07.760 --> 03:22:13.680]  you gotta be on some drugs to get your or is he had a brain chip i mean how do you do that right i
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:19.920]  mean and but the thing that you can notice is that his pupils are dilated and the the question
[03:22:19.920 --> 03:22:25.360]  that i have just looking at this picture not knowing it before is you know whether the light
[03:22:25.360 --> 03:22:30.560]  may be really dim but oh my god it looks like he's on some sort of drug right his pupils are just
[03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:37.600]  super dilated and so um wow yeah i know that in silicon valley there's there's a lot of micro
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:42.960]  dosing that goes on it's kind of like a like a mind hack um so i know you were talking about that
[03:22:42.960 --> 03:22:50.560]  earlier but um you know it should be a good question why why are his pupils so dilated uh
[03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:55.360]  we're gonna go to phone calls now first time a big google engineer has gone public and taken
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:23:00.560]  phone calls george chase uh linda everybody who's been holding the longest here we're gonna go to
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:09.440]  your phone calls right now uh let's uh go ahead and talk to vernon in florida you're on the air
[03:23:09.440 --> 03:23:15.920]  with jack jack with zack vorhees go ahead hey alex thanks for taking my call really appreciate what
[03:23:15.920 --> 03:23:21.920]  you guys do appreciate holding um just uh to comment on some of the censorship that i've seen from
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:27.920]  google is i own a small auto repair business here in florida and if somebody googles auto repair
[03:23:27.920 --> 03:23:34.560]  business near me literally sitting in my parking lot it will give them search results for whoever
[03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:42.080]  pays the most so i get telemarketing calls all the time saying that if i verify my listing
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:48.400]  and i spend enough money with them they'll bump my ad to the front of the list and so just you
[03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:54.960]  know i was making a comment as far as censorship that i've seen myself just a small business
[03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:59.280]  exactly you're going down the road you need gas or you need a carburetor and they don't
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:03.120]  tell you the places right there they tell you one five miles away because they pay yeah so i
[03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:08.080]  actually have the solution to this this thing are you on maps dot google.com is a listed business
[03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:14.880]  yes i am i verify to you know personally okay and so you've got to places that google.com
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:19.520]  sort of listing for your for your thing right and my understanding when i talk to one of the
[03:24:19.520 --> 03:24:25.760]  telemarketers is what they do is they actually sit there and search and search and search your
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:29.920]  business name if you pay them enough so that that way it gets moved to the top of the list
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:36.160]  regardless of location it'll still come up with whoever has paid them the most it doesn't really
[03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:42.560]  even matter as far as like uh sure that's fraud it'd be one thing if it said ad for mufflers
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:49.200]  or ad for transmission or auto repair and then showed you the closest result but
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:56.640]  now they only do it off who pays right you know so they're doing it off of user search traffic
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:25:02.960]  and so a lot of these people are seo wizards seo meaning search engine optimization and then
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:09.360]  what they do is that they fake user traffic in order to artificially inflate the perceived value
[03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:16.400]  of that link and it ranks it up so if you want to you know get into this the concept of google
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:23.200]  hacking is called seo okay i just and so what you've got to do is go hire a company to run a
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:27.680]  bunch of fake traffic to your business correct yeah they and that's what these companies call
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:31.440]  i mean up to three times a day i get a phone call from these companies listen i think that's
[03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:37.920]  terrible and bad but google actively suppressing the rnc being able to run an ad or something
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:43.120]  or twitter suppressing uh the rnc running an ad or facebook that's that's i'm not saying your
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:48.240]  problems not a problem i get it that's something that is being manipulated by locals through the
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:52.560]  system because google is designed to be hacked as you were saying but but the big enchilada is that
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:26:00.080]  it's it's being done to our entire election system oh yes it's way way worse politically as far as
[03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:04.880]  you know manipulate and elections and stuff it's just uh it can go all the way down to the local
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:09.040]  level of oh you're just giving us a local example which is very important thank you varnan uh let's
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:14.720]  go ahead now take another call uh let's talk to uh linda in new york you're on the air go ahead
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:22.480]  hi alex um thanks for all the good you do for the american people i'm trying um my question is
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:30.080]  would it be a value for zack to trade info with nsa database developer bill benny on data mining
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:38.960]  i kind of miss that trade info the data miner with bill william benny right so oh would you
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:44.240]  like to come on sometime with the former technical head of the nsa i would love to talk to nsa whistle
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:49.920]  blower bill benny he's he's a courageous individual you know who's who's come and reveal to the public
[03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:56.880]  you know the the the large surveillance apparatus that was pointed directly at them and vacuuming
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:04.160]  up all their data um you know the the big data thing is actually outside of my specialty but
[03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:10.080]  i'm sure that we can you know trade notes um and isn't that really what google is and and facebook
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:15.440]  it's like privatizing that same nsa system well yeah i mean the thing is is that we've heard a
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:23.280]  lot about the nsa data collection but google dwarfs that and you know the media has been
[03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:27.760]  pounding this drum oh it's really bad that the nsa has all this data it's really bad that the nsa
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:33.920]  has all this data but like it's it's completely dwarfed by what google has on you like they've
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:40.240]  got your real-time location data from your phone and they're so really i mean google is the real nsa
[03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:46.240]  yeah it's you know it's it's it's ridiculous to talk about the nsa when you know google and you
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:56.640]  know the old cia were far more insidious and comprehensive linda anything else no thank you
[03:27:56.640 --> 03:28:02.000]  very much thank you all right we got to go to break here in about 50 seconds but i promise every

[03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:19.040]  so how would you quantify that with 30 seconds how do we get the audience to realize how powerful
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:26.800]  they are look like every one of us should share info wars and tell our friends about it because
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:31.920]  the thing is is that you can either go viral through digital means or viral by telling your

[03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:43.280]  make this go viral by each one of us making it go viral it really is a fight between human
[03:28:43.280 --> 03:28:48.960]  intelligence and ai now because the ai's been hijacked all right jack before he's our guest

[03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:30.720]  to divide and conquer humanity and to really rob us of our birthright and the real potential we have
[03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:37.040]  in the general public makes decisions about our own development our own evolution i don't mean
[03:33:37.040 --> 03:33:41.280]  that from a darwinian perspective we're getting some fight about it we are evolving i'd say
[03:33:41.280 --> 03:33:48.640]  devolving right now and everything we've been given everything we've been to basically push is is is
[03:33:48.640 --> 03:33:54.320]  destroying human communities they want google and facebook communities where everything's 5g
[03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:59.120]  and you're inside these were bubbles and you're totally programmed these are corporations that
[03:33:59.120 --> 03:34:03.920]  want markets where they have captive humans that are totally under control it's like a proto
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:10.560]  matrix so zack vorhees we're gonna go back to these calls here you'll be back on the war room
[03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:15.200]  because you say you want to keep going you're on fire with will johnson is filling in roe
[03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:18.800]  and stroyer today when he's on a well-deserved vacation they'll be back with me for two hours
[03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:24.240]  to martin take more calls because google is suppressing your interviews they are blocking it
[03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:28.240]  they are tearing their hair out right now you're telling me off air that you're on air talking
[03:34:28.240 --> 03:34:32.400]  about all this because you've released the smoking gun documents of their blacklist
[03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:37.200]  and their perjury to congress this is huge yeah and big things are happening you know breaking news
[03:34:37.200 --> 03:34:43.360]  like today that um you know you know as a reminder the google deep mine co-founder placed on leave
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:50.640]  from ai lab and again that's the big real ai system that's the big that's the ai manhattan
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:53.920]  project that google is working on who do you think has the dominant system because we know
[03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:58.560]  ibm's involved we know microsoft is involved you know everybody's racing to get the ai
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:06.000]  yeah um i don't i don't know i do know that you know the big tech giants are they all have
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:11.200]  their own version and their own flavor of those competing ai yeah but google is the one with the
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:16.720]  most data and they went to china where there's no rules right and the thing is is that the person
[03:35:16.720 --> 03:35:23.520]  with the most data is going to have the best ai because ai is feeding off of data and so that's
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:31.440]  that's you know that's it you know nobody goes to a youtube version on ibm and so um you know
[03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:36.000]  google's why do you think they told the pentagon a year ago or two years ago now we're not going to
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:40.320]  work with you in the arrogance but we're going to move to china when we all know google was a
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:45.760]  nsa project right so you know google was funded by inkytel when it got it started so it was you
[03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:54.480]  know done with cia money um and the thing was is um google started a project with the us military
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:36:00.800]  called project maven which was going to use information from their geo databases and what
[03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:07.360]  happened was a bunch of a small contingent of employees decided that they were going to protest
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:13.040]  this and what was really weird is i got an email you know one time one day at my desk from the
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:18.480]  google executive team saying hey by the way well you know that there's going to be a protest today
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:24.720]  on project maven and if you want to join the protest then that's your right and you're not
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:30.640]  going to suffer any consequences they're promoting it yeah they're promoting it absolutely so they
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:35.120]  promoted this and then a bunch of employees walked out and a lot of people actually didn't end up
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:40.480]  walking out it was a it was a very very very tiny minority but then the media put pumped that up
[03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:46.240]  and then google threw up their hands they said look like we wanted to do this but our our employees
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:51.040]  are revolting so the truth is obama and all them said go with china and and once trump got elected
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:56.880]  the decision was final uh just like the washington post says we hope g can crush america it says
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:37:02.880]  you don't destroy trump destroy trump is the headline oh jeez destroy trump to save us of course
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:07.840]  it's it's so arwellian the corporations have made their deal with this guy because he's got a billion
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:13.360]  300 million slaves and it's just crazy how far they've gone let's go back to your calls okay he's
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:18.160]  been holding longest here ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten try to move quick
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:24.880]  here now uh let's go to uh ryan in florida ryan and we'll go to sarah ryan you're on the air thanks
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:30.880]  for calling alex jones general honey smack great to talk to you man it's an honor so what's what's
[03:37:30.880 --> 03:37:35.520]  your what's your question i wanted to ask you and jack both uh what do you guys think that
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:40.720]  president trump can do about all this big tech censorship that won't be uh negated by let's
[03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:44.640]  say a liberal judge you know we've seen every time a liberal judge doesn't like what he does boom now
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:49.600]  trump hands are tied what can we do personally or what can trump do like we're not able to rely on
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:54.960]  trump you know both of those kind of things what do you think we can do and um yeah so that's a very
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:38:01.440]  excellent question and so um my my plan for this is that with this document disclosure is that one
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:08.480]  tell your friends and download the information have them downloaded how to have you know educate
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:15.680]  yourself and three call your radio stations call your senators call your representatives
[03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:22.000]  and tell them that they need to stop tech censorship let your human voice be heard right
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:25.680]  because they're trying to suppress your speech online good we'll just do it the third dimension
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:31.280]  right and the thing is is that right now all the congress people are uh taking a break from
[03:38:31.280 --> 03:38:34.720]  congress so they're in their districts and they're listening to their constituents and you've got this
[03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:40.000]  like short window of opportunity to go and let your voice be heard so that when they all come back
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:46.240]  to washington dc this is going to be the topic on everyone's mind and you can tell that this is
[03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:51.680]  what's happening because you know the states are all bandied together for antitrust you know
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:56.240]  litigation which was reported by the wall street journal just yesterday so if you want to be part
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:02.480]  of this if you want to do america good and write then call your senator call your representative
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:10.160]  and tell them to stop big tech censorship it's not just censorship on conservatives they also
[03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:15.680]  censored tulsi gabard okay it's stop election meddling ryan great questions we're gonna move
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:21.200]  quickly everybody here let's go to sarah in california sarah you're on the air uh with our
[03:39:21.200 --> 03:39:27.840]  guests go ahead hi lucky was the day i found alex jones i just absolutely love your product we love
[03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:32.480]  you believe me it's a meeting but anyway i have so much to say here and i know you don't have much
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:39.920]  time we got time for you sweetheart go ahead thank you thank you so much i'm from the industry and
[03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:44.880]  had to step out of the industry because i'm from the organic industry meaning the real free market
[03:39:44.880 --> 03:39:51.520]  part i used to i worked for free third sentence and a content provider with 250 copywriters you
[03:39:51.520 --> 03:39:55.600]  know what i'm talking about yeah you you're getting absolutely hammered there in the the
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:40:00.880]  nutraceutical and health spaces it's really a bloodbath right now well well okay i have a
[03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:05.760]  question for you my question is you said the most a powerful statement when alex asked you the other
[03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:11.360]  day why did you do this and you said and you thought of every word and i wrote it down i had to go
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:15.520]  back and i've listened to all of them at least ten times all of those videos ten times because
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:20.800]  every word you said was intentional so you break down every word you're saying a lot you said i want
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:27.120]  to warn the american people ai weapons are aimed directly at your mind which taught which were
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:33.440]  which actually it it exposes the emotion machine for frequency modulation uh and so on and so forth
[03:40:33.440 --> 03:40:39.520]  so i wanted you to elaborate in reference to the weapons uh is it frequency based from the
[03:40:39.520 --> 03:40:45.120]  modern mincee's emotion machine working with the dopamine which the whole thing is a weapon system
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:50.640]  that's what he's saying right right but but specifically um what i specifically meant and
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:56.400]  dr robert ebbstein the former chief editor of psychology today is mapping this out very well
[03:40:56.400 --> 03:41:03.040]  and what he's mapped out is that the the the search prediction in google is one of the main ways
[03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:09.440]  that google is aiming their ai weapons at our minds and you know you can test this either by
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:14.400]  doing the clinton body count or you can even just type in men can and it will auto complete
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:19.600]  to men can have babies men can have periods and the thing is is that if you believe that this is
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:25.120]  what the consensus is thinking then you're going to go along with it because that's the way humans
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:30.640]  are we're heard animals in a way and so you know i i detail this at the beginning of the show with
[03:41:30.640 --> 03:41:35.840]  the ash experiment and i recommend that you look at the whole video on how that works and if you
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:40.800]  understand the ash experiment then you're going to understand how google is trying to program us
[03:41:40.800 --> 03:41:45.760]  through the auto search search suggestion they're trying to tell you what the consensus is
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:50.960]  and they're manufacturing that consensus and that they get you to accept that a man can have a baby
[03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:57.120]  and the and then facebook banned a republican ad saying we want strong women oh saying woman hurt me
[03:41:57.120 --> 03:42:02.160]  i mean that's a cult man that's a dangerous group and they're not just freaks they're killing the
[03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:06.560]  language they're killing the biological power of humanity yeah and they're trying to establish
[03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:12.000]  like a cult mentality right where words don't mean the things that they used to and you have to
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:17.360]  look at everything you subserve so you can be on twitter yeah you submit you can be on google
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:23.440]  you know what i'm not submitting a jack crab awesome yeah neither am i right like i came
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:29.520]  here to you know bus censorship open because i am anti censorship i believe in a free market for
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:36.000]  ideas and let the best idea win sounds like freedom to me sarah thank you great points

[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:34.480]  he's on the war room the last hour today we've got the great will johnson uh guest hosting that
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:38.480]  info wars dot com for us show but i want to get to all these calls for again but yeah i went and
[03:47:38.480 --> 03:47:42.880]  got genetic testing at a top lab and they they told me well you got the northern european thing
[03:47:42.880 --> 03:47:49.200]  40 have it your genes are turned off to be able to absorb b12 but my mitochondria was real rare
[03:47:49.200 --> 03:47:54.160]  it was operating at 100 the problem is it was like getting energy into it so kind of a mutant
[03:47:54.160 --> 03:48:00.560]  that's very rare to have 100 operation of mitochondria uh but then it's like typo negative
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:06.000]  people have that sometimes but then on top of it i i had trouble getting the energy into the cells
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:14.160]  though yeah exactly and i've i've got a genetic mutation two copies um in the mth fr gene um
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:21.760]  specifically called c667 t and um for me i'm able to bypass that with a special form of
[03:48:21.760 --> 03:48:26.560]  vitamin b9 called methylfolate so i've heard of that we would be looking into that so what did
[03:48:26.560 --> 03:48:31.440]  it do when you took it um what it does is it lowers the levels of homocysteine which is an
[03:48:31.440 --> 03:48:36.960]  amino acid that builds up in each one of your cells uh because you can't produce enough methylfolate
[03:48:36.960 --> 03:48:44.720]  and so by taking methylfolate directly then you bypass the the mth fr gene uh that is bottom line
[03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:48.320]  mother nature has some incredible stuff yeah and as you were saying to the last caller
[03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:54.800]  made you they're waging war on that yeah they're trying to wage war on alternative health um and
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:49:01.360]  what google's doing which is very insidious is that they are boosting non-credible non-authored
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:07.520]  pages ahead of really well researched papers on the internet and i'm insane what do you make
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:12.400]  of all the even of the journal american medicine admitting fluoride lowers IQs you know the thing
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:17.040]  is is that you've been beating that drum for years um and this was something that was really well
[03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:23.920]  known and there's a lot of research internationally showing that fluoride lowers the IQ of particularly
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:30.480]  males and now it's like okay well the i think the journal pediatric at pediatrics or something
[03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:37.040]  so much of that released a study saying that yeah like for each milligram of fluoride found in the
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:43.760]  pregnant mom's urine it like lowered the IQ by a certain amount and they tested this and they found
[03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:48.720]  that it was true and it's like duh this happens in like every single animal and the problem with
[03:49:48.720 --> 03:49:54.560]  fluoride is that it binds to aluminum and your body's trying to detox aluminum but the fluoride
[03:49:54.560 --> 03:50:00.800]  pulls it in and prevents it from being um excreted that's it you're so you're it's an adjuvant to
[03:50:00.800 --> 03:50:04.800]  make every other toxin stronger let's take some calls we'll talk about tomorrow's amazing
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:08.400]  jefferson in virginia you're on the air with a big whistleblower go ahead from google
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:14.720]  what's your take on this and we'll go to uh george thank you gentlemen uh zach i have
[03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:19.760]  to say you are very brave to be doing what you're doing i thank you as a patriot for america thank
[03:50:19.760 --> 03:50:26.160]  you thank you my question is how hard would it be technologically or software-wise for
[03:50:26.160 --> 03:50:31.680]  all the people that are on this blacklist at google that supposedly didn't exist to be reinstated
[03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:37.120]  and governed by a transparent algorithm rather than an opaque one that changes all the time
[03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:43.200]  yeah so that's a really interesting question first off if you're on a blacklist
[03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:47.200]  google will deny that you're on a blacklist they're not transparent about their blacklist they
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:52.000]  deny that they even have blacklist at all so even though you have a copy and you work there they'll
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:57.120]  lie yeah they'll lie about it and so the the question is how do you get off the blacklist i
[03:50:57.760 --> 03:51:02.640]  you know not even politicians are safe from this thing right so you know there's really nothing
[03:51:02.640 --> 03:51:06.880]  that you can do and this is the reason why that i'm now going to the people is because i couldn't
[03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:12.240]  change the company from within i'm now going to the people and i'm asking the people the we the
[03:51:12.240 --> 03:51:16.960]  people to let each other know that this is what's going on to let your senators and congress
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:23.520]  people know that this is what's going on and together as one force we can make a change and
[03:51:23.520 --> 03:51:28.320]  the thing is is that it's going to have to be up to the politicians to make this change now exactly
[03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:34.160]  what change needs to be done is something that's a little bit above me like i personally believe
[03:51:34.160 --> 03:51:39.040]  in the free market and i don't you know i i think that google was able to rise to power because of
[03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:43.360]  the distortion of the one they hijacked the whole thing it's a fraud now it's a fraud now right and
[03:51:43.360 --> 03:51:49.440]  so the thing is is that you know if we allow the free market to flourish then what's going to happen
[03:51:49.440 --> 03:51:54.400]  is that this is i believe going to just take care of itself what about prohibiting the four big tech
[03:51:54.400 --> 03:52:00.720]  companies from buying any new companies for three years um i think that that could be a step in the
[03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:05.520]  right direction you know some sort of you know antitrust regular because new companies pop up
[03:52:05.520 --> 03:52:10.480]  they just buy them they just buy them and then what they do is that they they blacklist other
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:16.400]  you know apps out of the different app stores you know you can't get on gab because twitter
[03:52:16.400 --> 03:52:22.880]  uh apple and the play store have forbidden it and that's just anti-competitive and
[03:52:23.520 --> 03:52:29.520]  you know they're they're now colluding as one big you know conglomerate even though they pretend
[03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:34.000]  big bully jefferson we gotta jump he's gotta come back tomorrow it's gonna be big you're making great
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:37.200]  points we should just start the show with how do we counter against this and what are they doing
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:42.320]  wrong uh let's go to georgia connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding george hi aj i i
[03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:48.880]  wanted to make a quick suggestion before i asked uh my question i think you should uh give a double
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:55.440]  points to anybody that gives like $50 or $100 straight up that way they they at some later
[03:52:55.440 --> 03:52:59.360]  stage when they want to buy products maybe they don't they have too much product right now that
[03:52:59.360 --> 03:53:04.480]  way you keep the money flowing and at least they get some something out of that i think that would
[03:53:04.480 --> 03:53:09.280]  encourage a lot sounds like a great idea yeah and another idea i think i think you should
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:17.680]  put up a couple of uh t-shirts one uh for uh white privilege or or guilt question mark and then put
[03:53:17.680 --> 03:53:22.320]  the mll question i thought it was the content of your character not the color of your skin type of
[03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:27.200]  thing i think it would be an absolute blockbuster at a picture of martin luther on the front and
[03:53:27.200 --> 03:53:32.160]  that that quotation i think almost everybody in america that's sick of tire this stuff would buy
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:37.920]  that even black people who are sick and tired of hearing that then maybe a double a new new shirt
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:43.280]  rape two eppstein clinton together and then the number of times he's been to the to the island
[03:53:43.280 --> 03:53:47.520]  and another another celebrities have been to the island i think that that would sell like hotcakes
[03:53:47.520 --> 03:53:52.160]  or the clinton body count on a shirt right i mean politics is downstream from culture
[03:53:53.440 --> 03:53:59.280]  yeah um so the question i are the question type of suggestion i'm thinking of why can't we get
[03:53:59.280 --> 03:54:03.920]  uh uh uh zack and a few other people like like you've already mentioned on the air right it's
[03:54:03.920 --> 03:54:08.960]  unfortunately in front of run fast like you can't remember the name but anyway start a new NGO that
[03:54:08.960 --> 03:54:14.560]  would be an advisor not only to the american politicians but internationally this becoming
[03:54:14.560 --> 03:54:20.640]  an international issue and it's basically coming right out of chai kong uh china basically so that
[03:54:20.640 --> 03:54:25.440]  people are feeling intimidated in all i think i think bob barnes is in studio next week he's
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:29.200]  trying to set that up he's doing a bunch of stuff but yeah we're all working together thank you so
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:33.040]  much george a lot of great points thank you and again tomorrow i'm going to be better about going
[03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:38.400]  to the colors early because they bring up some new questions now all right let's go ahead and
[03:54:38.400 --> 03:54:44.640]  talk to moving quickly here let's talk to jason in new mexico about an alternative to google go ahead
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:50.400]  he who controls the law excuse me he who controls the language controls the learning of the law
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:55.520]  thank you gentlemen for bringing up this very valid uh important topic it's it's actually uh
[03:54:55.520 --> 03:55:01.360]  life changing um one quick question that how do we get off the grid per save from from google how
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:06.240]  do we get off of the google you talk about google fasting yeah it's it's it's you got to do a google
[03:55:06.240 --> 03:55:12.720]  detox so you got to like switch from gmail to proton mail you've got to switch from google search
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:19.280]  to duck dot go or start page um you know you need to turn off the location services on your phone
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:25.200]  because you know if you go to youtube they are getting your data at any point and why give data
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:30.640]  to the enemy of america you know and so you got to identify all the different products that you're
[03:55:30.640 --> 03:55:35.520]  using and realize that every single time you use that product you're leaking metadata and they're
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:40.640]  vacuuming that up and they're selling it to god knows who across god knows what country some of
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:46.320]  them might be foreign adversaries to the united states but how do we do that if our kids have to
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:51.520]  have chromebooks to go to school and then also if you go to some of the newer platforms they say
[03:55:51.520 --> 03:55:55.680]  we'll try google chrome and then our site would work better you see it's kind of like they're
[03:55:55.680 --> 03:55:59.760]  hurting us sure no you're right we're out of time they force you into it yeah you're getting ahead
[03:55:59.760 --> 03:56:04.160]  of yourself just start it something simple and work down exactly you're not going to dominate
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:10.400]  all up front but just a 10 shift we'll start crippling this criminal organization we got a
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:15.360]  minute and 34 seconds and i wanted to go to john and ronnie i got to most people call me back
