[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:33.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.320 --> 00:42.880]  and it's time to blast off into the weekend it is Friday the 25th day of
[00:42.880 --> 00:50.640]  May 2012 and we're going to be launching via the Info Wars Command Center the
[00:50.640 --> 00:57.920]  Rolling Command Center this weekend on our way to Virginia and Bilderberg 2012
[00:57.920 --> 01:03.280]  and there are reportedly going to be well over a thousand people conservative
[01:03.280 --> 01:10.000]  Lee there I look forward to seeing you and I've got some information on that
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  coming up today I just saw this story earlier at info wars calm and I link
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.520]  through to the Daily Telegraph and newspapers in Australia it's true once
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.880]  a very free country under the Magna Carta it is now basically like China of
[01:29.880 --> 01:33.160]  course of communist Chinese pretty much on the country now over 90% of their
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.600]  rare earth minerals you name it so why not total global is treason but
[01:37.600 --> 01:43.800]  Australians face huge fines for speaking ill of new carbon tax if you talk
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.440]  about about the carbon tax they have passed the law and the commas are because
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.160]  they've already had two governments fall over trying to pass this it is a 50%
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.720]  tax on the sheep farmers and others so you can't even use your own property 20
[01:57.720 --> 02:03.760]  percent tax on others there's a whole they have TV shows about green police over
[02:03.760 --> 02:08.120]  there where you actually get forced home inspections and harassment the gen 21 is
[02:08.120 --> 02:14.640]  coming in there 100% and it's meant to shut down their industries of course the
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.240]  big globalist industries are all exempt if you didn't think small business was
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.680]  basically hanging on by its fingernails and almost extinct it will be now and
[02:23.680 --> 02:25.840]  of course you have the school teachers here saying talk about about the
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.960]  government you're gonna go to jail to the children this is the new model the
[02:28.960 --> 02:37.480]  reeducation camps are ready it's a 1 million 1.1 million excuse me in
[02:37.480 --> 02:48.840]  Australian currency 1.1 million if you speak bad about it because they're
[02:48.840 --> 02:52.280]  calling that a lie the government's passed a law that you can't talk bad
[02:52.280 --> 02:56.360]  because they say it's a lie what if police in Missouri when they got up on
[02:56.360 --> 02:59.760]  the news when Obama was campaigning four years ago in that newscast they said
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.960]  if you lie and they said for example and say he's not a Christian or it wasn't
[03:05.960 --> 03:12.720]  born here we will decide it's a lie and arrest you there's no law but we're gonna
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.960]  use false advertising and say that's what it is I mean these are tyrants so we
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.640]  say this won't increase prices no it won't increase prices at all California's
[03:22.640 --> 03:29.480]  got its 20% tax going in and there's a giant total exodus and San Francisco is
[03:29.480 --> 03:34.040]  an open sewer now because they've invited and paid for the homeless to come
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.680]  there from around the country so they can accost people and vomit and have
[03:37.680 --> 03:41.320]  sex in the streets and defecate everywhere there are some homeless now who
[03:41.320 --> 03:44.680]  are real homeless because the economy is imploding they're fed on and robbed by
[03:44.680 --> 03:50.800]  the gangs of drug-addled spoiled brats they all look like basically it's like
[03:50.800 --> 03:55.280]  an I've been to San Francisco many times like armies of Leslie Cochran's they're
[03:55.280 --> 03:58.600]  able to statue to here in Austin but it's like oh it's so cute the homeless
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.120]  guy I had an office next door where Leslie lived in luxury this is a guy
[04:04.120 --> 04:07.720]  went around cheerleader outfits with a big beard and I'm gonna hold my tongue
[04:07.720 --> 04:11.360]  about Leslie but if anybody ever criticizes me talking bad about his
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.360]  holiness I'm gonna tell you what I've seen okay including an access television
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.840]  a tin plus years ago when he had a show there and would use both the bathrooms
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.920]  I'll just leave it at that I'll just leave it at that I'm gonna stop right
[04:28.920 --> 04:33.080]  there the point is don't even notice what I'm talking about nationwide but
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.360]  side issue I just was reading how they're passing seven million dollars a
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.840]  year to fund a giant luxury condo thing for homeless but it won't be the real
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.560]  homeless the four families driven into homelessness the CPS takes their kids
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.840]  no it's gonna be a vomitorium like the Romans had for a bunch of people to run
[04:50.840 --> 04:55.760]  around inject heroin drink liquor and vomit all over each other I'm living
[04:55.760 --> 04:58.560]  that's what these guys do they they go around and vomit on each other I've
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.120]  witnessed it this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.400]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.400 --> 05:11.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[05:11.560 --> 05:15.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.120]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:19.120 --> 05:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.680 --> 05:27.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.120 --> 05:39.440]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.440 --> 05:42.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.280]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:46.280 --> 05:51.040]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[05:51.040 --> 05:55.320]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[05:55.320 --> 06:01.440]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:01.440 --> 06:04.880]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver
[06:04.880 --> 06:09.160]  lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and
[06:09.160 --> 06:13.440]  deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[06:13.440 --> 06:17.280]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for
[06:17.280 --> 06:21.640]  airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[06:21.640 --> 06:25.800]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and
[06:25.800 --> 06:31.120]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[06:31.120 --> 06:35.440]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now
[06:35.440 --> 06:40.680]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very
[06:40.680 --> 06:45.160]  easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and
[06:45.160 --> 06:51.280]  simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[06:51.280 --> 06:58.040]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[06:58.040 --> 07:03.480]  sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.960]  laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with pro-pure my
[07:07.960 --> 07:12.160]  friends I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar

[07:31.360 --> 07:35.520]  water from lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.400]  beneficial minerals which is key save money by not buying bottled water and
[07:39.400 --> 07:43.640]  avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic pro-pure is the best gravity-fed filter

[08:01.160 --> 08:06.960]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.960 --> 08:13.120]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network that's right it
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.760]  continues straight into this worldwide Friday broadcast the 25th day of May I'll
[08:19.760 --> 08:26.120]  be back this Sunday live from the road I'll probably already be in Tennessee on
[08:26.120 --> 08:31.400]  my way to Virginia to cover Bilderberg 2012 there in Chantilly and that is
[08:31.400 --> 08:34.760]  where it's located I made some phone calls yesterday they still got the
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.920]  conference set there they're not moving it so this is going to be exciting this
[08:39.920 --> 08:43.400]  is going to be powerful this is going to be informative we're gonna have live
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.000]  feeds not just during the radio show but it in the evening you name it we're
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.200]  going to do live shows for prison planet TV with a host in studio to be
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.480]  playing news clips and news packages we've done but I'll also be doing some
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.120]  live shows seven o'clock central from Bilderberg on the info wars nightly
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.160]  news as well last year we're going to the news I sent Paul Watson of England
[09:09.160 --> 09:16.040]  of Britannia and I sent Aaron Dykes of Texas we could have sent John Carter
[09:16.040 --> 09:23.440]  from Bar of Earth but the point is to the Swiss Alps in the James Bond setting
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.400]  of St. Moritz and just our Justin TV channel that we never even promote is
[09:28.400 --> 09:34.480]  just a backup had 3.5 million of views over three days we had some other
[09:34.480 --> 09:37.640]  channels with I don't know three or four million views as well putting it all
[09:37.640 --> 09:41.960]  together not to mention syndicated radio with the live feeds and video it was
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.520]  huge I mean we send our reporters ABC news goes and does live feeds and they
[09:47.520 --> 09:49.800]  don't even have counters but I've talked to people up there I mean they're
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.520]  nightly news only has a few million viewers on broadcast TV now and you're
[09:53.520 --> 09:56.320]  talking about maybe a few hundred thousand that end up watching videos they
[09:56.320 --> 10:04.160]  post online we the so-called alternative medium 3.5 million on a Justin TV
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.200]  channel I bet Justin TV made some moolah off that we don't we didn't make any
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.480]  money off the ads they placed over it every time you watch the live feed you
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.160]  had to endure a minute ad first and people that say well hey stream it on
[10:16.160 --> 10:22.560]  your own prison planet dot TV we can for subscribers but we cannot pay to have
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.640]  3.5 million people we're trying to work I'm able to put our own video ads over
[10:27.640 --> 10:31.920]  things but I don't even have sponsors that big to be able to pay for that I
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.000]  mean you're talking about conservatively 3.5 million views even low you know
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.680]  mid-range quality like Justin had we're talking probably fifty thousand
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.600]  dollars maybe more that's what we're talking about here even if you've got
[10:45.600 --> 10:52.560]  bulk bandwidth this is very expensive just the guys uploading to YouTube because
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.920]  we didn't change the data plan for Europe was thousands of dollars just in
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.000]  data uploads but here I am digressing on a syndicate radio show getting into
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.520]  kind of behind-the-scenes machinations and things that are going on take a
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.360]  little drink of the on tangy tangerine from info wars team dot com that is
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.080]  product placement by the way just because I have this actually want to drink
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.840]  I thought I'd do a product placement right now that's how you also fund us
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.280]  and that's good I didn't like how it tasted at first I'm completely addicted
[11:22.280 --> 11:26.040]  alright let's digress away from there as my brain bounces around like a ping
[11:26.040 --> 11:36.360]  pong ball we launched Wednesday two days ago the info wars social network to
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.320]  get people that love liberty together to organize pockets of resistance not just
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.600]  here in the US but worldwide against tyranny it exploded tens of thousands of
[11:45.600 --> 11:50.560]  people signing up hundreds of thousands in there looking at it and there's a lot
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.560]  of interactions with a social network checking all the statuses and things
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.120]  that's why the last one we had that got 30 plus thousand forty thousand I forget
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.480]  the exact numbers close to 40,000 members ended up crashing in but this time
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.160]  it's all been backed up checked there were a few tweaks that had to be made it
[12:05.160 --> 12:08.960]  got slow for about a day now it's working really good but we're still
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.760]  beefing things up that's why it's in beta and soon we're about to change the
[12:13.760 --> 12:21.080]  front page where whatever you vote up is the top groups and the top stories so
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.200]  there's gonna be a lot of new things getting added today and tomorrow at
[12:25.200 --> 12:30.920]  planetinfowars.com and I want to encourage and people are now doing this
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.280]  I'm seeing amazing articles being written I'm seeing incredible photos being
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.840]  linked to and posted I'm seeing really powerful poetry I'm seeing folks put
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.520]  together big compilations of globalist quotes I'm seeing people already
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.040]  organizing I'm seeing a lot of really cool stuff and I'm having to remind and
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.480]  encourage my writers and webmasters for info wars dot com prison planet com the
[12:53.480 --> 12:57.560]  editors to get in there and get some of the really powerful articles that are
[12:57.560 --> 13:00.240]  being written and to at least post part of them and then link back to the
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.520]  person's page so we're gonna really try to focus in and pay a lot of attention to
[13:04.520 --> 13:10.760]  planetinfowars.com but I'm also busy still and I think on the bus ride over
[13:10.760 --> 13:17.400]  two days up to Virginia that I'm gonna be rewatching because the problem is we
[13:17.400 --> 13:22.520]  had so many folks on the info wars reporter contest that's a good problem
[13:22.520 --> 13:28.800]  to have over a thousand total came in over 600 follow the rules and so qualified
[13:28.800 --> 13:36.560]  to be in the contest and I am going to sit there with our g4 connections on the
[13:36.560 --> 13:43.480]  different iPads and and Samsung pads and systems we have I'm gonna have four
[13:43.480 --> 13:46.800]  guys well there's four guys in the accounting the driver the three of us
[13:46.800 --> 13:53.520]  that aren't driving the bus I'll drive it some but are going to be going back
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.880]  over the ones we've already honed down about 100 so we're gonna try to while
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.040]  we're driving up there we're also gonna do some live reports that'll be at
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.840]  prisonplanet.tv on the way up there really is a beta test of all these new
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.640]  4g systems we've gotten and 3g's is back up and then we've got some good old
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.680]  fashioned backups as well where they jam our cell phones we're gonna have we're
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.640]  gonna have some other systems to be able to get the communiques out so a lot is
[14:22.640 --> 14:29.840]  happening a lot is happening a lot is going on and so soon I should be able
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.320]  to post I think we'll probably hone it down to about 20 and then post those 20
[14:35.320 --> 14:42.040]  videos in three rounds on infowars.com and just see your feedback have some
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.120]  crude voting systems where you can you know vote there on the site and tell us
[14:47.120 --> 14:51.920]  what you like that won't actually determine it but it'll feed into the
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.720]  feedback to see what you're liking you know kind of the wisdom of the crowd
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.680]  and we'll see where that goes so I'm gonna try when I get back from
[15:01.680 --> 15:05.960]  Bilderberg to collate the high-def footage and get that on the nightly
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.400]  news that we'll have all the mid-grade and well even some of the high high
[15:10.400 --> 15:17.840]  def will be going out if the g4 systems work properly we'll get back
[15:17.840 --> 15:20.800]  collate that get that on the nightly news as quickly as possible and on the
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.040]  radio show for you and then we'll also then try to start the whole public
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.960]  vetting of the male and female reporters that are gonna win the five
[15:30.960 --> 15:33.840]  thousand dollars each and then they'll obviously be in the front running of
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.760]  that if everything's continuing can be a satisfactory to all the parties higher
[15:38.760 --> 15:42.840]  people from the contest that is my intention but the the prize is the
[15:42.840 --> 15:50.440]  10,000 10,000 Federal Reserve notes that look like US money total fraud hiding
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.800]  in plain view so we'll be paying you in those those Federal Reserve notes that
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.640]  aren't worth the paper they're written on but as we predicted as the euro goes
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.520]  down first that makes the dollar go back up makes gold and silver go down but
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.760]  only for a time before its seesaws and the implosion starts here and even
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.440]  CNBC admits the United States is in much worse a shape than Europe once the
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.680]  implosion begins here we wish that wasn't the case but that is coming so
[16:16.680 --> 16:19.840]  those of you watch gold and silver dropping that is something that we have
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.720]  predicted before it rockets back up because all the mathematical facts all
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.400]  of history shows that they will hyperinflate the currency when they go
[16:28.400 --> 16:33.360]  to QE3 QE4 we thought that would start by early this year it has not happened
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.280]  yet but it's a foregone conclusion or all those derivatives are gonna go belly
[16:39.280 --> 16:47.240]  up and you see that starting with JPMorgan now but that itself will cause
[16:47.240 --> 16:51.800]  all sorts of problems I mean it goes from would you like to be shot in the
[16:51.800 --> 16:56.080]  head five times with a shotgun a double lock buck or 15 times with an AR 15
[16:56.080 --> 17:00.960]  223 I mean either way there's nothing there's nothing left here I mean this
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.480]  is off the charts crazy and it's we've we've all been maneuvered into this
[17:05.480 --> 17:13.520]  position but the elites themselves have lost control so it is definitely a
[17:13.520 --> 17:20.840]  crazy crazy crazy loco
[17:21.200 --> 17:32.720]  bonkers bizarro neverland dark crystal world that we are hurtling into head
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.680]  long that's really the best way to say it okay enough of the pleasantries and
[17:38.680 --> 17:45.640]  notes here there are no guests today and we are going to take a lot of your
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.640]  calls that probably means 20 calls is a lot for me as I never seem to get to
[17:49.640 --> 17:55.240]  them but when I do go to callers I tend to give you a lot of time on any issue
[17:55.240 --> 17:57.720]  you wish you discuss anything you'd like to talk about I'll give the phone
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.880]  number out at the end of the next segment I do want to tell you we've got a
[18:01.880 --> 18:07.480]  lot of really important news today I see these kind of articles about every two
[18:07.480 --> 18:14.440]  days and what's happening is I am becoming conditioned myself to just
[18:14.440 --> 18:21.160]  accept this and that's wrong and the reason I know that's happening is a
[18:21.160 --> 18:25.080]  couple years ago we see this come out every few weeks and I've covered but
[18:25.080 --> 18:31.920]  now it's every two days or so TSA robbing people's bags TSA grabbing small
[18:31.920 --> 18:34.880]  children taking them into rooms they scream and cry the father complains
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.760]  police come and baton them in the head or taser them people dying in TSA custody
[18:40.760 --> 18:47.000]  them robbing hundreds of people a week at major airports a piece just Kennedy
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.520]  Airport where I've had a present for my daughter robbed out of my bag they
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.720]  admit it's 200 plus robberies per week by the TSA the drug dealing the child
[18:56.720 --> 19:02.160]  molestation some of them are pimps drug dealers I mean it's incredible who else
[19:02.160 --> 19:09.680]  wants a job who else wants a job and I talked to some TSA that you know got it
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.640]  ten years ago who've come to my protest and things they go well I got it first
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.040]  just to search bags and stuff you know for security because it's decent paying
[19:17.040 --> 19:21.680]  but I quit when they started the groping so some people it was hey I'm you know
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.000]  been working at the post office I can get paid more over here I'll go here but
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.400]  as it got more and more evil incrementally the only people and I've seen it
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.160]  they want to pull out you know when a man's attracted to a woman and you see
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.020]  him pull good-looking women out of line if they're into women you see the
[19:38.020 --> 19:42.560]  pedophile types going after the kids you see the homosexuals going after the

[24:14.160 --> 24:22.920]  perfectly still but nobody wants to know him they can see that he's just a fool
[24:22.920 --> 24:31.640]  and he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill there have been so many
[24:31.640 --> 24:37.600]  Congress people so many movie stars so many models it's every week or so in
[24:37.600 --> 24:42.200]  the news saying this man this woman grabbed my genitals and clearly enjoyed
[24:42.200 --> 24:48.760]  it they either enjoy the raw power of it because it's all types of weirdos that
[24:48.760 --> 24:54.160]  are getting these TSA jobs and all sorts of perverts or they sexually enjoy it
[24:54.160 --> 25:00.880]  and undoubtedly when I was quote padded down in Las Vegas the person said I
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.960]  listened to your radio show I was listening yesterday this is my
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.000]  administrative privilege and was clearly enjoying the fact that I was awkward
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.760]  and couldn't do it and clearly enjoyed getting down on their knees in front of
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.520]  me they're listening right now and rubbing all over I mean this is bizarre
[25:22.520 --> 25:29.160]  and all these models of people come out and say yes the woman clearly enjoyed
[25:29.160 --> 25:32.960]  it there was no doubt about her sexual preference now it's one thing to have
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.680]  adults being abused and sexually assaulted that's bad that's illegal
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.040]  it's a felony the state police in Texas came out and tried to agree with the
[25:41.040 --> 25:44.880]  legislature and said it's a felony doesn't matter they're not going to stop
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.080]  psychologists have come out and said this is training children to be touched I
[25:49.080 --> 25:54.480]  mean I've always told my children if you're at a camp or something or at swim
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.960]  team and somebody starts touching you it's inappropriate anything other than a
[25:59.960 --> 26:05.360]  pat on the shoulder or whatever by an adult you know if a child comes over and
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.480]  hugs you or something that's fine and again then and then the system tries to
[26:08.480 --> 26:14.720]  even say hugging is wrong but then they make the government abusing you okay and
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.920]  now my children you know hear my radio show or they will be somewhere and they
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.660]  see it on TV I've been in a hotel room watching about the TSA on a vacation
[26:23.660 --> 26:27.560]  once they're like well what do we do you said don't let anybody touch us but if
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.920]  we ever fly we want to fly but we don't want to be touched by the TSA everyone's
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.800]  having to have this discussion and I had a several state reps on in Texas who
[26:36.800 --> 26:39.880]  unanimously as you know last year said you you can't do this it's already
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.720]  illegal we're gonna enforce the law what made them all blow up they've all got a
[26:43.720 --> 26:47.920]  fly quite a bit and they describe having their daughters and sons taken away
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.000]  and the daughters crying while TSA touches their breast and their genitals
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.880]  and I personally as a father can't handle it and I see it in the news where
[26:56.880 --> 27:02.640]  the parents get panicked and they tell them you stand there and then they
[27:02.640 --> 27:05.920]  arrest the parents when the child starts crying and you've seen the videos
[27:05.920 --> 27:09.640]  where they start pulling their shirts off searching them and and really getting
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.200]  off on it and you look at these TSA people they're the archetypal perv
[27:14.200 --> 27:17.520]  you know whenever the cops bust some guys around to pick up kids in a
[27:17.520 --> 27:21.280]  schoolyard or catch them grabbing a little kid they always look the same
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.960]  real wimpy little chicken necks you know how a pedophile looks and it's like
[27:25.960 --> 27:31.400]  oh my gosh you know how a heroin head looks you know how a crackhead looks I
[27:31.400 --> 27:36.160]  mean you can't always judge a book by its cover but the archetypal child
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.960]  abuser always looks the same whether they're black white Hispanic you know
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.800]  the look you've seen them real gross and you're at the airport and you see him
[27:46.800 --> 27:54.560]  I've sat there I was in California and I was went through they had a Starbucks
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.920]  right there I got a coffee because we got there early and so we gone to the
[27:57.920 --> 28:03.720]  checkpoint I said watch this and I sat there would do with Santa Rosa Santa
[28:03.720 --> 28:07.080]  whatever the big airport is outside Santa Cruz when we drove through there
[28:07.080 --> 28:12.600]  it's big and we even shot a little bit of video of some of it and they were they
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.200]  were not putting men through the scanners all they were putting through was
[28:16.200 --> 28:20.360]  women people and wheelchairs and children and we sat there for 30 minutes I
[28:20.360 --> 28:23.920]  went and got a newspaper we sat right there we even shot some video we vary
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.440]  on the nightly news and we also made the point they would body scan and then
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.320]  always pat you down see they said oh we'll just do pat down if you don't body
[28:32.320 --> 28:41.320]  scan San Jose dude just came in here everybody that there's always there's
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.760]  so many sand and sands this sands that around there I can keep track of a
[28:44.760 --> 28:49.440]  beautiful area the reason I'm prefacing all this before I get into all the other
[28:49.440 --> 28:58.000]  huge news is CBS news a defrock priest for reportedly you know what with little
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.840]  kids he's the head of TSA at the big Philadelphia Airport of course he is of
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.360]  course of course man was removed from ministry after three cases of sexual
[29:10.360 --> 29:17.000]  abuse against young girls oh my heavenly father please deliver us and this is the
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.160]  type of garbage that we deal with these wolves and I mean I'm telling you the
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.320]  guy that was rubbing I was wearing a t-shirt he was going this won't take too
[29:27.320 --> 29:35.640]  long and I'm just going what in Hades is this and I just wanted to get on the
[29:35.640 --> 29:40.040]  airplane and get out of there I mean in my entire life I've had medical doctors
[29:40.040 --> 29:45.720]  touch me and that's it I didn't like that and now I've had a man rub his hands
[29:45.720 --> 29:50.440]  all over my body and he was in a uniform this is the new America we're on the

[35:07.560 --> 35:12.600]  reporter Ben Siminoe shows us his conduct is under new scrutiny
[35:12.600 --> 35:21.800]  okay I tell you our video systems just do not work anymore we are at crisis level

[35:27.160 --> 35:30.880]  me do not know what's going on anymore so let's just recognize we've got a
[35:30.880 --> 35:35.880]  problem and let's get it fixed okay I mean we brought new computers to get
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.960]  around this and I don't know what I can do to be able to get these going is there
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.600]  anything we can do here go to rebroadcast
[20:52.900 --> 38:04.760]  of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line lay down GI lay
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.160]  down GI we saw it all through the 20th century and now on the 21st century
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.720]  it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.560]  crammed into this rat maze we should not submit to dehumanization I don't know
[38:17.560 --> 38:21.480]  about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world I'm concerned
[38:21.480 --> 38:25.600]  with the structure I'm concerned with the systems of control those that control
[38:25.600 --> 38:32.720]  my life and those that control me even more I want freedom that's what I want and that's what Jason wants
[38:32.720 --> 38:41.440]  it's up to each and every one of us to turn this into some of the greed, the hatred, the envy and yes the insecurities because that is the central mode of control
[38:41.440 --> 38:46.640]  make us feel pathetic, small so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our
[38:46.640 --> 38:51.880]  liberty, our destiny we have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a
[38:51.880 --> 38:57.080]  mass scale start challenging this corporate slave state the 21st century
[38:57.080 --> 39:07.080]  not the century of slavery not the century of lies and classism and all the rest of modes of control
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.080]  it's going to be the age of human crime standing up for something pure and something right
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.080]  what a bunch of garbage liberal, democrat, conservative, republican
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.080]  it's all there to control you two sides of the same coin
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.080]  two management teams getting for control the CEO job of slavery incorporated
[39:25.080 --> 39:29.080]  the truth is out there in front of you but they lay out this buffet of lies
[39:29.080 --> 39:32.080]  I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a fight out of it
[39:32.080 --> 39:33.080]  do you got me?
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.080]  humankind is too good
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.080]  we're not a bunch of underachievers
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.080]  we're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings
[39:43.080 --> 39:45.080]  we're going to be real beings
[39:45.080 --> 39:46.080]  the things that matter
[39:46.080 --> 39:51.080]  creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.080]  well that's it that's all I've got to say
[39:53.080 --> 39:55.080]  it's in your court
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.080]  hi ladies and gentlemen we're back here and you know my anger issues on air is not an act
[40:07.080 --> 40:09.080]  I hope everybody understands that
[40:09.080 --> 40:13.080]  I don't like my job particularly here all day
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.080]  knowing that America is helpless in the hands of a bunch of perverts and scum
[40:18.080 --> 40:20.080]  who are molesting our children
[40:20.080 --> 40:23.080]  and I see newscasts now from all over the country
[40:23.080 --> 40:26.080]  where you try to take a bus ride or you're driving down the highway
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.080]  and the TSA now wants to fondle your children
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.080]  let me tell you something you pedophiles
[40:31.080 --> 40:33.080]  you're not getting your hands on my children
[40:33.080 --> 40:36.080]  and we're going to wake this country up and take things back you pervs
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.080]  you see they know that if they can do that they can get away with anything
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.080]  so the social engineers are hiring an army of scum
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.080]  and you've got the report up at infowars.com right now
[40:49.080 --> 40:54.080]  i-n-f-o-w-a-r-s.com
[40:54.080 --> 40:59.080]  reported child molester
[40:59.080 --> 41:01.080]  who was defrocked over it
[41:01.080 --> 41:08.080]  TSA hired reported serial sex abuse priest pedophile as screener
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.080]  man was removed from ministry after three cases of sexual abuse against young girls
[41:13.080 --> 41:16.080]  CBS reports I just can't handle it
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.080]  when is this country going to wake up
[41:19.080 --> 41:21.080]  I can't even do this radio show now
[41:21.080 --> 41:25.080]  it's not just that the stupid CBS video that was playing earlier
[41:25.080 --> 41:27.080]  actually off their site quit working
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.080]  we need to re-download that ourselves and see if we can get it working
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.080]  that's not my only issue that's not why I got mad
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.080]  I have to fight constantly to not overturn this broadcast desk
[41:37.080 --> 41:39.080]  and start kicking holes in the wall
[41:39.080 --> 41:42.080]  and I'm not somebody that does that on any other issue
[41:42.080 --> 41:44.080]  I wreck my car I don't get mad
[41:45.080 --> 41:48.080]  you know crack a tooth I don't get mad
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.080]  lose my wallet I don't get mad
[41:51.080 --> 41:55.080]  but when I constantly learn about the globalist abusing children
[41:55.080 --> 41:57.080]  and bringing us into total bondage
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.080]  I am absolutely in a controlled rage right now
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.080]  every time I look at how innocent my children are
[42:08.080 --> 42:09.080]  and how good they are
[42:09.080 --> 42:11.080]  and I think of everybody else's children
[42:11.080 --> 42:13.080]  and I think of all the things they're doing to children
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.080]  it makes me angry to a level that is indescribable
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.080]  I feel like I could pull one of these people's heads off with my bare hands
[42:21.080 --> 42:23.080]  and you know what I'm talking about if you're a parent
[42:23.080 --> 42:25.080]  I am tired of it
[42:25.080 --> 42:27.080]  I am sick of it
[42:27.080 --> 42:29.080]  I am sick of it
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.080]  I have seen the photos from the families of their kids killed by CPS
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.080]  looking like concentration camp victims with their eyes sunk in dead
[42:37.080 --> 42:42.080]  I have to read constantly how they're grabbing two and three and four year olds
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.080]  and putting them on some cases 20 plus drugs on average seven
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.080]  until they start having seizures and then they put them on any seizure medication
[42:51.080 --> 42:54.080]  and turn them into little zombies and kill a bunch of them
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.080]  and none of you people are standing up
[42:57.080 --> 42:59.080]  you police you bureaucrats
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.080]  I am offended by all the races I hear about
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.080]  to race for homeless children
[43:06.080 --> 43:08.080]  that means kids the system's taken
[43:08.080 --> 43:12.080]  or the race to help this orphanage or that
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.080]  or the race to find a cure for breast cancer
[43:14.080 --> 43:16.080]  it's all by design
[43:16.080 --> 43:18.080]  the breast cancer off the charts
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.080]  the autism
[43:20.080 --> 43:23.080]  the breakdown of the family by design
[43:23.080 --> 43:27.080]  and then for little issues they take people's children
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.080]  and no one enforces against the CPS
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.080]  where they literally put them in cages in basements
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.080]  a lot of them don't even want to rape them
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  they just want the money
[43:37.080 --> 43:39.080]  so they feed them almost nothing
[43:39.080 --> 43:40.080]  put them in dungeons
[43:40.080 --> 43:41.080]  lock them up
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.080]  when they get caught
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.080]  the judges say the CPS is allowed to do that
[43:45.080 --> 43:49.080]  and they give them all these drugs
[43:49.080 --> 43:50.080]  and then they rape them
[43:50.080 --> 43:53.080]  and I just can't handle it anymore
[43:53.080 --> 43:54.080]  okay
[43:57.080 --> 43:59.080]  I know why a lot of people want to live in denial
[43:59.080 --> 44:01.080]  and just go off and not care about this
[44:01.080 --> 44:02.080]  but let me tell you something
[44:02.080 --> 44:03.080]  you're not going to hide from this stuff
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.080]  you're not going to hide from this stuff anymore
[44:10.080 --> 44:13.080]  you are not going to be able to get away from the evil
[44:13.080 --> 44:15.080]  we're all going to be judged
[44:15.080 --> 44:17.080]  for the 52 million abortions
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.080]  and the millions of dead
[44:19.080 --> 44:20.080]  this global empire is killed in our name
[44:20.080 --> 44:22.080]  in just the last decade
[44:22.080 --> 44:24.080]  and we're all going to be judged
[44:24.080 --> 44:26.080]  for everything we've done
[44:26.080 --> 44:27.080]  and if you don't believe in God
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.080]  hey that's your issue
[44:29.080 --> 44:30.080]  the world, history
[44:30.080 --> 44:31.080]  what comes around goes around
[44:31.080 --> 44:33.080]  when you don't care about anybody
[44:33.080 --> 44:34.080]  when you get into evil
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.080]  when you think torture is cool
[44:35.080 --> 44:38.080]  it's going to end up happening to you or your children
[44:38.080 --> 44:40.080]  you're a cop and you beat up innocent people
[44:40.080 --> 44:41.080]  and frame people
[44:41.080 --> 44:44.080]  your son or daughter is going to die in a car wreck
[44:44.080 --> 44:46.080]  or is going to get cancer
[44:46.080 --> 44:48.080]  that's just how it works
[44:48.080 --> 44:49.080]  that's what God's fearing is
[44:49.080 --> 44:51.080]  you people have no idea
[44:51.080 --> 44:53.080]  what you have crossed the line on here
[44:53.080 --> 44:55.080]  and what gates you've opened
[44:55.080 --> 45:00.080]  as hell is spilling out into this country and worldwide
[45:00.080 --> 45:03.080]  and I have got chills
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.080]  I'm not afraid of the New World Order
[45:05.080 --> 45:06.080]  and all their scum
[45:06.080 --> 45:08.080]  I'm afraid of the big guy upstairs
[45:08.080 --> 45:10.080]  and I can feel the anger
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.080]  I can feel it down here
[45:12.080 --> 45:14.080]  and let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen
[45:14.080 --> 45:16.080]  we're going to get everything we deserve
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.080]  everything we deserve
[45:19.080 --> 45:22.080]  everything all of us have done
[45:22.080 --> 45:24.080]  is going to come back on us
[45:24.080 --> 45:26.080]  multi fold
[45:26.080 --> 45:28.080]  multi fold
[45:28.080 --> 45:30.080]  all of it
[45:30.080 --> 45:32.080]  all of it
[45:32.080 --> 45:34.080]  none of you are going to escape judgment
[45:34.080 --> 45:36.080]  you people that like to abuse children
[45:36.080 --> 45:38.080]  you demons
[45:38.080 --> 45:40.080]  you are going to pay
[45:40.080 --> 45:42.080]  do you understand that
[45:42.080 --> 45:44.080]  you aren't going to outrun anything
[45:44.080 --> 45:46.080]  I know you want to take a bunch of little kids with you
[45:46.080 --> 45:48.080]  but they're not going to go where you're going
[45:48.080 --> 45:49.080]  you understand that
[45:49.080 --> 45:51.080]  their pain is going to be short lived
[45:51.080 --> 45:52.080]  compared to what you're facing
[45:52.080 --> 45:53.080]  do you understand that
[45:53.080 --> 45:55.080]  you're going to get a trillion
[45:55.080 --> 45:57.080]  times what you do to those children
[45:57.080 --> 45:59.080]  it'd be better for you
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.080]  to go out in the ocean and tie a big anvil
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.080]  you know the things always getting dropped
[46:03.080 --> 46:05.080]  on Wiley Coyote's head
[46:05.080 --> 46:07.080]  I know you're public school educated you pervs
[46:07.080 --> 46:08.080]  you don't know what that is
[46:08.080 --> 46:09.080]  to tie a big chain around an anvil
[46:09.080 --> 46:11.080]  and tie it around your neck
[46:11.080 --> 46:13.080]  and throw it into 10,000 feet of deep water
[46:13.080 --> 46:15.080]  that'd be a lot better thing for you to do
[46:15.080 --> 46:17.080]  or go hang yourself
[46:17.080 --> 46:19.080]  like Judas Iscariot
[46:19.080 --> 46:21.080]  than what you're going to be facing
[46:21.080 --> 46:23.080]  you're going to go and hide in caves
[46:23.080 --> 46:25.080]  and beg for the ceiling to fall in on you
[46:25.080 --> 46:27.080]  and it's not going to
[46:32.080 --> 46:35.080]  I can't take my children on their plane ride
[46:35.080 --> 46:37.080]  and now you can't take them on a cruise ship
[46:37.080 --> 46:39.080]  they started the pedo stuff there
[46:39.080 --> 46:41.080]  and you can't take them on a bus
[46:41.080 --> 46:43.080]  because the pedos are there
[46:43.080 --> 46:45.080]  and they're there because you know I can't do it
[46:45.080 --> 46:47.080]  because it's not just that I don't want my children being grabbed
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.080]  I can't physically let you do it
[46:50.080 --> 46:52.080]  and they've got cops in the airports
[46:52.080 --> 46:53.080]  they're to protect the pedophiles
[46:53.080 --> 46:55.080]  and they'll gun you down
[46:55.080 --> 46:57.080]  and high five after you're dead
[46:57.080 --> 46:59.080]  and they're going to
[46:59.080 --> 47:01.080]  that state legislature they abuse them
[47:01.080 --> 47:03.080]  members of congress have complained
[47:03.080 --> 47:05.080]  TSA says we know who you are congressman
[47:05.080 --> 47:07.080]  get over against that wall
[47:07.080 --> 47:09.080]  and they come up and the congressman we played the clip
[47:09.080 --> 47:11.080]  said it hurts and they sit there and laugh at them
[47:11.080 --> 47:13.080]  with a cop sitting there with a taser
[47:13.080 --> 47:15.080]  don't you slap his hand away
[47:15.080 --> 47:17.080]  and if you try to leave the airport
[47:17.080 --> 47:19.080]  we're going to charge you
[47:19.080 --> 47:21.080]  with a violation and charge you $10,000
[47:21.080 --> 47:23.080]  get up against that wall congressman
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.080]  this is about the power of us
[47:25.080 --> 47:27.080]  a bunch of scum
[47:27.080 --> 47:29.080]  just like Sodom and Gomorrah
[47:29.080 --> 47:31.080]  they come to the door
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.080]  with Lot and his
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.080]  wife and children in there
[47:37.080 --> 47:39.080]  and they say come out and have sex with us
[47:39.080 --> 47:41.080]  and they go no we're not going to
[47:41.080 --> 47:43.080]  and they go we want your children
[47:43.080 --> 47:45.080]  or we're going to kill you
[47:47.080 --> 47:49.080]  I forget the whole story of the bottle
[47:49.080 --> 47:51.080]  and the adults are like we'll come out and talk to you
[47:51.080 --> 47:53.080]  no we want the children
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.080]  hey guys will you bring up the
[47:55.080 --> 47:57.080]  story of Sodom and Gomorrah
[47:57.080 --> 47:59.080]  Sodom and Gomorrah
[47:59.080 --> 48:01.080]  men at the door demand children
[48:01.080 --> 48:03.080]  I'm going to pull up the exact
[48:03.080 --> 48:05.080]  King James version of that and read that to people
[48:05.080 --> 48:07.080]  and now they're here they're like
[48:07.080 --> 48:09.080]  we're here we want your kids
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.080]  we're going to put vaccines in them
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.080]  we're going to say that we have
[48:13.080 --> 48:15.080]  parental consent even when we don't
[48:15.080 --> 48:17.080]  the state's now injecting them without
[48:17.080 --> 48:19.080]  being totally illegally
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.080]  we're going to take them and give them abortions
[48:21.080 --> 48:23.080]  we're going to do all this we're the state
[48:23.080 --> 48:25.080]  we're your God we're the state
[48:25.080 --> 48:27.080]  we want your children every criminal
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.080]  sick system throughout history wants that
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.080]  there it is King James
[48:35.080 --> 48:37.080]  the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
[48:37.080 --> 48:39.080]  and there came two angels to Sodom
[48:39.080 --> 48:41.080]  and even and Lot in the gate
[48:41.080 --> 48:43.080]  of Sodom and Lot seeing
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.080]  them rose up to meet them and he bowed
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.080]  himself with his face
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.080]  towards the ground and he said behold
[48:49.080 --> 48:51.080]  now my Lord turn in
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.080]  let me find the part control left children
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.080]  or maybe sons
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.080]  they wanted his sons
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.080]  there it is and the
[48:59.080 --> 49:01.080]  mid said in the lot haste thou
[49:01.080 --> 49:03.080]  hear any besides
[49:03.080 --> 49:05.080]  son-in-law and now sons and daughters
[49:05.080 --> 49:07.080]  and whosoever thou has the city
[49:07.080 --> 49:09.080]  bring them out to this place
[49:09.080 --> 49:15.080]  now that's where their God sees and destroy the city
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.080]  I'll find it during the next break and read it when we come back
[49:21.080 --> 49:23.080]  good job pulling it up
[49:23.080 --> 49:25.080]  oh man it gives me a headache
[49:25.080 --> 49:27.080]  it ups I haven't even gotten into the news yet
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.080]  there's so much of it it's all off the charts
[49:29.080 --> 49:31.080]  confirming everything every day
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.080]  everything we've said is just absolutely
[49:33.080 --> 49:35.080]  confirmed in spades in triplicate
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.080]  lit up on fire
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.080]  and and it's worse than I thought
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.080]  and it's all going to happen and it's all coming
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.080]  and it's just going to get worse and crazier
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.080]  and the average
[49:45.080 --> 49:47.080]  person out there has no idea what's even going on
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.080]  the average person still has no idea
[49:51.080 --> 49:53.080]  what we're up against
[49:57.080 --> 49:59.080]  Obama is so cynical Obama told
[49:59.080 --> 50:01.080]  older unemployed workers start
[50:01.080 --> 50:03.080]  your own business really I don't
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.080]  get a tax incentive starting my own
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.080]  business operation and hiring all these people
[50:07.080 --> 50:09.080]  I've called the city and they laughed at me
[50:09.080 --> 50:11.080]  but if I was the formula one guy
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.080]  I'd get the whole track
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.080]  and everything paid for with taxpayer money
[50:15.080 --> 50:17.080]  so he could give you know four billion
[50:17.080 --> 50:19.080]  dollars to one daughter and millions of the other
[50:19.080 --> 50:21.080]  and they've got the two biggest houses
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.080]  in the US now hundreds of millions of
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.080]  peace 40 plus thousand square feet
[50:25.080 --> 50:27.080]  with my money
[50:27.080 --> 50:29.080]  they've built scores of tracks
[50:29.080 --> 50:31.080]  worldwide always paid for by you
[50:31.080 --> 50:33.080]  and then those very rich people
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.080]  come in lobby to raise middle class
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  taxes so they can steal it all
[50:37.080 --> 50:39.080]  and bank your bailouts and corporate welfare
[50:39.080 --> 50:41.080]  and the dumb down general population
[50:41.080 --> 50:43.080]  is being taught get rid of the middle class
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.080]  that'll make you rich it's the middle class
[50:45.080 --> 50:47.080]  buying cars hiring people
[50:47.080 --> 50:49.080]  doing all this stuff that runs the economy
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.080]  I'm so sick of crony capitalist trash
[50:53.080 --> 50:55.080]  you people are a bunch of scum
[50:55.080 --> 50:57.080]  and you're going to get destroyed by your own system

[51:09.080 --> 51:11.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[51:11.080 --> 51:13.080]  than silver or gold it's true
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.080]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.080]  before in this country and it's possible
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.080]  that could even happen again so our friends

[54:38.080 --> 54:40.080]  at the airports and everywhere else
[54:42.080 --> 54:44.080]  to have their way with us
[54:44.080 --> 54:46.080]  because they're simply trying to break our will right now
[54:46.080 --> 54:48.080]  and I've talked about that at nauseam
[54:48.080 --> 54:50.080]  because it's so important
[54:50.080 --> 54:52.080]  I told you a decade ago
[54:52.080 --> 54:54.080]  tens of thousands of drones were coming to the skies of America
[54:54.080 --> 54:56.080]  and would be weapons
[54:56.080 --> 54:58.080]  it's now CBS news associated press
[54:58.080 --> 55:00.080]  salon
[55:00.080 --> 55:02.080]  how did I know?
[55:02.080 --> 55:04.080]  MIT and the Pentagon said it publicly
[55:04.080 --> 55:06.080]  around 90%
[55:06.080 --> 55:08.080]  of what I cover is totally
[55:08.080 --> 55:10.080]  in the mainstream news
[55:10.080 --> 55:12.080]  but they spin it like it's good
[55:12.080 --> 55:14.080]  or it's in government documents
[55:14.080 --> 55:16.080]  or think tank documents
[55:16.080 --> 55:18.080]  about another 8%
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.080]  or so is sources
[55:20.080 --> 55:22.080]  as a journalist
[55:22.080 --> 55:24.080]  I have a lot of sources I wear the journalist hat
[55:24.080 --> 55:26.080]  I wear a commentator hat
[55:26.080 --> 55:28.080]  I wear
[55:28.080 --> 55:30.080]  a patriot's cap
[55:30.080 --> 55:32.080]  simultaneously
[55:32.080 --> 55:34.080]  and a hater of evil
[55:34.080 --> 55:36.080]  I don't like
[55:36.080 --> 55:38.080]  people that abuse innocent people
[55:38.080 --> 55:40.080]  it makes me feel very very violent
[55:40.080 --> 55:42.080]  and that's a normal activity
[55:42.080 --> 55:44.080]  you know I have two French bulldogs
[55:44.080 --> 55:46.080]  sweet little thing
[55:46.080 --> 55:48.080]  we also have a lab that was dumped
[55:48.080 --> 55:50.080]  that we found out by our place
[55:50.080 --> 55:52.080]  we found out by our place
[55:52.080 --> 55:54.080]  we found out by our place
[55:56.080 --> 55:58.080]  and
[55:58.080 --> 56:00.080]  sometimes when I get home at night
[56:00.080 --> 56:02.080]  my wife's already asleep
[56:02.080 --> 56:04.080]  and they know the sound of my car
[56:04.080 --> 56:06.080]  and stuff so they don't get up but then if I walk by
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.080]  the bedroom
[56:08.080 --> 56:10.080]  go into the garage or something
[56:10.080 --> 56:12.080]  I hear the little Frenchy
[56:14.080 --> 56:16.080]  Sparky
[56:16.080 --> 56:18.080]  the little gray brindle
[56:18.080 --> 56:20.080]  French bulldog
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.080]  the normal instinct that he's sitting there
[56:22.080 --> 56:24.080]  in bed with my wife curled up with her
[56:24.080 --> 56:26.080]  and he sees somebody walking by
[56:26.080 --> 56:28.080]  he wants to know I'm here
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.080]  and I know my little dogs aren't tough
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.080]  but they would bite somebody
[56:32.080 --> 56:34.080]  they were hurting my children
[56:34.080 --> 56:36.080]  why won't men get involved
[56:36.080 --> 56:38.080]  and see it as a destiny
[56:38.080 --> 56:40.080]  and a mission to go after the globalists
[56:40.080 --> 56:42.080]  and expose them
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.080]  I don't know how parents just turn their kids over
[56:44.080 --> 56:46.080]  and the kids start crying a lot
[56:46.080 --> 56:48.080]  I've seen it at the airport
[56:48.080 --> 56:50.080]  they just scum
[56:50.080 --> 56:52.080]  they come over and get off on it
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.080]  they have these sick looks on their faces
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.080]  with a little kid
[56:56.080 --> 56:58.080]  it's touched on and that's another reason
[56:58.080 --> 57:00.080]  I'm driving to Virginia
[57:00.080 --> 57:02.080]  I'm not even afraid of saying no to the scanners
[57:02.080 --> 57:04.080]  and all of that
[57:04.080 --> 57:06.080]  for me it's more of an anthropology research
[57:06.080 --> 57:08.080]  to go through it
[57:12.080 --> 57:14.080]  it's that
[57:14.080 --> 57:18.080]  I'm just seeing it done to the other people
[57:18.080 --> 57:20.080]  it really does torture me
[57:20.080 --> 57:22.080]  and I don't understand how it doesn't torture
[57:22.080 --> 57:24.080]  the rest of America
[57:24.080 --> 57:26.080]  I watch a three year old girl
[57:26.080 --> 57:28.080]  going mommy mommy and they're like it's okay honey
[57:28.080 --> 57:30.080]  and the men and women take them away
[57:30.080 --> 57:32.080]  and put them in the little glass box
[57:32.080 --> 57:34.080]  and the little kid puts their hands up
[57:34.080 --> 57:36.080]  and gets microwaved and they bring them over
[57:36.080 --> 57:38.080]  and then some perv comes over
[57:38.080 --> 57:40.080]  just rubbing all over the little girl
[57:40.080 --> 57:42.080]  I can't handle it
[57:42.080 --> 57:44.080]  I'm aiding and abetting
[57:44.080 --> 57:46.080]  I don't go over there and say listen you pervert
[57:46.080 --> 57:48.080]  this is illegal
[57:48.080 --> 57:50.080]  the police can't do this
[57:50.080 --> 57:52.080]  you're being trained to be a prisoner
[57:52.080 --> 57:54.080]  so
[57:54.080 --> 57:56.080]  that's why I don't fly basically anymore
[57:58.080 --> 58:00.080]  and I know I spent the whole first hour on this
[58:00.080 --> 58:02.080]  it just shakes me to my very core
[58:02.080 --> 58:04.080]  what does it do to you
[58:04.080 --> 58:06.080]  I feel weak and pathetic
[58:06.080 --> 58:08.080]  if I watch it
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.080]  but then I still end up singing on YouTube
[58:10.080 --> 58:12.080]  trying children
[58:12.080 --> 58:14.080]  being trained
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.080]  they're training us for checkpoints for blood tagging
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.080]  they're training the kids in public school
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.080]  their parents can't come get them
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.080]  they take them to FEMA centers
[58:22.080 --> 58:24.080]  they have the kids with their hands up and walk on the buses
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.080]  elementary students with police aiming guns at them
[58:26.080 --> 58:28.080]  we're all being trained
[58:28.080 --> 58:30.080]  to live in a giant reeducation camp
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.080]  martial law system
[58:32.080 --> 58:34.080]  and it's painful to watch
[58:34.080 --> 58:36.080]  the sleeping giant that is America
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.080]  awaken
[58:38.080 --> 58:40.080]  this is
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.080]  this is
[58:42.080 --> 58:44.080]  this is GCN
[58:44.080 --> 58:46.080]  the Genesis Communications
[58:46.080 --> 59:10.080]  Radio Network
[59:16.080 --> 59:18.080]  all of these filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%
[59:18.080 --> 59:20.080]  easy to set up and use
[59:20.080 --> 59:22.080]  doesn't require electricity
[59:22.080 --> 59:24.080]  purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells
[59:24.080 --> 59:26.080]  this filter system leaves
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.080]  in beneficial minerals which is key
[59:28.080 --> 59:30.080]  save money by not buying bottled water
[59:30.080 --> 59:32.080]  and avoid BPA that leases from the plastic
[59:32.080 --> 59:34.080]  Propeur is the best gravity-fed filter out there
[59:34.080 --> 59:36.080]  it's what my family uses
[59:36.080 --> 59:38.080]  Infowars.com

[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:22.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.080]  Alright, this is going to be a big hour with open phones. I'll get the number out in the next segment.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080]  Start going to your calls.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:44.080]  I mentioned this earlier as it ties into TSA hired reported serial sex abuse priest.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:52.080]  Cut a file as screener. CBS News and others are reporting that it's at infowars.com.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:01:05.080]  But earlier, I was going over the areas of Genesis 19 shot him and Gamora destroyed.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:13.080]  And in verse three, but he insisted Stowe strongly that they did go with him and entered the house.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.080]  He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast and they ate.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.080]  Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.080]  They called out the lot. Where are the men who came with you tonight?
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.080]  They were younger, I remember the rest of it.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080]  Bring them out so we can have sex with them.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.080]  I went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, No, my friends, don't do this wicked thing.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.080]  Look, I have two daughters. That's right. They offered him somebody who have never slept with a man.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.080]  Let me bring them out to you and you can do what you like with them.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:51.080]  I can't Bible's wild folks, but don't do anything to these men for they have come under the protection of my roof.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.080]  That's what they were angels. That's what it was.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.080]  It was another case in there where they wanted people's kids.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.080]  It all runs together. It's been a while since I was in Sunday school.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080]  Get out of our way. This is verse nine.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:13.080]  They replied, This fellow came here as a foreigner and now he wants to pay and play the judge will treat you worse than them.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.080]  They kept bringing pressure on lot and move forward to break down the door.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:23.080]  But the men inside reached out and pulled a lot back into the house and shut the door.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:33.080]  Then they struck them in who were at the door of the house young and old with blindness so they could not find the door.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.080]  And it goes on from there.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.080]  So a lot went and spoke with the sons in law and they were pledged to marry his daughters.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.080]  He said, Hurry and get out of this place because the Lord is about to destroy the city.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.080]  But his sons and laws thought he was joking.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080]  And it just goes on.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.080]  But you know, you read that the Bible like, Oh, really, they're coming to the door demanding, you know, hand them over to us.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.080]  But you go and hand your kids over to the TSA and every two days.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:16.080]  Now, I see an article where they catch them with child porn or grabbing little kids or raping the next door neighbor or raping women in parking lots or dealing drugs or stealing or making fun of each other or raping each other.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.080]  And I couldn't believe it last time I flew out of Austin.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:27.080]  The adventure just got more and more horrible because I guess they've gotten rid of most of the good TSA people before they weren't that bad that would ask for autographs and stuff.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080]  You're a troublemaker, aren't you? Where are you going?
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080]  I thought the guy was joking.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080]  So I wasn't even talking yet.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080]  He goes, Yeah, I know you are Alex Jones.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:44.080]  I was just looking at the guys like this is supposed to I said, Yeah, I'm going to meet Jesse Ventura who's suing you guys.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.080]  And he really enjoyed like he was the big man.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.080]  He was going to tell the radio host, Hey, you're a troublemaker.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080]  Came over with his chest sticking out.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080]  This is his country.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080]  Now I do it.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.080]  He won't.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:03.080]  By the way, in Steve Watson's article, TSA hired accused sex abuser, priest, pedophile and screener.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:10.080]  We have links to the mainstream newscast, both video and text admitting they no longer do the background checks.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080]  Of course not.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.080]  They want the abusers.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.080]  They want the criminals.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:21.080]  They want them and they're hiring them and they're hiring illegal aliens and they're hiring foreigners and they're hiring criminals and they're hiring them all.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:30.080]  If you get on to the bottom of the article, again, you can see the different newscast and links where they are not even doing the background checks.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.080]  But that's okay because, you know, this is the frontline of defense.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:41.080]  They're running your ticket that they're putting you on no fly list, no judge or jury, but the actual criminals,
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.080]  they're going to commit more crimes groping your family.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.080]  See, it's a total criminal design.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080]  Can you be a police officer with a criminal record?
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080]  No.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.080]  Can you be a TSA minion and break the law as a criminal?
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.080]  Yes, because only criminals will do the job.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.080]  Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, all of them hire criminals.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.080]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]  It's true.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.080]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.080]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.080]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080]  Into the next.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.080]  But right now, let me give you a smattering of some of the news coming up.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:27.080]  CBS News is reporting TSA hired accused sex abuser, priest, pedophile and screener.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.080]  He stepped down at the three girls said he did.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.080]  You know what to him?
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080]  Oh boy.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.080]  And I mean, it's every couple days they catch him doing stuff with kids or kidnapping kids or whatever.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.080]  This is insane.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.080]  Also, we're going to be playing the clip where they go confront.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080]  He's the head guy over the main gate area.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080]  Oh, he's the commander, of course.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.080]  And we also have links to mainstream news admitting what we reported on years ago.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.080]  They just ignore the background checks now.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.080]  Again, because there's terrorist everywhere, but let's just ignore background checks and let's hire illegal aliens and all the rest of it.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:05.080]  It's total theater, but not theater to make you feel safe theater to train you that you're a slave and have no fourth amendment.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.080]  And there's no jurisdiction the feds can't be in.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:18.080]  Then also Canada's maple spring hits fever pitch, but risk becoming neutralized by the globalist.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.080]  Syria, Yemen and America's quest for imperial dominance.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.080]  Yeah, you mean the bankers that run America setting up imperial dominance using Al Qaeda.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:33.080]  Australians face huge fines for speaking ill of new carbon tax 1.1 million Australian.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080]  I'm not kidding.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080]  There's links to Australian newspapers.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.080]  If you say it's bad, you're arrested and you get a million dollar fine.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.080]  Oh, I thought that was free speech.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080]  I mean, that's like communist China or worse.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.080]  Warren Buffett's buying up newspapers, eyeing internet paywalls for content.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.080]  And they already had companies try this and get countersued into oblivion.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:01.080]  But they go out and they even try to say a paragraph of an article that you post and link to so you can say, Hey, here's the article.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:09.080]  That's how it started with talk radio host 15, 20 years ago, having websites as you wanted to show people what you were going to talk about that day.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]  Like, go look at this.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080]  Tell me what you think.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.080]  You get traffic, they get traffic.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:22.080]  In fact, the old days when I knew what they were doing, they would send out and say, please, please post a couple paragraphs of this and link to us.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.080]  Not anymore because no one wants to read their garbage anyway.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.080]  So what they're saying is, oh, Warren Buffett says he's going to sue everybody.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080]  So it's just pure harassment.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  Already hundreds of newspapers, ABC News, you name it, are paid by the Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:41.080]  Half of it's Warren Buffett's money are paid to write great articles about how he likes ice cream cones and loves the children.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080]  That's that's literally the PR, what they say.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.080]  Not joking.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.080]  And Bill and Melinda Gates are superheroes.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:52.080]  That's what they pay for them to say that the that's the scyop they came up with.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:58.080]  Oh, look, he wants to tax the rich people because he's the biggest recipient of bailout money individually, your tax money.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080]  And he wants more of it.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.080]  He says, get the rich man.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.080]  He means somebody making 125,000 a year.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080]  So we're going to be going over that.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.080]  You've got Politico, Washington Post and others basically saying Obama is done for.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.080]  So I think Dr. Corsi and Dr. Tarpley and so many others are right.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:21.080]  The system is getting ready to flush Barack Obama down the toilet.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.080]  But the issue here is Mitt Romney.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080]  Why do they want him?
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.080]  He can at least get conservatives to go back to sleep who are waking up.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.080]  He likes carbon taxes, open borders, all the rest of it.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.080]  Maybe he helped write Obamacare.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.080]  Bain Capital that he's still one of the biggest owners of is the big funder of Obama.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080]  But it's time to put a new front man in.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:51.080]  So things are shifting towards Mitt Romney and suddenly all the conservatives that don't like anti-gun stuff and all this, they're going to suddenly love it.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.080]  Because, hey, Mitt Romney's white.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080]  That's a big part of it.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080]  You know, people learn to hate folks.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.080]  Everybody learned to hate Bush and then they gave you Obama.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080]  He was the savior.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.080]  He was the Christ.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]  He actually said that in the news.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.080]  So that's coming up.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.080]  By the way, the toll free number to join us is 800-25-99-231.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.080]  I have a question for you.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.080]  Is there anything the American people won't put up with?
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080]  Is there anything?
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.080]  Because a lot of people are getting mad about TSA and it's not flying, so their answer is we'll just be on the street corners.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080]  We're coming after you.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080]  We're coming after your children like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080]  They're coming to the door, banging.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080]  Bring them out.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080]  Bring them before us.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080]  Federal grants for checkpoints taking blood.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.080]  Always excuses for the tyranny.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.080]  30,000 drones, all of it.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:48.080]  Now that every few days, because I check it every few days, and there's always a new article about another TSA agent arrested raping a woman,
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:54.080]  raping a child, statutory rape with a 13-year-old, selling drugs, robbing people's bags,
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.080]  stripping their clothes down naked, running through the airport, screaming,
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]  I'm God.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.080]  Type in TSA agent, goes insane, says he's God arrested.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080]  Why is it at multiple times?
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.080]  It's a certain type.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080]  A lot of them aren't pedophiles.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.080]  They just like bossing people around all day.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.080]  I mean, if I got somebody out of my house to do yard work,
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.080]  I remember growing up working for a couple of different golf courses,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.080]  and I would watch these golfers boss the greenskeepers around and get off on it.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.080]  And I was always embarrassed for them.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080]  And I've seen that.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.080]  People loved to boss the handyman around.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.080]  People loved to chew out the person.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.080]  But then those of us that are nice, because all these clerks and people are getting treated so bad,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:47.080]  they turn into monsters, and then they're rude to us, and then we put up with it.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.080]  I mean, thank you, you get like double a tip from me now.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080]  And by the way, I used to be a big tipper.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:59.080]  If you don't say thank you, you don't say you're welcome, you don't get a tip.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080]  And everybody says no problem.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.080]  Really, I say thank you, and it's no problem.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080]  If you don't want this service job, don't take it.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.080]  Now, you go to a nice restaurant, it's thank you.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.080]  Because they're successful people.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.080]  Some of those waiters are making more than doctors at, you know, steak houses and places.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.080]  You have a problem.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.080]  But I couldn't imagine having somebody at my house doing yard work
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.080]  and talking down to them and chewing them out and bossing them around.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080]  That is so embarrassing.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.080]  But losers, I've always noticed losers.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.080]  Losers enjoy it.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.080]  It's one thing you got to get in somebody's face because they keep screwing up
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.080]  or there's problems or frustration.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.080]  But I'm not able to jump on people and mess with them and play games for their power trip.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080]  That's what tyrannies are.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080]  This is key.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.080]  You are about to say, so listen to me, please.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  The essence of tyranny and all its flavors is that it's people who are corrupt,
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:02.080]  combining forces together to control and dominate those that are producing.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.080]  And that means producing beauty, producing literature,
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.080]  producing science, art, success. They're parasites.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.080]  And they have a million excuses for what they do.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.080]  They have a system they always push of how it's for your own good.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.080]  It's the same throughout history.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.080]  We only live 75 years on average, folks.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.080]  We repeat the same stuff.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.080]  We store up knowledge and then we die.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.080]  And the next generation has to experience it again instead of learning from past generations.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.080]  But here's the essence of what I'm trying to say.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:39.080]  Tyranny is a system of losers who get together as a gang to take over so they can have status and power,
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:43.080]  not because they earned it, but because they stole it.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.080]  And they, I've always noticed there's a difference between a winner and a loser.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:55.080]  Winners admire honorable success, admire beauty, admire strength, admire.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:02.080]  I mean, I remember my dad bought me a dirt bike when I was a little kid.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080]  So I'd already had a moped.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.080]  And the neighbor kids had always had four wheelers and always great dirt bikes.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.080]  And I was always thinking it was cool. They never let me ride on them.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.080]  And they came over and were so jealous.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.080]  And then later I left it out and they knocked it over and stuff that I had to do.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080]  I mean, who cares?
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.080]  But then I realized about half the population is like that to degrees.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.080]  They hate somebody who's worked and has a new car.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.080]  They hate somebody who owns land.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.080]  They hate beautiful people.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.080]  I've always noticed, you know, the easiest women to get a date with are the most gorgeous.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.080]  If you just go over and are charming and talk to them nicely.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  Because everyone's either intimidated by them or they hate them.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:50.080]  Women especially, a gorgeous woman walks in and women start talking trash about them, many women.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.080]  And that's the spirit of the age.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:58.080]  I mean, I see a guy with an absolutely knockout gorgeous woman whose eyes are got electric fire in them.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.080]  I just admire the human body and God's creation.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.080]  And I start thinking about boy, but they'll have some great kids and have a good family.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.080]  I hope they, I hope they have a good life.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.080]  You know, that's the difference between Alex Jones and people that love liberty and people that,
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.080]  the globalist when they talk about this at Bilderberg from our sources and Tucker's confirmed this.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.080]  The big point is, I can't believe there's enough money for there to be a bunch of protesters even in the mountains of Switzerland.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080]  We've got to shut their economy off.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  But if we do it too fast, they'll revolt and overthrow us.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080]  We've got to do it incrementally.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080]  So they're so poor, they can't be here.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.080]  Poverty has always been a tool of the ultra rich.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080]  They always are monopoly men.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080]  Competition is a sin to them.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:47.080]  And they team up with the low level rabble scum, put them in bureaucratic uniforms, police uniforms, all of this.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.080]  And build them as their army over everyone.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080]  And so we know this design.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.080]  We know this signature.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080]  We know this wavelength.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.080]  We know what's growing and now coming to completion.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.080]  And they've studied tyranny and they know it always falls.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:11.080]  So they've given it a skeletal exoskeleton of technology, but it's still got the same spineless, spineless chicken neck spirit at its core.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]  It will fall.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.080]  It will rot.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080]  It will implode.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]  It will backstab itself into oblivion from the foundations of the earth.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080]  It was doomed to fall upon completion.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:26.080]  And it's already begun to collapse as they try to, at light speed, build on top of the new castle in the sand as it implodes.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:33.080]  We've got to create a graphic of a sandcastle collapsing, a global sandcastle that the little goblins building by the seashore.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:39.080]  And as it's falling, they're at light speed, like the flash going, trying to build it.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.080]  That's what they're doing.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:47.080]  It's collapsing and they're just trying to, trying to, instead of building it on the rock of liberty and freedom and goodness.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.080]  Your calls are coming up, banning free speech in Australia.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.080]  More attack drone news.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.080]  Ben Lawden being exposed as the whole killing being fake.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.080]  Huge amounts of key data on the economy.

[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.080]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:13.080]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.080]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.080]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:29.080]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.080]  that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.080]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.080]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.080]  But what if these things went away?
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.080]  Would you know how to protect your family in a natural or man-made disaster?
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.080]  Would you know how to survive?
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.080]  When disaster hits, power and water are gone and the mobs go crazy grabbing food off the shelves.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.080]  You and your family may be waiting in long lines for help.

[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.080]  So John covered that on the nightly news and people took it as if he was bashing people in England.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  You know, Lord Monkton likes the founding fathers.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:08.080]  The parliament over half voted for the colonies in 1775 and 1776
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.080]  until the king went and gave a speech and then they got behind the war.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.080]  But our biggest supporters were in England.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.080]  The Magna Carta came out of England.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080]  It's not America versus England.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.080]  It's the globalists that have taken us all over.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:27.080]  Condescending people with British accents all over our TV, telling us what to do.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080]  I mean, it's terrible.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080]  And no one would like that over in England.
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.080]  You know, I have the Watson Brothers because they're smart guys and love liberty.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080]  They work for Info Wars and Prison Planet.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.080]  But they absolutely hate the monarchy and the whole New World Order system.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:46.080]  And, you know, I mean, I don't care what your accent is if you love liberty.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080]  It's just, these are globalists.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.080]  But I just thought that was an interesting issue to raise that.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.080]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.080]  Julio, Mark, Shane, Blue, Don, and others.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080]  It's going to take calls the rest of the hour.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:04.080]  Then coming up, the system starting to go sideways on Obama, Australia banning free speech,
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080]  and a lot more.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080]  That is all coming up today.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  Julio in Illinois.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080]  Julio, welcome.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]  Aloha, Alex.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.080]  Aloha, everyone out there.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080]  I was at the NATO summit.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  I was inside McCormick Place, and I have to admit that was the biggest controlled media
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.080]  operation I have ever seen in my entire life.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:30.080]  And it goes to show you that corporate media, not just here in the States, but throughout
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.080]  Europe, really depend on government talking points.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.080]  No, you don't get into any of these things more than once if you don't regurgitate every
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.080]  word you're told.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.080]  Exactly.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.080]  It was all press releases.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.080]  I was inside Obama's press conference, and he already selected who he was going to pick
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.080]  for his press conference.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.080]  I even took a nap, Alex, no joke.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.080]  I took like a five-minute nap because he was the biggest puppet in the world.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.080]  Just being in his presence was just terrible.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.080]  I was at the Secretary General's press conference.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.080]  I asked him about domestic extremists.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.080]  He said NATO wasn't necessarily worried about it, but they are aware.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  And I find it interesting since here in the States...
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.080]  NATO is aware of evil Americans?
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.080]  Yes, NATO is aware of it.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  They're not that concerned, but obviously here in the States, Homeland Security is terrified
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.080]  of us.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.080]  But what was the most powerful thing, Alex, was actually outside McCormick Place when
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.080]  the Iraq veterans against the war threw their NATO medals.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]  I was crying, Alex.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.080]  It was so beautiful to see our veterans against the war.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.080]  Well, you know, Napoleon, you can pull up the quote.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.080]  He said, you know, isn't it a ridiculous joke that men will throw themselves on the bayonets
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.080]  for little pieces of metal and ribbon?
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.080]  And the guys pull up the exact quote of Napoleon about how medals are a joke.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.080]  But it's very similar to what I just said.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080]  I just paraphrased it.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080]  It's all a joke.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.080]  They take the troops' death benefits now when they get killed.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080]  They steal them.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  I mean, you are seen as a joke.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.080]  They let you use DU because it soft kills you.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.080]  America's gone.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.080]  We only get it back by admitting what's happened.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  Exactly.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:22.080]  Alex, I interviewed a veteran about depleted uranium and about Homeland Security calling
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.080]  him a domestic terrorist.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080]  And he was furious.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.080]  He was outraged at our government for calling him that.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.080]  Well, you know, I'm aware of your work over the years.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.080]  You do a great job as a journalist.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.080]  What's your take on the people saying they were set up with the mall off cocktails, saying
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.080]  it was beer making equipment, and that the people that basically gave them the apartment
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080]  were informants and set them up.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080]  I mean, the government does that every case.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080]  Is this case different?
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.080]  No, it's no surprise at all.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.080]  It's funny because there are stores in Chicago, Alex, that sell homebrew equipment.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:56.080]  So it's just hilarious that, you know, the Cook County and CPD would be charging them
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  with terrorists.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.080]  No, one of our salesmen brought me some homebrew he made once.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.080]  It was pretty good, actually.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.080]  Well, how evil?
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.080]  How evil that someone would make their own beer?
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.080]  Gosh, they put them in a FEMA camp immediately.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.080]  You know, Alex, you know what's crazy is the, you know, all the media had to take a special
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:19.080]  shuttle to McCormick Place from the Hyatt Regency, East Wacker, Chicago.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080]  They were special, though.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.080]  It was outrageous, though.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.080]  You had to go into a special room downstairs, turn in your equipment.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.080]  There were secret service agents with dogs searching all of your equipment.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.080]  I was able to get a little bit of footage through my spy camera.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:39.080]  It was outrageous, and then you had to wait in another room to wait for yourself to be
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.080]  searched by the special secret service agents.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.080]  I'll tell you what, Julio, contact us.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.080]  I might want to get you on as a guest when you get that video uploaded.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.080]  We can show some of it on the nightly news.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.080]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.080]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:30:00.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.080]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water?
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.080]  And laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.080]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.080]  My friends, I've done a lot of research.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.080]  And the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.080]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.080]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.080]  There's no priming required.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.080]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.080]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.080]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.080]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.080]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.080]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.080]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.080]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.080]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.080]  It's what my family uses.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.080]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.080]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,

[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.080]  They call it a survival seed bank

[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080]  for you and your family.

[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.080]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.080]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.080]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.080]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:48.080]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.080]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.080]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.080]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.080]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.080]  A decision is being made by the President
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.080]  and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.080]  When they realized there was no possibility of recalling the wing,
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.080]  there will be only one course of action over.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.080]  A total commitment.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.080]  Mandry, here we call what Clemens once said about war.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:28.080]  No, I didn't think I'd do that.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.080]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:37.080]  When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:42.080]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.080]  They have neither the time, the training,
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.080]  nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.080]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.080]  Okay, we're gonna go straight back to your phone calls
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.080]  and then to stacks of vital news and information.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.080]  Turn out the lights, the largest U.S. cities,
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.080]  are becoming cesspools of filth and decay.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.080]  China gets two to three new coal-flower plants a month.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.080]  We shut down dozens every month,
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.080]  and they paid to move General Motors to China,
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.080]  and China's buying up newspapers, TV stations,
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.080]  the biggest theater chain and controlling stocks
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.080]  in the big Hollywood production companies.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.080]  This is the globalism. This is economic bondage.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.080]  This is how the globalists are taking us over.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.080]  The police train for civil war against the people
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.080]  to make sure we put up with the end of America.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.080]  That is the bottom line, so that's coming up briefly.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.080]  Most importantly, we sell and promote products
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:54.080]  that we believe in and that we use.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.080]  And so that means they're high quality
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080]  and we've researched them well.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.080]  But on top of that, your purchase makes
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.080]  this truly independent front-line media operation
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.080]  that is contending with the dinosaur media
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.080]  able to operate, able to get more reporters,
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.080]  able to expand our operations,
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.080]  able to up the quality of our transmissions
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.080]  and our reach, and we are doing that.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.080]  Better believe we're dedicated and working hard
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.080]  and fighting on every front for liberty
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.080]  and doing the best job we can.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.080]  We have a spectrum of incredible products
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.080]  and books and videos, something I haven't plugged.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:33.080]  This was going, they're safe, for upwards of $1,000
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.080]  for 20 tablets during the start of Fukushima.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.080]  Fukushima is still ongoing.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.080]  I'm taking Montofilan, the best brown seaweed out there
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.080]  for optimum health of the thyroid and other issues.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.080]  But at the same time, in case there is a big
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.080]  reactor meltdown, the number one thing that screws you up
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.080]  is the thyroid taking on the radioactive iodine,
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.080]  TheraSafe 1995.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.080]  Lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080]  You're going to free citizen rulebook bumper stickers with it.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080]  Nobody can match that.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.080]  The tiny profit we make funds our operation.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.080]  TheraSafe, this is what the Homeland Security uses.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  This is what the military has been stockpiling.

[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.080]  The latest info proving six hours of footage
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  that it's an inside job.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.080]  A noble lie, Oklahoma City 95.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080]  Professional film of the eyewitnesses of the feds
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.080]  blowing at sky high.

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.080]  I drink it at half strength, though,
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.080]  so I can drink four glasses of it instead of two.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.080]  I just absolutely enjoy it.

[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.080]  Enough of my ranting.

[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.080]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.

[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.080]  Okay, let's now hurry to calls.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080]  Shane in California.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.080]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.080]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.080]  I'm doing good, my friend.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.080]  Great. I got a quote for you
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.080]  and a quick question.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.080]  Okay.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:49.080]  All right.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.080]  Well, this is Thomas Payne from Common Sense.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.080]  The robber and the murderer
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.080]  would often escape and punish.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.080]  It does not be injuries which are temper
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.080]  sustained, provoked, and digested.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  Now, I know I can hear you.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.080]  You've been pretty frustrated with
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.080]  all these criminals running around
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.080]  and nothing being done about it.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.080]  And I'm pretty frustrated about it too.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.080]  And a year has gone by now
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.080]  and I was wondering, are you now ready
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.080]  to talk about arrestwanted.com
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.080]  where users can post for free,
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.080]  suspected felons,
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.080]  offer a reward pledge
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.080]  for the arrest and conviction
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.080]  leading to a successful conviction?
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.080]  Well, the problem with having a website
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.080]  where you just say this person's a criminal
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.080]  is that somebody might end up
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080]  being innocent that's on there
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.080]  and then you're totally open up for defamation.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  If somebody does something to them,
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.080]  you know, I mean, I remember looking at your site
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080]  and I'm not saying you're a bad person,
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.080]  but I have a pretty good understanding
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.080]  of what's reckless
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.080]  and so I choose to not be part of that.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:01.080]  And you just read a quote by Patrick Henry
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.080]  or was it Thomas Paine?
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.080]  I don't remember now.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.080]  The point is, was it Thomas Paine
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.080]  about how the system lets criminals go?
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.080]  It's always done that.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.080]  For a very short time,
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  in period and controlled areas,
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  they actually went after criminals.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.080]  This is one of the only countries
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.080]  that's ever actually done it
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.080]  and really thrown the book out of them.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.080]  You say what you want about some of the Muslim countries,
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.080]  they actually go after criminals.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.080]  Unless you're the Saudi royal family,
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080]  they can do whatever you want.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.080]  But the point is, is that we've never reached a point
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:39.080]  where the power structure is more criminal, more openly.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080]  I mean, it's illegal in the TSA.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.080]  It's a misdemeanor when they touch on the outside.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.080]  It is sexual assault when they go on the inside.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.080]  It's a felony in every state and federally.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.080]  They just do it.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.080]  I've had prosecutors on.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  The county that San Francisco is in,
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.080]  I forget the name of the county,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080]  he said he's going to have deputies in there.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:00.080]  And if he sees them touching people's genitals,
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.080]  they're going to go to jail.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.080]  He's going to arrest them.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.080]  Well, that never happened.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.080]  So I don't know.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.080]  And the last time I heard it,
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080]  it's still going on there.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.080]  So where are the police?
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.080]  You know what?
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.080]  I would really get behind the police
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.080]  if they started arresting some criminals,
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.080]  some government criminals.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.080]  But a lot of these prosecutors and a lot of these mayors
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.080]  and police chiefs are crooks.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.080]  I mean, that goes without saying.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.080]  And they're there just revenue generating
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.080]  and responding when there's a murder or something.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.080]  But overall, they're just mafia.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.080]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.080]  But enough of what I have to say.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.080]  Mark and Texas, go ahead.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  Welcome.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.080]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say kudos
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.080]  on doing the void on social networks.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080]  And the site is moving quickly now.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.080]  It got bogged down a bit while we tuned something.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.080]  That's why it's in beta.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.080]  We want to hear your suggestions.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.080]  But let me tell you, it's a full-time job now,
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  just looking at all the incredible articles,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.080]  original research, poetry, you name it,
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:05.080]  being written and posted there on the site,
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.080]  PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.080]  Well, I plan on getting very involved in that
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.080]  because I heard that you were going to be doing
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:21.080]  some things that were in beta, like audio blogs.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.080]  They actually, you can get your point across that way.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.080]  Yeah, and people can already go to, like,
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080]  Blog Talk radio and do your own blog and things
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:31.080]  or do your own YouTube.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  And if you don't want to be on camera,
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.080]  you just show a computer screen while you talk.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.080]  The best thing to do is film over your shoulder.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.080]  That's what I do at home.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.080]  I actually just handheld it myself.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  I need to get a better tripod,
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  but haven't figured out how to set it on a big tripod
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.080]  yet to do it properly and then have it over my shoulder.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.080]  But the point is, just have 20 or 30 articles
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080]  you want to talk about.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.080]  Film over your shoulder while you click.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.080]  That's a YouTube radio show.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  And if you've got good information and content,
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.080]  you start doing a show once a week.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.080]  You'll end up reaching thousands of people
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.080]  conservatively every week.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.080]  And that's what we need is millions of voices
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.080]  against tyranny.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080]  Go ahead.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.080]  I agree with your sentiment on the last call,
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  or he kind of gave me a perfect end.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.080]  But we have a right to be faced by our accusers,
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:19.080]  which is one of the problems I'm having right now.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:24.080]  See, I'm deep within FEMA Region 6 as well.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.080]  But I'll quote somebody.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.080]  Lord Harrington from the 14th century,
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.080]  British satirist.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.080]  And he wrote a thing called treason.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.080]  If treason does prosper,
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.080]  pray what is the reason?
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.080]  If it does prosper, none dare call it treason.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:44.080]  Well, we can flip that on this new world order
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:50.080]  by just letting people know if you're ready to prosper,
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.080]  none dare call it treason.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.080]  Because he works through us or not at all.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:59.080]  I'm more of a spiritually driven individual on this,
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  you know, this flesh is an empty vessel.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.080]  No, I agree with you.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.080]  And this is all a test.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.080]  And those that are blind spiritually don't realize that
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.080]  and they laugh at us.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.080]  The fool has said in his heart, there is no God.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080]  They look at all these stupid, worldly preachers
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.080]  and people don't think that's what we're talking about.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.080]  It's the opposite of that.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  But everything, due process, being able to face your accuser,
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080]  it's all been destroyed.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.080]  All the time, they have known criminal, three-time loser,
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:35.080]  felons, get up on the stand and denounce people
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.080]  with no criminal record.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.080]  The jury is not told it's a three-time felon.
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.080]  And they professionally, every week,
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.080]  go in and send innocent people to jail.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.080]  And so let's be clear.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.080]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.080]  We have to face this evil.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.080]  I'm going to Bilderberg.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.080]  They could easily plant something on us or whatever
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.080]  and have an informant say something.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.080]  But you know what? I'm in God's hands.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.080]  Just because this system is run by a bunch of
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:04.080]  knuckle-dragon criminals doesn't mean I'm going to give into it.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.080]  I'm going to go challenge it.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.080]  And I know that people know the truth.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.080]  And it will be an example of that ever ends up happening,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080]  of what we're facing and will bring to light.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.080]  That's why they haven't really tried that in a while on us,
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.080]  is because they understand nobody is going to buy it.
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080]  We do our best to even follow all these
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.080]  unconstitutional laws and things.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.080]  And we're going to be nonviolent when we are up there.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.080]  We're going to get normal for media to want to go cover
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.080]  130 of the richest and most powerful people meeting in secret.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080]  They do it publicly at Davos,
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.080]  and there's over 3,000 media on average there.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:40.080]  But we're weird and bad and evil to want to cover this,
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.080]  where Obama got knighted to become the main candidate
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.080]  four years ago, and where they're undoubtedly going to be
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.080]  sneaking again this year.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.080]  And we're finally breaking through where the Washington Post
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.080]  and the Bilderberg coverage and the Salon
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  and Bilderberg coverage and Politico and Bilderberg coverage.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.080]  They hate it. They still make fun of us.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.080]  But they admit there's a meeting of rich and famous elites.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.080]  And yeah, they do kind of pick some presidents,
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.080]  but you're still bad to not like that.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.080]  Yeah, and they commit crimes and violate the Logan Act.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.080]  Anything else, sir?
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.080]  Mr. Tucker, is it Jim Tucker?
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.080]  Yes, Jim Tucker.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.080]  Yeah, I mean, he said it best.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  I mean, good works are done in sunshine.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.080]  But I just wanted to point out that, you know,
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.080]  I'm a convicted felon.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:36.080]  And what we need to understand about these background checks,
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.080]  ever since Homeland Security came in,
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:44.080]  it's not that they're being ignored.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.080]  They're being enforced where they want them enforced
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.080]  and ignored where they want to ignore them.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.080]  No, no, I've read where states are passing laws now
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.080]  where only the state can hire criminals.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.080]  In fact, Texas was trying to do that because they're like,
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.080]  we can't hire anybody. Everybody's a felon.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.080]  And it was the county commissioner about a year ago going,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.080]  we want to be able to hire felons.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.080]  We found out a bunch of our people with the new backgrounds
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.080]  are felons. We got to let them go.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080]  We want to be able to have our own waiver so they can get
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.080]  their own gang of crux.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.080]  I mean, I tell you, this government is so stinking.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:18.080]  It's too selective enforcement.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.080]  Well, listen, listen, I don't get into all the race stuff,
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080]  but one time we got pulled over.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.080]  This is when I was in high school driving back from the beach.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.080]  And to be quite honest, we had been drinking some,
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.080]  not a lot, the kind of hair of the dog.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.080]  And the guy comes over, he smells it,
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.080]  but we're both being the guy in the car driving back.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.080]  We don't had blonde hair and blue eyes.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.080]  It was a sheriff's deputy with swastikas on his forearms.
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.080]  And he basically tells us how Hitler and we can go.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:53.080]  And I thought, my gosh, what would it be like to be black
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.080]  and get pulled over by this guy?
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:59.080]  But side issue, it just really creeped me out to be let off
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.080]  of something, which, you know, because I was white.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.080]  Anyways, yes, selective enforcement is the essence of
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.080]  tyranny. God bless you, sir.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.080]  Don and Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.080]  Go ahead.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.080]  Hey, Alex, FEMA region five glass and flag out front,
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.080]  raw milk and fridge. How you doing?
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.080]  Pretty good. Sounds like you're pretty evil.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  Yeah, I think I am.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.080]  Hey, there's a town called, and I'm just throwing us at you,
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.080]  but there's a town called Kalamazoo, Michigan,
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.080]  and that's where I'm at.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.080]  And we'd love to have you.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.080]  I know my three daughters would be there with me,
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.080]  a lot of friends and coworkers.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.080]  And I know you're a busy guy, but just that's a funny name.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.080]  I thought it might stick in your head and we might see you
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.080]  sometime.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.080]  Well, I would love to travel the entire country.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.080]  I meant to be able to stop and give a few speeches on my way,
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.080]  but it just didn't work out because I have too much to do.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:55.080]  What do you think of the TSA waving the background checks?
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.080]  But everybody else has got to have their background run
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:02.080]  to even fly and hire known pedophiles to be the commanders.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.080]  Absolutely apart for the course.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.080]  As soon as you said you had that story on Info Wars,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.080]  I went and emailed it out to everybody I could.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.080]  It's just part for the course.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.080]  Well, sir, I mean, I'd heard the stories about him enjoying it.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.080]  Now I watch when I fly.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.080]  You can see the good-looking woman and you know the one guy
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.080]  that's got the job because he likes to put his hands
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080]  on beautiful women.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.080]  Then you see the pedo who likes kids,
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.080]  the lesbian that likes women.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.080]  And I mean, it's happening.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:28.080]  It is happening.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.080]  I mean, a normal person does not want to put their hands
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.080]  on somebody who doesn't want to be touched.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.080]  I mean, that is a big deal.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.080]  I mean, even with your...
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.080]  I mean, everybody who knows who's got a wife or husband
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.080]  has a relationship.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.080]  It's a big deal with your wife or husband.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.080]  This is an intimate thing.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.080]  And people you don't even know...
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:51.080]  I mean, when I was like 16, every girl I saw,
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.080]  I was after, like Peppie Le Pew.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.080]  Now that I'm older and everything,
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.080]  I realize this is a big deal.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.080]  This is about love.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.080]  And it's a big deal who you jump in the sack with.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.080]  But no wonder pilots who've flown for decades
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.080]  and are fighter pilots will go and vomit
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.080]  and not be able to fly.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.080]  And people are like, oh, don't be a wimp.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:11.080]  It's not wimping, man.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.080]  It's traumatizing to have somebody who knows
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.080]  they've got you in their power rubbing all over you.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  I mean, Jesse Ventura literally started having rage breakdowns
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.080]  in his whole life.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.080]  He could control his anger.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.080]  He was all into being in control.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.080]  And he sat on air.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  He figured out why he was blowing up at people.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:32.080]  I mean, I'm not going to get into the whole story,
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.080]  but we almost got in a fist fight
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.080]  after we left the airport.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.080]  OK?
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.080]  He apologized the next day, but he figured out it was the TSA.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.080]  It's the same with me.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.080]  I get mad about these pedophile stories.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:47.080]  I mean, me and Ventura literally almost got in a fight
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:51.080]  because he was so angry after the TSA were grabbing on him.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.080]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.080]  People can't handle this, man.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:00.080]  It was incredible they did a Ventura in front of me.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.080]  I was just...
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:34.080]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:35.080]  in your own own.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.080]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,

[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:05.080]  do you own a vehicle with less than 150,000 miles
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:07.080]  with a manufacturer's warranty about to expire
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.080]  or no warranty coverage at all?
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:11.080]  In order to aid the American people
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.080]  with saving thousands on future auto repair costs
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.080]  during these hard economic times,
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:19.080]  VSC America is now offering an affordable low-cost coverage plan
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.080]  to the general public.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.080]  As of today, you could be one of millions of drivers

[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.080]  Again, that's 1-800-493-7561.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.080]  Alright, coming up when I start the next hour,
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.080]  I'm gonna get a bunch in tube.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.080]  Bank runs in Europe spreading outside of Greece,
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:15.080]  and now Google Trends shows one of the top trends,
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.080]  fear of bank runs.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.080]  It's all-time high for Americans.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.080]  That's a story in the featured news area.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.080]  You can also find it in the breaking red link at the top
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.080]  at infowars.com.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.080]  That's just some of what's coming up, big news blitz,
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  but I was just talking to Weldon Hansen back there
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.080]  in the back office.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.080]  He's got a pretty popular country, Western Band,
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.080]  called Weldon Hansen Band,
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.080]  and they play all over the state, play at rodeos, you name it.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.080]  And he said, yeah, it's freaking him out.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.080]  He goes everywhere he goes now.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  He sees TSA at rodeos, at concerts,
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.080]  and it says TSA Inspector,
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  and they're bossing the cops around.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.080]  The feds out of their jurisdiction,
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.080]  and it's not even a sworn officer, and they're the boss.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.080]  They shut highways down everywhere.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:04.080]  They're all over the place.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.080]  There's nowhere to run from these people.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.080]  I guess I should go ahead and load my children up
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  and go to the airport and try to get them through there
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.080]  and make a big issue about it.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.080]  I guess the answer is fly and stand up against them
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.080]  and speak out and sue them and everything.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:22.080]  And these criminal courts, I tell you, this is so pathetic,
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.080]  and they don't even do their background check.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.080]  And when we had a national opt-out day for a week,
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.080]  they just turned the scanners off
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  so people couldn't resist and say no
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.080]  so that we couldn't show our power.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  They know what they're doing.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.080]  They just keep pressing and pressing and pressing
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.080]  and never giving up.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.080]  We can never give up.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.080]  Blue in Tennessee.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:43.080]  Then we'll go to Jake and others.
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.080]  Go ahead, Blue.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:49.080]  I am doing everything within my power for resistance.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:52.080]  And one idea that I would like to give to your listeners
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.080]  is if you take a key bag that is enclosed through itself.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.080]  Now, I'm sorry.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.080]  I can't really understand your phone.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]  Yeah, talk right into your telephone.
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.080]  Okay.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.080]  I'm looking for solutions to everyday problems.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.080]  And one that I have found that works very effectively
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:17.080]  is take a key bag that is self-contained
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  so it has a cover over the key bag.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.080]  And you put a sticker on it that simply says,
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.080]  have a cup of freedom on me.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:32.080]  And on the back side of the key bag, it says infowars.com.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:37.080]  And in my area, the radio station that plays you is 1470 AM.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.080]  I place these underneath the windshield wipers.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.080]  Ooh, that's an idea.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:44.080]  Hey, whoever's got a tea company
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080]  and wants to come out with an Alex Jones brand,
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  the answer to 1984 1776 tea,
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080]  we need to come out with our, you know,
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:56.080]  just repackage another good tea, find a good tea.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080]  Yeah, whatever, companies contact us.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.080]  And we can have infowars.com, have a cup of freedom on it.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  That is a genius idea, ma'am.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.080]  Thank you.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:07.080]  And the other thing I wanted to tell you
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.080]  is to reiterate what you said about women.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.080]  And being that I weigh under 100 pounds,
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.080]  I have been the epitome of reverse discrimination.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:22.080]  Women are the most malicious vile human beings
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.080]  on the face of the earth when they choose to be.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.080]  Because they will pick you apart
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.080]  if you are not what they choose
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.080]  on the platform that they think that you should be.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.080]  I'm sorry, I've given birth to two children.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.080]  I still weigh under 100 pounds.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.080]  Well, I mean, I've seen it happen.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.080]  I mean, women, most women get dressed up
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.080]  and look pretty, not for men,
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:47.080]  but to like show off with other women.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.080]  And the things women do to each other,
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.080]  I mean, not women are great.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.080]  It's just that that area of competition
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:56.080]  with women with each other is just really vicious.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:59.080]  And I was using that as an example of these cultures
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.080]  where people hate somebody
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.080]  if they're better looking than them or smarter.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.080]  Or those people also hate those
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.080]  that aren't as good looking as them.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.080]  I mean, it's just very sick.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:11.080]  And, you know, they don't want to be around old people.
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:13.080]  And, ooh, they don't want kids.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  They're so selfish.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080]  They're missing out on the whole world.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.080]  And again, they think they're getting to us
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.080]  because we're freaked out by them.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.080]  That's not what's happening.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.080]  It gets to us because they're so spiritually blind.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.080]  God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.080]  All right, more calls coming up.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.080]  And then it's a big news day.
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.080]  I covered some of it in the first hour, some of it this hour.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.080]  But I am going to be dedicated.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.080]  I am going to hammer you with hardcore news.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:49.080]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:59:09.080]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:29.080]  and the Silver Lungs
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:54.080]  system works.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:56.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:06.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.080]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.080]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.080]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:12.080]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:14.080]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:18.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:29.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:32.080]  All right, we're now into the next hour.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.080]  Giant News Blitz coming up in the next segment on Key Information.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.080]  Burst off, Jake and Oregon, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.080]  Welcome.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:49.080]  I don't think Jake knows he's on air.
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.080]  His girlfriend or wife's talking.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:53.080]  Hey, Jake, how you doing, buddy?
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.080]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  Good.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.080]  Hey, I got two questions.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.080]  I wanted to ask about the kid who was talking about President Obama
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.080]  and he got in trouble.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.080]  And the teachers are acting like he doesn't have a First Amendment, right?
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.080]  Well, she said you can be arrested for that.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080]  Yes.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  Whatever happened there?
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.080]  Did the teacher lose her job?
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.080]  Well, first they said it wasn't real, as they always do.
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.080]  You know, the tank's ramming the church, burning it down.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.080]  We're not attacking, not an assault.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.080]  The TSA doesn't grope you.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.080]  We don't strip search old ladies.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.080]  There's no radiation.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.080]  We're stopping.
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.080]  But first they said it didn't exist.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.080]  Then they said, yes, it's real.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.080]  We're suspending her.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  But separately, they're trying to segue with laws
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.080]  where you don't have free speech in Australia.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:45.080]  You get a 1.1 million Australian fine
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:48.080]  if you criticize the carbon tax.
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.080]  That's coming up.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.080]  And another thing is I'm having trouble waking people up.
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.080]  You know, I'm a young activist myself.
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  And people treat me, you know, because I'm only 15 years old
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.080]  and they act like I know nothing.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.080]  So I was wondering, can you help me out with that?
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.080]  How can I wake more people up?
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.080]  Yes, sir?
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.080]  I said, I'm only 15 years old.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.080]  I'm not ignoring you.
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.080]  What happens is there's a steady stream of people
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.080]  bringing me articles and giving me info
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.080]  while I'm talking to callers.
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.080]  So I just missed like five seconds of what you said.
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:27.080]  Well, I said was I'm only 15 years old
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.080]  and people act like I know nothing about the church movement
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.080]  and about the TSA and the new world order.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:35.080]  And I was wondering how I could wake more people up
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  because people treat me like I know nothing.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.080]  Well, I mean, they treat each other like that
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:42.080]  because they think it's threatening for you to act like
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  that you know the earth is round.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:45.080]  They think it's flat.
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:49.080]  I would make copies of Obama deception, fall the republic.
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.080]  I would hand out photocopies of infowars.com articles.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  And then when the school tries to censor you,
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080]  you call the newspapers and make YouTube videos
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.080]  and make a giant deal out of it.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.080]  And suddenly you'll be the coolest person in the school
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  and you'll defeat the enemy.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.080]  You must use every opportunity
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.080]  and their own persecution against them.
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  Record them saying like Al Gore said,
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.080]  kids, go boss your parents around.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  Tell them carbon taxes are good.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:19.080]  Well, people recorded that and slammed Al Gore.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  Show their evil.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.080]  Engage them.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.080]  See when we engage the enemy, they attack.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.080]  We're like, oh, they're attacking.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  Good.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.080]  We get stronger.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.080]  They get weaker.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.080]  Notice the enemy never stops attacking.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:33.080]  They're weaker, but they know they've got to keep attacking
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:34.080]  like a honey badger.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.080]  Well, we're like a honey badger 10 times bigger than them.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.080]  We will crush them.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:42.080]  We're like a Wolverine.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.080]  Ever seen a Wolverine beat up a mountain lion
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.080]  three times in size?
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.080]  It's because it's so fast, so dedicated, and so fearless.
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.080]  And it grabs around the wildcat.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.080]  Even it does it with bears.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.080]  It gets up underneath them, grabs them around the neck
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.080]  and bites them on the snout.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080]  And so it's absolute tenacity.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.080]  We're right.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.080]  You're scum.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.080]  You're filth.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.080]  We have the moral authority.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:07.080]  Notice it's always how the government has the moral authority
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:10.080]  and how they're good and they care about us.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.080]  Get aggressive in the info war.
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.080]  Get aggressive in the info war.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.080]  Get aggressive in the info war.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:19.080]  And what you do over and over again begins to magnify the power.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.080]  Go hand out one page brochures about liberty.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.080]  They're cheap to photocopy.
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.080]  You know, trifold them.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  Go hand them out every Sunday morning for a year.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.080]  Rain or snow, there'll be news articles about you.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  Then you could start an organization.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  Then you'll be a leader.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  They will admire you once you've proven you're a leader.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.080]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man,
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  hated, feared, and scorned.
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  But in time, when his cause succeeds,
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  the timid joined him because then it cost nothing
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.080]  to be a patriot.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:52.080]  Be that trailblazer today, my friend.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.080]  Go forth, Jake in Oregon,
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.080]  and defeat the New World Order
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:25.080]  with a weapon of truth and the First Amendment.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:29.080]  It's simple to make, affordable,
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.080]  and has a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.080]  Now with eFoods Direct,

[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:02.080]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.080]  adding poison to your water
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.080]  and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.080]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:10.080]  My friends, I've done a lot of research,
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:12.080]  and the best gravity filter out there,
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.080]  bar none, is ProPure.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:17.080]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.080]  Its filters are silver and pregnant
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:21.080]  to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080]  There's no priming required.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:24.080]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:28.080]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.080]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:31.080]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:34.080]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:37.080]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:38.080]  which is key.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.080]  Save money by not buying bottled water
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.080]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:45.080]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.080]  It's what my family uses.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.080]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:52.080]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.080]  you get an additional 10% off and infowars.com.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:00.080]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:02.080]  When you're out on the road,
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:07.080]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.080]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:12.080]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:16.080]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.080]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:25.080]  They so pride in every stitch,
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.080]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:32.080]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.080]  where you need it most.
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:38.080]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.080]  Others don't.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:41.080]  We turned jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080]  Diamond gusset jeans,
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:46.080]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.080]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.080]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:53.080]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:55.080]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.080]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:00.080]  Others don't.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.080]  The Genesis Communications
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.080]  The Genesis Communications is coming soon.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:15.080]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:18.080]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:20.080]  Coming up at the start of the next segment,
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:22.080]  I'm going to go back to your calls
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:23.080]  and then back into news.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:26.080]  But we've also got a little lower third animation
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.080]  that Marcos Morales, one of our great graphics people,
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:30.080]  put together.
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:33.080]  If you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv,
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:37.080]  probably 95% of folks are listening to us on XM166
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:42.080]  and over 100 wonderful, brave AM and FM affiliates out there
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.080]  or over the audio streams.
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.080]  But if you go up to the prisonplanet.tv,
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.080]  there's a 15-day free trial.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:51.080]  You can watch the whole three-hour radio show,
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.080]  see the nightly news, and support the First Amendment.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:56.080]  Each membership to prisonplanet.tv
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:58.080]  is really six memberships.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:00.080]  Now, create a username and passcode,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.080]  and we tell you this, that isn't to your bank or to whatever,
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.080]  or you better trust those you give it to.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.080]  Just make up a username and passcode,
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.080]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month,
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:14.080]  or go get a 15-day free trial membership that we've got going.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:19.080]  And then six people can be logged in simultaneously
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:21.080]  with the same username and passcode.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.080]  That's the number under our old system
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:26.080]  that it wouldn't crash the servers
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:29.080]  if everybody logged on at the same time with it.
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.080]  We've gotten our bandwidth cheaper now and better,
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:33.080]  and we have a better system.
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:36.080]  And so, prisonplanet.tv, knock-on-wallet,
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.080]  is really never slow anymore.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.080]  We're getting better and better,
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:43.080]  so I'm tempted to turn it up to 10 people per membership.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:45.080]  But is that pearls before swine?
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.080]  Go get a membership, or if you have one,
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:51.080]  send your username and passcode to a couple friends and family
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.080]  and tell them to tune in to the radio show.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.080]  They can watch it.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:01.080]  But they can also get the commercial free podcast.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:06.080]  By the way, folks, it's supposed to be a commercial free podcast
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:09.080]  for the radio show every day,
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:12.080]  and we had folks in here that ever once in a while forgot
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.080]  and didn't cut all the commercials out.
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:17.080]  You complained, and someone is no longer with us here anymore.
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.080]  So you complained, and we appreciate that,
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.080]  and they were unable to stop leaving the commercials in,
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.080]  so they're bye-bye.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.080]  And the only reason I raise that and bring that up is
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.080]  we do listen to you.
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.080]  We're trying to get better, but just remember,
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:32.080]  we do everything the best we can.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.080]  We're not some big monolithic operation.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.080]  I get emails that were sent to the crew sometimes that say,
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.080]  I've sent you emails and you don't respond.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.080]  I can't even hardly go see my grandmother once a month.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.080]  I used to go see her every week.
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.080]  She lives here in town.
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:50.080]  I'm just letting you know.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:53.080]  People go, well, this politician sends me an email back.
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.080]  It's a fake one from their staff.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.080]  And do people really want to fake auto respond like it's from me?
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.080]  I mean, do you really want that?
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.080]  Because when I send out a message to people,
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.080]  I go write it and then they send it out in the mass email.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.080]  Like when you're on Info Wars Insider,
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.080]  you do get occasional messages I actually write.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.080]  When you, uh-oh, the graphics are already on screen.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:20.080]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:21.080]  We're still going to play it.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:22.080]  Come on up the next break,
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  because I had some special things I wanted to say
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.080]  about Jan Napolitano.
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:27.080]  You know, I was out at Steiner Ranch this week
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.080]  doing the latest installment that is incredible
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.080]  of Brothers in Arms.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:35.080]  And our new gun show we're doing.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.080]  It might be every two weeks.
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:38.080]  It might be every month in the future, every week.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:40.080]  We're just developing it right now.
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:41.080]  My idea of a gun show.
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.080]  And I think the last episode was powerful
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.080]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:47.080]  Wait till you see the next one.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.080]  But we actually saw real dung beetles.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  I don't usually see those out on our ranch
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.080]  that we've got in East Texas,
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.080]  but these are big dung beetles rolling dung around.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:58.080]  We got some high-deaf video of Jan Napolitano.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.080]  But I told Marcos a month or so ago,
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:03.080]  I said, I want a graphic like they have on History Channel
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.080]  where the bug for your prisonplanet.tv
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.080]  or M4 Wars does something funny.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  Why don't we have Jan Napolitano laying eggs
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:15.080]  that turn into little TSA goblins?
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:16.080]  Well, he came up with this.
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.080]  Go ahead and roll it again, please.
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.080]  It is a theater of the mind.
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.080]  Describe it for people who are listening on the radio.
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.080]  She is a little red dinosaur,
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:30.080]  and she comes out and lays an egg
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:33.080]  that is a TSA bat boy that flies off.
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:35.080]  And then a hammer falls down
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  and crushes the Napolitano goblin.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.080]  No affiliation with the real Janet Puppet,
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.080]  New World Order Napolitano.
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.080]  We wish her a long and healthy life,
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:50.080]  a nice little thing he added there with the hammer.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.080]  So he'll get the Secret Service visit.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.080]  I'm just joking. It's a joke.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:57.080]  Anyways, so there you go.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.080]  That's one of the funny little things we have now.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:00.080]  Let me get into the news.
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  You know, I always realize I'm procrastinating on some of the news
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.080]  because this is really painful stuff.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.080]  And I read this last night and this morning
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.080]  and then again when I came in,
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:09.080]  and by the third or fourth looking at it, I'm like, wow.
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.080]  And people who think I want to make the government look bad,
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.080]  you got it wrong, okay?
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.080]  There's so much of this stuff
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.080]  that I can't even keep track of it and it's all so horrible.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  I don't have words to really get it down, okay?
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:27.080]  So let me just go ahead and try to get into all this.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  Let me just go ahead and begin with the economy stack.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  Just a part of it.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  I actually have two stacks on the economy.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.080]  Here it is.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  Google Trends.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.080]  Fear of bank runs hits all time high for Americans.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.080]  Concern over economic crisis,
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:45.080]  outstrips, Lehman Brothers aftermath.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.080]  And Paul Watson in his article at infowars.com
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.080]  and principle.tv.
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:52.080]  And infowars.net, one of our auxiliary backups
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:55.080]  that they take down the other sites I should add.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.080]  He shows the concern over Lehman Brothers
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  and huge meltdowns being bigger in U.S. searches.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:03.080]  And it's gotten Google Analytics that you can look at too.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.080]  It's public.
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.080]  All the numbers.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:10.080]  This outstrips the 08 plunge and panic.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.080]  It outstrips everything.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  It outstrips all the big crises by a pretty dramatic figure.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:22.080]  In fact, I can show you the graph right here
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  if you're watching on TV.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:25.080]  There is current concern over bank runs
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:30.080]  the highest it's ever been going back since 2004.
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.080]  That article is at the bottom of featured news section
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.080]  at infowars.com.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:39.080]  Might want to get that out to everybody.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.080]  Most figures out of Google Trends Americans
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.080]  have been searching for the term bank run
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:44.080]  in record numbers.
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.080]  Yeah, I've talked to people at the bank.
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.080]  I was getting some cash out.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  And so was my wife.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:51.080]  And they're like, wow, everybody's getting cash out.
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.080]  Well, let me see if we've got $2,000.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  So it's pretty serious.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.080]  The search volume index on Google for bank run
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  in the United States region peaked
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:04.080]  an all-time record level May 13th
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.080]  and has hovered around this high ever since.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:12.080]  Yeah, it is just turbo charging right there.
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.080]  I'm going to read the whole article.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:16.080]  Speaking of that, Zero Hedge has links to The Guardian
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:18.080]  and other papers.
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:23.080]  Police urging Greeks to stop stuffing mattresses.
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.080]  We have spent a considerable amount of time in the week
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.080]  or to explaining why deposit withdrawals or bank runs
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:31.080]  are the death knell for the Euro experiment.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:34.080]  We first described the runs on banks and governments.
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:37.080]  Zero Hedge is just spot on.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.080]  It's a bunch of big multi-millionaire stockbrokers
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:41.080]  who remain anonymous.
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:43.080]  Every poster on there is called Tyler Durgan.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.080]  You know, I'm told they're listeners,
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.080]  but I can't ever get them on.
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:49.080]  Side issue, though, let's continue.
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.080]  On the basis of the potential for overnight loss of
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.080]  fundability back in December,
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.080]  but the escalation last week in Greece
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.080]  and the contagion in Spain
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.080]  signals things shifting to 11
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.080]  the amplifier of Euro fail.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:07.080]  That's a little spinal tap comment.
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.080]  Or so I have read.
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.080]  This evening brings new information from The Guardian
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:15.080]  that police are urging Greeks to keep their money
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.080]  in bank accounts rather than putting it at risk of theft
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:21.080]  amid further uncertainty about whether the austerity
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:24.080]  struck country will remain in the Eurozone.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.080]  And it goes on quoting Reuters and The Guardian and others.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  Many people have withdrawn their money from banks,
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:32.080]  fearing a financial crash,
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:35.080]  and they either carry it in on them,
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:39.080]  find a hideout, a home, or in storage rooms.
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.080]  We urge people to trust the banking system,
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.080]  trust the Titanic, everything's fine,
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.080]  light a cigar, leave their money there,
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:50.080]  or at least in a safe place, not hide it at the home.
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.080]  Well, cash can be devalued, too.
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:53.080]  I don't have very much cash.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.080]  I don't have very much anything.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:58.080]  I just have paid off my debts
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:01.080]  and got a bunch of hillbilly family.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:03.080]  So that's my...
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.080]  And anybody, anybody coming in my house
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.080]  is going to be attacked by the bull mastiff,
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:13.080]  I didn't mention that dog, and the firearms.
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.080]  But that's if you can make it through the barbed wire.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:19.080]  But, again, it's not because I'm living in fear,
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:22.080]  it's because I'm ready.
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:25.080]  I'm ready.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.080]  And if my wife doesn't shoot you, my nine-year-old son will.
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:29.080]  Now, let's continue here.
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:34.080]  Big European funds dump Euro assets.
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:37.080]  That's the financial times today.
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:38.080]  So there you go.
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:39.080]  The globalists are gutting the Euro,
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.080]  but they'll demand giant tax increases to save it,
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:44.080]  which will then be more they'll steal,
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.080]  then they'll continue to implode it,
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.080]  then they'll steal even more,
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.080]  holding her one hostage,
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:49.080]  posing as saviors with poor media,
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.080]  telling you how great they are.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:51.080]  That's going to be the plan.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:54.080]  Some of Europe's biggest fund managers
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.080]  have confirmed their dumping Euro assets
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:59.080]  amid rising fears over a possible Greek exit
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.080]  from the Eurozone in a single currency turmoil.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.080]  The Euro sudden fall this month
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.080]  caught many investors by surprise.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.080]  Europe's single currency has lost 5%
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:11.080]  in the past three weeks after barely moving
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:14.080]  against the dollar for much of the year,
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.080]  and it just goes on to break all of that down.
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.080]  Real federal deficit dwarfs official tally,
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.080]  and it's bigger than Europe's.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.080]  USA Today actually reports the truth for once,
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.080]  and it goes over to say that it is a lot bigger
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:31.080]  than the slaves have been told.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:34.080]  Of course, they don't tell you that it's 600 plus trillion,
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:36.080]  but they claim we owe.
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:39.080]  It's not our debt, but the bankers had the crooks
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.080]  sign us on to it.
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:44.080]  It's a couple million per person.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:46.080]  Impossible to pay, and it doesn't really matter
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:49.080]  because they got 30,000 drones and SWAT teams
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:51.080]  that are ready to eat their mother's guts
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.080]  and ask for seconds because following orders is tough.
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:58.080]  Drinking fluoride and using DU is tough, too.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:01.080]  Going in that pine box is real tough, too.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  Government loves you, enforcers don't they?
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.080]  Yeah, they love you a lot.
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.080]  Here's another one.
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.080]  Euro, again, falls between $1.25,
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.080]  so that's what the dollar's up,
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.080]  but it's like their ship sinking so fast
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.080]  that ours isn't sinking as fast,
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.080]  so people are like, yay.
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.080]  Number of high school students with job
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.080]  hits 20-year low Washington Times.
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.080]  Well, Obama just says go out and start a company.
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.080]  It's no big deal.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.080]  Of course, you can't because they're increasing
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:29.080]  the power prices, shutting off the street lights,
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.080]  and you can't make it to work because you can't pay
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:33.080]  from the gas, even if you could.
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.080]  You can't pay for all the insurance and stickers,
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.080]  and the cops are going to catch you.
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:39.080]  If you're an illegal alien, you're above the law
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  and they let you go on record, but that's okay.
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:43.080]  Pentagon contractor admits engaging in dirty tricks
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:45.080]  against journalists.
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.080]  Big article there where one of the biggest groups
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:50.080]  out there publicly admits they go after people,
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:52.080]  including Americans.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.080]  You don't talk bad about them,
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:57.080]  and that's what's up next, Australia banning free speech.
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:59.080]  This is a big deal.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:01.080]  Uh-oh, look right there.
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:03.080]  A little over a year ago,
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:05.080]  I began to do a lot of research into why,
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:07.080]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:09.080]  that I was still starving,
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.080]  and my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:13.080]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:16.080]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:18.080]  are almost completely depleted
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:21.080]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.080]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:26.080]  fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:28.080]  I then searched out the best vitamin
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:30.080]  and mineral company out there,
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.080]  and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.080]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:36.080]  to give you the real nutrition you need,
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:38.080]  and once you've got that,
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:40.080]  you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:43.080]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months,
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:46.080]  simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:48.080]  Check it out for yourself. It's incredible.

[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:30.080]  Food for now. Food for life.
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:00.080]  So, working to keep the world tied together.
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.080]  And have less shrinkage and do not burn.
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.080]  Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:35.080]  And sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:37.080]  Water can be heated in a sun oven
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:39.080]  for purification or personal hygiene.
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:41.080]  For the past 26 years,
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  sun ovens have been proudly made in the U.S.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.080]  They're durable, have a long life,

[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.080]  forward slash radio.
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:01.080]  That's sunoven.com forward slash radio.
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:24.080]  All right, here is the Janet DePoletano
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.080]  laying a little TSA goblin egg graphic
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.080]  with something added to it.
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:32.080]  So, here is that, and I'll go back into the news
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.080]  and your phone calls.
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:49.080]  Oh, man.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.080]  We are definitely out of control.
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.080]  You know, this is like gallows humor here, though.
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:57.080]  I mean, this is a hardcore show,
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.080]  but we do screw around a little bit
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.080]  because if you didn't, it would make you cry.
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:05.080]  There she is laying a pedophile egg
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:08.080]  so it can hatch out and she can wave the background check
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:11.080]  and a priest defrocked for reportedly abusing
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.080]  three little girls, CBS News reports,
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:18.080]  can then be the commander of terminals D and E
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:22.080]  and use a security badge to have the media thrown out.
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:25.080]  We're here to discuss the fact that you were defrocked
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:30.080]  for sexually abusing reportedly 11-year-old
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:32.080]  and other girls.
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:34.080]  I'm in command, get out of here.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:36.080]  I mean, the video is up at infowars.com
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:39.080]  in our article linking over to CBS.
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:44.080]  TSA hired accused sex abuse priests
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.080]  pedophile as screener.
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:49.080]  It said reported earlier.
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:51.080]  Why has it now changed to accused?
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.080]  Reported.
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.080]  I had spinning, now it suddenly changed to reported.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.080]  Okay, let's see what it is on infowars.com right now.
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:03.080]  Anyways, that article is up at infowars.com
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.080]  and it just, I mean, I see these every couple of days now
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:08.080]  and most of them I don't even cover it.
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.080]  It's like another one caught with a bunch of child porn,
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:13.080]  another one caught raping their neighbor's five-year-old.
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:16.080]  Well, who else wants to do that?
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.080]  Who else wants to humiliate and scream at people
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:25.080]  for too big a shampoo bottle, or even if it isn't too big?
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.080]  Amazing.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:30.080]  Absolutely off the charts.
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:34.080]  Amazing.
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.080]  All right, this even blows me away.
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:40.080]  I remember three years ago, headlines in the Australian news
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:43.080]  and they reported it with a straight face like it was good.
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.080]  Australia to adopt Chinese-style net censorship
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:50.080]  and it said criticism of the government will no longer be allowed.
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.080]  Criticism of carbon tax, and I was reading this
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:54.080]  and it said you will have an internet ID
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:59.080]  that Bilderberg's calling for, by the way, worldwide right now.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:02.080]  You'll have an internet ID
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:07.080]  and if you do any of this,
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:09.080]  you'll be permanently banned from the internet,
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:11.080]  which nowadays you can't even basically live without in most business.
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.080]  And if you are trying to go to a rural area,
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:15.080]  the green police are coming and shutting you down.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.080]  And there's our article, infowars.com,
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.080]  but scroll down if people think I'm joking.
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.080]  Click on the first link, it's to the Daily Telegraph.
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:24.080]  And we'll show you their headline on this.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:32.080]  Don't serve carbon lies, ACCC warns.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.080]  Shops and restaurants could face fines up to 1.1 million
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.080]  if waiters or sales staff wrongly blame the carbon tax
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.080]  for price rises or exaggerate the impact.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  Oh, it's, it'll see, well, we don't let you lie.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:47.080]  There's no court. We just come in and the government says
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.080]  you don't blame the fact that they're reportedly going to double
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.080]  the price of beef and lamb
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.080]  because they are putting a 50% tax on the land itself
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.080]  being used if you have sheep on it.
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:04.080]  That's been on the Australian news.
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:06.080]  People doing hunger strikes, you name it.
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:09.080]  They're announcing the fish is going to have a huge tax on of at least 50%.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:12.080]  Folks, if there's a 50% tax on the landowner,
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:14.080]  it's going to go right down the line.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  It's going to be way over 50%.
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:19.080]  And it all goes in the global carbon trading.
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.080]  I mean, this is so evil.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:23.080]  Now if you fly to Europe, no matter where you fly from,
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:27.080]  they put huge taxes on carbon paid to the Rothschilds.
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.080]  People won't believe that.
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:31.080]  Type in Rothschilds run carbon trading system.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  Click web, but it'll be about a year old.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:36.080]  It's like BBC, Associated Press.
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:39.080]  The Rothschilds, you pay your money.
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:43.080]  Inron helps set it up to the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.080]  all the usual suspects.
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:50.080]  And they're telling them, if you complain,
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:53.080]  and they admit it is going to increase the price,
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:29:01.080]  we're going to find you 1.1 million Australian.
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.080]  Praised by Barack Obama as a model for the world,
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:07.080]  Australia's highly unpopular carbon tax
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:11.080]  set to take effect from July 1 is set to be
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:14.080]  policed by laws which forbid business owners
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:20.080]  from criticizing it for causing prices to rise.
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:25.080]  With thought criminals who do so under threat
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:31.080]  of being hit with huge fines over 1 million dollars.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:32.080]  There you go.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:36.080]  Shops and restaurants will face 1.1 million
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:38.080]  if waiters, this is a quote,
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.080]  or sales staff wrongly blame the carbon tax
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:43.080]  for price rises or exaggerate the impact.
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:45.080]  Oh, the government says you don't exaggerate now.
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.080]  I mean, that's Soviet Union.
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:48.080]  That's it.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:30:17.080]  And I've got more quotes on your calls.
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.080]  I'll see you next time.
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:52.080]  See them on the web at 5starsope.com
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:31:19.080]  or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:24.080]  I'll see you next time.
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:32:02.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:05.080]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:07.080]  Number one, new climate legislation
[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:09.080]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:12.080]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:15.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:18.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:21.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:23.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:25.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.080]  And now, new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:29.080]  is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:33.080]  to local grids.
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:37.080]  from weather-related onages.
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:39.080]  Number five, a solar power generator
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:41.080]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:43.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:45.080]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.080]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:50.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:52.080]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:54.080]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:56.080]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:33:00.080]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.080]  We're here for now
[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:19.080]  by the grace of God,
[02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:21.080]  Monday through Friday
[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:24.080]  from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:26.080]  Back Sundays, and I'll be live this Sunday on the road,
[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:28.080]  going to Bilderberg 2012
[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:31.080]  to cover it, 4-6 p.m. central.
[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:34.080]  I guess I'll be in the Eastern time zone, 5-7.
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:36.080]  Centrale.
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:38.080]  Couldn't do this without you, the listeners and supporters
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:40.080]  and info warriors couldn't do it without
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:44.080]  the incredible crew, all of them totally dedicated
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:48.080]  at infowars.com.
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.080]  So draconian attacks on free speech
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:55.080]  come to Australia, and it's in the Australian papers like,
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:59.080]  yeah, if you exaggerate the price increases,
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:03.080]  it's only 50%, and there's quotes.
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:06.080]  If you say it's increasing prices or exaggerate the increase,
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.080]  we're going to find you, no judge, no jury.
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:11.080]  Two Australian governments have fallen
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:13.080]  in the last, what, five years
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:15.080]  trying to ram this through, and the bankers are like,
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.080]  I don't care, you'll be paid off, ram it through.
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:21.080]  And I've seen Australian TV shows on YouTube
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:23.080]  where it's like, we're the Green Police,
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:26.080]  the Green Audit Time, we come to your house
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:28.080]  and we give you fines.
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:30.080]  I'm not joking, I actually sing like that.
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:32.080]  It's like, hi, we're here without a warrant to come to your house.
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:34.080]  Yeah, we're trendy.
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:37.080]  It's like, thanks a lot for coming in.
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.080]  That's tile, that's bad, but it's with an Australian voice,
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.080]  you've got to see it.
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:43.080]  I can't really do a niny Australia.
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.080]  Hey, mate, how you doing there?
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:47.080]  So like, how do you do an Australian accent,
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:51.080]  but then do it in the trendy voice?
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  Oh, it's now time for us to take your property.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.080]  That's more of a weird cockney accent.
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:00.080]  I can't even do it, I just can't do it.
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:03.080]  I cannot do a simpering Aussie bureaucrat.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:05.080]  The voice doesn't really lend itself to that,
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:08.080]  but still, they've all got the same little demon eyes.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.080]  They look real weak and pathetic.
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:12.080]  It's armies of nobodies who would be outcasts
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:14.080]  getting big gangs together and take over.
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:16.080]  That's government.
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.080]  They love little uniforms and outfits and festooning hats
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:22.080]  and running around all importantly.
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:24.080]  They're like children playing make-believe.
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:26.080]  It's like when my four-year-old dresses up as a princess.
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.080]  But she's four, that's okay.
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:31.080]  But you're not supposed to as an adult.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:35.080]  Australia, you'll always still be scum, though.
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:38.080]  That doesn't mean everybody that wants to go into public service is bad.
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:41.080]  A lot of people have a need, a duty, it's family, it's good.
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:43.080]  That's the old system.
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.080]  But when government swells and gets big, it always looks like this.
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.080]  And I've been to third-world countries.
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:52.080]  I've seen the look of crazed thugs and uniforms, and it's here now.
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:56.080]  The Green Police, you see those out-of-yads from three years ago?
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.080]  And I told you that's exactly how they dress and what they do in Europe.
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.080]  And then later, the makers of it admitted they're based in San Francisco.
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:05.080]  They said, oh, this was to condition you.
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:09.080]  And the mayor in San Francisco came out and agreed in the San Francisco Chronicle
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:11.080]  and said, this is what we really plan to do.
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:15.080]  Arrest you if your hot tub is using too much energy.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:17.080]  Arrest you if you have the wrong light bulbs.
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:19.080]  We're going to arrest you.
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.080]  Yes!
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.080]  And under the federal laws, they couldn't pass, but Obama's implementing the whole carbon regime.
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.080]  They come in your house without warrants.
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.080]  They come on your property, and people all over the nation are now seeing federal Green Police
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:37.080]  show up with machine guns and shotguns, and they tell you you're trash.
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:40.080]  And if you've got a problem, they're ready to call in their support.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  It's their country now.
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  Let me get back to Australia where half the farmland and ranch land has been laid off limits by a law.
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:51.080]  Half of it.
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:53.080]  Or they say you can pay for the use.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:58.080]  They say, and then you're like, well, okay, people just use the half.
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:03.080]  And then not, no, no, no, it's just, it's a tax on every piece of land, no matter what you use.
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:09.080]  You can officially hand it over to them, or you're going to pay for it.
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:12.080]  Ah, it's loving and liberal for the earth.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:14.080]  The GMO, though, is expanding.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:18.080]  It's not a problem. Fukushima's not a problem.
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:30.080]  According to the ACC Deputy Chairman, Michael Shaper, the warning applies to comments made by staff over the phone,
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:34.080]  because they're listening, on the shop floor or in meetings.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:37.080]  Ah, your comments are being watched.
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:41.080]  Keep your mouth shut, boy.
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:48.080]  It also covers advertising, product labels, websites, invoices, contracts, and contract negotiations.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:53.080]  That's what the fellow reserves, since the 50s, takes your money out of your paycheck for most people
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:56.080]  and make the employer spy on you and get all the files.
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:01.080]  Whoever you do business with, you've got to get paperwork from them and watch them, all this little informants.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:09.080]  Totally illegal, totally unconstitutional, indentured servitude. Let's go on and on.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:13.080]  Incriminating yourself, because there's no way to follow it, because the law is written where the big guys are exempt.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:15.080]  But if you try that, you go to jail.
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:21.080]  And they take your money out that way, and they told employers then, don't call this an income tax.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:23.080]  Call it a war tax. It started in World War II.
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:26.080]  They already had it on the books, but they didn't implement it till World War II.
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:30.080]  So, that's all the craziness that's going on there.
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:35.080]  And imagine, you don't talk, you don't explain to people why their power bill just went up.
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.080]  You don't explain why their food bill, why their gas bill, why every bill went up.
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:43.080]  You understand us? You keep your mouth shut.
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:46.080]  Australians in mass should come out and say no to this.
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:54.080]  And I tell you, Australians, nice, friendly, they kind of have the old nickname of being Texans, real gregarious and friendly.
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:57.080]  It's most frontier people are, till you cross them.
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:02.080]  But now in the modern age, it's just like, oh, come on, mate, let's just go along with it.
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:03.080]  That's just what they do.
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.080]  It's more of an English accent. I need to work on my Australian accent.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:09.080]  But that's what, no, no, no.
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:13.080]  There's nothing they won't stop doing if you don't say no to these crooks.
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:16.080]  And we've been blocked in Australia on the web a few years ago
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:19.080]  and found out they were doing some testing of this bureaucratically
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:23.080]  when they were unable to pass the Chinese-style net censorship.
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:27.080]  And mark my words, everything they're doing to Australia is coming here, folks.
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:30.080]  You think that school teacher's the only one saying you'll be arrested if you talk bad about Obama?
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.080]  I have newscasts.
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:36.080]  By the way, I have asked, I'm not mad, but I know it's in Obama deception.
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:37.080]  I know it's on the web.
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:42.080]  Did we find the video in our own archives out of Missouri and there's other ones where they're like,
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.080]  talk bad about Obama, be arrested.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:47.080]  With the police chief up there in his uniform trying to scare everybody.
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:49.080]  These are thugs.
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:51.080]  Now, I've played it on air before, but I'm not kidding.
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.080]  If you forgot that, they've already done this.
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.080]  Al Gore says, go tell your parents what to do.
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.080]  They're racist if they don't want carbon taxes to that fat piece of trash.
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.080]  Excuse me.
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.080]  The draconian measure will be enforced by teams of carbon cops.
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  That's an actual quote.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:16.080]  You exhale carbon folks.
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.080]  They chose this because everything is producing it so they can control and micromanage everything.
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:22.080]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:23.080]  It's all discredited.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:24.080]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.080]  It's draconian.
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:26.080]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:27.080]  The elites are exempt from it.
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:33.080]  This is hellish who roam the streets conducting snap inspections of businesses to ensure they are not making any references to the tax.
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:34.080]  Oh my gosh.
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:36.080]  These are free speech killing commas are.
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:41.080]  This is the headline should be Australia falls the Soviet style takeover.
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:45.080]  I mean, words cannot describe this.
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:41:00.080]  The characterization of dissent against the carbon tax as a criminal offense exemplifies how the measure passed last year goes way beyond merely forcing Australia's top 500 companies to pay extra 2378 per each ton of CO2 emitted.
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:04.080]  The system will be rolled out in carbon trading system.
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:15.080]  Not only will Australians be whacked with price rises on everything from energy to food, small business owners will also be intimidated into silence when they are forced to pay out more for key supplies.
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:20.080]  Energy prices across the country have already skyrocketed over the course of the last year.
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:27.080]  But don't say it or we'll come find you and arrest you with carbon cops.
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:38.080]  And hey, I better not speak out. They've got my GPS front door coordinates with attack drones and now admit that myself and Steve Quell were right two years to go talking about that.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:46.080]  After the carbon tax bill passed Australia's federal parliament last year, the government set about trying to erase any dissent against the jobs destroying legislation.
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:49.080]  That's a quote out of all paper with a link to it.
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:51.080]  They actually say no dissent allowed.
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:56.080]  We're watching you scum suckers.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:01.080]  I mean, I am entering the vortex right now. I mean, this this is bondage.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:06.080]  This is off the Australia used to be the freest country in the Commonwealth.
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.080]  And now it is one of the least free and England is off the charts and Canada is a police state.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:16.080]  I mean, what will you not put up with people?
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:23.080]  You are the culture that created the Magna Carta and the common law that has worked so well in the model world and now look at you.
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.080]  You are back under the control of the banksters and their whore queen and all the rest of it.
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:29.080]  And I have had enough of it.
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:31.080]  I have had enough of it.
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:34.080]  And no, I'm not celebrating the Diamond Jubilee as you noticed.
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:36.080]  I don't know what it is about women.
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:37.080]  They just love royalty.
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:38.080]  I mean, it's like a joke.
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:43.080]  I mean, Monkton's a really nice guy and, you know, he's a redditary peer and all that stuff.
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:44.080]  Nice guy.
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:45.080]  I like him.
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:46.080]  He's a patriot for his country.
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:52.080]  And I understand people that like the thing because they're like, well, it's anti globalist and they want to in some levels, you want to get rid of that.
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:57.080]  I get that the monarchy is almost vestigial to the globalist and they will get rid of it.
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:01.080]  But, you know, my whole deal is I was making jokes while Monkton was here doing curtsies to him.
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.080]  And I go, guys, did I do the curtsies or not?
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.080]  I did the curtsies.
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:09.080]  Oh, look, it's the Diamond Jubilee.
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:11.080]  Look, I'm already digressing.
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:13.080]  The point is these people are tyrannous.
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:16.080]  Maximus are the maximum piece of trash.
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.080]  Tyrants and their government in Australia is a criminal group.
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:28.080]  Look at England banning self-defense trainers from coming in to their country.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:36.080]  Mainline law abiding trainers, people that train the Navy SEALs, people that train British soldiers, not allowed to train people to defend themselves.
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.080]  Every day, are we where they knife some guy in front of his kids for fun?
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:45.080]  I mean, I'm going to say the Brits have been so domesticated, they're helpless now.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:53.080]  And the foreign thugs, whether they're white Eastern Europeans or Middle Easterners or Africans who come from really rough places,
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:56.080]  they just walk right up on these videos and start punching people.
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:58.080]  And then the men just fall down in front of their families and go,
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:00.080]  Oh, no, don't beat me.
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:02.080]  Oh, no, please.
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:03.080]  Oh, no.
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.080]  Ah, ah.
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.080]  And the women go, ah, ah.
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:11.080]  And if the woman hit someone with an umbrella, the police savagely grabbed them.
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.080]  That's on the news.
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.080]  I get emails about this too.
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:17.080]  But in Northern Europe, if you are in your house being raped and you defend yourself,
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:24.080]  maximum prison sentence, maximum, because the criminals run the government.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:27.080]  I'm ranting, aren't I?
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:30.080]  So ridiculous.
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:32.080]  Oh my gosh, this is incredible.
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:37.080]  Australians face huge fines for speaking ill of carbon tax.
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  It's all happening.
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.080]  It's all going to happen.
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:43.080]  And, you know, that's the end of the road when the cops come to arrest you for your speech.
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:48.080]  I mean, they are lawless, Nazis, Soviets, whatever you want to call them.
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.080]  Crooks, done.
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:53.080]  They've confessed they are a whole system of fraud.
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:55.080]  Russia turns up the nuclear rhetoric.
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:56.080]  That's financial times.
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:59.080]  I told you about this weeks ago, but the mainstream media is having to report
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:03.080]  that Putin and many ideas are threatening to nuke Eastern Europe
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.080]  if they keep rolling missile systems in and circling Russia.
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:09.080]  Finally, the dinosaur media thought they'd report on that for you.
[02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:12.080]  Those bankers make 40-to-1 bets and they got bunkers.
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:15.080]  It might be fun for them to get a nuclear war going.
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:18.080]  See, you don't get how dangerous these globalists are.
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:21.080]  Their little minions just want to molest your children at the airport
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.080]  and they let known sexual abusers be the commanders.
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:26.080]  And you love it.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.080]  In fact, the new flag of America, our new mainline listeners, love it,
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:37.080]  should be, I guess, a TSA agent hurting a child.
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:39.080]  But we are, I mean, why not be proud of it?
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.080]  We can all hang them out, made in China and cry and go to parades.
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:48.080]  Like, maybe have a national sporting event where the TSA abuses men, women,
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:52.080]  children, and we all share them and say,
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:54.080]  oh, we're so proud of what you do to our children.
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.080]  Thank you for keeping us safe.
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:04.080]  Operators admit Fukushima radiation levels two and a half times
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:07.080]  what they publicly announced, that's infowars.com,
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.080]  with links to the official Tokyo Electric.
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:12.080]  So there you have it.
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:14.080]  And of course, the environmentalists say,
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:16.080]  arrest those of us that criticize man-made global warming
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.080]  or fighting other programs.
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:20.080]  So this is just part of their authoritarian move.
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  While the real environment is in deep trouble
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.080]  and the genetic code of the planet is being rewritten,
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.080]  by a bunch of transhumanists who just say, oh, it's evolution.
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:29.080]  We'll do whatever we want, humankind's over.
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:31.080]  We're going to merge with machines and live forever.
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:34.080]  Really, the original eugenicists in the 1850s
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:38.080]  for five generations interbred five families,
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:40.080]  the scientific elite under British government funding,
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:43.080]  the Wedgewoods, the Huxleys, the Darwin's, the Galtons,
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:47.080]  one other, and they had over 90% of their children born,
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:49.080]  totally mentally retarded, deformed, or stillborn.
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:53.080]  And the 10% that did survive or less were highly intelligent
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.080]  but had absolute congenital medical problems and deformities.
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:00.080]  And then they all became the leaders of the eugenics movement,
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:02.080]  founding UNESCO, UN, everything,
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.080]  running around, slaughtering everyone worldwide,
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:11.080]  and writing books and getting Nobel prizes for it.
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:12.080]  And go read their books.
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:15.080]  It's all how they'd set this up and poison the food and water
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:18.080]  and kill us and do it so slowly we couldn't resist and everything.
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:22.080]  And I'm just supposed to be all for it or I'm not trendy.
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:23.080]  Oh, I got stacks for their news,
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:25.080]  but let's just go ahead and take a few phone calls here.
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:27.080]  Oh, let's go ahead and talk to Nick in New Jersey.
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:29.080]  Nick, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:32.080]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing on this wonderful,
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:33.080]  tyranny-filled afternoon?
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:36.080]  Well, I mean, you know, we need to give $1.1 million fines
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.080]  and arrest people that say the carbon tax increases prices,
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:40.080]  which they admit it does.
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:43.080]  I mean, you know, you don't have free speech in Australia.
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:44.080]  Oh, no.
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:47.080]  And, you know, we got our Americans getting zuckered
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:48.080]  all over the place.
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:50.080]  Oh, you know, we told you it wasn't worth $100 billion.
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:51.080]  It wasn't worth $10 billion.
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:53.080]  We told you it was already on the way out, already declining.
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:54.080]  A lot of analysts had said that.
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.080]  We told you you'd be ripped off by him.
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:57.080]  We were conspiracy theorists.
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.080]  Now they totally ripped everybody off.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:01.080]  Turns out he insider trade, but that's fine with all of them.
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:02.080]  He loved him.
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:05.080]  He's like, he's like MF Global Head, John Corzine.
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:08.080]  I just can't believe how everybody gets zuckered in by that.
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:10.080]  Facebook is such the coolest thing on the planet right now.
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:11.080]  Why do they like it?
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:13.080]  It's cool to get, it's cool to take your children up to the TSA
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:15.080]  so they can gang-wrap them.
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:17.080]  That's what I was calling about, actually.
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:21.080]  I have a question, maybe search a little bit of advice
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  for me and all your listeners.
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:27.080]  Now that these TSA agents will be harassing us
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:31.080]  on the streets and at our bus stops and whatnot.
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:32.080]  I have a question.
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.080]  I'm wondering if, since they are not sworn and bonded officers,
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:41.080]  do we have the right as Americans to refuse them to show them ID
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:42.080]  or let us search our bags?
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.080]  Yes, yes, but they have force du jour or force.
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.080]  Is it force du jour or force?
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.080]  I always get my French mixed up, but it means the overpowering force.
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:56.080]  Bank robbers that come in with machine guns and say,
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:59.080]  get on the ground or I'm going to splatter your brains.
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:01.080]  They are illegally doing something,
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:05.080]  but they're in control by the overpowering force or force.
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:06.080]  Because they have the gun.
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.080]  Force du jour.
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:08.080]  That's what tyranny is.
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:11.080]  And so the feds were able to get the beach out of,
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:13.080]  oh, just some people that aren't really cops
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:14.080]  are going to violate your Fourth Amendment,
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:15.080]  but just at the airport.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:16.080]  Yeah, that's for your safety.
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:18.080]  Next, you're going to take your shoes off, take your belt off.
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:19.080]  Next, we're going to yell at you.
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:22.080]  Now we're going to body scan you and touch you.
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:23.080]  Now we're going to touch you and body scan.
[02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:25.080]  Now we're going to put you in a closed room and strip search you.
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:26.080]  Now we're going to scream at you.
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:28.080]  Now we're going to do a chest x-ray.
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:29.080]  Now we're going to be on street corners.
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.080]  Now we're going to be at your house.
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:31.080]  Now we're going to be everywhere.
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:32.080]  Now we're going to be at your school prom.
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.080]  Now we're going to be.
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:36.080]  So it's totally illegal on the books.
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.080]  I've had prosecutors, state reps, congressmen on.
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.080]  It's illegal.
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.080]  But they've got cops that when the congressman says,
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:45.080]  you're hurting my genitals, they go, officer.
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:48.080]  The officer comes up and says, you'll be ejected right now
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:49.080]  and fine if you don't let him.
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:51.080]  And the congressman goes, all right, all right.
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:53.080]  And it's the state's exercise of power.
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:55.080]  And they're like, that's right.
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:57.080]  And now we're going to hire pedophiles.
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:49:59.080]  There's nothing you're going to do about it.
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:03.080]  And if you speak out against the carbon taxes, you go into jail.
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.080]  How's that sound?
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:05.080]  That sound like freedom?
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:06.080]  Oh, that sounds awesome.
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:09.080]  The cops, the PS agents are high fiving each other, you know,
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.080]  going to go have a soda around the corner after they harass us
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  and play with my genitals a little bit, right?
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:15.080]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:16.080]  And it's force measure.
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:17.080]  I always get it.
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:19.080]  Well, what's force does your then?
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:20.080]  I know there's two different laws.
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:23.080]  It's like Nome de Plume is a pen name.
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:26.080]  Nome de Guerre is your war name.
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.080]  You know, like they call it famous football player,
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:31.080]  you know, the crusher or the, you know, something like that.
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:35.080]  There it is, force measures, superior overpowering force,
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:37.080]  unexpected or uncomfortable event.

[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:49.680]  It is disgusting to see how they reacted with this so-called

[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:15.440]  I didn't go because I knew what it was. I come from a long line of military people
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:23.560]  that every one of my male relatives have served in military service Army Navy Marines and Air Force and

[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:58.480]  But I still get out and the only place I go is the doctor the pharmacy the grocery store
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:03.360]  That's it, but I've gone all over my neighborhood and passed out
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  I make up a little
