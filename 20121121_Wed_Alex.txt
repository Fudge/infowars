[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.000 --> 00:40.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.000 --> 00:50.000]  it is Wednesday the 21st day of November 2012 I am your host Alex Jones and we
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.600]  are going to be here live for the next three hours the founder and head of
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.920]  WorldNet Daily will be joining us Joe Farah does a Farah in the second hour
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.720]  today to give us his take on what he sees as the biggest threats to liberty but
[01:05.720 --> 01:11.480]  also some of the positive things he sees unfolding always a very informative and
[01:11.480 --> 01:17.520]  enlightening talk and he'll be joining us today for now or Joseph Farah in the
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.840]  first and second hour obviously there is a cornucopia a veritable plethora a
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.320]  galaxy of important news that we will attempt to at least go over in some
[01:29.320 --> 01:36.220]  detail and I also intend to open the phones up and take your calls and we
[01:36.220 --> 01:43.120]  will get into that coming up in the next segment I will give you the number
[01:43.120 --> 01:49.160]  obviously the Middle East situation is continuing to deteriorate and whereas I've
[01:49.160 --> 01:56.280]  said that it's wrong that Israel's using high-tech weapons to devastate large
[01:56.280 --> 02:05.160]  swaths of the Gaza Strip it is also out of control when the Palestinian
[02:05.160 --> 02:12.840]  Authority celebrates suicide bombings and rockets killing people I mean just
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.360]  from a PR perspective it's like when Hillary says we came to Libya we saw
[02:18.360 --> 02:22.520]  he died or when people make jokes about killing I mean even if you're going to
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.440]  kill it is very unsavory to brag about it even when you personally have done the
[02:28.440 --> 02:33.560]  killing taking human life is a very solemn act but it's all part of this
[02:33.560 --> 02:37.680]  globalist disconnect from reality with the corrupt elite that we have in
[02:37.680 --> 02:48.120]  control bus bomb rocks Tel Aviv I meant push for Israel Gaza truce and that's
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.680]  just some of the news and information we have on that front today you know I
[02:52.680 --> 02:56.160]  talked to Watson a couple days ago and asked him to do an article and he's
[02:56.160 --> 03:00.480]  going to do one soon but anybody can pull this up Israel actually founded
[03:00.480 --> 03:09.520]  Hamas in 1973 that's a redstrizzling post UPI you can pull those up and read
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.840]  that for yourself just type Israel founded Hamas into a search engine you
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.760]  can get the mainstream news on that just like our government funded and
[03:18.760 --> 03:23.080]  created al Qaeda and just like our criminal governments let al Qaeda and
[03:23.080 --> 03:30.160]  Libya Syria and other areas part of what Wesley Clark broke down see there's a
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.600]  Wall Street Journal headline how Israel helped to spawn Hamas that's kind of a
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.200]  spin no no they founded it to actually set it up as a counterbalance to
[03:40.200 --> 03:47.520]  Hezbollah as a divide and conquer the Iranian manipulated group but but Iran
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.720]  wasn't in control of Hezbollah at that time so I guess it was mainly if I go
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.200]  back from memory it was a counterbalance the PLO the Palestinian
[03:57.200 --> 04:05.760]  Liberation Organization again there's just too much news happening too much
[04:05.760 --> 04:14.520]  unfolding right now to not be here on air on the day before Thanksgiving and if
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.600]  I sound a little bit slow I only get sick every couple years and I had a little
[04:18.600 --> 04:27.400]  24-hour bug and I've still got it but I am here but I just want you to know why
[04:27.400 --> 04:36.080]  sound a little bit different it's actually kind of purgative that's a word to
[04:36.080 --> 04:43.000]  the 25 hour bug kind of cleans you out of you know what I mean okay we've got
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.400]  so much news I am gonna break down when we come back huge developments on the
[04:48.400 --> 04:54.280]  TSA front as free humanity strikes back against the dog training tyranny of the

[05:11.640 --> 05:15.400]  drought and agricultural history and what about the presidential election this

[07:58.120 --> 08:12.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones
[08:17.680 --> 08:26.360]  it is Wednesday the 21st day of November 2012 I'm Alex Jones your host and we
[08:26.360 --> 08:29.800]  have Joseph Farah of WorldNet Daily joining us in the second hour to talk
[08:29.800 --> 08:35.760]  about the agenda of Barack Obama you know I read the articles they wrote it
[08:35.760 --> 08:42.680]  confirmed my own analysis and I got to tell you everything that Joseph Farah
[08:42.680 --> 08:48.160]  and others said that Obama was planning in his next four years is certainly
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.480]  unfortunately being proven true in fact and then some never underestimate the
[08:53.480 --> 08:59.400]  activities of a group of control freaks who've been given basically unlimited
[08:59.400 --> 09:07.520]  governmental power to dominate the population never underestimate what
[09:07.520 --> 09:15.760]  they'll do never underestimate hiring a bunch of minimum wage employees giving
[09:15.760 --> 09:21.160]  them a two-week training course and telling them that they can read minds
[09:21.160 --> 09:26.520]  and that everyone is a potential terrorist of course they'll go from
[09:26.520 --> 09:33.680]  9,000 employees 11 years ago to 70 plus thousand today of course the TSA would
[09:33.680 --> 09:37.960]  end up being on our highways in our schools at our shopping malls and
[09:37.960 --> 09:44.600]  changing the entire culture certifying police and security guards waving a
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.680]  magic government wand and telling them they can suddenly stick their hands down
[09:48.680 --> 09:54.440]  your pants I've sat back and watched the body language of TSA flying and you
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.480]  can see the low-level ones are just there for a job and look extremely
[09:58.480 --> 10:02.200]  depressed but then there's those in the mid-level and upper-level management
[10:02.200 --> 10:09.000]  who are craved with a petty will to power they don't have the mind they don't
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.400]  have the IQ they don't have the the heart the history the research the blood to
[10:16.400 --> 10:21.920]  be a leader on their own among men and women by what they produce and what they
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.760]  stand for but within the larger structure of a parasitic authoritarian
[10:27.760 --> 10:36.960]  eugenics-based social engineering system they swim freely like amoebas in a
[10:36.960 --> 10:48.840]  fetid cesspit amoebas in a sewer filled swamp and this is their day this is
[10:48.840 --> 10:55.240]  their season and the season is just beginning the season of wickedness the
[10:55.240 --> 11:02.240]  season of darkness the season of oppression the season of injustice and
[11:02.240 --> 11:10.760]  humiliation and sickness and pain and poverty everything bad replacing
[11:10.760 --> 11:15.920]  everything that was good because as due process and the Bill of Rights and the
[11:15.920 --> 11:23.840]  Constitution and the defense of liberty as that exits the vacuum is filled with
[11:23.840 --> 11:29.640]  the most abhorrent because you're not just going to get some median level
[11:29.640 --> 11:36.120]  corruption that too will be displaced in fact all of the out-of-control abuse we
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.440]  see right now and that we think can't get any worse and gets worse every day
[11:40.440 --> 11:50.560]  the good is exiting the chamber out the vent out into space by the global
[11:50.560 --> 11:56.520]  propaganda machine that acts like a fan blowing it out into that comes
[11:56.520 --> 12:05.480]  corruption oppression mercenaries control freaks and dupes but as the
[12:05.480 --> 12:09.920]  chamber gets filled with that it will still continue the tyranny will still
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.640]  continue to be intensified blowing that out until the most corrupt the most
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.000]  wicked the most cunning fills the space and then they will turn off the
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.800]  propaganda machine they will close the little trap door and it will be a
[12:27.800 --> 12:35.520]  contained space that is known in literature and in all cultures as hell
[12:35.520 --> 12:42.920]  living hell if you've studied North Korea for the last 55 60 years it can
[12:42.920 --> 12:48.640]  only be described as a living hell even for the 1% of the population that's the
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.320]  inter-communist party if you study the Soviet Union under Lenin Mao Khrushchev
[12:53.320 --> 13:00.280]  and others it can only be described as a living hell if you study Nazi Germany
[13:00.280 --> 13:08.160]  once it bloomed into 1939 1940 can only be described as a living hell if you
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.160]  study Cuba it can only be described as a living hell if you study any of these
[13:13.160 --> 13:19.240]  places where the tyrants get in control it is a living hell and the tyrants
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.640]  themselves generally end up being paranoid sequestered up in their little
[13:23.640 --> 13:32.200]  ivory towers themselves in a hell of there and their cohorts creation okay
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.200]  what's coming up today we've got quite a bit of new reports that have stacked up
[13:37.200 --> 13:42.520]  this week because we're not doing original nightly news every night because
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.560]  holiday week we're using that finish from the new studios and put in some of the
[13:46.560 --> 13:54.640]  new equipment and do some training but still they produce news pieces and these
[13:54.640 --> 14:00.280]  these are excellent as an interview that David Knight did that I want to
[14:00.280 --> 14:04.360]  interview that I want to play an interview he did had a Freudian slip I
[14:04.360 --> 14:08.000]  want to interview this gentleman as well I've interviewed him before House Bill
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.640]  80 Texas Freedom Travel Act which would make it an offense to touch someone's
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.440]  private parts as a condition to enter a venue or travel also prohibits separating
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.280]  a child from his or her parent which the perv forces like to do because if you
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.400]  can train a mammal to give up its youth to an obviously predatory person you
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.880]  don't know you've broken the will to survive you've broken the most basic
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.360]  instinct to defend the youth because there's only people have that basic
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.360]  survival instinct individually that's the most powerful instinct and then the
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.840]  but well I'm starting at the end of the equation the most powerful instinct is
[14:44.840 --> 14:50.520]  to protect your young that's number one number two is to protect yourself and
[14:50.520 --> 14:59.560]  number three is procreation so they say sex sells the holy act that's why we're
[14:59.560 --> 15:06.760]  so attracted to it it's the creation of a new life for me a splicing a 50-50
[15:06.760 --> 15:14.000]  genetic clone of two people it's kind of a big deal but the system always seeks
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.520]  to lower it down and debase it and make it a petty act because if you make it a
[15:18.520 --> 15:26.680]  petty act and not something that is the greatest thing in all of creation you
[15:26.680 --> 15:33.640]  can then debase the entire flow of the life force and the chain of life itself
[15:34.440 --> 15:42.760]  and I'm not judging anybody out there in my day I was quite promiscuous the point
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.440]  is is that I now understand these things and as you become a man you set aside the
[15:47.440 --> 15:52.000]  things of a child or as an adolescent and I'm just trying to tell people things
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.280]  so you can miss out on some of the some of the things that some of us have
[15:57.280 --> 16:01.400]  unfortunately not missed out on you may sit there and say oh yeah I'm sure it's
[16:01.400 --> 16:07.080]  terrible you're missing out on all that I know a lot of rock stars for whatever
[16:07.080 --> 16:18.640]  reason big ones and they'll tell you that it's it's destructive and side
[16:18.640 --> 16:22.480]  issue the problem is getting into things everything is interconnected and I have
[16:22.480 --> 16:25.960]  thousands of points I want to make in my thought process runs about a hundred
[16:25.960 --> 16:34.000]  times faster or more than my verbal capabilities do but you know look it's
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.600]  called common sense but it's not so common in an age of disinformation and
[16:38.600 --> 16:51.840]  poisoned minds a festering culture but the point is we'll get to his interview
[16:51.840 --> 16:59.640]  with that state representative that has introduced that Simpson so that is going
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.800]  to be coming up later in the shower and then I've got a bunch of other reports
[17:03.800 --> 17:10.520]  here on carbon taxes I've got one on succession and some others so we're
[17:10.520 --> 17:14.840]  going to be airing some reports there some will be premiering here on the
[17:14.840 --> 17:25.480]  radio today now that said I do want to open the phones up and we will do that
[17:25.480 --> 17:35.640]  on any issue you'd like to raise here on air and I'll do that now you know what
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.800]  I'll do it after the break because I think it's best that I at least mentioned
[17:39.800 --> 17:44.720]  some of the news that we have here that I will attempt as best I can to get to
[17:44.720 --> 17:52.760]  today boy I didn't think I'd ever see the drudge report calm trifecta but three
[17:52.760 --> 18:01.240]  info wars dot com articles up at drudge report calm and I know why the articles
[18:01.240 --> 18:04.280]  were on drudge report calm sometimes I'll see an article right when it breaks
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.000]  and I'll go oh out of a hundred thousand articles out today I know that'll be on
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.880]  drugs because drudge knows from a populist perspective what people are
[18:12.880 --> 18:16.280]  interested in because it's what he's interested in that's what governs what I
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.760]  cover I think it's interesting you're gonna hear it covered here but three
[18:21.760 --> 18:28.400]  articles children being expelled in San Antonio for not wearing RFID tracker
[18:28.400 --> 18:38.320]  chips around their necks and two other articles that also got into the TSA
[18:38.320 --> 18:45.680]  activities so we're gonna be getting into those reports here today and the
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.000]  Rutherford Institute has taken up the San Antonio family that we've been
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.520]  championing the Hernandez family and they're in court today so after
[18:56.520 --> 19:00.560]  Thanksgiving well undoubtedly maybe get an update on Friday when Mike Adams is
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.920]  gonna be sitting in here get an update from from them on that situation but I
[19:05.920 --> 19:09.560]  do have some newscast on that we're gonna play some clips of here today as
[19:09.560 --> 19:16.880]  well and we have a big stack of TSA tyranny here there as usual going over
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.240]  and above what I could even imagine they would do and then here's another
[19:21.240 --> 19:27.800]  article that's up at drudge report comm today cameras inside mannequins now
[19:27.800 --> 19:30.800]  spying on shoppers because they want to get the cameras down at ground level
[19:30.800 --> 19:36.240]  it's all part of creeping you out again breaking your will also on the economic
[19:36.240 --> 19:41.760]  front a very important stack of news on what's happening with the engineered
[19:41.760 --> 19:48.560]  financial cliff and then bus bomb rocks Tel Aviv amid push for Israel Gaza
[19:48.560 --> 19:54.000]  truce again how do you pick a side in this when both sides are killing each
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.640]  other and why did the Palestinians start firing rockets a month ago I mean why
[19:58.640 --> 20:04.640]  did they invite this attack we just had a terrible storm in the east but we are
[20:04.640 --> 20:08.880]  all still in the eye of the perfect storm we have the most devastating

[24:37.400 --> 24:42.280]  universe and for giving me the great gift of consciousness and life and
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.520]  steering me through all the trials and tribulations of my 38 years about to be
[24:47.520 --> 24:54.480]  39 years upon this planet and successfully protecting me so far and my
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.160]  family so that I might grow and develop because more and more I realize one of
[24:59.160 --> 25:02.700]  the greatest sins of the New World Order is trying to shudder people's
[25:02.700 --> 25:08.760]  development trying to dumb them down so they never find the beginnings of their
[25:08.760 --> 25:15.320]  true human potential and I'm very thankful for our forebears our founding
[25:15.320 --> 25:20.600]  fathers and the women who supported them and their families for the great vision
[25:20.600 --> 25:25.840]  they had and the great time bombs they prepared for corrupt tyrants of the
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.120]  future the First Amendment the Fourth Amendment the Tenth Amendment the
[25:29.120 --> 25:36.960]  Ninth Amendment the Second Amendment that simply point out in unenable
[25:36.960 --> 25:44.680]  unalienable rights that were there from the foundations of our world because
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.240]  it's it's hard once you have a basic liberty established to get people to
[25:49.240 --> 25:58.200]  give up that liberty yet it recoils against being enslaved that's why
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.680]  tyrants the last few thousand years when they first take over a central
[26:02.680 --> 26:06.920]  government they haven't taken over the general population yet they always
[26:06.920 --> 26:16.640]  create a new police corps of thugs control freaks petty clerks nobodies
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.240]  William the Conqueror who invented the modern what is the modern property tax
[26:22.240 --> 26:29.960]  I don't know how many years ago was it 1100 years ago not 1100 800 years ago I
[26:29.960 --> 26:36.760]  was flipping the numbers it was 1100 we look up the data William the Conqueror
[26:36.760 --> 26:44.840]  takeover of England the point is he brought in the property tax and then he
[26:44.840 --> 26:51.560]  set up his own new paramilitary enforcer there were more than 50,000 because I
[26:51.560 --> 26:56.680]  have the history of the property tax right over here my little hand there were
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.920]  over
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.760]  50,000 different private landowners and what is just England not Scotland not
[27:05.760 --> 27:13.880]  Ireland but just what is England and by the time he died there were there were
[27:13.880 --> 27:26.680]  only a couple hundred yeah 1066 but by 1100 he took over in 1066 and by the
[27:26.680 --> 27:35.360]  time he died a little after 1100 they had gone in purposefully and destroyed
[27:35.360 --> 27:43.040]  the economy brought in a blight you see taxes are the power to destroy they're
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.840]  designed to destroy middle-class infrastructure they don't want you
[27:47.840 --> 27:54.880]  uppity you see state of Texas last year got a little uppity when the the house
[27:54.880 --> 28:01.160]  of representatives in the state I live in state I hail from unanimously voted to
[28:01.160 --> 28:07.320]  say look we have existing laws that police can't touch your genitals we're
[28:07.320 --> 28:11.360]  going to enforce this a felony on the inside of the pants a misdemeanor on
[28:11.360 --> 28:15.600]  the outside we're going to order the state police into the airports the feds
[28:15.600 --> 28:19.200]  are power grabbing these aren't even sworn officers on top of it they
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.560]  shouldn't be called officers there's a federal bill to try to make them stop
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.400]  calling themselves officers because an office an officer means you hold an
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.520]  office under the state or under the government in the past if you were a
[28:30.520 --> 28:33.960]  federal office officer you to be commissioned by Congress they weren't
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.320]  about to just let the president start appointing who he wanted because the
[28:38.320 --> 28:46.400]  president might appoint a bunch of his men to do a William the conqueror so we've
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.240]  been through this over and over again we left we live 75 years on average and
[28:51.240 --> 28:56.320]  if we forget history we repeat the same thing we do the same things over and
[28:56.320 --> 29:02.120]  over and over again and now we've got tyrants who write books about how they
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.280]  do the same thing over and over again and how they're scientifically trying to
[29:08.280 --> 29:14.040]  bring something in that can't ever be defeated but then the feds threaten an
[29:14.040 --> 29:18.600]  armed blockade of the state if it passed the Senate so they killed it but here it
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.160]  is TSA reportedly exposed breast representative Ralph Hall's teen grand

[34:45.360 --> 34:51.560]  why is he saying that it's called being flippant it's called being caddy it's
[34:51.560 --> 35:04.440]  called sarcasm sarcasm sarcasm Darren McBreen and Rob do finished the Satan
[35:04.440 --> 35:13.480]  speaks little video I did in the tradition of Goath he wrote in the
[35:13.480 --> 35:20.400]  under 1830s or so a Faust which I need to reread and in the spirit of the
[35:20.400 --> 35:25.160]  screw tape letters that were written by C.S. Lewis which I'd never read when I
[35:25.160 --> 35:34.480]  was a child my dad would drive me to school and a few mornings a week he
[35:34.480 --> 35:43.460]  would play books on cassette tape and so I listen to the screw tape letters but
[35:43.460 --> 35:47.400]  didn't even know that C.S. Lewis had written them or they're gonna make a
[35:47.400 --> 35:53.840]  movie out of it but it's it's it's it's the devil or it's a high-level demon
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.840]  talking to one of his mid-level demons and man I was just rereading that last
[35:58.840 --> 36:03.240]  night well I'd listen to it but I was rereading it for the first time
[36:03.240 --> 36:08.240]  physically reading it it's just amazing the knowledge that C.S. Lewis had about
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.600]  how real evil works whether you believe in a physical manifestation of the devil
[36:12.600 --> 36:20.920]  or not I just did a one-take deal where the devil is talking to his son and it's
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.640]  so frightening sounding that I realized that the public is so dumbed down now I
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.520]  can't even put it out like this people won't even understand it they'll think
[36:31.520 --> 36:37.640]  I'm a literally worshiping Satan and that I want the no no no the real devil
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.880]  wants to act like it loves you and it's a nanny state and there's nothing really
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.200]  concrete in the world and why don't you go along to get along and everything's
[36:48.200 --> 36:54.800]  nice or or for those that do have a side of flair to them that the devil is
[36:54.800 --> 37:00.480]  adventure and the devil is power and the the devil is is you know a gorgeous
[37:00.480 --> 37:07.560]  woman no God gave us gorgeous women God gave us handsome men and daring men
[37:07.560 --> 37:14.440]  and loving mothers that's creation that's life a beautiful woman so
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.960]  incredibly gorgeous their eyes their eyelashes their hair the curb of their
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.880]  shoulders their breasts their waist their hips their legs their feet all of it
[37:23.880 --> 37:30.480]  that is life that is that is a creation that is not the devil that does not come
[37:30.480 --> 37:44.040]  from the devil that has not come from hell rotting stench is what comes from
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.040]  death and I don't want any part of it and I'm gonna say this the globalist love
[37:48.040 --> 37:56.600]  to get people into wars because out of wars they can corrupt societies and they
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.760]  can consolidate the power and the wealth because people will get in line during
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.800]  wars as many attire and has said war is the health of the state but it's more
[38:06.800 --> 38:11.280]  than that for these social engineers that's why they have wars on illiteracy
[38:11.280 --> 38:16.080]  illiteracy gets worse wars on drugs more drugs flow in because they run the
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.320]  drugs it's a full spectrum dominance they bring it in people sell their bodies
[38:22.320 --> 38:27.160]  people rob their houses rob your house to buy the drugs at a hundred times they
[38:27.160 --> 38:30.720]  should cost then that's laundered through the big banks then if they catch
[38:30.720 --> 38:35.400]  low levels using it they put you in the prison to go to college to learn to run
[38:35.400 --> 38:41.960]  more criminal operations run by the banks as well then the general public
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.680]  gets scared of the giant armies of criminals and calls for a larger army
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.120]  to handle it which is then more police and more bureaucrats and more judges who
[38:50.120 --> 38:54.560]  then prosecute wars against the general public and who put you in jail for six
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.680]  years for washing your car in your own lawn or leaving dog poop on the hike and
[38:59.680 --> 39:08.120]  bike trail see it's all actuaried angled out and it's not just my opinion the
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.800]  globalist right countless books and white papers bragging and so many times I
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.120]  read their white papers and I come in here on air and source them and show them
[39:15.120 --> 39:19.520]  to you but I know that 99% of you probably more don't even go read them if
[39:19.520 --> 39:25.960]  you just read it you'd know how serious this is because the globalist have
[39:25.960 --> 39:31.360]  realized how humans work they study us like like an ornithologist would study
[39:31.360 --> 39:38.480]  birds or a zoologist would study you know just the keeping of animals in
[39:38.480 --> 39:46.920]  general and they talk about us like they're animals and the elite consider
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.360]  themselves be different species no you're not a different species in the
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.280]  way you say that you're missing your heart and your love and your compassion
[39:54.280 --> 40:01.680]  and the higher wisdom that what you do under others will come back on you there
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.560]  is no escaping it there is no escaping it there is no escaping you reap what
[40:07.560 --> 40:13.280]  you sow karma what comes around goes around everyone inherently knows this
[40:13.280 --> 40:22.000]  and God fear not I'm God fearing what I call God fear isn't that you're afraid
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.360]  of God it's that you're afraid of violating the true wholesome good order
[40:27.360 --> 40:37.040]  the chain of life you inherently know that it's bad to hurt a child but you
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.760]  don't not hurt a child because it's some sin you're holding back from you
[40:42.760 --> 40:54.240]  abhor it if someone points out that even that type of idea exists that's God
[40:54.240 --> 41:04.400]  fearing and so much of the modern giggling evil is a let the devil take it all I
[41:04.400 --> 41:10.320]  don't care what's going on I don't care what's happening I don't care what it
[41:10.320 --> 41:16.040]  does other people I don't even care if I'm destroyed myself I'm going to go out
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.400]  and I'm going to have a good time and then those people invariably die when
[41:21.400 --> 41:27.920]  they're 25 30 years old they invariably are completely unhappy and they leave a
[41:27.920 --> 41:36.480]  train destruction behind them the higher level globalist though they are
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.360]  conscious of all this but they are so desirous to destroy the mass of
[41:41.360 --> 41:49.680]  humanity that they actually try to take care of themselves as best they can so
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.440]  that they can achieve the goal of hurting more people because that for them is
[41:55.440 --> 42:01.680]  the ultimate act of creation and power it is a monument to their beauty as they
[42:01.680 --> 42:12.680]  see it and they are very threatened by the pure they are very threatened by the
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.440]  good they are threatened by beauty they are threatened by innocence it is like a
[42:18.440 --> 42:21.880]  bright light the cockroaches
[42:21.880 --> 42:34.120]  and they are playing God I mean it is the ultimate fallacy and off the chart
[42:34.120 --> 42:42.160]  hilarity if it wasn't so serious the most but backwards thing I could imagine
[42:42.160 --> 42:50.040]  that the people running the dominant environmental religion movement are the
[42:50.040 --> 42:58.680]  ones accelerating the nano tech takeover the cross species genetic
[42:58.680 --> 43:07.880]  manipulation and literally hundreds of other abominations because they are
[43:07.880 --> 43:12.640]  driving it from an abomination perspective you see you could say let's
[43:12.640 --> 43:21.440]  have a collectivist utopian altruistic directed social engineered system to
[43:21.440 --> 43:26.320]  lift up humanity but I use this analogy a hundred times I'll use it the hundred
[43:26.320 --> 43:32.480]  and first it'd be like Gandalf in Lord of the Rings trying to use the ring for
[43:32.480 --> 43:42.880]  good but it would turn to bad but we're not at the point of a big giant
[43:42.880 --> 43:50.440]  government that could go bad it has been scientifically evil for at least 85
[43:50.440 --> 43:57.880]  years in the central hubs of the scientific tyranny and has now metastasized
[43:57.880 --> 44:06.520]  out and is a full grown man it is now in its prime lifting the axe above the
[44:06.520 --> 44:13.800]  Republic I mean it is red level we're under attack it's on and the beginning
[44:13.800 --> 44:20.080]  is now here everything we've seen previous was was like a kitten playing
[44:20.080 --> 44:25.280]  with a mouse it's not a kitten anymore it's a saber-tooth cat coming down on
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.160]  us and I'll go to your phone calls and have all these reports coming up in
[44:28.160 --> 44:33.920]  Joseph Farah it's just that we better be thankful for what's good because evil
[44:33.920 --> 44:43.320]  is not being able to recognize wholesomeness from spoilage and the
[44:43.320 --> 44:58.440]  system seeks to disease our minds so that we might be destroyed because if
[44:58.440 --> 45:05.080]  your mind is not diseased physically and spiritually and mentally it will its
[45:05.080 --> 45:15.080]  programming is to resist this and to do everything in its power to stop it now I
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.640]  do have all the news here and I'll bring some of this up with the judge Joseph
[45:20.640 --> 45:32.200]  Farah but I got into this latest talk this latest line of discussion this
[45:32.200 --> 45:40.400]  latest slow-motion tirade talking about war because you look at what the
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.240]  Israelis are doing and how they've been dehumanized and how their government
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.560]  controls the media and how they're a big welfare state and a collectivist state
[45:48.560 --> 45:57.520]  and a police state surrounded by big barbed-wired walls and then the
[45:57.520 --> 46:03.200]  Palestinians pushed out in their own areas they've become their own police
[46:03.200 --> 46:13.160]  state and why why did the Palestinians on October 24th fire 80 rockets in
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.360]  Israel or in there after the ceasefire Palestinians launched mortar shell the
[46:18.360 --> 46:22.480]  28th Palestinians fire two rockets two-grad missiles striking four schools
[46:22.480 --> 46:26.440]  October 29th Palestinians fired 20 rockets and mortar shells in Israel
[46:26.440 --> 46:32.080]  October 30th Palestinians for the first time use 45 km rockets to fire into
[46:32.080 --> 46:38.800]  Israel Palestinians fired two Quasim rockets November 4th Palestinians fire
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.320]  a Quasim rocket into Israel November 6th following the shooting of a Ghazan
[46:43.320 --> 46:47.000]  civilian approaching the border with Israel Palestinians fire a rocket
[46:47.000 --> 46:53.040]  November 9th Palestinians fire two Quasim rockets remember 10th Palestinian
[46:53.040 --> 46:56.720]  militants fire anti-tank missile the 90 of Jeep thrown the border Palestinians
[46:56.720 --> 47:00.800]  then fire 25 rockets IDF airstrikes destroyed several Palestinian targets
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.360]  remember 11th Ghazan groups fire a hundred rockets and mortar shells at
[47:06.360 --> 47:11.240]  Israel cities and towns November 12th Ghazan government fired nine rockets as
[47:11.240 --> 47:16.080]  other Israel number 14th Israel targets Hamas leader Ghazan government fired
[47:16.080 --> 47:22.600]  nine rockets and it goes on you see here's the problem with all the reporting
[47:22.600 --> 47:27.160]  I'm seeing on what's happening in Israel either it's one-sided to Israel or
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.440]  it's one side of the Palestinians and both sides are vitriolic but I notice
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.360]  because I don't control what my writers you know do I mean the people I hire I
[47:36.360 --> 47:40.160]  know have good heads on their shoulders and I respect that our reporting is
[47:40.160 --> 47:45.800]  probably 90% pro-Palestinian and I called a few of my riders yesterday and I
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.600]  said look we can be against the bombing of these civilians and killing them but
[47:50.600 --> 47:56.080]  some of these articles were posting don't even talk about the fact that the
[47:56.080 --> 48:02.400]  Palestinians are breaking the ceasefire and and my issue is we need to go full
[48:02.400 --> 48:11.440]  spectrum on this and explain that Israel created Hamas in 1973 and that our
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.880]  government credit Al Qaeda and that our governments put the Muslim Brotherhood
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.440]  in everywhere now to then support this new escalation who stands the game from
[48:20.440 --> 48:24.000]  getting both sides to kill each other because that's what'll really end this
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.280]  is the full spectrum realization that the military industrial complex wants to
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.240]  keep these wars going and that it's wrong when we had Ray McGovern on it's
[48:34.240 --> 48:37.240]  you know we're wrong when he talked about he's right to bring it up you know
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.760]  that in a Pentagon meeting they're saying let's move you know let's let's
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.840]  mow the grass dehumanizing the Palestinians like that he's right
[48:44.840 --> 48:51.240]  that's wrong but it's also wrong when I go to these Palestinian sites and I see
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.000]  him and they say Jews aren't human and Jews are the devil and I mean you know
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.320]  I was on a site this morning just by accident that showed me as a goblin Jew
[49:00.320 --> 49:05.960]  and then had all these Jews with big giant noses like Hitler cartoons the
[49:05.960 --> 49:13.480]  weird thing is I'm not Jewish but if I was I'd be proud of it but but the point
[49:13.480 --> 49:19.820]  is the reason I get into this is is that it's so mentally ill and if the
[49:19.820 --> 49:24.640]  Palestinians wanted spokespeople it probably shouldn't be the lowest of the
[49:24.640 --> 49:34.520]  low Nazis living in their mother's basements because it is just that's
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.200]  what I'm saying I don't like what Israel does and I criticize Israel and Israel
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.000]  has race laws where you can be arrested if you marry someone who's Jewish if
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.240]  you're a worker there I mean that's some serious stuff that should be talked
[49:45.240 --> 49:49.760]  about and instead it's almost got to be on purpose I mean I can't I know how
[49:49.760 --> 49:52.880]  Turner was a government agent and I said that I could prove that but you can't
[49:52.880 --> 49:56.040]  prove it with all of them but most of them are either government agents or
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.560]  their snowballs you know they're repeating what they heard their mocking
[49:59.560 --> 50:05.160]  birds you know snowball gets bigger because the anti-Israel propaganda is
[50:05.160 --> 50:13.000]  so nasty and so ham-fisted that it makes Israel look good and it makes you even
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.840]  if you've been a critic of some of the things Israel does go well I'm sure not
[50:17.840 --> 50:25.160]  gonna be with these people I'm sure not going to but again that's what war does
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.840]  and my point is is that there's a lot of hypocrisy here Israel's full of
[50:30.840 --> 50:35.080]  hypocrisy Palestinian governments are full of hypocrisy and and why does
[50:35.080 --> 50:41.640]  an Egypt let in the Palestinians most of them want to leave I mean why not why
[50:41.640 --> 50:50.680]  doesn't Jordan do that why didn't Syria why doesn't Lebanon well the truth is
[50:50.680 --> 50:55.280]  all those governments need that fight to continue so they can keep people at
[50:55.280 --> 50:58.800]  each other's throats and point at each other as the bad guys for their
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.240]  military industrial complexes have you ever wanted to generate your own

[54:33.440 --> 54:37.000]  important what's happening also the Italian Supreme Court president calls
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.280]  for a new 9-11 investigation an international criminal court into the
[54:42.280 --> 54:45.640]  fact that's an inside job former Italian president's gone public saying that
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.200]  they were briefed that it was an inside job of course it was by the criminal
[54:49.200 --> 54:55.320]  elements that run our government today. Mike in California listing on KOMY 1340
[54:55.320 --> 55:01.280]  a.m. you are on the air sir. Thank you Alex for taking my call hey Alex that last
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.480]  segment really spot-on with the analysis over in the Middle East I would
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.360]  encourage your writers to maybe you can listen to that segment for a future
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.840]  future thought for some of the emphasis in their articles I wanted to
[55:15.840 --> 55:21.560]  comment on yesterday's program I didn't get to listen to it in its entirety but
[55:21.560 --> 55:29.240]  about this next from now to in the next three years that being a real key point
[55:29.240 --> 55:38.040]  for if there's any possibility of the American spirit to have a chance to take
[55:38.040 --> 55:46.720]  back some or preserve some freedom and liberty that it's we better get it up
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.160]  right now and do what we need to do. Well that's my point I mean I'm not
[55:52.160 --> 55:57.240]  calling for people to follow my plan to restore the Republic I'm saying it is up
[55:57.240 --> 56:00.000]  to the states Declaration of Independence it's not even what you call
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.360]  secession the states created the federal government we've got to move
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.360]  through the states to block the TSA if the states have to control the borders
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.920]  and they have to do it it's their right to defense if the hijack feds won't do
[56:11.920 --> 56:17.200]  it and we have to get aggressive about this and it's a process it's not going
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.000]  to happen it's not going to happen overnight but let me tell you my call
[56:21.000 --> 56:30.000]  someone call it a clarion call war cry as one writer called it is to get people
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.600]  to realize we're being conquered by collectivism right now collectivism
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.600]  bankrupt she was regulations on purpose exempts the insiders so they can dominate
[56:39.600 --> 56:44.520]  me the only ones that exist in the artificial economic ecosystem and then
[56:44.520 --> 56:48.840]  they come in with collectivism siphoning off the tiny middle class that's left
[56:48.840 --> 56:53.160]  until it's gone then once they have a giant mass of poor people they tell them
[56:53.160 --> 56:57.600]  go live in cardboard boxes and then the and then there'll be paramilitary police
[56:57.600 --> 57:02.440]  to mow them down if they get in the way of that and then whatever's left the
[57:02.440 --> 57:06.640]  middle class will be protected along with the elite by the paramilitary troops
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.200]  and we'll beg for the paramilitary troops to mow down the cardboard box
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.920]  people because the middle class would have had their firearms taken you
[57:13.920 --> 57:17.880]  disarm them you take their jobs you bankrupt them it's called enslavement
[57:17.880 --> 57:22.640]  go ahead that means me to my next comment now I'm there's a lot of you know
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.360]  talk about secession I know that you guys carry the documentary in your store

[57:41.440 --> 57:45.320]  everybody should see yeah I think I believe it's important now you mentioned
[57:45.320 --> 57:51.600]  about Ron Paul and putting up there I agree with him being instrumental but
[57:51.600 --> 57:56.560]  my attention keeps on going back to the Achilles heel of emphasizing one man
[57:56.560 --> 58:01.480]  instead of a no I agree Ron Paul needs to come out what he's done I don't want
[58:01.480 --> 58:05.920]  to get into inside baseball but I've spoken with Ron Paul I've spoken with
[58:05.920 --> 58:12.240]  his crew yeah he's got I've spoken to his people he's got three big unannounced
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.840]  projects that are about to be announced that are big that he's committed to but
[58:16.840 --> 58:20.920]  they but they they are looking at what we're talking about and trying to make
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.280]  that a focal point and if we can keep Jesse Benton out of it or Jack Hunter
[58:25.280 --> 58:28.840]  we should be okay according to them the Bilderberg group's great people
[58:28.840 --> 58:33.680]  literally so but that attempted coup d'etat inside the Paul organization has
[58:33.680 --> 58:38.360]  been routed all right we'll be right back stay with us

[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:57.800]  it's a Yorkie and he's driving crazy Alex I gotta ask you do you know what
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:07.920]  brought Castro Hitler Putin etc etc to power the internal stranglehold of their
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:12.680]  economies you know one has to ask you know he's here about a hitler well why
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:18.600]  Hitler why was he brought in and you know the same thing and to come in said
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:24.360]  oh no not this lifetime are we gonna be having this take place after Yeltsin
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:30.120]  after Gorbachev sold out to the West that's exactly what was going on and you
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:33.360]  talked about the Palestinians I've had to grow a thicker skin over the years by
[1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:37.200]  way I've been doing this for 32 years trying to shout from the mount top so
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:41.280]  it's going on day and night nighttime talk shows and everything but you know
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:47.040]  you asked about the Palestinians and Israelis we love Israel it's Israel
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:52.160]  leaders we hate just like in this country we hate our leaders exactly our
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:57.440]  media always spins it and says you hate America you don't like the government
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:02.400]  no no no I love my country I hate my out-of-control illegitimate government
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.560]  and and exactly my only issue is both sides are killing each other it's wrong
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:13.440]  but but the government stay in power because of the constant state of war I'm
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:20.200]  just saying the pulling back and the not taking sides is what brings clarity to
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:25.160]  this that's what I'm saying yes but it's the chicken and egg theory which came
[1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:31.080]  first who's subjugating who into abject poverty right next door actually
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:35.560]  cousins I follow I got it no I got it you're saying the Palestinians have a
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:39.880]  right to revolt because they were the ones heard it out and pushed out through
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:45.480]  tribal warfare that and the way they're being forced to be led around by the
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:49.080]  nose today we couldn't stand it what they're doing is to get trivial kids to
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:53.160]  stand sentry at different checkpoints a guy go through all day and rate of
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:57.000]  boulder heads off a 12 year old kid telling them what to do grown people and
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.880]  that Alex you know I'm sorry well no no I'll say this this my biggest problem
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:05.880]  what's happening in Israel it is true that a lot of the Israeli advisors are
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.960]  the ones over here training our police and so we're like turning into that over
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:16.640]  here no it's bad I I mean listen I'm just so sick of it and I'm so sick of
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:22.160]  hearing about it all day too and I'm and I was making the point about the
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:29.000]  anti-Israel crew is is cartoonish and I think sometimes that's on purpose to
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.960]  make anybody critical of what Israel's doing look like buffoons I mean have
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:37.120]  you seen how almost every site is now governed by whoever's the most radical
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:43.080]  online and so it's literally like Nazi propaganda now yeah and people telling
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:48.280]  me how Hitler was good I mean no I studied history real history Hitler was
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:53.080]  an absolute out-of-control lunatic and so my whole issue is you know it's like
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  either Iran's go to the US is bad or the US is good and Iran's bad no they're all
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.920]  corrupt governments the point is you're right our government's the one that
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:07.160]  overthrew their legitimate government in 53 that was pro-america and it's true
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:12.240]  the West goes around backing the overthrows of different places to take
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:17.400]  them over go ahead let me close with this you know it's not coincidental that
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:21.960]  we just happened to be involving all these countries and killed them right
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:26.760]  left the Christians and that Muslims are all getting killed that and who
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:30.960]  benefits from that and we're being the big bully boy for Israel used our
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:35.160]  military and everything and that's exactly what's going on I think Israel
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:39.960]  they pack and everything's got a hole for our military you know listen there's no
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:43.760]  doubt that there's no doubt that a special interest apex up there at the
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:47.040]  top and is in there manipulating and that's wrong this whole betray us thing
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:50.880]  and the rest of it it's probably a part of that manipulation I hear you we're
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:54.160]  gonna go to break and come back with Joseph Farrah straight ahead on Alex

[1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:37.280]  network ladies and gentlemen we are joined here on the Alice Jones show
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:42.560]  that's yours truly by Joseph Farah the founder of the Western Journalism Center
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:46.080]  also been a newspaper editor at some of the biggest papers in the country and
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.240]  of course he's headed up world net daily since 1996 one of the biggest
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:55.560]  constitutional libertarian websites out there well the biggest if you don't
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:59.680]  count something like info wars.com or drudgereport.com and all the books they
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:03.880]  they published countless books just a real force out there and I wanted to get
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:08.160]  him on he's hard got to get on but here he is for his take on the election
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:13.320]  because he had said before the election that constitutionalist libertarians
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:18.560]  might get run out of the country if Obama got reelected and you know four
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:22.720]  years ago he hadn't backed McCain against Obama he wrote the book none of the
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:26.880]  above a bestseller but now Obama had told us what he was going to do coming
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:30.720]  after semi-auto handguns and rifles wants to shut down over a thousand
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:37.920]  power plants they shut down 200 plus and it crippled us already he's he I mean
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:43.600]  we've got the whole agenda and now it's here and it's on and we are in grave
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:50.760]  grave trouble not that not that Mitt Romney was great either but the vote for
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:54.960]  Obama and now they say a mandate conservatives you better get more
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:00.920]  socialist than Mao Zedong and Lenin and Karl Marx combined or you're not going
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:06.280]  to win well that's a hoax we know that the numbers vary but 12 to 15 to 18
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:11.360]  million people that would have voted Republican because the way Ron Paul was
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.320]  treated other things and and we've seen serious numbers proving that they
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:19.840]  didn't vote and so now the argument is hey sometimes it's good to get that
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:23.400]  hundred and five fever and really you know kill whatever's in you that virus
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:27.560]  of that bacteria well now it's here so we better use this tyranny to wake
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:34.400]  people up states rights movement lawsuits exposure or it's over because once
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.480]  you get a pure democracy and you get 51% that can vote away the money of the
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:43.320]  other 49 you go into a hardcore tyranny now of course the megabanks the offshore
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.800]  folks are lobbying for this because they can then get all their corporate
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:48.960]  welfare as long as they've got a giant group in fact I have an article here I
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:52.920]  want to go over some of it later it was up yesterday the American Dream blog we
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:57.240]  headed up an info wars.com government website for immigrants come to America
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:00.560]  and take advantage of the free stuff the Daily Caller also reported on it
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:05.840]  worldnetdaily.com also reported on it welcome to USA.gov and we've got
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:11.080]  copies of what it advertises here to get all your free welfare come here have
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:14.680]  your babies for free get everything free free free and then let you vote
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:19.680]  fraudulently to take well Alex Jones's guns and raise my property taxes you know
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.560]  my house value's gone down quite a bit the state says we're not going to let
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.800]  you contest that and it's just it's going to go up and we only passed a new
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:32.120]  property tax to build stuff for the University of Texas that's got close to
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:34.760]  a hundred billion dollars or more you heard me around a hundred billion
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.920]  dollars there will be fewer jobs for American workers under this of course
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:43.960]  it'll drive down the wages and create a new voting bloc so this is it they're
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:48.720]  conquering us through collectivism the ultra rich using the poor this is the
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:55.920]  old pattern Steve shank uses the analogy of scar in the Lion King I saw the Lion
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:59.520]  King like ten years ago and never made this point on air but it's true as he
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:04.960]  goes to the scavengers the hyenas there and he says hey help me overpower the
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:10.360]  lions make them our slaves make them hot for us and all you'll never go
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:15.360]  hungry again so they do that and they go and they take over and that's what's
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:20.960]  happening here and it's all just going into hyperspeed here there's a Senate
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:24.200]  bill set to vote that's called the internet privacy rights bill that
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:30.640]  actually says no more warrants period for anything I mean it's all happening
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:36.320]  right now it's totally insane and we face just unbelievable times this is not
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.480]  hyperbole folks I have to have talks every week with my wife because as a
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.400]  mother you know my wife's smart but as a mother the basic instinct is to protect
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:51.320]  your children I got three children and she's lived around the world she's got
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:56.920]  a degree in history she knows she's lived in Europe you name it and she she
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:02.040]  says man this we know where this goes we better get out of here and I'm like
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.920]  nope no word around we're going down with the ship and she's like okay but
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.160]  I mean that's not hyperbole we have to have this discussion now you know like
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:13.280]  6 30 in the morning at least once a week seems to be when it happens you know
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.640]  when the kids are still asleep and you're looking at them asleep in bed
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:21.080]  that's when again I'm not staying here to be the big radio star I'm not staying
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:25.720]  here to do all this I could go overseas and do my show I go to Switzerland right
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:30.280]  now folks but you're not going to get away from the New World Order with activity
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:36.600]  like that Joseph Farah worldnetdaily.com WND.com I'm just kind of having a
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:42.400]  public display here of what I'm really feeling and intellectually seeing where
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.960]  are you with this whole election and just the fact that it's not just that we
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:51.960]  have the socialism the federalization the police state gear up the EPA
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:55.920]  announcing six years in prison for dog poop in your backyard mainstream news
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:14:01.680]  six years in prison for soap running off your car when you wash it and nothing
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.360]  to do with the environment just total control the the nanny state the giant
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.560]  prisons being built everywhere the police bugging their eyes out everywhere I
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:14.040]  mean where do you see this going Joseph Farah? Well I agree with your entire
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:20.280]  analysis couldn't agree more I would raise one other issue that you didn't
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:24.840]  touch on it I don't know if you've touched on it since the election Alex and
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:30.640]  that is that I think one of the things we learned from this vote was that it's
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:35.920]  not even a legitimate vote I mean quite honestly with the when you look at all
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:42.320]  of the shenanigans involved that I think the vote was stolen I think it was
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.360]  stolen probably because of the voting patterns we have the new machines now
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:51.120]  now I knew just just interrupt then I'll shut up I knew you were gonna go there
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:54.680]  without even knowing where you'd go first that's why I left that out and
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:59.760]  again you know I'm nonpartisan so are you they even Bev Harris who's been a
[1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:03.240]  Democrat that you know the top expert she said well I mean go over the
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.400]  anomalies they're not anomalies they announced states before any votes were
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:10.920]  counted they they there were precincts with zero votes for Romney with thousands
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:15.160]  voting I mean it's a fraud absolutely and it starts before the election because
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:19.320]  you know I think we talked about this perhaps the last time I was on I mean
[1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:25.320]  these voting machines where there's no paper trail anymore where you know a
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:31.440]  little alteration in the software can effectively change the vote they gave a
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:35.800]  vote and so forth we saw evidence of that but just days before the election you
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.720]  know they were testing machines and they found that the people who voted for Romney
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:45.320]  their vote was turned up into a vote for Obama and so forth and you know the most
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:49.320]  people probably thought oh well they they'll get those bugs worked out before
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:54.480]  election day but on election day one of the guys in Chicago who was who was
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.680]  who had discovered this problem he's actually you know actually working on
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:03.200]  the machine he went he went in and voted for Romney and he saw his vote changed to
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:09.800]  Obama and he brings it to the attention of the a poll worker and he's told well
[1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:15.360]  you should just assume that your vote was recorded correctly now you know I don't
[1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:19.240]  know about you Alex are people listening to us right now but you know I
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:25.360]  actually want to see my vote recorded the way I cast it and that's just one of
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:31.800]  literally dozens and dozens of anomalies you know before the election as you know
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:38.360]  we were very concerned at W&D about foreign contributions making their way
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:43.360]  into the Obama campaign and it happened in 2008 there were no consequences for
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:48.720]  it no prosecutions whatsoever this is strictly illegal foreigners cannot
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:55.600]  contribute to US election that's the law well it happened in 2008 we documented
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:00.840]  it and in two so in 2012 we decided to test the system to see if there'd been
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:08.000]  any reforms we made donations to Obama's campaign on his website using a
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:15.360]  Pakistani IP address and using the name Osama bin Laden occupation deceased
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:22.800]  terrorist and his employer Al Qaeda he lived at 9-11 Jihad way in some place
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.720]  in California we had to use the US zip code that's because you have to put that
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:32.960]  in and we so in other words we we raised every possible red flag you could
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:38.760]  raise to get this donation disqualified we really didn't want Obama to take our
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:47.920]  money but he took it and he took it again and again several donations made by
[1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:53.800]  Osama bin Laden we then started you know some other who else can we have a
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:58.960]  donate we had Ahmadinejad donates Hugo Chavez all kinds of people every
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:04.120]  single one of these don't and again all using foreign IP addresses which should
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  be a total giveaway I mean you you've got a website I've got a website I've
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:14.120]  been in this business for over 15 years and I can tell you the easiest thing to
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:18.800]  detect is an IP address and if you you know it's not against the law for me to
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:24.040]  sell things to foreigners but if it was I can block every single foreigner from
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:30.160]  buying anything at WND which is exactly what you would expect a campaign to do
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:35.280]  a presidential campaign but they didn't in other words they were encouraging
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:41.280]  foreign donations now we got a lot of publicity about that did they give the
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.880]  money back no they still haven't given the money back so we filed an FEC
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:52.040]  complaint with these very specific examples and even that and that's been
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:56.040]  made public Obama campaign knows about that that they give the money back no
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:02.360]  now at some point I expect the money will be returned but there'll be no
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:07.440]  penalty there'll be no you know major investigation there'll be no scandal and
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:12.280]  I believe that this is the tip of the iceberg in terms now let me give you an
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.480]  example of why this is a big deal
[1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:22.520]  Obama bragged about the fact that you know what a high percentage of donors
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:27.840]  gave $200 or less I tell you what Joseph stay there we got to go to break I
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:32.000]  don't want to cut you off here and we come back get into this but yes just
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.320]  like fast and furious didn't get in trouble just like Cylindra didn't get
[1:19:35.320 --> 1:19:39.600]  in trouble they can't give the money back because that would set a precedent
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:44.000]  for all the other and so you could have Satan you know giving him a million
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.120]  dollars from Hades from Hades and that would be the end of it so this is
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:53.360]  basically what's happening they're just setting a precedent to do whatever they
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:57.700]  want Joseph Ferrer as our guest I'm Alex Jones we'll be right back with vote
[1:19:57.700 --> 1:20:00.120]  fraud
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:06.600]  we just had a terrible storm in the east but we are all still in the eye of the

[1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:18.440]  what about the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to

[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.000]  opt out and film them that's really been successful a testament to the public
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.280]  being angry bipartisan success by the way you got even big Democrat sites

[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.200]  to I want to salute all of you that have been involved got a bunch of special
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.280]  reports we're gonna be airing as well this is a short segment long segment
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:54.080]  coming up Joseph Farah head of world that daily.com I cut you off you were
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.600]  getting into election fraud and the evidence of it listen I had Bev
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  Harrison he's always very judicial very judicious and we're having her back on
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:11.240]  but she she said blackbox voting that org that it's hands down absolutely
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:15.720]  beyond fraud where and she had to admit she's good she's been a Democrat in the
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:21.960]  past she said that it was states where Romney should have won they announced it
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:28.080]  for Obama before the polls even closed and that that there was just
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:33.160]  unmitigated fraud off the charts this time where now they don't even try to
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:37.040]  hide it but go ahead and make the point you were making. Yeah well I started with the $200
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.920]  donations you know Obama brags about most of his donations were $200 or less
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:49.520]  but interestingly he has his campaign refused to release the records of the
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:55.040]  $200 donors and so here's what you do you know the way they spread wealth
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:26:00.640]  around right I mean government money you know they're billionaire friends what
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:05.720]  is to prevent the money from being spread out to people and they're
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:10.840]  instructed to make donations of $200 or less we have no record of those people
[1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:16.760]  it's unbelievable so that's it you know there there's so many ways that the one
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.720]  of the things that kills me the Democrats you know they're so much
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:24.600]  against voter suppression that's why they want to have photo ID laws where
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:28.600]  people have to you know actually show who they are when they vote these are the
[1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  people by the way want to put chips in you and want to identify every move you
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.360]  make but yet when it comes time to voting a legitimate time to ask somebody
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:43.840]  for ID all of a sudden it's voter suppression if you ask somebody for
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:49.400]  voter ID and in every state that required photo ID Obama lost okay that
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:55.200]  should tell you something about why voter ID so we've got to put voter ID in
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:00.320]  yeah I mean you know I mean gosh you got to drive a car you got a photo ID get
[1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:04.800]  on an airplane you got a photo ID you got people banking you got to have photo ID
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:08.960]  these are understandable things there's a lot of fraud out there why is it that
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:14.480]  there's no fraud at the election booth I mean it's crazy to think about this is
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:19.160]  supposed to look at how all the scientific polls had a neck and neck or
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:25.440]  or Romney a little bit ahead again but but just for the sake of you know debate
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.800]  let's say people really did elect him what do you think of how they're
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.960]  pushing it it's a mandate now for collectivism the Republicans better
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:36.400]  become collectivist or they're out of the game forever they're trying to move
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:42.240]  the overton window you know to towards total civilization yeah well you know
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:47.040]  the Republicans are in you know they're in the CYA mode right now they're
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:51.200]  already capitulating to everything that Obama want John Boehner the house
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:54.760]  speaker you know he's gonna he's gonna raise it that limited again he's gonna
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:59.000]  let Obama spend as much money as he want more taxes let's cuz the mega banks
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:03.440]  want that money that's why they're capitulating yep it's unbelievable look
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.560]  I predicted you know virtually I predicted doom today on your show
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:14.400]  before the election and this is what we're facing right now you know that's
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:19.600]  not to say I want people to give up the fight anymore than I want Alex Jones or
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:24.240]  I intend to give up the fight but we really have our backs to the wall the
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:28.320]  next four years are going to be very very ugly we need to be prepared for it
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:33.960]  we need to you know encourage each other stick together people who believe in the
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:37.400]  Constitution and the founding principles of this country we need to stick
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:43.200]  together more than ever before absolutely and you know and I still
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:47.280]  believe there's a chance we can eventually turn this thing around maybe
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:52.520]  maybe we need this tyranny Alex to wake people up in this country maybe they
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:56.280]  haven't experienced enough tyranny in the last four years maybe they got to see
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:29:01.280]  that overdrive and if they do and we're lucky people are going to rise up in
[1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:06.920]  anger and righteous anger and take this country back this was a short segment
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.960]  long one coming up but I want to get into your ideas of how to turn things
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:16.920]  around and look at some of the places we've had some success I mean are there
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:20.080]  any bright linings out there that you see other than the fact that sometimes
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:24.480]  it needs to get really bad first yeah I mean you know the old expression that
[1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:27.720]  darkest hour is just before the dawn I don't think we've reached the darkest
[1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:32.120]  hour yet I think the darkest hour is coming sometime in the next four years
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:37.280]  in this country and and hopefully that means exactly let's talk about from your
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:40.720]  deep research in the books you've published on this what the attack plan
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:45.600]  is going to be give us a heads up just a fair up straight ahead
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:59.440]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.440]  for 16 17 years and so many other issues defending the Second Amendment you
[1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:33.000]  name it and trying to influence the Republican Party to not be complete
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.040]  globalist but you know Joseph I want to go through a bunch of questions now here
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:40.440]  for you before we go to calls but that's my big issue here is the Republicans
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:45.160]  aren't really going after them now on fast and furious they're not going after
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:49.400]  them on salandra or salindra they're not going after him on you know they're
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:52.960]  giving in on the tax increases they're doing everything because we know the
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:56.720]  big special interest that put Obama and that's what they want you know it's the
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:01.640]  ultra rich that are running this thing against the middle class but I mean we
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:06.120]  could see the Republicans go after Obama for all the outlandish things he's
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:10.560]  done and kind of check this out of control executive power instead I've got
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:13.880]  articles here where the Senate saying hey we're just gonna get rid of the
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.400]  Fourth Amendment entirely it's not gonna happen we're not gonna see Republican
[1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:22.960]  even though you know I mean for instance the Republican how we could get the
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:25.720]  House is under the control of the Republicans for one reason the Tea
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:31.400]  Party movement in 2010 and these guys have contempt for the Tea Party movement
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:36.280]  that put them in power and are going to do everything to ignore you know what
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:42.800]  the Tea Party asked them to do and you know John Boehner is tripping over
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:49.280]  himself to accommodate Obama in every way imaginable so we don't have a two
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:53.240]  party system at work in in Washington even though we should because you know
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:58.600]  the House of Representatives is a very very powerful body that's the body under
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  the Constitution where all spending is initiated that's the one that's the
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:07.760]  body that before you can raise the debt limit they've got to approve of it
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.720]  Republicans have a majority in there in other words they could stop all this in
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:17.760]  in a you know in one vote Alex the Republicans in the House have the power
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.960]  to return us to something resembling constitutionally limited government
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:28.840]  overnight and they're not gonna do it they had chances to do it in 2011 they
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:32.200]  didn't do it they didn't do it in 2012 and they're gonna a few weeks they're
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:37.160]  gonna vote again and they're gonna give Obama all the money he needs to continue
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:42.680]  Obamacare and all these crazy stimulus programs at redistribution of wealth
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:48.080]  up the wazoo so do we have a two-party system in this country no not
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:51.800]  effectively we don't we got we got a one-party system that's right and I've
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:56.200]  now seen in hundreds of papers I know you've seen this as well because you
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:59.480]  tracked the news as a newshound just like we do with your great team up there
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.400]  to visit your office's amazing crew and set up you've got hundreds of articles
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:09.040]  the last month with mainline Republicans in the newspapers criticizing
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.400]  State House and and congressional members who were talking about agenda 21
[1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:17.920]  and the UN running our military now I mean that's in congressional hearings
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:23.560]  that NATO is telling the Congress what to do and that Congress now has just
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:28.640]  handed over and all of its authority on the power of the purse and then
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:34.320]  meanwhile the Republican Party is still busy trying to run a witch hunt against
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:40.080]  mainline conservatives that have woken up to what's happening thanks to you and
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:44.080]  drudgereport.com and you know some of the other sites and people that are
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:50.200]  covering issues like this it's just so frustrating that this should be our
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:53.840]  greatest hour when the world government's been announced we've been
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:57.480]  confirmed to be right it's run by megabanks that run derivatives the
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:02.280]  Federal Reserve and now America can wake up and we can take the states back and
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:06.000]  take the federal government back and restore the Republic. If you know what's
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.160]  going on it's actually funny to listen to the Republican establishment types
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:15.360]  making excuses about the election because to them it's the fault of
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:19.640]  conservatives that this happened now they went ahead and they nominated the most
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:25.320]  liberal guy they could imagine Mitt Romney right they picked you know most of
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:29.160]  the Senate candidates they didn't they didn't get their way on one guy Todd
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:34.760]  Akin so Todd Akin is to them is responsible for the entire election
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:39.720]  debacle and and now what they want to do is they want to make sure that the
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:44.600]  people don't get to choose in primaries anymore who the candidates are they
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:48.800]  wanted they want to pick them themselves which they did anyway for the most part
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.760]  but not 100% this is what I'm seeing from the Republican Party right now and
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  it's very very scary because you know you have to have some balance you got to
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:02.840]  have some opposition you got to have we'll have checks and balances our
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:08.680]  founding fathers a new also well and and we don't have them anymore exactly the
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.000]  Republicans operate like this placeholder of like oh there's
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.360]  conservatism and then meanwhile it allows the left to move even further
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  towards tyranny and then they go oh we lost because we didn't you know we
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:26.480]  weren't liberal enough do you agree with me looking at the numbers that it was
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:30.400]  Ron Paul people sitting and out that I mean other was fraud as well well you
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:36.080]  know hey did Romney lift the finger to enlist Ron Paul and his you know did he
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:42.280]  give them the time of day no and that was a huge mistake because Ron Paul
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:47.480]  showed in the 2012 primaries that he was you know represented a lot of people
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:52.680]  out there and and that was a tremendous you know an oversight what do you want
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:57.600]  to call it it was arrogant that there that they had no place else to go well
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:01.400]  they did have someone place to go they could stay home and that's what they
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:09.520]  did I mean if somebody told you a day before the election Alex that Barack
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:15.440]  Obama was gonna get 10 million fewer votes then he got in 2008 what would
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:19.240]  your prediction have been about the outcome it would be that he would have
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:27.000]  lost exactly but but Romney got three million votes less than John McCain got
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:32.920]  which was almost unimaginable no no what happened is a giant mass of
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:37.760]  Republicans that understand the Republican Party is a fraud and working
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:41.480]  with the Democrats stood down and I talked to these people they said let it
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:46.200]  get bad I got my guns they want a civil war come and get it and I think that's
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:49.800]  what it's coming down to and that brings me to my next point I don't want the
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:53.320]  media to be able to frame this as secession you know because we want to
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:57.320]  set up the South again or something I mean the Declaration of Independence says
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:01.440]  the states created the federal government they can abolish it or remake it or
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.560]  change it or abridge it whenever they see fit so why not have the states pull
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:10.960]  out have another constitutional meeting to not bring in new dangerous you know
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.280]  a constitution or a concon but to reupload the Bill of Rights a
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:19.440]  constitution and declare this federal government illegitimate I mean I think if
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:23.560]  we got that word out I've talked to a lot of Ron Paul supporters his advisors
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:31.360]  Edwin Vieira Bruce Fine of course also Lou Rockwell they said what I'm talking
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.480]  about is actually in the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:37.960]  Independence and of course I mean I know it's there but they concurred that it's
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:41.880]  a good idea well I'm just going with the founders idea it's not my idea it's not
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.840]  my plan I'm saying it's my plan now to get everybody to have a large debate and
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:51.880]  and kind of turbo charge the nullification movement like we see Texas
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.160]  unanimously voting to take that to kick the TSA out last year the Senate killed
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.800]  it then David Dewhurst though got shot down on the Senate because he helped kill
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:04.440]  it last year they're back with the bill again I mean I what do you say to my
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:12.600]  idea of packaging repackaging secession the way it was really meant to be that
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:16.400]  hey if the federal government goes rogue the states get together and remove it
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:22.960]  100% for it I've been for it for years talked about it many times Walter
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:27.920]  Williams is another guy who's talked about it eloquently for years and you
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.520]  know I think it's coming down to that I do believe we've got such a stratified
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:37.320]  society right now I mean you look at the the electoral map and that doesn't
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:42.160]  even begin to tell the story but you basically have you know urban areas
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:49.080]  versus rural areas and you know the people who live have chosen to live in
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:53.160]  the rural areas are people who want to be self-governing individuals they don't
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:56.440]  want to be messed with they don't want people telling them what to do the the
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:02.480]  people who love government have all flocked to the city and unfortunately
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:05.840]  there's more population in the city than there is throughout the rest of the
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.560]  country that's why the map looks so weird you know that the that Obama can
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:15.560]  win even though he's got you know it looks like just pockets you pocket
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:22.240]  around the country of support and so what we got to do is we got a continue
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:27.760]  even if we can find one state one state to make a stand I don't know whether it's
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:33.800]  Texas or South Carolina or North Carolina some state where we can we can
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:39.120]  flock there and we can build this that you know shining city on a hill and and
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:43.520]  and you know other people will want to come there good people want to flock
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.880]  there they want to be living in a in a society where you know you you earned
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:53.760]  what you deserve to earn and and you're not taxed but I mean we've got to do away
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:58.760]  with the IRS and we've got to do you know that means a complete break with
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:04.640]  Washington and I don't know if you know we've got the enough courage to do that
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:09.880]  today if enough people have enough courage to do it but really what
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:13.720]  alternative do we have well that's all the globalists as you know talk about
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:18.400]  is so-called tax avoidance havens the U.S. because we only pay 50%
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:22.000]  and you know federal some form of federal tax and all the different hidden
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.920]  taxes but you look at France where it's over 70 close to 80% you know the
[1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:32.120]  French government calls Britain a tax avoidance saving when they've got when
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:36.800]  they've got VAT but it's a fact government knows that when you cut taxes
[1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:42.480]  tax revenues increase just like Kennedy did he cut one tax bracket by 50% the
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:48.080]  other by 30 and tax revenues doubled by the next year so why do they want to
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:53.120]  keep increasing taxes because it's about control and then they get to give that
[1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:58.800]  tax money and contracts to themselves and they're not going to stop and and I
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:04.240]  just see their entire battle plan built around stopping a secession movement
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:09.440]  that's why it's obviously the key and that's why they love borrowing too
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:13.000]  because there's no accountability to borrowing you know you start raising
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:17.320]  taxes and people start getting angry but if you borrow money people don't feel
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:21.040]  it coming out of their pocket you know we haven't had the inflationary cycle
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:25.920]  that we all anticipated with this crazy borrowing that's been going on
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:30.680]  unprecedented and so you know we're going to see this continue now for four
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:34.640]  more years but by the time Obama is done we're going to be looking at the
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:41.040]  somewhere between probably around 25 trillion dollars in debt at this current
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:45.920]  rate it's unthinkable which is great for the big foreign megabanks because it's
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:54.720]  all zeros and ones just digits is just electronic digits it's amazing but when
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:58.400]  you don't pay your property tax they come and take your house but then I get to
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:02.040]  read the federal websites where they tell the illegals come here and have a kid
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:05.560]  for free and we'll put them on welfare and once you're here your whole family
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:12.240]  it's like wow if I don't pay my property tax which is really hard to pay it's not
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.720]  my property it's it's a rental fee then they come take my house but nobody
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:23.960]  cares about me but oh the government advertises in foreign lands to come here
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:31.080]  so I can pay for their life well you you asked about you know what's coming and
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:35.040]  this with this second term of Obama I'll tell you one of the first thing that's
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:39.760]  coming and and it's due to the total capitulation that once again of John
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:45.440]  Boehner and the leadership of the Republican is we're now going to see
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:50.960]  that comprehensive immigration reform that we've been hearing about for you
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:55.640]  know two administrations of Bush and one administration of Obama now there's a
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:00.680]  consensus in Washington Boehner who used to be against this when Bush was for
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:06.880]  it is now saying yes we got to do that we're gonna do it right away and you
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:12.360]  know that he's doing it because he believes I think he genuinely believes
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:16.920]  that they you know because they lose the Hispanic vote the Republicans do and
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:21.360]  the media can spend it because it's all about identity politics where people
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:25.200]  want vote for Obama because I'm black he's black how is it good for Hispanic
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:29.480]  Americans to have their wages knocked down to have their kids saddled with
[1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:33.120]  debt but the media says this is what Hispanics want so it becomes that
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:39.000]  bandwagon effect it's just unbelievable maybe maybe we should all move to
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:44.360]  Mexico you know the beautiful country great beaches natural resources take
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:49.520]  over Mexico might be easier than taking over the United States of America that's
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:54.640]  not exactly yeah but they got laws against that there and they got guns and
[1:46:54.640 --> 1:47:04.040]  drug cartels yeah it's we're in deep trouble I mean it's so crazy that that
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.880]  all of this is going on let's let's get I want to take some calls here but what
[1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:13.320]  are some of the other things you see front and center on the radar well very
[1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:17.360]  big story in WND today I hope you had a chance to see again it's called now big
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:23.320]  brother is really watching you and it's about DARPA but this is an aspect of
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:29.920]  DARPA I know you've talked a lot about this DARPA is now working in the realm
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:34.840]  of artificial intelligence remember this is the the film minority report
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:41.680]  pre-crime pre-crime unit yeah DARPA is on the verge of achieving that the
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:46.040]  pre-crime unit they're gonna be able to you know if you watch the TV show a
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:50.720]  person of interest you see it there that's what the machine does it for it
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:56.200]  to create it but was built to predict you know where the next terrorist attack
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:59.600]  was gonna come from but it predicts a lot of other things and of course they'll
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:03.400]  then stage something to claim it's infallible and it's it's like the
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:06.720]  zeitgeist movement once a computer that decides what we all get and a
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:11.120]  collective of systemal who programs who programs the computer just like you know
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.320]  other stuff's been proven a fraud like they plant DNA on people they've been
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.000]  caught doing everything else the lie detectors have been proven a fraud I
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:23.480]  mean this stuff can't be trusted no of course not trust machines I mean it's
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:29.960]  crazy but you gotta read this story by Steve Elworth very good very scary but
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:33.800]  yet you know you want to know what you were gonna be up against in the next
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.440]  a few years this is this is another thing I mean but this is gonna make
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:42.640]  Orwell look like a child's play by comparison and they're not just gonna
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:45.800]  use your neighbor titling on you because they're mad at you to get a visit
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:50.560]  they're building little NSA private hubs everywhere with these little spy bases
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:55.280]  all over the country and then these giant facilities in Utah and Texas and
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:59.000]  basically for those of you that like collectivism get this through your
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:04.360]  heads this is a collectivism with an architecture towards oppression I mean
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:08.480]  collectivism always goes that way to begin with but this is consciously going
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:14.600]  that way and you remember if you go back and you look at the worst tyrannies of
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:19.840]  the 20th century Stalin Hitler Mao etc. you know one of the things they did
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:23.680]  back then when they didn't have the technological capability that we have
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:30.720]  today is they just indoctrinated the kids and kids turned in their parents
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:35.160]  that was what they were trained to do and you know we're very close to that
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:38.840]  right now with the indoctrination of the public school system it is a status
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:44.040]  system and the kids are being turned away from their parents I gotta tell you
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:49.040]  out there all you parents you know one of the very first things you need to do
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:54.280]  if you haven't already done it is get your kids out of the state school system
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:50:00.040]  I agree by the way for at least 15 years they have ATF sponsored local sheriff's
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:04.160]  deputies that sixth and seventh grade teach the kids for a semester and they
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:08.160]  have quote access on the playground and lunch and they write essays on what
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:13.680]  their parents do and we've got school computers watching people at home and
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:18.120]  now in California and other states as you know Joseph they're giving kids
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:22.440]  inoculations without parental consent so it's already there I mean if you have
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:27.240]  a population than chips as you see the story today in WND about the girls
[1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:33.000]  about to be suspended from school because she will not accept a microchip in
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:37.920]  her student ID and they're gonna you know attempt to throw her out oh yeah they
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.680]  gave her the suspension letter in fact we we're gonna have their Nanda's family

[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:26.080]  hundred different ways but folks if you've studied mainline history you know
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:30.280]  how much trouble we're in I mean there's no doubt about this prognosis we like we
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:33.880]  came into the doctor and you had giant tumors the size of you know grapefruits
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.600]  all over you I mean you know they tell you you're in deep trouble this country's
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:42.600]  in trouble and you've got hard-working people that are holding it together and
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:46.520]  then a bunch of spoiled rotten certainly punks and I don't mean just poor
[1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:50.000]  welfare people a lot of them are disabled or you were brought up in it
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.680]  I'm talking about the yuppies and the so-called liberals they're not even
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:58.280]  liberals I want to make a film or write a book about my observations they're
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:04.440]  these anti-human evil-loving gibbering trendies Joseph Farrah what do you call
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:08.400]  those people I know you've run into them that just think corruption in the state
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:13.160]  is cool and they they think they're part of the system so they they get this
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:18.520]  reflected glory from it and they they giggle at anybody that's concerned what
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:21.440]  do you call those people I don't know what you call them but do you remember the
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:27.880]  movie The Matrix yes I think an awful lot of America is living in The Matrix you
[1:55:27.880 --> 1:55:34.720]  know and then there's a few people like you and me drudge and maybe you know
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:41.400]  lots of people other talk radio guys who are living outside The Matrix and it's
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:47.480]  so hard for us to figure out what's wrong with all these other folks because
[1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:51.440]  you know we don't know that they're that they got those electrodes in
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:55.760]  there in their brains and they're under the spell of The Matrix they're
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:01.800]  loving it they are under a spell it's it's they love the con they bought into
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:05.880]  it and it doesn't matter if we historically and accurately know
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:09.880]  exactly where this leads they just giggle at us it's it's funny let's talk to
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:14.440]  Robert in Texas thanks for holding Robert you're on the air great show as
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:21.640]  usual Alex and a excellent analysis from Joseph always a good guess there I just
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:26.320]  wanted to quickly mention that big pharma as one of the fronts that the
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:31.360]  people really need to pay attention to and I feel like natural alternatives are
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:36.720]  a way to go I just interviewed Rick Simpson the man who cured cancer and
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:42.040]  cancer in Canada using pure cannabis extract that interviews on Funkmaster
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.360]  5 channel if y'all want to look at that a lot of people out there listening
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:49.800]  probably know somebody who's affected by a chronic illness and are taking poison
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:54.000]  to treat it you know what you know what what's that guy's name was I've seen his
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.640]  research and it's in I've seen a lot of the studies that show cannabis oil has
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.280]  amazing effects and the FDA's been trying to block it what's his name again
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:06.200]  his name is Rick Simpson he's from Nova Scotia Canada and we just interviewed him
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:09.280]  last week I understand well listen what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna get
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:13.400]  some scientists on about him boil but but that's a separate issue I wanted to
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:17.880]  raise to Joseph Farrah here he was talking about election fraud does
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:26.800]  anybody really buy does anybody out there really in their wildest dreams and
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:33.600]  imagination really believe that prop 37 got voted down like that in California
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:36.480]  to know if something's organic and then what do you think about Obama going
[1:57:36.480 --> 1:57:41.360]  after the marijuana Joseph Farrah well all I know is that we are the most
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:44.960]  heavily medicated society in the history of the world all you got to do is
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:52.520]  watch television and every other commercial is drug peddling and you know
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:58:00.680]  it's crazy because you know I mean I used to be kind of a hardliner on drug
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:05.120]  legalization now I mean I realize that what the federal government is doing
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:10.560]  with this so-called the war on drugs not a war at all what it really is it's a
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:16.280]  way to control people and and you know we could see how effective the war on
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:20.600]  drugs was with the best furious where we're actually given guns the drug
[1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:26.840]  cartel but yeah big pharma is a is a is one of the biggest problems we have
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:31.160]  because I think what it essentially comes down to is they're keeping people
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:35.560]  that's the matrix okay but they're not plugged into electrodes but they're
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:42.600]  dope up and up there that's right stay there hold your eye back you are

[2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:48.360]  with Joseph Farrell of World Ant Daily your calls and a ton of news and special
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:51.960]  reports are coming up after the break right now let's go back to your calls
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:57.960]  John in Minnesota quick question or comment for Joseph Farrell. Yes I'm
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:05.960]  calling in tell a little story and also how the FEMA camps how how they plan to
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:15.720]  fill them I was a FEMA inspector still listed as one and after what I saw last
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:20.160]  year and what I was threatened with I decided not to go out for them anymore
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:27.240]  I called this then get back in March or April I called in to Sean Hannity show
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:32.080]  and they vetted me for two hours check me out said that they were gonna make a
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:39.080]  whole show around it and possibly bring me in to be on the TV show as well the
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:43.080]  following week they never called me back and I called back into the show and
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:47.160]  talked to the producer I had her private line and she said that Sean had
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:51.600]  decided not to follow the story that it just wasn't something that they were
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:55.000]  gonna do. I'm probably gonna have to put you on hold because Joseph Farrell's
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.640]  gotta leave her in about four minutes but give us a brief encapsulation and
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:05.640]  we'll come back to you after the break. Okay I was I got stationed in
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:13.880]  Philadelphia and was inspecting homes that were basically correct houses with
[2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:23.000]  decades of dilapidation and the I found children living in the squalor and you
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:29.560]  know with drug deals and drug use going on right in front of them and called it
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.560]  in then they told me to mind my own business. If you got a healthy baby if
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:39.960]  there if the if the bow doesn't match their dress then the CPS will take them
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:44.280]  because they've got folks that want the kid if the child is being eaten by rats
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:48.320]  literally they won't help them if it's a good drug dealing operation to launder
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:51.200]  some money for the banks. Joseph Farrell any comments on what this
[2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:55.000]  caller's talking about? Well I think he picked the wrong show to take his story
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:00.120]  to I think he should have taken it to the Alex Jones show. You guys don't exchange numbers I
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.080]  want to hear more. No no exactly I'm gonna put you on hold sir you can
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:07.200]  send us your stuff we'll vet it and then we'll get you on but I'll come back
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:10.240]  and have you tell your story just because it matches from what I know I mean
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:13.360]  you'll hear about the foster parents with this with kids and they can't get in
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:16.720]  trouble. Let's jam in well you know we're out of time for calls until I come
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:19.880]  back the next break. Joseph Farrell any closing comments you'd like to make
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:24.480]  today? Well just you know that you know look we're in for trying times we talked
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:28.040]  about this during the break Alex you know we're things are going to get worse
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:33.680]  before they get better it's a time for you know redoubling our efforts
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:38.680]  preparedness that we got to think survival for the next few years and it's
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:44.040]  very important that people like-minded people even if you know maybe previously
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:48.240]  we thought we were in competition with one another we got to stick together
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:54.560]  because if we don't we're gonna you know hang separately and and so you know
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:04:00.400]  everybody out there listens to Alex Jones I would urge you to support his
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:05.600]  work and whatever way you can whether that means buying his great books and
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:15.240]  DVDs and and you know this is no time for nitpicking between you know
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:21.160]  constitutionalist people who are liberty-minded we're gonna have to stick
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:29.640]  together we're up against it big time and so stay the course I know I
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:34.520]  predicted doomsday in the next four years but there's a there's a very good
[2:04:34.520 --> 2:04:39.040]  chance that the common tyranny we're gonna see the increasing tyranny we see
[2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:44.360]  in these next few years might just be the wake-up call that America needs to
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:48.760]  reverse course well it will be if we use it like judo and use their energy
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:52.720]  against us but everybody better redouble their effort to not just go to sleep and
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:56.400]  complain now is the time to take over the states Joseph Farah thank you so

[2:11:24.800 --> 2:11:29.640]  you take that down they're coming after me and so I just also want to tell
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:34.640]  people something that you the eye of Sauron is on this show the eye of the
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:39.800]  New World Order is fully aware of what we're doing and I say good put me on
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.240]  your list come after me because I know how evil you are and letting this type
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:50.160]  of evil come in is what is hurting the the the little children the CPS was
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:56.400]  shut up a hundred years ago roughly we were born to the caller as race eugenics
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:00.060]  courts or race hygiene courts you may have heard of that but only from the
[2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:03.600]  Nazis that's because the media will talk about that the Nazis got it from the
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:08.400]  United States in England England developed at the US perfected it the
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:14.000]  Germans blew its bad its good name I had a 40 and slip its bad name but they gave
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:18.240]  it its bad name because it deserves one I was about to say it's blew its bad
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:23.360]  name but I couldn't say that I said good point is they were pushing it as a
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:28.560]  great thing and until Hitler gave it a bad name because it deserved one and
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.800]  I've seen this with the foster parents not all of them there's some good
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:37.640]  Christian families out there but predominantly the warehouses of kids I
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:42.480]  have seen it with the with the warehousing homes they're all state
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:46.200]  certified folks and you can kill kids in these things and they don't lose their
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:50.400]  licenses I've seen cases where you've got to have three kids a died a small
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:55.200]  home in a year it was one in Oklahoma a case and they had the CPS director go
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:59.120]  children will die that's just the way it is that was the headline on the
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:03.600]  article children will die because in one week two had died and one had died the
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:09.120]  month before they were letting like two-year-old swim alone at the CPS home
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:15.480]  and had a pool in the back it was a taken over old hotel the point is where
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:19.000]  do you think the pedophiles go where do you think the abusers go where do you
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.160]  think they go to be in the government envelope where they're the authority so
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:29.120]  they're above reproaching they wouldn't do anything wrong folks that's in
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:32.840]  history the most dangerous thing is the government so the caller I don't know
[2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:35.560]  what his story is you don't hear about a minute of us we had to go to break he
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:38.640]  brought up how he went to the media tried to get this out they wouldn't
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:43.840]  cover it and how he was a FEMA inspector and the nightmare stuff he saw in the
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:48.520]  inner cities and yes if it is is that's what you can get a half million bucks for
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.960]  to the adoption agencies if it's a black haired blue-eyed or green-eyed person
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:56.520]  they'll kill parents for them that's whatever reason I've talked to the top
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:00.360]  people involved exposing this one I was a state senator they murdered when she
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:05.800]  just called me a week before and said I've got total proof of the of the of
[2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:09.080]  the list the roundups how they're picking kids out I'm coming on your show
[2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:12.040]  next week well they killed her a couple days later blew her and her husband's
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:18.400]  head off and but side issue she had the quotas the list all of it I don't know
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:21.240]  where his story is going he just said he was in FEMA he'd go in and see these
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:25.040]  crack houses and they wouldn't do anything look if it's a blonde haired
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:28.960]  blue-eyed baby and you go to have your child for the first time at the hospital
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:31.520]  they'll make it up and say there's marijuana in your blood and take your
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:35.320]  kid and if you try to fight back the cops will gun you down okay it's what
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:42.360]  works in America they do what they're told and if now if you're a black baby or
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:46.640]  Hispanic baby you they can drag those kids along behind them you know their
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:50.400]  car and no one's gonna get in trouble I mean if it's Hispanic or blacks they
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:54.240]  may throw them in jail for it but if it's black kids in foster care you might
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:57.880]  as well put them in a wood chipper for the media spends that I'm not saying put
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:01.720]  them in a wood chipper I'm illustrating how horrible either treated the media
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:05.000]  loves it takes stuff out of context what I say but people know they do that so
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.440]  it's fine but anyway sir I'm gonna give you the floor for about four or five
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:10.680]  minutes we're gonna go to break take a few more calls for those of them
[2:15:10.680 --> 2:15:17.000]  holding and I've got a news blitz and play these special reports but you've
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.200]  got the floor tell us why you were inspecting what you did at FEMA why you
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:26.080]  left and then we'll vet your information and do a full report for you and we're
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:29.680]  gonna give you I'm gonna give your number to Rob do to call you go ahead
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:37.040]  all right I was a disaster inspector so just a warning for all the listeners
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:42.920]  especially those in the Northeast right now do not take the FEMA money there's
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:48.800]  a clause that you sign on the tablet at the beginning the print is so fine that
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:56.320]  it's still legible but I read it and basically it says that you owe this
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:16:02.840]  money back and the federal government can seize your house of property if it's
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:09.400]  not paid back if you're able to pay it back because people aren't so they'll
[2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:17.280]  end up seizing the property when that time period is I cannot back up that's
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:20.400]  why they're now saying they're not gonna let most of New Jersey and New York the
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:23.600]  mom-and-pop motels and hotels aren't gonna be allowed to rebuild for
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:27.600]  environmental reasons but the government will authorize big companies to come in
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:37.960]  so this is how they take over go ahead okay so I was stationed in New Jersey and
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:42.720]  FEMA had run out of money earlier in the year because of the tornadoes in
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.680]  Alabama and Joplin and then some of the flooding up in North Dakota so they went
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:56.160]  to Congress and asked for more money when Congress gave FEMA the amount of money
[2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:01.640]  I'm not sure what it was it might have been like seven billion dollars this is
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:08.520]  when excuse me Irene and Lee hit up in the Northeast last year towards the end
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:14.320]  of the year just like Sandy did this year Irene and Lee didn't cause as much
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:19.840]  damage it was a lot of flooding a lot of rain now the people I was helping out in
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:24.680]  New Jersey last year were legitimately big they didn't they couldn't do
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:28.640]  anything and insurance wasn't gonna pay because it was flood and it was also a
[2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:32.760]  man made because they released the dam that flooded these towns I understand
[2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:39.000]  I remember that so tell me what you found and what the scandal is okay so they
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:45.400]  sent that when when FEMA gave them that or they get the money from Congress
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:50.600]  Congress also passed a law granting power to the executive branch the
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:56.480]  president that he claim any area a natural disaster area without the
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:01.040]  governor that state asking for federal assistance I saw that there is as well
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:09.160]  yes the very next day I was out of New Jersey and in Philadelphia giving crack
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:14.080]  houses crack heads tens of thousands of dollars for decades of dilapidation
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:20.720]  tens of thousands okay they got one inch of rain in Philadelphia from those two
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:28.400]  storms one inch we were replacing roofs remodeling houses but we were just
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:31.960]  giving them money those money were probably being smoked up in crack pipe
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:36.320]  that's 75% of the houses that I went into for crack houses unbelievable so
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:40.360]  what type of stuff were you seeing when you went in these houses
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:47.600]  the fill up need be spent condoms I'm sorry but this is you know crack pipes
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:52.640]  laying around high-dermant needles whiskey and beer bottles so the first one
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:56.160]  that I went to actually had a gun pulled on the outside and the guy told me to get
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:59.640]  away that I was there for him and if he said he was a block captain and they
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:05.440]  were gonna listen to him so I went in there's the three-story row house went
[2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:09.400]  in just it looked like somebody had hit a hornet's nest that's how many flies
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:13.920]  were in this place I get up to the third level and realize that there's kids
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:19.360]  living in this field three floors of crack smoking and crack dealing going on
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:26.080]  right in front of me I called it in for the kids and they told me of my mom
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:29.200]  business all right listen I'm gonna put you on hold I gotta give you more time
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:34.360]  stay there yeah I've seen I've seen this literally myself on investigations but
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:38.960]  when your kid at school falls and breaks their arm they'll still try to take them
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:45.160]  because you're healthy there's some fat pedophile wants to get your kid and they
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:48.400]  shop you know there's pedophiles one a five year old they're gonna get one they
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:51.720]  want a newborn they're gonna get one or they just got well-meaning families that
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:57.600]  get them the CPS is there to pray on good families and protect I can I could
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:02.800]  I'm gonna do it I could take you to a crack house right now we all know that

[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:37.280]  want to use your identity or not so but everything you're saying I already know
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.080]  to be true so basically you're told just give a bunch of money to the Crack House
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:48.960]  areas and again I started out on access television 17 years ago and it was
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:53.280]  right in an area of East Austin that had the guys coming out selling the crack
[2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:58.800]  I was at a gas station last week and there was a guy parked in a car with
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:04.600]  cars pulling up selling him some kind of white powder and little baggies and I
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:10.000]  knew not to call the cops nothing was gonna happen you know I mean if they
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:14.040]  did I'd probably get arrested for it or something besides the government ships
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:16.840]  most of it into begin with unless it's methamphetamine that they're cooking up
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:19.520]  you know private groups cooked out up that's why the government really hates
[2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:23.400]  that so much they don't get as big a cut because it's more grass roots certainly
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:29.560]  bad for you as well but I also growing up in Dallas Texas they wouldn't sell us
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:34.840]  beer in Rockwall where I lived underage people and I routinely almost every
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:38.680]  weekend when I've ride in with older kids you know because I was cool when I was
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:42.160]  12 13 14 15 I got to hang out with the folks that are few years older than me
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:47.160]  can't believe how much danger I was in we would drive to South Dallas in the
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:55.160]  crack neighborhoods and right next to the liquor stores right next to the liquor
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:00.160]  stores there would be crack houses right there and to be honest a couple times
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:05.360]  they would not sell us alcohol and when I was like 14 I was dumb enough they
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:09.760]  said hey Alex you know you and Chris or whatever you go over there and they'll
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:12.520]  sell it to you there and sure enough they did but let me tell you once or
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:16.280]  twice walking in one of those I knew and I wasn't there again to get drugs I was
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:21.640]  there to get you know 12 pack of beer but because the crack houses sell alcohol
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:24.760]  as well for those that don't know it's a one-stop shop but I mean you walk into
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:29.120]  these things and it's there's a guy with a gun on the table marijuana cocaine
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.480]  whatever you want alcohol you little such-and-such you little racial slur
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:37.600]  bam give me the money boom you're out and a cop drives right by when you come
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:43.320]  out so I guess there I am telling you that story but right down here right off
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:47.240]  East 11th I want to do that because I still drive down there sometimes they're
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:51.440]  still there I want to go I'll do it I won't tell the crew to it I want to go
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:57.240]  and I want to go walk into crack houses and then I'll call the police from the
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:27:03.880]  crack house I mean they know where they are it's a joke I'm sorry that they
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:08.240]  allow these districts to operate to sell her by the drugs okay I mean that's how
[2:27:08.240 --> 2:27:11.860]  this works the prostitutes all of it going back to the caller quickly
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:17.320]  finishing your story so you said something about this what happened you
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:21.120]  know they kept telling me to buy my own business tonight you know they said that
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:26.560]  they you know just send me home well you know we we don't have much money so I
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:32.560]  had to stay out in the field three days later my first appointment was at a
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:38.160]  house and they didn't answer the door left a note she called up later in
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:43.120]  afternoon just screaming at me that I've never showed up well I could tell by the
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.440]  swear in her voice that she was already high and she was probably sleeping off
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:53.400]  her ride the evening before so I guess there I showed up late in the
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:57.720]  acronym it was actually getting close to dark and we weren't supposed to be out
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:05.680]  that time anyway she was listed by herself as the owner and registered
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:10.320]  of getting a FEMA money and owner of the house and there were four children
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:15.840]  listed all that everybody listed all the children are in the computer system
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:23.200]  they show up so we go in the house and dog be fees ceilings came in and walls
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:29.880]  cracked and came in just horrible conditions and before kids there was no
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:34.640]  computer running around the house while there was another girl there you know
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:40.840]  older one of her friends was staring me down like I was caught then left right
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:47.840]  there we went we were going through the inspection and I could hear a baby crying
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:53.160]  upstairs and she kept screaming shut up baby shut up and I mean screaming
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:58.360]  you know on a screen like she did and I could just hear the baby crying upstairs
[2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:04.320]  but it wasn't listed on the computer so I figured it was other girls baby so we
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:08.040]  finally go upstairs and I can hear that I can hear the babies up in the front
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:12.000]  room and she's continuing the screen shut up baby not checking on it or
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:16.960]  anything and there were four reasons upstairs about the last one I was
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:23.360]  expecting because that's the way it was going we open up the door there's the baby
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:27.400]  laying on the floor tell us stay there we got to finish this after the break

[2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:14.080]  know that stop acting like I've done something wrong stop acting like all the
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.640]  theater they're terrorist everywhere your bosses put the underwear bomber on the
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:20.640]  plane on record you guys are now arresting people because they have

[2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:37.200]  all much to do about nothing the government shipping in the drugs the
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:39.960]  government's laundering the drug money the government's running child
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:44.120]  kidnapping rings the government's you know giving trillions of foreign banks the
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  government's involved every crime you can imagine but they want to all over the
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:51.400]  country they're trying to train cops that filming is illegal and they arrest
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:55.760]  people and it gets thrown out of court and cops lose lawsuits in Illinois they
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:00.080]  try to put a guy in prison for life for filming the cops and when the court
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:04.400]  threw it out I had the guy on the state attorney came down and tried to lobby to
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:09.080]  get it reinstated I mean they want you life in prison for filming police in
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:12.160]  public not doing anything wrong you shouldn't be afraid of it that's the
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:16.600]  thing they tell us you see they don't like these equalizers now good cops out
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:19.840]  there and there are a lot of them they understand that big government's
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:22.960]  dangerous they understand no checks and balances are dangerous and they
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:27.280]  understand it's good that people are out there filming you know if I was a cop
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:32.200]  and a good cop I would hope people were filming because you know then there's a
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:36.760]  record of what went on don't have something to hide you know there it is
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:40.760]  my whole issue is they get into our private information which they shouldn't
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:46.160]  do it violates the law with the NSA and the rest of it but then our public
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:51.760]  stuff they want to say is off limits no no it's the privacy of your home and
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:56.840]  why don't I want cameras in my house nothing to hide except my privacy I
[2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:01.680]  want to be able to do what I want I want to be you know all creatures need
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.520]  their privacy but out in public you don't have any and the fact that they
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:10.080]  want to try to threaten to arrest people the rest of it that's coming up and I've
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:14.640]  got so much to get to here okay so so so your FEMA inspector you're going to
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:18.400]  these houses crack houses you go up to the next floor of this house you're
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:22.920]  inspecting this baby's been screaming you open the door what do you see with
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:29.320]  the baby you've been here and screaming I'm sorry Alex I kind of broke down after
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:44.320]  thinking about the story go ahead it's okay go ahead it's okay good be strong
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:49.480]  for the baby tell us what happened the baby was laying in a polytrasch no
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:55.760]  diaper no nothing just lay in there with an empty bottle dried snot tears
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:37:04.200]  covered its face and the flies please were on top of it and she stood over the
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:10.240]  baby and started stomping beside it said screaming the shut up in effort shut up
[2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:15.000]  at the top of her lungs the point of where I couldn't even my eardrums were
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:22.320]  already was continued while I inspected the room for damages that were decades
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:30.000]  of dilapidation I understand so so so I will just like the TSA groves us in
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:35.240]  front of us it's all about out in the open so so how did this end I stepped
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:42.440]  out of the room and right when I got there the girl or right when I was
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:46.440]  stepping out of the room the girl that had left it showed back up and they
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:53.600]  closed the door behind me but it was still cracked and she I can hear the
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:58.080]  girl that I inspected the house for it did you get it did you get it did you
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:05.800]  get it give me a hit it started smoking rock right above that baby and I said I
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:11.000]  just said I need your signature and I'm and I thought only just came out signed
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:17.320]  it and she actually exhaled the crack smoke in my face oh yeah listen I could
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:23.600]  take into a live feed to anywhere in East Austin and show people smoking crack
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:28.360]  on the side of the street and cops driving by I can take you to any city in
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:32.840]  the US and show this but then I if I get pulled over the cops are gonna ask if I
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:36.320]  got drugs and I'm like do I look like I'm using the government's garbage and
[2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:39.760]  cops that are that have pulled me over know that this happens and they say oh
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:43.960]  what's your problem what's my problem the government ships it in don't give me
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:49.000]  your holier than thou garbage anymore and it just makes me upset about the
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:55.120]  entire situation and yes I know about that and I have absolutely not witnessed
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:58.520]  things like that but I've read about it in the news where it's a baby eaten by
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:03.280]  rats eaten by flies in it you know that you know or or you'll see the stories
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:11.080]  of a seven-year-old that weighed 17 of pounds and you know was like shriveled
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:16.080]  up and couldn't talk you know and death was a mercy and this is going on
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:21.240]  everywhere and the CPS doesn't want them because they're already being killed
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:26.760]  that's what they want they want your healthy kid if you're a good black
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:31.560]  Christian family with your with your kids all healthy and clean cut you won't
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:34.640]  give your kids inoculations they take them but we've covered those cases in
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:39.640]  Michigan if you're a white homeschooling family they're coming after you they are
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:47.520]  a force of evil I have been around them finish your story let me guess you tried
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:51.720]  to call FEMA tried to call others what happened I personally would have called
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:57.880]  911 and see that's why I'm gonna be honest the one area I'm cowardly in is
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:01.680]  this area because when I saw a cop choking a woman to make her sign a
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:04.960]  document to hand her kid over because it was a blonde-haired blue-eyed baby and
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:09.200]  they even filed fake paperwork I walked in the room and knew if I attacked the
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:13.000]  guy I'd go to jail and wouldn't be able to keep fighting him so I had to leave
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:16.920]  but then that gave me nightmares because at a primitive level I should have
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:20.720]  physically defended the woman I mean I it was all in a split second what I was
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:24.280]  gonna do to the guy but I didn't do it I was ready to execute on him but you know
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:28.680]  you know execute the defense of the woman but I stood down and doing that is
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:33.080]  very unhealthy for you and so that's why I don't want to go show the crack houses
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:36.600]  I don't want to go look at them I know why people leave it all over there
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:42.960]  rotting because because it's hard to look at but it's going on by design so
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:46.120]  so finishing your story and we'll get a hold of you and vet your story and then
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:55.480]  get it out for everybody finish the story all right so I go outside and you know I have like a 10 minute cry there because I
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:01.560]  couldn't control myself in my vehicle and I call them my female office and I
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:05.240]  tell them what's going on there's a baby that's not even registered in the
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.360]  computer that it doesn't exist you probably had the baby in the house and
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:15.720]  nobody even knows that it's in there except for me so I call them up and they
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:20.720]  said no you're not we've told you before this is not what you're there for you
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:24.520]  none of your business and I said well I'm gonna make it my business if y'all
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:28.920]  are gonna do anything I'm gonna call the police I'm gonna call CPS and before I
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:34.440]  could even finish my sentence she boarded it out if you call anybody we will
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:41.080]  have you arrested for violating her civil rights this is what I was told yeah
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:44.880]  just nobody knows that's a fraud no matter what you're told in the
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:48.760]  commission of a crime is happening and they tell you oh well there's a privacy
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:53.800]  clause all that goes out the window you know even with doctor client privilege
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:57.920]  that's how doctors spy on you now for no reason is because well they thought a
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:02.520]  commission of a crime was happening they twist that if you see if you sign
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:06.320]  forms of confidentiality and you're working somewhere and they're making
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:13.720]  methamphetamine in the bathtub you're allowed to go expose that go ahead so
[2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:18.840]  you know being as scared as I was and wanting to keep making money I understand
[2:42:18.840 --> 2:42:21.640]  you drove out of there you drove out of there but you tried and she tried to do
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:26.560]  the right thing later to get the story out so how did this end well three days
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:33.400]  later I went in and to another inspection and the lady she when I walked up
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:39.520]  she said I bet you seen some FH around here at me and I said oh yeah and she was
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:44.240]  an old black hippie lady and the things that were coming out of her mouth were
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:49.200]  totally unexpected and I did her inspection I'm not and during the
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:52.880]  inspection I told her about that what had happened and we were sitting down
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:57.280]  under dining room table and filling up the last bit of paperwork and she split a
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:02.160]  tablet across the table and said you know write down that a name and address
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:06.080]  you know because I wanted it before I said you know I can't do it I just can't
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:12.240]  do that and she's she got very angry with me and she said you don't think that
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:17.040]  God put you in that baby's life and then put you in mine so that we could save
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:21.840]  that baby this is what I do is I'll save those children you're gonna write that
[2:43:21.840 --> 2:43:29.640]  down and you're not leaving here alive she you know she made me see the light
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:35.040]  and I went into my computer and I gave her every single address that I had been
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:38.760]  to that was a crack house that had children in it you know I did a third
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:43.240]  party and I've been scared ever since for the past year that something's gonna
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:47.800]  happen to me and now that I'm on the air finally talking about it now I'm really
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:52.080]  scared well listen don't be scared brother because because every time I
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:55.800]  think about the new world order killing me or even coming after my kids none of
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:43:59.600]  them have a future we don't stand up now that's the thing about this evil and
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:04.880]  everybody has got to go and expose these crack houses everybody has got to go and
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:09.140]  expose all this stuff drugs aren't fun they're not cool none of this is and you
[2:44:09.140 --> 2:44:12.960]  did the right thing the fact that the fact that you drove off crying I've done
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:18.280]  the same thing watching the CPS do stuff because you know in your mind you
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:21.520]  know you know you're thinking about how you got to defend this person you know
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:26.840]  it's wrong but you know then there's the shell shock what matters is you end up
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:30.680]  doing the right thing in the end you know it's never too late and the fact
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:33.680]  that you even cared a lot of people would just doing my job you people are
[2:44:33.680 --> 2:44:38.000]  disgusting whatever you know blah blah blah and then leave and dehumanize those
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:41.760]  people the fact that you cared about it Rob do's got your number we're gonna end
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:45.440]  up getting in touch with you Friday as we're off tomorrow I got a great
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:50.120]  rebroadcast lined up and that's basically that but but God bless you sir
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:54.600]  and I appreciate appreciate your information okay yeah I really want to
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:45:00.560]  say that those people that that have been knocking on the door please do not
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:04.440]  fill that out they'll be able to seize your property if you don't pay that back
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:08.440]  you can end up getting $30,000 and a year down the road they're gonna want it
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:11.080]  back and again that's the rest of the story that's why they've got Google
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:14.280]  actuaries they know where all the crack houses are in databases and I'd
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:18.240]  actually read about this they're sending money to them so they can take the
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:24.160]  property later it's it's all very very cold-blooded well listen thank you so
[2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:27.240]  much and I'm glad you have the strength to tell that story John we're gonna be
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:32.720]  talking to you very soon there goes John I don't want that fall into the cracks
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:37.240]  guys yeah and that's exactly how it works then he's telling this other woman
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:42.160]  this story and as he says hey God put you in that house for a reason put you
[2:45:42.160 --> 2:45:45.960]  in this house for a reason you're gonna give me that information everybody's
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:51.520]  got to stop being so cowardly you know what I mean if something's evil you've
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:54.480]  got to oppose it it doesn't mean you've got to oppose everything all the time
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:58.240]  but when your heart tells you you got to oppose something get passed being
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:05.160]  cowardly I mean I think about what they what CPS does to kids you know the most
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:09.800]  dangerous place for children even when you average in all the bad drug addict
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:13.480]  parents and and the abusers and the alcoholics and everything do you know
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:16.360]  in the government's own numbers they don't publicize them a lot but you can
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:21.440]  pull them up on the average year you are five to seven times more likely to be
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:32.160]  sexually or physically abused in who's custody child protective services and
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:36.040]  they just zombify the kids and put them on anti-psychotics I'm talking two-year-old
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:44.000]  you cry for mommy that's mental illness and that's why any time I I have
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:48.600]  physical fear for myself instantly God just says you know what you've seen with
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  the children and I can just see it all and there's there's not and it's not
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:58.360]  that I'm even embarrassed that my flesh is weak and that I would even have an
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:03.800]  inkling of fear the inkling of fear I have fear that I'm so weak I've had fear
[2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:08.120]  that I don't execute resistance against these people properly with all the gifts
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:14.280]  I've been given because let me tell you the evil is going on 24-7 people all
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:18.200]  there's always evil it's increasing because there's an attitude now that
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:26.400]  oh that's just the way it is you can't do anything the the CPS grabbing our kids
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:31.200]  outside of real courts the TSA power grabbing and people now resisting that
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:35.480]  think about it we're able to now have people all over the country videotaping
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:38.720]  and the TSA is trying to force people through scanners and ripping the clothes
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:41.720]  off little girls that turn out to be state representatives in Texas and
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:46.080]  they're beating people up and they're threatening people got big stacks of
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:49.960]  news on it today I put info wars dot com and present by the dot com but it
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:52.760]  doesn't matter because more and more people are angry and upset and they
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:57.480]  don't care they're going to resist I've seen two different national polls 156
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:05.120]  152 are saying people are opting out of the scanners it's happening everywhere
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:11.080]  and it's the same thing little things grow big things have small beginnings
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:15.760]  and we're not meant to be slaves and there's always a struggle between good
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:20.720]  and evil and I'm not offering anybody a utopia anybody that says they've got a
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:23.840]  utopia is a fraud
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:30.520]  when I'm saying is that we need to pull away from evil and just swim as hard as
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:34.680]  we can away from it evil has a gravitational pull and you want to get
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:38.160]  away from it and it's always that eternal struggle trying to get away from
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:44.560]  it in our own lives you know changing things as an inside job and you know
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:49.240]  shame on all these churches that go out and selectively find some poor people
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:52.920]  they claim they're going to take care of or you know shame on all the yuppies
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:58.720]  that walk up to me in grocery stores and say what's wrong or say to my son like
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:03.000]  I'm not even there what's wrong with your eye my son has a birthmark on the side
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:08.280]  of his head and he says it's my birthmark you know I guarantee he's
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:12.760]  smarter than they are at 10 years old and then and then and I'll go you hey
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:17.080]  you can talk to me I'm here oh this is a thing you don't have any kids do you
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:21.920]  what are you a social worker yeah you are and then you want to come in here and
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:26.320]  like like a pervert talk to my kid I'm not a pervert how dare you know but it's
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:30.640]  but like but like a pervert superseding you don't have the courage or the will
[2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:35.040]  to have a kid you don't have the courage to raise them up you just got the
[2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:39.040]  courage to come in here and get in front of them like I oh you don't like you
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:42.440]  don't like it now that I'm in your face why don't you go worry about the
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:47.400]  crack houses down the street why don't you go worry about the CPS of using kids
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:52.720]  oh but it's about the religion that you see the liberals have their counterfeit
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:55.560]  of being good people and being involved in the community they have their
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:49:58.520]  counterfeit where they run around all day how they're good and we're all
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:02.800]  terrorists and the TSA has to check us all on our pies and cakes can't fly
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:06.720]  with those and we're gonna have to pull your shirt up in public I mean I've sat
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:12.240]  there while a male TSA worker gets down there to grope me because I've got to fly
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:15.640]  out somewhere and they're saying either this you don't fly so okay I'll do a
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:22.680]  test and the guy gets down on his knees and is licking his lips I mean he's you
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:29.640]  know and it's so alien to me the idea of getting off on putting people in bad
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:33.720]  situations and making them do something but see there's a lot of people like to
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:37.280]  make people do things ladies and gentlemen that's what this is all about
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:42.120]  and they look that's for them is the thrill seeing that beautiful woman in
[2:50:42.120 --> 2:50:45.720]  the line that they could never get with the electric eyes and then the beauty
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:48.680]  you know what I'm talking about and I'll be there with the guys that go watch
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:51.960]  this they're gonna pull her out for groping she's doing the scanner look
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:55.640]  look the sharks are coming in and boy they get that woman and it is it is I

[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:30.840]  part of the course breaking down where he'd go in these crack houses for FEMA
[3:00:30.840 --> 3:00:34.600]  disaster funds and there'd be kids literally in a state of you know near
[3:00:34.600 --> 3:00:39.680]  death from what I heard and FEMA CPS none of them would do anything because they
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:43.600]  don't want poor kids they want to make sure they die as quickly as possible
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:47.840]  that's all covered up and then I was just getting into how the yuppies just
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:52.520]  flip out when you've got three kids well they're really not gonna like me coming
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:58.680]  down the road here soon and they they get in your face about all this stuff and
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:01.760]  I'm that's why I carry my iPhone at all times now I'm gonna start just
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:05.640]  videotaping them you think I'm joking about this I've told my wife next time
[3:01:05.640 --> 3:01:09.320]  one of these women walks over and goes do you really think it's you really have
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:13.240]  three kids you think that's a good idea I think that's good for the earth I mean
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:19.600]  oh I mean these people are cult members is all I'm telling you so they're trying
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:24.760]  to take my kids because one of them's got a birthmark and knock on wood my
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:28.600]  children never had any serious injuries or been to the hospital and then
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:32.200]  meanwhile kids in the most dangerous things with horrible parents they leave
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:36.560]  them with them and it just makes me sick again liberals of the counterfeit of
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:40.000]  everything they claim they are that's that's my point Thomas Jefferson a
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:45.560]  liberal you an authoritarian punk let's go to your calls here just run through
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:51.320]  him quickly John's been holding too long and so has Michael and and Simon and
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:55.440]  then we'll get to the folks in Israel David and Israel John and Florida
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:00.840]  thanks for holding go ahead how you doing I'm a long-time listener and a
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:05.040]  first-time caller I just wanted to know a couple about a couple of things that I
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:10.800]  know you're always on top of first is sequestration I'm really scared about
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:17.120]  it I don't know much maybe you can let me know about that well I mean that's
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:21.400]  just where they have automatic spending cuts in the military
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:27.520]  that's it go ahead I was thinking that it was more than that I was here in
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:32.320]  reports and reading online about how when sequestration is supposed to start
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:41.400]  cutting down on on you know on welfare and all these other things so and also
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:47.920]  the the succession and how is government supposed to help people that are
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:52.600]  already you know bound by the government and the state to pull out how does
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:56.440]  how does this transition occur well here's the deal it's slowly going to
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:03.160]  collapse anyways if it continues down the road the way you help people is
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:08.680]  producing an economy and a society instead they destroy the society and then
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:13.920]  make you basically go on welfare that's the plan and so it's absolutely
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:19.440]  devilish that's how you get locked between a rock and a hard place also one
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:25.320]  more thing I needed to tell you had to do with voting for Obama my daughter she
[3:03:25.320 --> 3:03:29.440]  was six-year-old she's in first grade and they had to like these little things
[3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:34.720]  where they try to teach them you know they teach them how to vote but my
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:38.720]  daughter doesn't know anything about voting she comes home one day and she
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:44.560]  tells me daddy I voted you know I'm speechless she tells me she voted for
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:49.320]  Obama because that's what the schools told her between these two pictures
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:54.600]  whose name is whose name sounds better and you like Obama you like Obama and
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:58.480]  the white-ass teacher asked the assistant principal and they told me well
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:02.400]  we're just letting them you know choose between what's their choice and you know
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:07.960]  I it was like I was talking to a little kid incredible well you're right that's
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:11.720]  the thing it's an arrested development in the general population which robs
[3:04:11.720 --> 3:04:18.640]  people of their true destinies and is the ultimate sin and it's what we
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:23.840]  struggle against John but it's a terrible situation that they would spend
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:28.320]  twenty two billion dollars to move General Motors to China or part of its
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:36.400]  plants for vault and Cadillac and then say that the voters in the Rust Belt
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  States voted for Obama because he would give them benefits like but their kids
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:44.320]  won't ever have any jobs listen we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:48.040]  with more calls got we ought to do a show where I take calls from Israel and
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:52.600]  the Palestinian areas because that'd be good to hear both sides on that
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:56.880]  sometimes maybe we'll do that on Friday well I'm not here Friday it's Mike Adams
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:06.000]  we'll be right back a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:09.720]  why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:14.040]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:17.400]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[3:05:17.400 --> 3:05:22.020]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:55.960]  they're trying to threaten journalists now even mainline journalist that's
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:00.880]  backfiring I mean everyone is seeing through this house of guards and so
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:04.560]  they'll act more arrogant more blustering it's going to implode and I'm
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:08.760]  gonna get to a special report on that in a moment with State Representative David
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:12.280]  Simpson is reintroducing the fight right here at the nullification level the
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:17.560]  state of Texas but Michael in Florida thanks for holding you're on the year
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:23.640]  hey how you doing Alex good I'm a long-time listener I've been fucking
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:30.960]  excuse me I've been listening for about four years I'm 19 about to be 20 I've
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:37.840]  been listening since I was 16 and I was really glad to see you talk about Israel
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:43.760]  this morning because I've been an avid fan and I've seen a lot of a lot of
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:50.480]  crazy alternative documentaries on YouTube that try to accuse you of being
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:56.600]  some type of Israel Israeli agents that are just ridiculous and anyway I was
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:01.440]  glad to see that you touched on that that subject today well I mean you know
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:04.560]  I mean here's the deal you've got to accuse me of being a bunch of other
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:12.120]  agents too that's probably a cognitive dissidents cast Sunstein style
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:18.480]  operation because they really go crazy when I do criticize Israel and it has
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:21.880]  the reverse psychology of making me never want to criticize Israel because
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:25.960]  that is a popular internet meme where some nobody who never stood up for
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:29.440]  anybody never did anything never said their real name never had skin in the
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:36.880]  game can just say Alex Jones is a Vatican agent or Alex Jones is a Israel
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:40.960]  agent or Alex Jones this or that and sometimes they go find distant members
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:45.080]  of my family and then mix it in with other people who aren't my family and
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:50.080]  say you know horrible things like they'll show a picture of some Dennis
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:56.720]  named David Jones at the George Herbert Walker Bush Memorial in Houston and say
[3:10:56.720 --> 3:11:00.760]  that's his dad it's the proof you know in my dad's when something the right
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:04.360]  middle name and there's photos of my dad online and then people are like we
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:08.200]  ought to get his dad and that's when it kind of gets to you it's like man
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:14.080]  they're not just lying about me you know they're they're lying about my dad yeah
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:19.440]  and again I come from a family where even if you don't like somebody you
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:22.360]  tend to not talk about about them I'm kind of the anomaly that I've got the
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:25.840]  point where I'm just done playing games so I'm firing in all directions and
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:31.320]  people that have done us wrong but you know I certainly I mean if I'm gonna go
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:37.440]  after somebody on air then I'm gonna try to have my ducks in a row and be right
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:41.080]  about it I'm not gonna try to accuse somebody you know who's innocent of
[3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:44.680]  something but that's a way it's been successful of beating people into
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:50.240]  submission where I remember 10 years ago if you said Jews were the seed of the
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:57.520]  devil but you thought Hitler was bad that was okay you know first it was we
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:01.680]  it's not that Jews are the devil Zionists are the devil and then it's like
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:06.280]  no Jews are inherently the devil and people edit that out and say I said that
[3:12:06.280 --> 3:12:09.720]  I'm not me people know people are wise the trick just be aware of it folks this
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:12.080]  is more and more that's happened where they take like three words out and you
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:20.120]  know put it out there and and and and and you're not trustworthy enough if you
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:25.280]  don't think all Jews should be killed and you so it just radicalizes radicalizes
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:29.840]  radicalizes where it's just cartoon land where people don't even know how to
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:33.480]  write but they can say this person's this or that when they don't know Israel
[3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:36.320]  we've got a call from Israel go to her in a few minutes it's very diverse
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:41.320]  politically there's a lot of stuff going on you know if you look at what
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.160]  Israel's doing and what was done to the Native Americans here there's parallels
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:49.760]  except Israel could argue their people were there before so they have the stake
[3:12:49.760 --> 3:12:54.320]  groups ethnically push each other out and I think it's ugly it's horrible it's
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:58.160]  primitive it's wrong both sides are wrong that's why the globalists are
[3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:02.800]  financing both sides I've covered that at nauseam you know I've covered the USS
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:06.680]  Liberty I've made films on it and the white supremacist and all those people
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:10.080]  like Hal Turner who it turned out was an FBI asset and I said that on record
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:14.120]  because I could tell he was one you know came out and said Jones is covering up
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:18.480]  for the USS Liberty because the admirals I all had on who blew the whistle
[3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:25.320]  pointed out that they that they were ordered to stand down and the White
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:30.160]  House was in control of it with Israel to false flag the ship to be able to
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:34.720]  attack Egypt I mean that's a cold-blooded military move I was covering
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:38.720]  the real depth of the Liberty and I have people say listen our government
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:42.960]  wasn't involved in that it's the Jews and my thing is well let's depoliticize
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:48.760]  or de-racial this thing or or or or de-religionize and I'm making up words
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:53.560]  here you know like I'm Jesse Jackson the point is is that let you just look at
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:56.960]  how they play us off against each other and then have basic principles of
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:01.400]  Liberty and then no matter what color we are what religion whatever it is we can
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:06.680]  all agree these are basic standards that work to build a civilization level
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:11.840]  playing field free market you know exceptionalism all of these things but
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:16.760]  I'm almost out of time I got to play a couple news reports here again but let's
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:20.960]  just for the sake of argument say I'm this horrible person that shouldn't be
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:26.560]  used as a crutch for other people to not go out and fight the New World Order
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.400]  it's easy to come out with a website or a podcast and announce you're great now
[3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:35.440]  looks Jones is bad it's easy to come out and announce he's a shill he's this and
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:40.120]  that and string stuff together out of context to then announce how big you are
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:45.240]  and I am so big that that will get them some limited attention but not good
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.360]  attention it's like junk food or something and so I don't mind being
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.440]  attacked they've taken it to new heights with my family and stuff and you know
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:58.800]  everything they do we just get blessed in the end so it's up to God but outside
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:02.200]  of Alex Jones here did you have any points you wanted to cover real fast
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:06.320]  yeah definitely I've always like I said I'm young but I've done a lot of looking
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:09.840]  into a lot of different subjects I first started looking into you when I found
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:13.960]  out about the Federal Reserve and just how our whole system has been based off
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:17.200]  of lies and it just doesn't make any sense and when you when you know
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:21.840]  economically just mathematically you know our whole you know our whole system
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:26.920]  is just you know based off a debt and is literally slavery and so anyway that's
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:30.240]  how I started getting into all of this and my parents you know my mom you know
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:35.600]  totally thinks I'm just ridiculous and that I'm just looking into you know you
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:41.040]  know wackos I guess oh yeah it's bad to it's bad to look into things you don't
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:43.600]  want to look into things well look they've tried to flood the internet with
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:48.000]  wacko weirdness and infighting that's what Cass Sunstein talked about and I
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:52.320]  appreciate your call sir they've done that so that people don't know what's
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:58.920]  real okay well look if it's on info wars.com or prisonbunna.com about 95
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:03.520]  percent of it's accurate we really try to be accurate we've got our you know
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:08.840]  man serious handle on things and we give a bibliography of everything we talk
[3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:13.760]  about okay I mean that's what's important you've got to go make your own
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:18.960]  decision but we're trying to find reality we're trying to be truthful we're
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:24.000]  trying to be honorable but we're fallible you know corrupt creatures we're
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:29.080]  humans so it's gonna have problems but we're trying to be real we're trying to
[3:16:29.080 --> 3:16:33.960]  be true blue and so you know that's where it stands or falls and I've been
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:36.880]  attacked since day one man the devil must have known when I was going to do
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:40.480]  early on in my life through everything he had at me but God took me through it
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:44.980]  and and and 17 years on air I mean I think about the stuff I went through the
[3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:49.480]  first few years on air it's nothing even compared to now and so I'm just gonna
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:52.440]  continue on we're gonna skip this network break here because I've got to go
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:56.760]  to this piece and then we're gonna come back and go to Simon and then David in
[3:16:56.760 --> 3:17:02.400]  Israel maybe we shouldn't talk to David in Israel Israel so evil maybe I'm I
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:09.320]  don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm bad if I if I even even talk to somebody in
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:14.720]  Israel I mean that should be blown off the map right I mean it's wrong to say
[3:17:14.720 --> 3:17:18.440]  you sit to have some Israelis say we need to mow the yard with the Palestinians
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:22.640]  which is wrong and I said that's wrong but it's wrong to also have some of the
[3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:26.160]  Palestinian Authority people and Ahmed energy'd say we want to blow Israel off
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:29.640]  the map and by the way he has basically said that people say oh he didn't really
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:33.320]  mean that in his quote he said drive the Zionist state out in the ocean so
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:38.360]  they've also said we're gonna blow Israel off the map okay there's a lot of I
[3:17:38.360 --> 3:17:42.480]  don't think the people in Israel have a corner on Hutzpah is my point and I
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:46.800]  don't want any war I want all those cultures to thrive I want peace I don't
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:49.920]  want the crooks to be able to short-circuit society because it gives
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:54.840]  them power to have wars you understand that I want prosperity for everybody
[3:17:54.840 --> 3:17:58.240]  because when I want prosperity for you I get it and I don't do that like
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:02.120]  magically I've learned that in life I always was like that I wanted good for
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:05.400]  other people and they said people said oh that's foolish you get ahead by
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:12.240]  cheating others that's not what I found when I die I want people to know Alex
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:16.480]  Jones was reputable he did what he said he would do he was honorable he was a
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:21.360]  good guy that's why the system if you noticing their attacks on us always say
[3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:25.200]  we're fraud and we're not real because they don't want you to know there's
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:29.520]  anything real they don't want you to know there's anything modified warts and
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:34.440]  all I'm real folks I don't agree with Jesse Ventura on some things that are
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:41.120]  fundamental like abortion but I still admire him because he is so real and
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:45.600]  is not controlled and I know he's come a long way in the eight years I've known
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:52.560]  him and I think in the end he's going to fully wake up okay so not even the
[3:18:52.560 --> 3:18:57.720]  most wise know how everything is going to end up in the end you just have to go
[3:18:57.720 --> 3:19:01.200]  with your heart go with your soul use the intellect to navigate at one level
[3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:04.400]  but your gut and your heart and another and that's what I have going for me
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:09.000]  people that do have discernment successful people they don't have to read
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:12.880]  folks and they know I'm real the new order knows I'm real they know I'm ready
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:17.680]  until death to fight the globalist I mean I'm seeking for the truth I'm
[3:19:17.680 --> 3:19:22.880]  seeking for the honorable course and that's what I'm looking for that's what
[3:19:22.880 --> 3:19:27.240]  I want because I know it was five minutes ago I was six seven years old it
[3:19:27.240 --> 3:19:30.600]  seems like five minutes ago it seems like 30 seconds ago my first child was
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:37.600]  born now he's 10 years old about to be 11 I know how short this is and I know
[3:19:37.600 --> 3:19:42.480]  that all that lives on is the species all that lives on is the good guys and I
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:47.280]  have hopes and dreams for other people and the love and the passion they're
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:50.160]  going to have even if you don't believe in God and after life I believe in the
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:57.000]  afterlife of life I believe in good all right let's go to this clip where our
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:01.800]  own David Knight interviews the House member here in Texas is leading the
[3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:06.400]  charge against the TSA here it is I don't know about you folks but I want my
[3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:09.360]  freedom and dignity back now the federal government is making it a
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:13.360]  prerequisite to travel that you have to be subjected to humiliation and sexual
[3:20:13.360 --> 3:20:16.840]  assault at the airports they're taking the right to move about freely and
[3:20:16.840 --> 3:20:20.240]  they're trying to change that into a privilege that's granted only if you
[3:20:20.240 --> 3:20:24.960]  submit yourself to unnecessary humiliation but fortunately here in Texas
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:29.040]  we have some men with some backbone on this issue and the leader on that is
[3:20:29.040 --> 3:20:33.000]  representative David Simpson from Longview Texas can you tell us a little
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:38.280]  bit about the bill that you've just put in it's a House bill 80 I believe that's
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:45.320]  correct basically is we're calling it the Texas Freedom Travel Act it just it
[3:20:45.320 --> 3:20:51.840]  makes it an offense to touch someone's private part as a condition of getting
[3:20:51.840 --> 3:20:57.320]  into a area accessing public transportation or a venue you have to
[3:20:57.320 --> 3:21:01.760]  have probable cause you have to have believe someone's committing a criminal
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:07.680]  act to treat him as a criminal we basically lost our innocent until proven
[3:21:07.680 --> 3:21:10.600]  guilty assumption here now we're all guilty until they prove that we're
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:16.240]  innocent is that correct that's right we're continuing to receive assault on
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:20.160]  the first ten amendments the Bill of Rights which are founding fathers were
[3:21:20.160 --> 3:21:24.760]  very concerned about and the fourth amendment is one in particular that's
[3:21:24.760 --> 3:21:30.440]  under assault mm-hmm now this brings up an interesting conflict between the
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:32.720]  federal government and we're seeing this on a number of issues there were a lot
[3:21:32.720 --> 3:21:38.560]  of states that passed initiatives that would limit the Obamacare mandate there
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:42.920]  were states that passed initiatives on medical marijuana even marijuana
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:46.240]  legalization and we've seen over and over again the federal government just
[3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:50.200]  disregards the wishes of the people and the wishes of the states they
[3:21:50.200 --> 3:21:53.760]  completely disregard the 10th amendment just like they do much of the other the
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:57.680]  rest of the Constitution now you tried this two years ago tell us what happened
[3:21:57.680 --> 3:22:03.520]  at that time well the bill received bipartisan support both chambers that passed unanimously
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:08.720]  on both second and third reading then the Department of Justice threatened to
[3:22:08.720 --> 3:22:13.200]  make Texas basically a no fly zone to shut down a flight or series of flights
[3:22:13.200 --> 3:22:17.680]  and that's just an outrageous threat we have planes coming in and out of Texas
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:22.400]  all the time people are not being searched in this way and then the bill
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:27.360]  was brought before after that threat was made and the initial support that we
[3:22:27.360 --> 3:22:33.000]  had which was nearly every senator dissipated it so that we couldn't
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:37.960]  overcome the procedural hurdle but I do believe the people of Texas are behind
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:44.440]  the bill and I've received encouraging words from some of the leadership of our
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:49.440]  state that the bill move quickly and that's encouraging to me well that's
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:52.000]  great you know it's not just the people of Texas there's people all over the
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:55.480]  country they were watching that last time and we're supporting you on that and
[3:22:55.480 --> 3:23:00.120]  and and as you said it was a total outrage that the federal government would
[3:23:00.120 --> 3:23:04.760]  try to blackmail us over that you know if you remember two years ago around
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:09.840]  Thanksgiving right after they'd rolled these machines out we organized a opt-out
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:16.560]  campaign for the busiest travel day of the year and the TSA blinked they shut
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:20.520]  the machines down so you know we're we're coming back this time two years
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:23.480]  later we've got an opt-out and film campaign and this time we're doing it
[3:23:23.480 --> 3:23:27.920]  for a week because they tried they tried to back down on that you know people are
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:31.320]  fed up with this and all over the country people are fed up with this I
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:35.800]  really do hope that the Texas legislature that all of them will get
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:39.680]  some backbone this time and call their bluff there's absolutely no way they're
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:44.680]  gonna be able to shut down all travel in and out of Texas that's right and we
[3:23:44.680 --> 3:23:50.080]  just should not submit to something that's unconstitutional we should refuse
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:56.680]  to give them that right that touches them and that way unless we committed a
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:24:01.320]  criminal act and this bill too is a little bit improved and that it won't
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:07.120]  allow PSA or anybody to separate a child from a parent there was one autistic
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:10.760]  boy that was separated from his parents when he was being touched in this
[3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:17.680]  intrusive way he began to cry out man on boy man on boy and just if a young
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:23.200]  child is taught that this is indignant and not supposed to be done can figure
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:29.000]  this out why are we allowing our federal government to do this yes and we
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:33.320]  shouldn't go along with it as a state and support it that's right that's right
[3:24:33.320 --> 3:24:36.840]  that's why I said the beginning I want my freedom and my dignity back you know
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:40.480]  this is I think this is just nothing more than just behavioral conditioning if
[3:24:40.480 --> 3:24:43.800]  you look at BF Skinner and that's exactly what he was suggesting telling
[3:24:43.800 --> 3:24:48.160]  everybody to have to freeze in the airport I mean this is going beyond all
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.720]  reason this is nothing more than just behavioral control that's right and
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:57.000]  they're not law enforcement agents we should refuse to submit to those things
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:02.160]  one of my favorite parts of our Texas Constitution is article 1 section 1 it
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:06.960]  says Texas is a free and independent state subject only to the United States
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:11.880]  Constitution and then it goes on to talk about the importance of local self
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:17.800]  government and preserving that and when it's impaired it threatens the union the
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:22.360]  perpetuity of the union and so this is critical for not only our state but for
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:27.760]  our whole nation that we do not put up with tyranny yes you probably have
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:31.880]  noticed these petitions that are going around at the White House there's 50
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:36.320]  petitions and every state saying that they would like to succeed that's right
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:42.520]  and we must refuse as a state to carry out their business for us yes one of the
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:47.040]  programs was bus safe at Houston where they were going to randomly search
[3:25:47.040 --> 3:25:52.280]  people's handbags and carry gate them on municipal buses and what was crazy
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:57.440]  about it is that Houston PD and our state law enforcement they would never do
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:05.200]  that except under the color of the TSA yes that doesn't give us any right to not
[3:26:05.200 --> 3:26:10.440]  follow the Constitution we must refuse to follow those who would not uphold the
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:14.240]  Constitution well representative Simpson I sure appreciate you talking to us
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:19.280]  thank you for taking the lead on this and we are all watching you to see what
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:23.040]  happens and we're all supporting you thank you very much thank you David and
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:28.520]  thank the people of Texas they're gonna be the ones that move it forward thank
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:33.920]  you so much all right powerful little seven-minute interview and I'm just doing
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:38.280]  the rest of the hour live here today I know we've got Simon in the UK holding
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:46.240]  the longest then we've got David in Israel Celeste in New Mexico scanner and
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:50.680]  Kenny I will at least get to those calls and hit the economic news years ago I
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:54.800]  couldn't get it all done in three hours so went to four hours I went back to three
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:26:58.200]  but we can still do four here in a lot of stations actually carry the fourth
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:03.040]  hour so let's go to Simon in the UK then we'll go to David in Israel go ahead
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:09.680]  Simon what's on your mind today hi Alex this what I hope you'll find exciting
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:14.520]  news I've been sympathetic with the fact that your electoral system is so
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:18.800]  inaccessible but because ours still has the paper ballot you were talking a lot
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:22.520]  about that earlier and I just wanted to tell you I founded a party you can have
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:28.640]  six words for a party name my party is called 9 11 was an inside job oh that's
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:32.880]  that'd be a good party actually some polls show 80% of people think it was
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:38.200]  an inside job here in the US that might be a successful party name well we found
[3:27:38.200 --> 3:27:42.120]  no trouble getting the 10 signatures we needed I walked down one short street and
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:46.240]  we're on the ballot for parliament for an election taking place on the 29th of
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:52.160]  November and I have 58,500 leaflets with 9 11 was an inside job in blaze and
[3:27:52.160 --> 3:27:58.160]  bottom going into every home in this constituency if I if I may if I could
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.440]  just give you the URL if anybody wants to see that leaflet there's a short URL
[3:28:01.440 --> 3:28:05.960]  and sir this is genius another way to get the word out sure give it to us thank
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:08.940]  you I knew you'd like it man it's inspired by your great work my friend
[3:28:08.940 --> 3:28:16.160]  NEW AIJ 9 11 was an inside job the initials NEW AIJ.org and you can look
[3:28:16.160 --> 3:28:21.480]  at our leaflet there and if anybody wants to to to join I'm taking members
[3:28:21.480 --> 3:28:25.400]  worldwide this is a worldwide movement to try and get that out again I want to
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:29.040]  write that down so we can put it up on screen what's the please I'd like to
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:32.200]  log in at Paul Joseph Watson or someone in the UK wants to get hold I can offer
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:35.920]  you exclusive coverage of the events leading up this is going to be no but
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:38.840]  that's a smart way and then everybody getting the breakdown of the parties
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:42.560]  we'll see that smart little loophole you found there what what's the name of the
[3:28:42.560 --> 3:28:50.400]  site again it's it's just the initials of 9 11 as words NEW AIJ 9 11 was an
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:29:01.040]  inside job NEW AIJ.org NEW NIJ.org it kind of spells new age but I'm
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:04.280]  don't worry we're nothing to do with whatever the point is is getting the
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:09.680]  word out very exciting well anything else you'd like to add yeah I mean one
[3:29:09.680 --> 3:29:13.160]  thing is that the media here is required to mention the names of all parties and
[3:29:13.160 --> 3:29:16.880]  and another trick here is that we can stand in local elections with no
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:21.040]  deposit there's some expense involved for a general for parliamentary election
[3:29:21.040 --> 3:29:24.560]  but people can stand anybody who wants to stand is prepared to put the time in
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:28.240]  going around knocking on doors we can get it on a ballot and then you get to go
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:32.560]  around all the meetings and debates and get in the news again even if the
[3:29:32.560 --> 3:29:36.720]  elections are fraudulent here to a great extent it's great to run because you
[3:29:36.720 --> 3:29:40.920]  then get to illustrate things to people and it's another bully pulpit to use
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:47.640]  we'll be back with a call from Israel and New Mexico Florida West Virginia you
[3:29:47.640 --> 3:29:56.400]  name it and a key report on the economy the empires on the run Alex Jones and

[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:32.720]  scientifically crafted grasping premeditatedly evil government that's
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:36.960]  run by a bunch of mad scientist that think they're elites and see us as
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:41.720]  animals and and let me tell you something I'm not an animal and I've been
[3:34:41.720 --> 3:34:44.440]  around I've seen a lot of things and I've researched your writings and I've
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:49.560]  watched you and you people are not elitist what you are is a stinking case
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:53.880]  of cancer and I guess in your argument hey if you can take something over that
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:35:01.360]  means your boss of it not in my book not in my book I mean that's like these
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:04.560]  crazy people they ask him why'd you throw your baby off the cliff I just had a
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:08.080]  compulsion I just knew I could that yeah I forget what they call that in
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:14.560]  psychology but man I tell you I'm not drinking the kool-aid here it's that
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:20.640]  simple and and we're in trouble we're in trouble we better turn this around and
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:25.840]  that means all of us ourselves get our lives together get our houses in order
[3:35:25.840 --> 3:35:31.160]  and so much of this is driven just by habit we've been brought up in this
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:35.440]  corruption we're just so used to it question everything all right let's go
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:41.200]  to your calls let's talk to David in Israel David what you calling about
[3:35:41.200 --> 3:35:46.520]  today I'm calling about that you know that there was a ceasefire that was
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:50.360]  supposed to happen it was announced it was on the news at 9 p.m. Israel time
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:57.120]  which is 7 p.m. I mean at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and it just Israel stopped
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:02.800]  and the Arabs and Palestinians are still shooting rockets thing they never
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:07.760]  stopped I started seeing things on my Facebook page from it and then also on
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:13.160]  a root Sheva you know which is Israel national news national news.com also
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:18.760]  mentioned it like it's in some of the news things here so you know all the
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:23.080]  even like Fox and all the news says ceasefire announced and they kind of
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:28.960]  that's it I mean obviously the image of Israel with f-16s bombing government
[3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:35.120]  buildings and Gaza is one we don't like to see and I understand that but why
[3:36:35.120 --> 3:36:39.680]  does Hamas quote celebrate Tel Aviv bus bombing and I went and looked it up they
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:44.880]  actually said that dozens wounded in blasts Hamas blesses attack says God
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:49.320]  willing we will soon see black body bags drudge report comm is the best
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:58.200]  listing of all this Egypt is calling this a truth so my only issue is why did
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:04.400]  they start firing rockets early October and why does everybody cuz again I'm
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:07.960]  about logic I'm about being fair here and I see a lot of stuff done in Israel
[3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:11.600]  I don't like I see a lot of stuff a lot of other places I don't like my only
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:18.800]  issue is I don't understand why Hamas is doing this if they don't want to be
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:25.360]  bombed can you explain that to me sure because the they want to just destroy
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:30.600]  Israel it's kind of like a the kamikaze pilots like you know America couldn't
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.640]  handle in the beginning because they couldn't understand it so you know they
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:40.520]  just want it and it's written you know in their Bible in the Quran they just
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:45.120]  want to destroy all non-believers and they know they're going to get attacked
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:49.720]  they want to which is hard for them to send they want to get a higher death
[3:37:49.720 --> 3:37:55.320]  toll because they know it gets on the news like a rocket recently hit a school
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:00.120]  in southern Israel but that school was empty because they sent everyone home
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:05.280]  for the day over there they want to have the kids in school so they can go on the
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:08.440]  news and say look look at the part that's true they actually parked the
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:13.920]  schools right next to the missiles correct but even now like the example is
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  there's a ceasefire Israel stops and they're continuing to shoot rockets so
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:24.120]  what's gonna happen Israel then we'll go back in again and take some type of
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:28.880]  military action and then people are gonna say oh gee what happened it's a
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:32.360]  crazy circle but like they literally never stopped it's supposed to be 9 p.m.
[3:38:32.360 --> 3:38:36.600]  and I'm seeing things I know that's my point that you know my point is I'm
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:39.520]  tempted to go there and see this for myself but then I need to go see it
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:43.440]  from the other perspective but I don't say I'm neutral on this because that's a
[3:38:43.440 --> 3:38:49.640]  good position to take I mean I live here in the United States I'm on record not
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:52.640]  liking Israel you know involved in our politics but I get the fact that they
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:55.840]  want that for their interest that's what governments do for the Constitution says
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:38:59.880]  that shouldn't be happening but then I also get that the other Arab countries
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:03.480]  won't let the Palestinians into their countries and then I also see the fact
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:07.560]  that you know there is all this talk it's like well I'm over here trying to
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:10.480]  not have an Iran war because the government will use that to take my
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:14.280]  liberties and it'll it'll kill a lot of innocent Iranians who don't like their
[3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:18.480]  government but at the same time Ahmed and Ajit is saying blow up Israel wipe
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:25.120]  them off the face so it's so crazy when it just goes on and on and I'll say this
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:27.400]  let me ask you this is somebody living in Israel yes you're an Israeli
[3:39:27.400 --> 3:39:30.560]  obviously let me ask you this question we'll open the phones up the show is
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:35.440]  almost over on Friday and then Sunday I'm gonna be live on Sunday and then
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:39.840]  Monday so I want to get both sides from from you know Palestine areas of you
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:44.880]  know Gaza wherever folks are out there to you know to call them but also from
[3:39:44.880 --> 3:39:51.120]  Israel because why did the West put al-Qaeda in Libya put them in Syria now
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:55.400]  put the Muslim Brotherhood in kick out their old guy I mean I see what's
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:39:59.320]  happening they're getting ready to get just a big war going because then they
[3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:03.240]  can have more weapons sales on both sides and politicians can point fingers
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:07.960]  at each other I mean I see that that's why this is going on and I quite
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:12.360]  frankly see you know Hamas gets stronger the more they're attacked Netanyahu
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:17.080]  will get reelected because he's standing up to it boy war just seems to help
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:22.600]  government doesn't it well it's not really about the government so much in
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:29.440]  the Islamic way is to destroy anyone in the West so I think the rest of the
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:33.320]  government's putting like pulling out Mubarak and putting in the Muslim
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:40.600]  Brotherhood it makes no sense but I see it as a situation where they want to
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:44.640]  maybe appease them because they're afraid of being attacked themselves so
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:48.240]  it's like hey we'll give them Czechoslovakia we'll you know give this
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:52.680]  over just leave us alone yeah we'll give you a poll and everything's fine well
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:56.040]  sure I mean they have the saying that when freedom fails the best men rot in
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:59.840]  filthy jails and those that cry to peas appease are hung by those they tried to
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:04.800]  please and what you were saying before but the Native Americans is good keep
[3:41:04.800 --> 3:41:10.440]  just to give you a background perspective basic perspective Jerusalem has
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:14.120]  been the capital of Israel for 3000 years there's been continuous Jewish
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:18.000]  presence here for 3000 years it's probably one of the oldest cities in the
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:23.600]  world older than London older than Paris and if you go to the Western Wall we
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:28.240]  call here the Kotel you can see from the outer walls of the second temple that's
[3:41:28.240 --> 3:41:35.840]  thousands of years old Islam didn't even exist till you know 1300 years ago so
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:40.640]  it's been a continuous Jewish presence here and there's about 6 million Jewish
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:46.120]  people in the Middle East there's 600 million Arabs and Muslims it's a hundred
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:51.920]  to one ratio and the land is a thousand to one if you look at the Muslim
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:57.400]  I know those numbers my only issue is this I have had groups connected to the
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:42:01.320]  Israel lobby attack me because I you know I'm you know against the whole
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:04.480]  globalist move because all these governments are lined up for it but then
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:10.360]  I separately viciously and sustained before I ever even got into these issues
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:15.920]  have been attacked by groups that all they do is obsess on Israel if someone
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:19.960]  falls on a banana peel it's Israel's fault everyone that works for me
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:23.920]  supposedly works for Israel I get orders from Israel all of it totally made up
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:28.960]  they'll even edit that together it's like I've never seen so much deception as
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:33.640]  my point is that is that I'm not somebody that's a joiner or in this camp or
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:40.880]  that camp and it just must be really weird if you're Jewish or especially
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:45.760]  Israeli to have the whole world 24-7 obsessed with you when like you said
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:51.800]  you're 1% over there in that area I mean it is just it is biblical it is and of
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:54.080]  course there's gonna be wickedness in high places you're gonna have wickedness
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:59.840]  in Israel as well I just it is it is bizarre I mean it really is the big
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:03.080]  enchilada real quick closing comment to that and I'm gonna take a few more calls
[3:43:03.080 --> 3:43:09.240]  sure you know you know I think any any criticism you have of Israel is is a
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:14.120]  legitimate or fair even if I disagree with it you know you're coming from a
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:20.120]  normalized place not in a demonizing way so I will say that you know even if
[3:43:20.120 --> 3:43:26.480]  things I disagree with it's it's well my whole point is everybody's got problems
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:31.360]  and corruptions it I mean it's systemic I'm just saying I know in the Arab
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:36.640]  world demonization of Israel becomes just an easy one off for everything
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:41.080]  because because I personally have experienced it because I don't even
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:45.040]  hardly get into you know Israel and all this I try to stay out of it and people
[3:43:45.040 --> 3:43:50.440]  demand to put you in a camp is what I'm saying correct yes absolutely you don't
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:55.200]  necessarily you know need to be in one necessarily and people you know it's like
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:43:58.480]  I said it's not about picking like a sports team one of the other but you know
[3:43:58.480 --> 3:44:01.600]  one one closing point like I said just you know keep in mind that anything
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:06.320]  going forward that Israel stop with the ceasefire and the Arabs did not so if
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:10.520]  anything happens tomorrow or the next day you know with the news is not going
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:15.240]  to necessarily report that the ceasefire you know the Arabs was continuing to
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:18.720]  shoot rockets when Israel stopped and again you can go to Israel national news
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:22.680]  calm you can see it you can you know there there are things out there but
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:26.760]  it's not widely publicized so if Israel does something we do something in the
[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:30.920]  next day or two or tonight or something else you'll know the reason for this
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:36.000]  specific issue you know there was ceasefire they did not hold we will do
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:40.480]  something it's not a gee what happened it's it'll be clear so just you know
[3:44:40.480 --> 3:44:44.360]  keep that in mind for you know what comes up and then sure well here's the
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:47.640]  headline of the LA Times ceasefire between Israel and Amos prevents
[3:44:47.640 --> 3:44:53.480]  ground war but Egypt says Gaza ceasefire agreement reached and I'm not denying
[3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:57.040]  what you're saying but I'm not even seeing more rockets fired if what you're
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:45:03.080]  saying is true then it shows that that the media is involved in a cover-up of
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:06.440]  this because we just type in rockets
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:12.560]  click on Israel national news comm right which is a root cheva and then here it is
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:18.920]  ABC news yeah no no I found it I found it it's rockets fall fall silent and
[3:45:18.920 --> 3:45:22.880]  Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Amos wait wait the headline said that it had
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:28.680]  rocket fire halts and yeah that says that it lists 116 rocket strikes Gaza
[3:45:28.680 --> 3:45:34.440]  rockets for my Iran's technology Iran so now I believe you I'll go check it but
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:39.320]  we'll we'll follow that I appreciate your call from Israel look my whole issue is
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:45.640]  ladies and gentlemen this is my biggest criticism of Israel the Israel lobby
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:50.560]  consistently is anti-second amendment in this country while my taxpayer money
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:55.680]  pays for settlers m16s and I mean my goodness I'm gonna pay for your m16s
[3:45:55.680 --> 3:46:02.880]  but I can't have one you know that that's my issue and we wouldn't be able
[3:46:02.880 --> 3:46:06.640]  to the Middle East if it wasn't for all the oil our government's putting al-Qaeda
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:09.920]  in it makes perfect sense because they're gonna have larger wars with all
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:13.320]  these countries and the globalists do want to depopulate the Arabs I'd rather
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:18.560]  empower the Arabs industrialize them but but the West since 53 has been
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:24.240]  overthrowing these countries anyways it's a complex issue it it's just yes
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:32.080]  Hamas since October 1st has been firing rockets every day into Israel to get the
[3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:36.600]  response to get the crisis going to try to force other Arab nations into a
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:42.120]  conflict with Israel and Israel has got hundreds of nuclear weapons in a high
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:45.840]  tech military and you know the US is gonna get pulled in I'm just trying to
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:46:50.160]  stop a wider war but the globalists are going to use it take all our liberties
[3:46:50.160 --> 3:46:56.800]  and you know it is not good that they're firing rockets into Israel and that's
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:47:00.600]  and they're getting more and more high tech and the politicians approval
[3:47:00.600 --> 3:47:04.080]  ratings drop when they don't fight back against that so they're gonna fight back
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:07.960]  against it and you know government stage stuff too they don't even have to with
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:12.880]  the status it's very complex people want to make it simple so last in New
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:17.920]  Mexico you're on the air thanks for holding hi Alex I just wanted to call
[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:22.560]  and wish you a wonderful blessed Thanksgiving and your family and all

[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  us and to join us and to pray for the peace of Jerusalem and that's what the
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:49.800]  word tells us and there is hope we know we went in the end so I just want to
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.800]  encourage you Alex we've been listening to you since you went on the air 17
[3:47:53.800 --> 3:47:58.600]  years ago you're like part of our family and we were just so blessed by you and
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:03.040]  thankful and just keep up the good work you you know I tried to sit down this
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:06.360]  morning and write up something I have some notes over here about what I'm
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:11.080]  thankful for and it's such a big issue that I started almost crying you know
[3:48:11.080 --> 3:48:15.640]  got a tear in my eye I don't even know how to say to God how thankful I am I
[3:48:15.640 --> 3:48:21.120]  mean it's so good goodness is so good and and then it makes evil that much
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:25.160]  more abhorrent and that's why we have to stand up against it every day every way
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:29.920]  and I'm just thankful for our great audience who takes action I'm thankful
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:32.600]  to all our friends in the media and the alternative media that are helping us
[3:48:32.600 --> 3:48:37.200]  fight tyranny it is such a blessing and a great honor that we can now call for a
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:40.360]  national opt-out film the TSA and it's one of the biggest stories in the
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:46.720]  country we can now you expose RFID with kids getting kicked out of school it's
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:52.120]  now a national news story we can now expose so many things because we're now
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:56.200]  on over a hundred and forty AM and FM stations our news websites are giant
[3:48:56.200 --> 3:49:00.040]  drudgereport.com carries a lot of it that's what pushes it over the edge along
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:05.520]  with all other things I'm just thankful for everybody and I want and I just want
[3:49:05.520 --> 3:49:10.160]  us to rediscover our common sense and rediscover a natural distrust of big
[3:49:10.160 --> 3:49:14.720]  government and a natural you know I mean nobody wants to give you something for
[3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:18.800]  free from a big system folks people want to help somebody that's down but the
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:22.320]  system doesn't want to help you they want to help destroy you anything else
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:27.040]  ma'am I just want to say it was a blessing to hear your son you know
[3:49:27.040 --> 3:49:31.240]  that's our hope of the young man from Florida you know we've got a lot of
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:35.440]  things to be thankful for we've got young people good young people and we
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:40.360]  need to stand up and Jesus said the truth will set us free and that's what
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:44.640]  we're about and thank God for you and just keep up the fight thank you so
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:48.120]  much God bless you yeah I see sitcoms and dramas that have paid government
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:52.200]  messages you understand that's admitted that's not a free system they've got
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:56.160]  that overlaying the real media they want to get rid of us so they're unopposed
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:01.240]  and they're foolish to think that'll work because the messages been sent the
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:05.080]  more they clamp down the more it's self-evident but they have pro-government
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:10.680]  healthcare messages anti-gun messages anti-family messages and they've got
[3:50:10.680 --> 3:50:15.280]  messages that are anti-children that children are horrible and gross and a
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:22.840]  burden and they've got messages that are destructive and that's government paid
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:27.400]  for and and we're told young people are crud and they do act like crud more than
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:31.240]  ever I've seen the numbers but those that are awake are better than ever it's
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:36.520]  just kind of a splitting apart of the ways there the wheat from the chaff but
[3:50:36.520 --> 3:50:41.560]  expanding on that you should have an instinct to want to empower youth and
