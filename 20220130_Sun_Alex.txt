[00:00.000 --> 00:28.480]  Alright, my friends. The more epic the time, the more I need to just slow down and find
[00:28.480 --> 00:36.080]  that quiet still place the most high the King David wrote about in the Psalms.
[00:36.080 --> 00:43.660]  We can officially say that the New World Order is in full retreat and is in total collapse
[00:43.660 --> 00:47.360]  and crisis. That's why they're trying to collapse the world economy so they can pose
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.640]  as the saviors and distract us from the crimes they've committed. If they're unable to fully
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.840]  crash it while posing as saviors, they have to crash it, smother it, and pose as saviors
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.960]  at the same time, if they're unable to pull that off, it's over for them. It doesn't mean
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.360]  there won't be new corrupt groups and new attacks and new permutations, but this major
[01:11.360 --> 01:20.360]  satanic Luciferian wave, this eugenics-based transhumanist system, can and will be defeated
[01:20.360 --> 01:31.720]  if we are vigilant. It's just wild to see Elon Musk, whether you trust him or not, coming
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.600]  out against the New World Order, coming out against the four shots, coming out in favor
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.440]  of the worldwide trucker protest emanating at its heart from the capital of Canada, Ottawa,
[01:42.440 --> 01:49.080]  the Occupy, Ottawa operation, peacefully now unfolding, and to see him coming out and saying
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.040]  they're trying to depopulate us, we don't want robots to take over, we need to have
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.040]  more children. And then, of course, I know the inside baseball that he's telling people
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.200]  that he knows here in Austin that he is awake and doesn't like the New World Order. I didn't
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.280]  know if I trusted that a couple of years ago because of some of the things he's been pushing
[02:06.280 --> 02:12.400]  that I don't see as too freedom-oriented like the NeuroLink, and then I see him and Joe
[02:12.400 --> 02:20.640]  Rogan Instagramming out there at his little command base outside Austin with Jordan Peterson.
[02:20.640 --> 02:27.120]  It's just amazing to know that the awakening to the whole globalist program is so mainstream
[02:27.120 --> 02:32.760]  now that it's the hottest thing in pop culture. You know, I'm not really going to get into
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.360]  all this, and it doesn't actually inflate my ego. It just is an example of what you
[02:36.360 --> 02:47.920]  should know and what's going on. But let's just say this, the biggest, hottest movie
[02:47.920 --> 02:55.960]  stars right now are in a big collaborative coming up with an Alex Jones movie. And who
[02:55.960 --> 03:00.880]  knows if that'll get made, but that's what's going on, people that are household names.
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.680]  And then we also criticized quite a bit for going to the Davos group. And I'll only tell
[03:05.680 --> 03:12.880]  you that story so you get an idea of how hot freedom is. But see, for us, the trailblazers
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.920]  way out of the tip of the spear, and that means this audience of activists as well,
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.760]  we have taken the heat, we have taken the pain, we have taken the censorship and the
[03:20.760 --> 03:30.280]  lawsuits and the dirty tricks, but we've persevered thanks to God working through you. So I don't
[03:30.280 --> 03:36.080]  feel bitter to see people now across the political spectrum, including Bill Maher, coming out
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.240]  against the New World Order, coming out against censorship, coming out against the left, because
[03:41.240 --> 03:46.000]  that's what winning looks like. It's very, very frustrating, I know, for a lot of people
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.640]  that are gunsmiths and former special operations operatives from some of the most elite units
[03:50.640 --> 03:57.320]  there are in the army and other groups, and they see the super pop nature of guns and
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.040]  they see how it's a bunch of larping and a bunch of former leftists getting into it
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.800]  now, and they don't have dedication or they haven't paid their dues. And I explain to
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.080]  these guys, hey, this is what winning looks like. You want to get the general dumb down
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.840]  mass of domesticated people on board with us? Once they come on board with us, they're
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.360]  going to have a lot of problems still, we're going to have to walk them through this. Taking
[04:21.360 --> 04:27.040]  the world back is not an elitist operation. And I understand I'm not calling the military
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.280]  people want to be elites. To them, it's just frustrating because they've paid so much and
[04:31.280 --> 04:35.960]  been through so much and they see a bunch of people coming on board now that the hard
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.760]  work's been done. But that's the way it always is. You should celebrate that, not be mad
[04:40.760 --> 04:47.240]  about it. I celebrate Tucker Carlson waking up and Joe Rogan and now Elon Musk and everybody
[04:47.240 --> 04:55.600]  else. And of course, now, the next phase, and things are really going to get crazy.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.540]  I wish.
[05:00.540 --> 05:08.440]  Reset war is a good idea. Reset war is a great tool. It allows recap.
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.880]  Really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[05:13.880 --> 05:19.480]  go across political lines or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.080]  together. I'm a combat veteran, and, I mean, that brought me close to God, but Alex goes
[05:25.080 --> 05:30.520]  through brought me even closer. I can feel God in my life now. The viruses that Alex talks to
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.960]  you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain and how to erase those programs and
[05:35.960 --> 05:42.040]  install new. Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts.
[05:42.040 --> 05:47.160]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious
[05:47.160 --> 05:51.800]  and self-determined life. If you're on the fence about reset wars, it's time to get off the fence.
[05:51.800 --> 05:57.400]  Join reset wars today.
[06:02.760 --> 06:10.600]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:12.440 --> 06:18.840]  And we are live. Thanks to God's good graces and your patronage listeners and viewers
[06:18.840 --> 06:28.840]  on this Sunday, January 30th, 2022 broadcast. Let's put on the screen for TV viewers so I can
[06:28.840 --> 06:36.600]  read it to radio listeners. Today's live show headline because it really says it all. And if
[06:36.600 --> 06:40.120]  we're going to beat the globalist, we need to understand what we're up against and what we're
[06:40.120 --> 06:50.680]  fighting. The entire Hollywood globalist new world order project is falling apart. It's an
[06:50.680 --> 07:01.960]  absolute wreck. And to force it on us, they are going to have to pull out all the stops
[07:02.840 --> 07:07.400]  and accelerate to where they want it to be in 10 years now and take the gloves off with us.
[07:07.400 --> 07:12.520]  And that's only going to backfire that much faster. But they will continue to double down and double
[07:12.520 --> 07:17.240]  down and double down until we have a giant war and total depression and billions dead. And that's
[07:17.240 --> 07:24.040]  what most analysts believe is a very good possibility. Put that headline back up. Thank you.
[07:24.040 --> 07:31.480]  I want to read to folks. Sunday live, the globalist Hollywood pedophile axis of evil is collapsing
[07:31.480 --> 07:40.120]  and they want to take us with them. The new world order social engineers are desperately trying
[07:40.120 --> 07:46.840]  to start wars, crash economies and create civil unrest in a desperate attempt to smoke screen
[07:46.840 --> 07:54.200]  their crimes. Tune in and spread this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show as we chronicle
[07:54.200 --> 08:02.520]  the epic awakening of humanity and the coming globalist instigated crises that humanity must
[08:02.520 --> 08:09.400]  and will overcome together. And that's where we are. So let me make the big announcement here.
[08:09.400 --> 08:14.200]  And I've been making this announcement a lot, but I want to make it very, very, very clear to
[08:14.200 --> 08:21.320]  everyone, including Klaus Schwab, including Prince Charles, including Queen Elizabeth of Gotha,
[08:21.320 --> 08:27.720]  including the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and all of the out of control psychotic satanic
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.680]  so-called elites. You have failed. You are failing and you will continue to fail.
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.640]  And your outrageous attempt to take over the biological processes of humans and turn us into
[08:43.640 --> 08:52.920]  factory produced corporate owned creatures will fail. And your thinly veiled excuse of
[08:52.920 --> 08:58.520]  bettering the race to create the Uber mention we know is yet another level of deception.
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.760]  And that's why you see an exodus from the new world order and I can list all the names here,
[09:08.760 --> 09:16.760]  but now Bill Maher, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, everybody else you could name now,
[09:17.480 --> 09:22.760]  understands that you have corporate junkies that are given their talking points like the
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.440]  young Turks and others who are hated and have almost no viewers and are a joke and are their
[09:28.440 --> 09:35.640]  gaslighting people. But it doesn't matter where you are in the world. Everybody is breaking with them.
[09:35.640 --> 09:41.400]  CNN has 100,000 viewers on average. This Sunday show will have over three million people that
[09:41.400 --> 09:48.680]  watch and listen to it conservatively. They have 100,000. Their top shows 800,000. Joe Rogan's
[09:48.680 --> 09:54.920]  biggest podcast have 100 million views, his smallest 11 million. They're a joke. They're over.
[09:54.920 --> 09:58.360]  And they could take Alex Jones off the air and they could take Joe Rogan off the air.
[09:58.360 --> 10:03.400]  People are so hungry for the truth, whoever stands up and tells it will immediately become huge and
[10:03.400 --> 10:09.160]  giant and they'll never be able to whack that mole and keep people down when they're looking for the
[10:09.160 --> 10:14.760]  truth. And not even somebody to tell them what to think like the globalists do, but telling people
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.320]  what they already know and they already see and validating things they've experienced
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.880]  and having that sense of community based on truth and discovery and exploration together.
[10:25.880 --> 10:33.640]  So we're not out of the woods. And as they say in pulp fiction, the wolf says,
[10:33.640 --> 10:41.400]  let's not start celebrating yet here. But we're definitely not on our heels anymore.
[10:41.960 --> 10:48.280]  And we're leaning forward into this. And there is an exponential awakening curve.
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.720]  I mean, I'm not going to get into off the record things and conversations with people, but
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.280]  Hollywood is completely collapsing. And there is giant rebellions within it
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.800]  of people wanting to completely break with it. And that's happening. And that's a bell
[11:05.800 --> 11:12.920]  weather of the globalist cult and their mindset and their fangs of the cobra that they're trying
[11:12.920 --> 11:20.440]  to inject into us and poison. And the fact that the very venom packets, the very venom pouches
[11:20.440 --> 11:27.320]  of this satanic order is being defanged and rotting out of its head right now is a very,
[11:27.320 --> 11:35.000]  very beautiful thing. So there is an exodus away from globalism. There is an exodus away from
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.640]  Satanism. There is an exodus away from pure unadulterated hedonism. There is a real desire
[11:41.640 --> 11:47.880]  to rediscover God and family and decency and honor and hard work. And the lockdowns and the
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.560]  attempted laziness and the attempted global social credit score, all of this is an attempt to
[11:53.560 --> 11:59.080]  break our back, break our will. And many people are succumbing to it. And the floods of fentanyl
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.320]  killing millions and millions of people. All of this is chemical attacks and the biological
[12:03.320 --> 12:10.440]  attack of COVID-19 and the more intense attack of the deadly gene therapy injections. This is all
[12:10.440 --> 12:16.680]  very serious attacks by the so-called ruling class because they're failing. And this doesn't
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.960]  mean that they're not going to launch even bigger attacks. But you notice every time they double
[12:21.960 --> 12:28.200]  down, every time they try to bully us, every time they try to censor us, every time if we don't back
[12:28.200 --> 12:34.840]  down and we don't give up and we fight back and improvise and overcome, we get stronger, they get
[12:34.840 --> 12:41.960]  weaker. And every day we're out here in this jungle of reality fighting for truth and justice
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.320]  and being made to rely on the Holy Spirit in God's direction. We get closer to God while they get
[12:47.320 --> 12:52.840]  further away and they're more lost than ever. And we don't celebrate that, but at the same time
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.200]  understand our enemies are a joke. You know, I saw this clip a couple weeks ago and I meant to play
[13:00.200 --> 13:06.040]  it. And then I was surfing around today in my email and somebody sent it to me and I want to play
[13:06.040 --> 13:14.040]  Eleanor Holmes, ancient member of the Democratic Party, who Pelosi seriously considering as the
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.760]  person to be the chairwoman of the Transportation Committee. We have, they have the Department
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.760]  of Energy saying they quote, want to bankrupt oil and gas and coal and that they've doubled
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.840]  gas prices to make you learn to get off of it. But here's this lady pulling up at the Capitol,
[13:30.840 --> 13:38.760]  running into two cars, her assistance there could back it out and park it correctly, but they
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.200]  don't even care. So she does double hit and run, we'll play the video, go and start rolling it.
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.880]  They do a double hit and run and then they just leave. They just walk off because they're royalty,
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.320]  they don't care. This is the zoo in control of the nuclear weapons.
[13:55.320 --> 14:02.840]  This is who thinks they're a God. This is who wants to censor you and put you in a FEMA camp.
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.320]  This is who wants to arrest the quote unannoculated and put us in forced labor camps. The majority
[14:07.320 --> 14:14.760]  of Democrats support that international rescue simple. These people, Pelosi and Biden and this
[14:14.760 --> 14:21.480]  woman are emblematic of the collapsing system that they control. They're collapsing, not us. If we
[14:21.480 --> 14:27.320]  don't decide to just crawl and aggrave with them politically and let them con us that we're collapsing
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.400]  and that we're over, if we realize we're separate from them, we're Americans of every race, color,
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.200]  and creed that love justice and freedom. If we understand that and transcend them, then it's
[14:36.200 --> 14:40.840]  their destruction, not ours. And all we got to do is not engage them and not fight with them and
[14:40.840 --> 14:47.000]  they're going to burn themselves out. Here's the video. Ellen, our home's Norton is struggling to
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.360]  park her car right now. And she has hit that red car next to her repeatedly. And we're taking
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.880]  pictures. And we don't think they're going to do anything about it. And if she parks like that,
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.960]  she should not be a member of Congress anymore. Is she going to park like that? It looks like it.
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.200]  It's a giant parking spot. You could park a huge, largest Ford pickup or Dodge pickup there is in
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.840]  there. You could park a freaking dump truck in the parking spot. And she's ramming her Prius or
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.720]  whatever it is into these cars. And then they just get up and just wander off. Who gives a damn?
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.720]  And again, this is how they wreck your cities. It's how they wreck your life. It's how they
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.680]  defund the police while they've got bodyguards. And this is our enemy. This is the parasites that
[15:34.680 --> 15:40.040]  have taken the country over. And they have nothing to do now, except get a civil war going so they
[15:40.040 --> 15:45.080]  hope they can have the military have a civil war with us. No, we are not going to play their game.
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.360]  They are politically dead. They want to take us with them and we're not going to let them do it.
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.360]  When we come back, I've got Bill Maher. Wait till you hear this.
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.560]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.240]  at home and the world at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all
[16:11.240 --> 16:17.560]  use more of, our new sleep support formula, down and out, it's just the thing. It's our new
[16:17.560 --> 16:23.240]  faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.680]  herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution. So the
[16:34.680 --> 16:40.040]  ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it. One of the other sleep
[16:40.040 --> 16:46.120]  support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like
[16:46.120 --> 16:51.320]  the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when
[16:51.320 --> 16:59.560]  you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out. Selling out now at infowarstore.com.

[18:04.200 --> 18:09.080]  Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything
[18:09.080 --> 18:14.120]  you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking
[18:14.120 --> 18:20.120]  people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand
[18:20.120 --> 18:25.320]  their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.040]  for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.520]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very

[19:53.640 --> 19:55.320]  Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[19:55.320 --> 20:11.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.240 --> 20:28.840]  Yes, humanity has an instinct for freedom in a first for justice and honor and life and beauty
[20:28.840 --> 20:37.640]  and building. And yes, humanity is rapidly absorbing the truth of our peril. But will it be fast enough?
[20:37.640 --> 20:45.800]  Will it be intense enough? To hold off the plant extermination of at least 80% of our people
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.280]  within eight years. I don't just make idle statements. As you know, my friends,
[20:53.240 --> 21:00.680]  certain death awaits 80% of the world's population. If we don't reverse the enemy's operations now,
[21:00.680 --> 21:07.000]  the Bible tells us it will be reversed, but the man of sin will have his year of power
[21:07.720 --> 21:14.360]  and one fourth of earth will be killed. That process has already begun.
[21:16.040 --> 21:24.440]  Get right with God now. Choose wisely, because this is a stepping stone into eternity.
[21:24.440 --> 21:36.680]  So the social engineers are pulling out all the stops to divide us on race and sex and region
[21:36.680 --> 21:43.160]  and weaponizing it. And they are pulling down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
[21:43.160 --> 21:48.760]  everywhere. And the articles are just flooding in. Clemson University admissions counselor
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.880]  claims Republican applicants are part of an oppressive group. And if you're a Republican,
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.080]  you'll not be allowed in the college. Congress has put up with all the censorship and the debanking
[21:59.080 --> 22:05.800]  and things never done in the history of this country. Things done by Hitler in the first five,
[22:05.800 --> 22:11.000]  six years of his reign of terror before he started arresting everybody. This has been done all over
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.640]  the world over and over again. It follows in the steps. And now the lefts everywhere calling for
[22:15.640 --> 22:20.920]  my arrest and Trump's arrest and his whole family's arrest and Bongino's arrest and Tucker Carlson's
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.720]  arrest and they come to our houses and threaten us and they send out grand jury subpoenas to us,
[22:26.520 --> 22:34.280]  not just on January 6. While the left talks about the right wing and how we're about to enslave
[22:34.280 --> 22:40.200]  them all, when they're not even the left wing, they are the corporate mouthpieces pretending
[22:40.200 --> 22:46.120]  that they are the resistance when they are the establishment by every yardstick, by every measurement.
[22:46.120 --> 22:55.640]  So why is Bill Maher coming out and saying the woke people in this country are the most dangerous
[22:55.640 --> 23:03.480]  thing to it and they're full of crap? Because he's a comedian that travels around the country
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.040]  and he even tells people in the blue cities, nobody wants to wear the mask or take the shots,
[23:08.040 --> 23:11.720]  in the blue cities everybody's sick of the left and the black people are sick of it,
[23:11.720 --> 23:18.760]  the brown people are sick of it. Everybody's sick of it who's got a brain. Yeah, there's some young,
[23:18.760 --> 23:22.760]  dumb people and some old dumb people. There's people out there that's still buying to Hollywood,
[23:22.760 --> 23:29.720]  buying to what Prince Harry says about censoring Joe Rogan, how asinine to have some royal
[23:29.720 --> 23:36.360]  twit telling Americans what we can hear and see. I think we had a war about that 240 something years
[23:36.360 --> 23:45.480]  ago, right? So you look at Maher and you say, hey, screw him, he's been a big leftist. Hey, folks,
[23:46.360 --> 23:50.200]  this is what winning looks like. Yeah, they got a bunch of leftists out buying guns,
[23:50.200 --> 23:54.600]  learning how to use them and then suddenly they become populist and conservatives. That's what
[23:54.600 --> 24:03.320]  happens. And yeah, a lot of the left are now running to us saying, hey, we want to be populist,
[24:03.320 --> 24:09.480]  we want to be into freedom too. And we have to say to them, if this isn't just a gimmick,
[24:09.480 --> 24:14.600]  because you know that there's been a pendulum swing, that's fine, because we want you to defect
[24:14.600 --> 24:19.160]  over to us. We're not like the left that has a perfect orthodoxy where you've got to follow
[24:19.160 --> 24:24.040]  our every little word and how we say it's done. We just want you to promote free speech and
[24:24.040 --> 24:31.080]  private property and an open, truly free society that celebrates human victory and competition.
[24:31.080 --> 24:36.680]  And yeah, we don't like ganging up and killing unborn babies, but we're not going to judge you
[24:36.680 --> 24:40.120]  if you've been part of that done in the past because you were deceived. We want you to get
[24:40.120 --> 24:46.840]  the understanding of a pro-human future and celebrate our unborn. I don't tell you this
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.640]  because I'm proud of it. I tell you because I'm ashamed of it, but it needs to be out there
[24:51.640 --> 24:57.640]  that I've paid for quite a few abortions when I was young. And that's why I was saved again.
[24:57.640 --> 25:03.640]  When I was about 10 years old, I was first at my Holy Ghost experience and then I became wicked
[25:03.640 --> 25:09.320]  and bad and got disconnected from God. And then literally God hit me like a bolt of lightning
[25:09.320 --> 25:16.520]  and said, you have got to stop killing your children or you are going to be cut off from me
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.800]  completely. And I didn't commit the ultimate sin. I didn't reject the Holy Spirit and that major
[25:21.800 --> 25:27.720]  conviction. And then that's when the whole world opened up and the plan was laid out before me.
[25:29.400 --> 25:33.800]  Because God said, let me let you show you what it feels like to have my spirit removed.
[25:33.800 --> 25:40.120]  And God began to remove his spirit from me, that hand that had been on my shoulder and that around
[25:40.120 --> 25:47.880]  me, that energy field of my whole life, those guardian angels were now stepping back saying,
[25:47.880 --> 25:54.440]  you kill your children. You're going to be separated from me forever unless you stop it.
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.560]  And I literally then experienced that and over the next few months,
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.920]  what literally saw my mission and what I was supposed to do and how I was going to go wake
[26:06.920 --> 26:12.280]  people up and then trigger this giant awakening of all these other people and how that was what I
[26:12.280 --> 26:17.560]  had to carry out all the way to the end unto death. If that is what God wants me to do and I had to
[26:17.560 --> 26:24.680]  sign onto that so the Holy Spirit would not leave me. And that's a true story, folks. That really
[26:24.680 --> 26:31.400]  happened. That's real. And God doesn't give you things you can't handle all at one time. I wondered
[26:31.400 --> 26:36.120]  all these things in my life was just God testing me with more weight and more stress and more attacks
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.400]  and more persecution and more dirty tricks. So I would learn all of this so that I would someday
[26:41.400 --> 26:50.520]  begin to become a master, not a master yet. That doesn't happen till you die. But literally,
[26:50.520 --> 26:56.600]  ladies and gentlemen, I can now see God's plan and its fullness and how powerful it is. So let's
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.880]  celebrate that people are coming over to our side because believe me, they're doing it under major
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.680]  globalist attack, but because they have a hunger for it, let's not be mad at them because they want
[27:06.680 --> 27:12.840]  to stand next to the fire of truth. Let's invite them in and then show them because we're all sinners
[27:12.840 --> 27:19.800]  and we've all fallen short. Here's what Bill Maher had to say. And finally, new rule, it's
[27:19.800 --> 27:25.080]  suppressing enough. Having just had a birthday and being 66, please don't ask me to start doing
[27:25.080 --> 27:33.480]  grown-up things like run for president. A few weeks ago, Fox News' Dana Perino, a former Bush
[27:33.480 --> 27:39.240]  press secretary, suggested that the Democrats should recruit me to run for president, which is
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.640]  kind of special because it means that in the space of 20 years, Bush press secretaries have gone from
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.640]  telling me I need to watch what I say. They need to watch what they say, watch what they do, and
[27:51.640 --> 28:00.120]  this is not a time for remarks like that. There never is. They've gone from that to wondering if
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.840]  I should run for president. It would be interesting to see if Bill Maher is recruited to run for
[28:05.720 --> 28:12.440]  the presidency. Now, some people think this means I've changed. I assure you, I have not.
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.240]  I am still the same unmarried, childless, pot-smoking Libertine I always was.
[28:19.240 --> 28:31.320]  I have many flaws, but you can't accuse me of maturing.
[28:38.760 --> 28:44.680]  Let's get this straight. It's not me who's changed. It's the left, who is now made up of a small
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.960]  contingent who's gone mental, and a large contingent who refused to call them out for it.
[28:49.960 --> 28:53.400]  But I will. That's why I'm a hero at Fox these days.
[29:00.200 --> 29:05.880]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill, and it is the fastest growing market
[29:05.880 --> 29:11.720]  in supplements in the world, for good reason. There are a lot of amazing compounds out there,
[29:11.720 --> 29:17.880]  some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our brains, and we've tried them all,
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.760]  we've researched them all, and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems,
[29:22.760 --> 29:28.120]  or any type of toxicity, or any type of extreme hangovers. Because I'm not saying some of our
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.080]  brain products, you won't have a little bit of a letdown once you take them, but that would
[29:31.080 --> 29:35.880]  just be a lie. But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.960]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good, clean, Neutropic, a good,
[29:41.960 --> 29:46.120]  clean brain pill. You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you. This is a
[29:46.120 --> 29:52.280]  high quality system. It's available at infowarstore.com. It's sold out for a long time at 40% off.
[29:52.280 --> 29:57.560]  So get your Brain Force Plus today at infowarstore.com and help keep us on air. Thank you so much,
[29:57.560 --> 30:04.520]  and I'll see you out there. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience.
[30:04.520 --> 30:11.880]  It's a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by
[30:11.880 --> 30:19.320]  the global private corporations has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from
[30:19.320 --> 30:24.920]  which we will never emerge. It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover
[30:24.920 --> 30:33.640]  our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total
[30:33.640 --> 30:40.440]  absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[30:41.480 --> 30:46.600]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out
[30:46.600 --> 30:52.280]  with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and Carbon Taxes. Things only get worse from
[30:52.280 --> 30:58.280]  here if we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance,
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.480]  noncompliance. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[31:03.480 --> 31:07.720]  Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[31:07.720 --> 31:12.760]  patrons can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts,
[31:12.760 --> 31:19.080]  Owen Shroyer. Supermail Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable
[31:19.080 --> 31:24.520]  tank. Supermail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[31:24.520 --> 31:30.680]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[31:30.680 --> 31:35.880]  It also worked quite well. They just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact,
[31:35.880 --> 31:39.720]  each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[31:39.720 --> 31:42.840]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's
[31:42.840 --> 31:48.920]  just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[31:48.920 --> 31:52.920]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[31:52.920 --> 32:04.520]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[32:04.520 --> 32:10.600]  lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage cyber attack, with the deep state
[32:10.600 --> 32:17.800]  pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the massive inflation
[32:17.800 --> 32:23.080]  and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now, you need to get
[32:23.080 --> 32:29.480]  prepared now with high quality, storeable food that is ready to ship. And it's been four years
[32:29.480 --> 32:36.760]  since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storeable food at 25% off
[32:36.760 --> 32:44.440]  four years. But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two weeks
[32:44.440 --> 32:51.320]  from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog
[32:51.320 --> 32:57.160]  of my Patriot supply. Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that
[32:57.160 --> 33:05.480]  wants to be self sufficient. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's
[33:05.480 --> 33:26.040]  Alex Jones. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[33:26.040 --> 33:36.440]  Jones. I want to read some Bible verses here on air. And I don't read these verses because I'm
[33:36.440 --> 33:42.520]  some high and mighty perfect preacher that's lived some really clean life. Now I know the devil.
[33:43.160 --> 33:51.800]  I've been down on his level to quote Keith Whitley. Psalms 139 to 14.
[33:51.800 --> 34:01.800]  I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. You can read other translations of that.
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.680]  There's other places where it says that. But what is fearfully made? Well, we're God fearing
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.360]  because of God's awesome power and being in that presence. But you're made in the image of God,
[34:14.360 --> 34:22.040]  made by that God and made with free will as the seed of the universe put in you by that God. And
[34:22.040 --> 34:33.720]  that's fearfully made. When God made you, there was fear all around that because of the potential
[34:33.720 --> 34:39.160]  for you to serve evil and good. Because you can comprehend the universe. You can invent amazing
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.440]  things. You can create whole nations and armies and starfleets and anything you want.
[34:46.680 --> 34:52.360]  So the angels are just swarming around when your soul's being formed by God. Fearful, fearful of
[34:52.360 --> 35:00.440]  it. Satan jealous of your covenant with God, your power because God took a part of himself and made
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.000]  you just like the rib and the archetype of Adam was taken to make Eve. So that there would be
[35:07.000 --> 35:15.320]  Congress between us and God, that interface. And that's what they don't want you to know,
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.160]  that you are created by the infinite divine spirit.
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.040]  For I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[35:28.040 --> 35:40.200]  A couple more. Romans 12 to and be not conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the
[35:40.200 --> 35:49.480]  renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[35:49.480 --> 36:01.640]  You are imperfect, but you can jack in to the perfection and then be perfected at the next level.
[36:03.080 --> 36:10.200]  Romans 12, 3, for I say though that grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.600]  think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according to God
[36:16.600 --> 36:26.760]  has dealt to every man the measure of faith. Don't think of yourself as invincible and all
[36:26.760 --> 36:31.320]  powerful and good and don't think of yourself as ugly and horrible and a failure. The devil
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.320]  will tell you about those things. Think of you as the potential of the universe and beyond given
[36:37.320 --> 36:47.320]  to you by the master creator. All of that potential for what you were created to be laid out before
[36:47.320 --> 36:56.680]  you, and that's the great truth. And so we look at the miserable Harvey Weinstein's and we look
[36:56.680 --> 37:05.320]  at the pathetic Justin Trudeau's and we look at the buffoonish Boris Johnson's and we look at the
[37:05.320 --> 37:15.160]  and we look at the ridiculous McCrons and all of these people went against God's plan because the
[37:15.160 --> 37:27.080]  God of this world, the liar gives them petty power, but they're hated by the people. They're
[37:27.080 --> 37:36.840]  always destroyed in the end. They're losers. And so when you look at them, don't even hate them
[37:36.840 --> 37:41.320]  and give them that power. Think about how you love your children and your family and the culture
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.840]  and goodness and justice and you do what you do exposing them, not because you hate them,
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.880]  but because you love the people that you're standing up for. And in that office,
[37:53.880 --> 38:01.800]  you move way closer to God, who is that North Star to deliver us from this,
[38:02.920 --> 38:09.160]  because we better be praying to be delivered from this and we better be supporting and praising
[38:09.160 --> 38:17.960]  and appreciating and praying for the people in California and New York and Michigan and Canada
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.840]  and the UK and Australia and Europe, truck drivers that can't even pay their bills,
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.080]  truck drivers that haven't seen their kids in two weeks, truck drivers who might get fired,
[38:27.080 --> 38:32.680]  but they're still there blocking those roads and shutting things down to show the world people power,
[38:32.680 --> 38:37.080]  not the globalists locking us in our houses to bankrupt us and control us, but us showing
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.320]  the globalists that we don't buy what they're saying and doing and that we stand against them.
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.840]  Non-violently with the truth while they try to normalize Klaus Schwab on TV,
[38:48.840 --> 39:03.320]  all over world TV, US TV, US cable, C-span, bragging that they've captured and penetrated our
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.480]  governments. Klaus Schwab's own Wikipedia page linked to his own website says he is capturing
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.280]  our countries and he brags that he's captured more than 70 nations now under his control.
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.240]  He does that so his followers and agents feel emboldened and feel powerful as he announces
[39:24.600 --> 39:25.720]  that he rules us.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.120]  The capture of democratic structures and institutions, we have penetrated and have now
[39:34.120 --> 39:42.200]  control half, more than half of the world cabinets. More than half the world's cabinets,
[39:42.200 --> 39:48.120]  the people running governments, he brags on television that he rules us.
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.040]  Look, of all my background and ancestry, I'm probably more German than anything else,
[39:56.040 --> 39:59.960]  so I love German culture and love Germans, my great family that are German Texans.
[39:59.960 --> 40:04.040]  But I mean, what's up with Germans thinking they rule the world, run everything, right?
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.080]  I mean, Klaus Schwab's grandfather literally was a top arms producer for the Nazis. Like, dude,
[40:09.080 --> 40:19.000]  burn in hell, man. Get the hell off our back. Who died and made you God? Nobody.
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.800]  And all your Hollywood trash and all the McCrons and all the Trudeaus and all the
[40:25.800 --> 40:33.320]  Mercos and all the Australian leader, the New Zealand leader, all worked for you and we know it
[40:33.320 --> 40:42.840]  and we reject you. And we say no to you and we tell you that you will be brought to justice
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.360]  for your violations of the Nuremberg Code and common sense and everything that's good and decent.
[40:46.360 --> 40:53.880]  You mass murdering, society destroying, lockdown running, murderer. The lockdown now that you
[40:53.880 --> 40:58.600]  had mentioned, I agree with their numbers, 40 million in the last two years have starved to death
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.560]  on top of the other 25 million that starved to death every year and almost doubling in the last
[41:03.560 --> 41:10.040]  two years of people starving to death, begging for food, no jobs, lockdown, because the IMF
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.840]  and World Bank controls their African nations and their Asian nations and their Latin American
[41:14.840 --> 41:20.840]  nations and then the UNS refugee camps to organize military aged men and ship them up here to invade
[41:20.840 --> 41:37.880]  the United States on record. Unbelievable. All right. I got a lot of news to hit. We got so much
[41:37.880 --> 41:42.600]  to cover here and so much to go over. I'm just going to say this because if we don't get funding,

[45:59.720 --> 46:06.600]  now. It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[46:06.600 --> 46:10.680]  what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[46:10.680 --> 46:15.560]  my NASA and other governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really happening with the
[46:15.560 --> 46:23.640]  climate. The only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change
[46:23.640 --> 46:28.600]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[46:28.600 --> 46:31.720]  it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[46:31.720 --> 46:37.480]  okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[46:38.040 --> 46:43.160]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the UN
[46:43.160 --> 46:48.920]  they have weather control trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a
[46:48.920 --> 46:54.360]  very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.760]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[46:58.760 --> 47:28.600]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:29.640 --> 47:44.680]  so the globalist anti-free market vulture capitalist system is in trouble all over the world
[47:45.320 --> 47:50.440]  and so it's trying to create a global crisis it controls to consolidate and keep power very very
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.600]  simple and they brag about that that's all out there what i'm talking about here is not my opinion
[47:54.600 --> 47:59.080]  so if you're a new listener go check it out for yourself and we're not giving you anything here
[47:59.080 --> 48:06.840]  that's speculative so here's what's going on i have really weighed trump and i've looked at
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.400]  everything he's done trying to bring american jobs back stopping most the fentanyl coming in
[48:11.400 --> 48:18.680]  defending the borders uh deescalating wars around the world trump's a good person overall that
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.400]  means well he made big mistake with warp speed and the rest of it and thinks that that's his uh
[48:26.600 --> 48:32.840]  thing to hang his hat on that that's his legacy and so he's doubled down there but i'm not going
[48:32.840 --> 48:40.920]  to throw the baby out with the bathwater that said they have a constellation of prosecutors
[48:40.920 --> 48:48.520]  both federal and state from new york to illinois to california to many other areas that have
[48:48.520 --> 48:55.640]  indicted the the people around trump other billionaires you name it they've i mean there's been
[48:55.640 --> 49:07.240]  hundreds of indictments and the system is doing that to try to force trump into mobilizing aggressive
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.840]  political grassroots power so that the globalists can make their takeover and their censorship and
[49:12.840 --> 49:21.400]  their authoritarianism and their surveillance about trump as if he's the representative of
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.680]  the resistance instead of it just being simply hey i'm liberal i'm conservative i'm old i'm young
[49:26.680 --> 49:33.480]  i'm whatever i don't want a surveillance state i don't want in the infrastructure legislation
[49:33.480 --> 49:40.120]  that passed kill switches and all the cars coming out in three years and and breathalyzers and tracker
[49:40.120 --> 49:46.840]  systems i mean that shouldn't be a partisan issue they admit now that the world vaccine id is a global
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.800]  social credit score based in china where political this and it's can't leave their house and they
[49:51.800 --> 49:58.200]  use the coveted thing selectively as the excuse got a bunch of articles on that today so we got
[49:58.200 --> 50:05.480]  to thread the needle on this but when you see axios articles like this one coups are making
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.360]  a comeback around the world well they don't tell you as we had a coup against the people
[50:10.360 --> 50:18.200]  and against populism 14 months ago and it was the 2020 election and the idea that we can't
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.920]  question elections the idea that we couldn't challenge all those incredible anomalies and
[50:22.920 --> 50:29.160]  issues is insane remember polosi said we're not going to accept him winning even if they even
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.040]  if the electoral college says he's the president we're going to have our own inauguration and
[50:34.040 --> 50:41.960]  say bideness remember that oh but as soon as trump just tried to have a 10-day investigation
[50:41.960 --> 50:47.160]  in the senate which is constitutional they're now calling that illegal and the january 6th commission
[50:47.160 --> 50:54.440]  is asking the justice department to arrest people in trump's orbit for challenging an election
[50:54.440 --> 51:02.760]  and saying we don't believe it's accurate when if a third world country does one tenth of the
[51:02.760 --> 51:11.640]  of the hanky-panky and the chicanery and all of the skullduggery that went on during that november
[51:11.640 --> 51:18.120]  december january fiasco it would not be a certified election the un would say it wasn't
[51:18.120 --> 51:24.040]  a free and fair election the united states state department would say that but they don't because
[51:24.040 --> 51:30.680]  it's here they've lost the people they've lost not just the midwest they've lost everybody
[51:30.680 --> 51:39.160]  california isn't really blue it's red and all these places are illinois new york new jersey
[51:39.160 --> 51:45.560]  but you've got to have huge super majorities to overpower the election fraud and all the dead
[51:45.560 --> 51:52.200]  people on the voting rolls and the illegals voting in texas and in florida the democrats went
[51:53.960 --> 52:01.000]  for a decapitating level political event to decapitate the republican party by even stealing
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.960]  texas of florida but they ran out of dead people and people that had moved out of state on the
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.640]  voter rolls and they hit that wall and they failed so that's what's happening here ladies and
[52:11.640 --> 52:19.880]  gentlemen and so trump should not be indicted his family should not be harassed you have the new
[52:19.880 --> 52:26.440]  york da that says he won't even respond to armed robberies he said that last week he said i'm not
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.600]  gonna even unless somebody gets hurt we don't respond so you can put a gun to somebody's head
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.520]  and say give me that money give me your purse and as long as you don't pistol weapon or shoot
[52:34.520 --> 52:40.040]  them you don't get in trouble and then you got democrats making jokes and attacking the police
[52:40.040 --> 52:46.040]  because two cops just got killed and making fun of their funerals i have the articles these are
[52:46.040 --> 52:52.200]  america hating people they instinctively had our institutions so much because they want to wreck
[52:52.200 --> 52:58.200]  it all our institutions perfect hell no but there are institutions and the new world order
[52:58.200 --> 53:05.960]  desperately wants those institutions that are local under their control so we got all this talk
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.600]  about coups are making a comeback and i'm gonna play this clip trump says they're trying to put
[53:10.600 --> 53:15.960]  me in jail trump calls for biggest protest ever if racist prosecutors do anything illegal
[53:17.240 --> 53:22.920]  and it's all literally installed george soros leticia james the attorney general in new york the
[53:22.920 --> 53:32.600]  uh the new york prosecutor all of them ran on putting trump in jail i mean these are not impartial
[53:32.600 --> 53:39.560]  people so absolutely you can't i mean george soros has gotten over a thousand da's in just the last
[53:39.560 --> 53:46.440]  two years elected a thousand he's got over 20 attorney generals that he literally calls and his
[53:46.440 --> 53:54.280]  son alexander tells them what to do on record if i called up a da that i'd pay to get an office
[53:54.280 --> 53:59.320]  and told them what to do the fbi would raid me and should because that's corruption that's bribery
[54:00.040 --> 54:03.800]  you can give to people's political campaigns you can't direct them what to do why would george
[54:03.800 --> 54:09.320]  soros want rampant crime and five times the car jackings and triple the murders because he hates
[54:09.320 --> 54:15.720]  you he wants to level the country to consolidate the control he's overthrown over 20 countries and
[54:15.720 --> 54:19.720]  destroyed their pensions and destroyed their currencies he's a monster
[54:23.080 --> 54:25.000]  and you look at the young turks and all of them
[54:26.840 --> 54:32.040]  celebrating him and saying alex jones is the worst person in the world because he says
[54:32.040 --> 54:39.400]  george soros was a nazi collaborator he said it on 60 minutes he said it on npr anybody can find
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.360]  those clips but it doesn't matter these are fawning leftists that just love the money because
[54:44.360 --> 54:50.120]  they're not even leftist they're corporate whores they're liars and they signed their soul on to this
[54:50.120 --> 54:57.960]  guy who loves the car jackings and murders and killing mainly brown people who thinks that's funny
[54:58.760 --> 55:03.080]  to demoralize you and then now we've got the former president who did have the election stolen
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.920]  up there literally so desperate now he's not backing down at least to him on the surface
[55:08.920 --> 55:14.200]  saying be ready to demonstrate if they try to arrest me and people say well they're not going
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.760]  to try that yes they are because they want to push us into confrontation they want to push us into
[55:18.760 --> 55:25.800]  crisis on the streets because they've already lost and so people say well jones you're not being very
[55:25.800 --> 55:31.720]  manly why don't you want to go ahead and take the left on i'll explain this next hour because it's
[55:31.720 --> 55:36.040]  multinational it's international it's about destroying the currency and the infrastructure
[55:36.040 --> 55:47.400]  and so discretion is the greater part of valor we have to peacefully and and with civil disobedience
[55:47.400 --> 55:53.240]  shut down the system and expose it because the globalist system is collapsing our system we don't
[55:53.240 --> 55:58.680]  collapse our system to get them we collapse their system by identifying them and not complying
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.520]  i'll explain more of that in the next hour but here's trump really saying some desperate stuff
[56:08.440 --> 56:15.400]  if these radical vicious racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal i hope we are going
[56:15.400 --> 56:23.080]  to have in this country the biggest protest we have ever had in washington dc in new york
[56:23.080 --> 56:31.400]  in atlanta and elsewhere because our country and our elections are corrupt they're corrupt
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.160]  well you know i criticize him on the deadly vaccines but when it comes to wavos and it
[56:37.160 --> 56:43.480]  comes to doubling down and it comes to saying we're going to stand up he's done it but it's
[56:43.480 --> 56:49.640]  got to be peaceful and we got to stop provocateurs and here's the problem biden is in control of the
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.520]  federal police and the military and he's in control of the police in dc and they're going to do the
[56:54.520 --> 57:00.520]  same thing again walk us into a trap we get five million people there and then they have 100 cops
[57:00.520 --> 57:06.360]  at the capital and then the left breaks in and some useful idiots go along with the going in and
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.560]  then they freaking kick off a cyber attack and say we launched it and turn the damn lights out
[57:11.560 --> 57:17.080]  because that's what they want to do so i'm not going to sit here and play soldier or armshare
[57:17.080 --> 57:23.640]  quarterback i'm just telling you we're going into some insane times with 282 days out from the
[57:23.640 --> 57:29.240]  midterm elections which is going to be a massive landslide of populist patriot candidates taking
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.000]  over the republican party and and a lot of people gun the democratic party are now starting to run
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.040]  against this insanity so the globalists aren't going to let us get there without staging major
[57:38.040 --> 57:41.960]  events as general flin warned on the show friday the globalists are getting ready to stage false
[57:41.960 --> 57:47.240]  flags create a new january 6 hour number two straight ahead tell everybody you know tune in now
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.240]  paying for warriors if you're like me you've been a long time listener of this program
[57:53.240 --> 57:59.160]  and you fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me a fire is burning
[57:59.160 --> 58:04.840]  something needs to change and yet we feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a system that
[58:04.840 --> 58:10.760]  someone else created for us it's time for us to break free from that system race at wars is a game
[58:10.760 --> 58:17.080]  changer you start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim so much
[58:17.080 --> 58:22.840]  of the stuff we look at today is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and therefore we
[58:22.840 --> 58:28.200]  manifest as negative reality out there when they feel their lie cheat steel plan to enslave and rob
[58:28.200 --> 58:35.480]  the people there is an awakening reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock
[58:35.480 --> 58:41.000]  onto the deep rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me and now i'm not scared
[58:41.000 --> 58:47.880]  anymore i have to say i was blown away i feel so much better every day listening to it to alex
[58:47.880 --> 58:53.240]  thank you very much for putting the course together you're absolutely right we are reflections
[58:53.240 --> 58:58.840]  of god we are emanations of that and we can use that god energy to do really anything we want to
[58:58.840 --> 59:03.560]  do in this life roman's chapter 12 paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our
[59:03.560 --> 59:09.400]  mind and that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious most people go through
[59:09.400 --> 59:13.880]  their day and don't think about many things you can drive along a long journey and not even remember
[59:13.880 --> 59:19.560]  half the trip in this process we need to have a concerted active effort physically and mentally
[59:19.560 --> 59:25.880]  to reprogram that subconscious mind that's what this series is about is resetting our mind because
[59:25.880 --> 59:31.880]  there's a war on for our mind he's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation
[59:31.880 --> 59:35.800]  and in this new great awakening and i encourage everybody out there if you haven't gone there
[59:35.800 --> 59:47.800]  yet go to reset wars dot com that's where your journey begins
[59:47.800 --> 1:00:03.720]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:11.640]  so
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:18.440]  australia and canada now the front lines big news on that next segment but here's the latest
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:34.360]  gregory's report
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:43.560]  men and women defense force both serving and retired volunteers or national servicemen
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:50.440]  veterans or we are at a point in history without precedent the world and many of you know that
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:55.880]  truly malevolent forces have been ating and undermining our nation for longer than most of us have
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:03.320]  lived they our adversaries have executed their monstrous plans against innocent men women and
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:10.440]  children they fight with a pre-biblical barbarity without decency and without constraint they fight
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:16.920]  without courage and without compassion their war against the people is undeclared total war
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:26.600]  it has been a traitors war a dirty war a coward's war we know only too well that unless we halt and
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:31.480]  then reverse this under attack on every aspect of our lives we will lose everything we love
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:37.880]  and enter a period of civilizational darkness more depraved than any period in human history
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:45.640]  we must act however this is not a call to arms our soulless adversaries and their mindless
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:52.040]  enablers would like nothing better than for a shock to be fired because to do so would legitimize
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:58.120]  in the minds of many subnambulant australians further unconstitutional and unlawful constraints on
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:04.840]  our rights to our lives our liberty and our property we will not give them that excuse
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:12.520]  we know we never fight on ground of the enemy's choosing we must fight but in doing so we must
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:19.960]  win the people at every opportunity we must stand with the people unarmed but in uniform
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:27.800]  our weapon pure courage we took an oath to serve our nation and what is our nation if
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:34.920]  not the people by our presence in uniform alongside and with the people we are sending a powerful
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:41.640]  unambiguous and galvanizing message that in this war for the world we the people are united
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:48.680]  and invincible we must demonstrate the pure courage born of love of family and love of country
[1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:55.480]  that beats in the heart of every soldier sailor and airman because what is courage but love in
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:01.880]  action and if you love someone or something enough you will do what must be done regardless of the
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:08.360]  cost to you perhaps we will lose our property if so what of it we can always acquire more
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.840]  perhaps we will lose our liberty if so what of it we can eventually be set free
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:22.920]  perhaps we will lose our lives if so what of it there are destinies much worse than death
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:29.000]  these sentiments are too much for most to understand much less accept and that is all
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:35.640]  the more reason for us for you to stand with the people now you might be challenged to explain
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:42.040]  why you chose such a course of action the answer is simple you'll be doing one military law
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:49.240]  civilian law and just plain common decency require and demand you are disobeying the
[1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:54.680]  unlawful commands given by the admirals generals and air marshals of the australian defense force
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:00.760]  to participate in the genocide of the australian people they are guilty and you will be innocent
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:07.880]  the oath to serve your country as a soldier did not include a contract for the normal luxuries
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  and comforts enjoyed within our society on the contrary it implied hardship loyalty and
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:19.640]  devotion to duty regardless of rank ladies and gentlemen of the australian defense force
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:24.440]  it is time for you to serve not the admirals not the generals and not the air marshals
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:31.480]  but to endure hardship show loyalty and do your duty for your country and your people
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:37.720]  and remember that in the words of gk chester we fight not because we hate what is in front of us
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:45.560]  but because we love what is behind us i'm ricardo boz national leader of australia one thank you
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:51.720]  and that's the former head of australian army special forces and he needs to be the next
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:05:03.080]  prime minister of australia i want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:08.600]  our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of
[1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:15.160]  the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:24.200]  and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people to
[1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:29.160]  buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:34.840]  leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:39.960]  or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding
[1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:45.240]  every sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:50.920]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization making the companies they do
[1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:59.480]  fun the only things left standing this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop it
[1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:08.280]  of the information war it's alex jones all right i want to take you all up above the mountains
[1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:19.400]  the 35 000 foot view and beyond and when i tell you what i see you don't have to believe alexander
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:27.880]  emrick jones you will be given the places to look and see it for yourself you see i'm not seeing for
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:37.160]  you i'm simply taking you up to the mountain and asking you to see it for yourself
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:45.720]  i could sit here and talk about all this incredible news and i will next segment
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:55.160]  but what's really hiding in plain view because if you understand this you'll understand everything
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:07:01.080]  as i've said many times there are certain issues there are certain things that if people understand it
[1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:06.440]  they'll understand everything if you can grasp this you can grasp it all
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:15.480]  but it is multifaceted it is complex but once you grasp it it's incredibly simple
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:23.320]  remember that raspius and poll three weeks ago 48 percent of democrats said they want to
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:26.680]  put people in camps that don't take the vaccine
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:33.480]  50 plus percent said take people's children away if they don't give it to them
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:35.800]  it's not even approved in little children
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:45.080]  yeah there's the headline democrat voters support harsh measures against the unvaccinated
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:56.280]  now think about that it's a very powerful polls big sampling group very scientific
[1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:04.120]  and the next segment i've got one of the little teleprompter reading democrats
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:08.200]  up there talking about how they're all in fear of republican martial law
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:16.120]  and republicans coming to put them in camps total projection which is their new talking point
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:26.600]  just like fizer and bill gates and tridot and all of them are saying this week last week love take
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:33.560]  the fizer shots and don't question side effects be tough and do it for love what love of money
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:40.600]  love of depopulation love of power love of death as christ said all those that hate me love death
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:50.520]  so we got that big backdrop there just just remember that and then let's add this one thing to it
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:09:00.680]  because there are at least a dozen manhattan project level operations that are on record
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:07.880]  going on human animal cloning projects secret space programs human cyborg programs
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:11.400]  the list goes on and on
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.480]  but what's the big one that's hiding in plain view what's the big one
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:36.200]  it's geoengineering in 1992 a group of scientists won a Nobel prize for a plan to spray aluminum
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:43.160]  dioxide and barium salts and also radioactive isotopes because they form really big nuclei
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:49.800]  perform clouds into the atmosphere at 30 to 35 000 feet to form a shield to block solar
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:54.360]  radiation to stop global warming really it's just an excuse and a cover for weather modification
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:59.720]  and geoengineering and terraforming on the planet and the the the the chemicals they spray on record
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:04.600]  have made the soils of the world where this is being done mainly in the northern hemisphere
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:08.920]  ungroble while the plants are dying the trees are dying the bees are dying
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:14.520]  oh i mean you know the number one supplier of honey in the world now is
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:17.320]  cuba they don't let the chemtrails happen in cuba
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:25.640]  so they're spraying aluminum that then gets to the oh but don't worry monsanto's got over 200
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:30.920]  seeds already patented they can grow in aluminum see and that's old news folks
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  you need to get dame wettington back on the show real trial blazer but here's the point
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:45.800]  just like it's on record that there's a law to put a kill switch and a tracker chip and all the
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:50.840]  new cars that biden just passed last year you tell the average person that you know at church
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:56.760]  they roll their eyes even though it's the law and even though it's on record that 5g causes
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:05.640]  massive cancer they just say so what but now bill gates has come out again and imagine if
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:10.440]  they said the russians wanted to do this or or or imagine if they said trump wanted to do this
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:15.080]  everybody would say no but oh because it's bill gates who says he literally wants to depopulate
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:19.240]  you well then oh my god you said you want to have death panels and kill old people well i
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:25.800]  really want you to quote release a chemical cloud on the world he also has a plan to block out the
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:31.400]  sun now remember these are all projects going on department of energy last time we got documents
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:37.960]  they're spending five billion a year to add barium salts and aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:45.560]  to kerosene jet fuel that is then aerosolized under patents through the jet engines yes we
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:50.440]  know there's condensation trails yes we know ice crystals form and i watched them when i was a kid
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:56.440]  and before 1992 and it all started when operational 94 they would fly and was cold weather it would form
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:00.440]  crystals and they would dissipate they don't dissipate now they get bigger and bigger and form
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:07.320]  cloud banks and the governments of the world have a treaty and at the un and they admit they're doing
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:14.760]  it and then when i get up here and say hey we should have a debate about this they go oh that
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:23.560]  doesn't exist it's kind of like you know soros is in Reuters bragging four years ago hey uh i get
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:28.280]  state department money to pay for billions of dollars of debit cards to ship illegal aliens into
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:37.000]  the us we cover it the news says it doesn't exist it's the same thing so they'll tell you hey we're
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.320]  geoengineering we're controlling the weather it's for your own good it's a wonderful thing we're
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:46.920]  spraying the stuff and then mainline scientists go that's that's that's killing the the the the soil
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:52.200]  it's killing the trees let's go we're not doing that doesn't exist hey you just had a big conference
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:57.720]  on c-span you said the cia director admit it you know like no we didn't know like yeah we did oh
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:03.960]  really fact checker say it doesn't exist and then the fact checker group is newsguard owned by microsoft
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:10.440]  so they're up there saying we're gonna sterilize your sons we're gonna have drag queen story time
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:15.160]  we're gonna open the borders we're gonna devalue currency build back better five plus trillion
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:21.960]  dollars and then they say oh a no-bill prize winner says this won't cause inflation and then
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:35.640]  socky tells you there is no inflation so again do you think the only secret program that's not
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:44.200]  even secret is the geoengineering weather modification no and again i want to explain
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:48.280]  something if you really read the globalist writings that are public they say they've not
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:55.960]  made contact with aliens they say they are going to become an alien species that is a transcendent
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:02.360]  that then is distributed into all living things as a dust you and they said that 20 years ago
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:06.040]  they made the johnny debt movie transcendence about that
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.240]  now whether they're going to be able to carry this out or not the point is these crazy people
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:19.480]  are doing this and for the crime of talking about what they're doing and i'll show the
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:27.560]  clips next segment i've got to be taken off the air and de-platformed and sued and debanked and
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:33.480]  arrested because they don't want you to wake up and go hey the nfl game doesn't matter even though
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.800]  it's fun to watch i get it but the baseball game doesn't matter or whatever because we're gonna lose
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:42.440]  all of that if we don't start studying not tom brady's
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:53.080]  nfl scores but what's actually going on and what's happening because here's the new headline
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:15:01.080]  out of cnbc this bill gates funded chemical cloud could help stop global warming oh it's
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:07.400]  a bill gates funded chemical cloud and it's sprayed through the jet fuel that they add
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:14.200]  barium salts and aluminum dioxide into the air to save us oh my gosh it's exactly what i said
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:20.440]  20 plus years ago because we had the patents then we had the whistleblowers then we had them all
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:29.000]  then it gets worse i knew an engineer i actually knew two engineers that told me in the mid-1990s
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:34.600]  i thought they were crazy even though they were very wealthy people and successful that doppler
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:39.960]  radar being funded by the feds we put in was designed to resonate with these sprays and actually
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:44.760]  ionize the atmosphere they've definitely classified that too it is you wonder why we got this nice
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:50.760]  doppler radar here in town well yeah because it doubles as a weather modification control system
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:54.680]  we'll talk about it when we come back
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:09.880]  if you only knew the power of the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat humanity
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:20.040]  then our gods will reward us with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the globalists
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:27.800]  they must first play god they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:34.040]  Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:39.080]  then destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:46.840]  deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:53.240]  dual order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:17:01.400]  fight is info wars dot com this is a great sponsor we have one of the best deals you're

[1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:03.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:19.880]  so they treat you like children we tell you 25 years ago about geoengineering and weather control
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:25.320]  and the doppler radar systems and the chemtrails they add those to the jet fuel and even satellites
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:30.760]  that can manipulate control weather and they tell you it doesn't exist because they don't
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:35.560]  want the small little people talking about that you're supposed to watch your hip hop and your
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:41.320]  rock and roll and your hollywood crap and while you sleep the globalists destroy your future
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:47.000]  here's sky tv talking about china publicly admitting they have doppler radar on the ground
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:53.400]  directed by satellites to manipulate the quote rivers in the sky that's what the jet stream is
[1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:59.720]  here it is but never fear if there's one thing the chinese communists believe in it's absolute
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:06.520]  control over all aspects of life including apparently the weather yes apparently china is
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:14.440]  developing a high-tech satellite based weather control system called river in the sky that will
[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:21.880]  allow it to move water vapor through man-made corridors in the sky this is in addition to
[1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:28.200]  their cloud seeding programs that involve shooting missiles filled with salt and minerals into the
[1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:32.040]  sky based on an original idea by kate bush
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:42.520]  oh yeah folks so they make jokes about all this the point is they don't want you discussing
[1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:46.760]  what's happening at the big adult table like at Thanksgiving little kids are over at the
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:51.640]  card table and the adults are over here and see i'm like a kid that came over to the adult table
[1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:55.160]  hey they're talking about killing us over here they're talking about world government they're
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:59.880]  like oh no you go back over to the kid table no i'm not going back over to the kid table no thank you
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:06.840]  in full wars is at the adult table and i just want to get all of the people out there to realize
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:11.320]  you can go dial into what they're doing because they think you're so stupid they just talk about
[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:16.200]  it right in front of you like you're a moron and i mean are they right you deserve to die do you
[1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:22.440]  deserve to be sterilized and 5g fried and all this so this is getting into all the chinese
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:29.240]  weather modification so now bill gates who wants to depopulate and who wants world government
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:37.560]  and who wants all these things is all over the news with chemical clouds sprayed out of jet
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:43.080]  engines mixed with the fuel exactly what we told you it was in the documents to save you
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:49.880]  from the global warming of course and that's their cover so let's play a clip here of john
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:56.200]  brennan before he let the cia six years ago before trump got in admitting all this
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:03.640]  another example is the array of technologies often referred to collectively as geo-engineering
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:07.640]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:14.040]  one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or sai
[1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:18.680]  a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:25.560]  heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an sai program could limit global temperature
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:30.920]  increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy
[1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:37.320]  additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively inexpensive
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.520]  the national research research council estimates that a fully deployed sai program would cost about
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:51.320]  ten billion dollars yearly now what's really going on there were a lot of wars that happened with
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:56.760]  the greeks then later the romans and when an enemy really gave the greeks or the romans a problem
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:04.840]  they would get at great expense a bunch of sea salt and they would salt the field so no one could
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:19.960]  grow food the hunts and the mongols would catapult black plague rotting bodies over the the great
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:24.520]  wall of china to give them diseases on the side so you know everything we do now is just more
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:33.880]  sophisticated of what already happened before and that's what they're doing right now is their
[1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:40.280]  geoengineering they're doing all this they're manipulating and they're playing god and they
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:48.360]  don't want you to even have a discussion or a debate about what they're up to i mean we show
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:54.440]  you department of energy documents decades ago how they're doing it what's going on so did you just
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:25:01.480]  catch what i said the romans in their fight with Hannibal they finally beat him and if you go back
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:07.320]  and look they went and salted the earth of some of the groups they defeated look up salting the earth
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:17.880]  and so now they don't put salt in the soil so you can't grow stuff they spray aluminum in it
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:24.440]  as a cover project for everybody at the department of energy with the liberals global warming is real
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:29.800]  it's a secret project other countries won't let us do it because of the un treaty 1979 so we're
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:35.960]  going to keep it secret and save the earth they're like yeah we like star trek yeah yeah we don't
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:40.280]  tell the public the media's got to make fun of anybody that talks about it because you know we
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:46.200]  don't want the public getting involved this is too important and then all you little star trek
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:54.200]  nasa people and department of energy people don't go what is spring hundreds of thousands of tons
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:26:02.680]  of barium salts and aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes mixed with jet fuel out what does that do
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:11.000]  when it settles to the ground oh oh oh that's why on average the aluminum level in the united states
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:17.880]  is eight times what it was before the early 1990s and starting in the 90s there's films on this
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.960]  it just oh suddenly there's all this aluminum and now your oak trees are dying and now your crops
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:33.720]  aren't growing how liberal how loving how trendy and the insects are dying and the birds are dying
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:41.240]  and everything's dying you know we've got a ranch we've had since the 1820s in east Texas
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:47.960]  and when i was a child there were it looked like the hobbit the shire giant oak trees everywhere
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:54.760]  i mean some of them 10 feet around it looked like the hobbit and i go there now and they're all dead
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:01.640]  almost all or they're barely alive with just a few leaves on them these mighty oaks
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:14.120]  and that monster is spraying them with insecticide and herbicides and just loving it and he's bought
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:19.160]  all the farmland up and now he's got them he's an owner of monsanto part of it he's rolling out
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  plants that grow in aluminum what a jerk but it's okay he's liberal and tim cooks gay so what
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:32.600]  does it matter if he runs death camps in china i mean he wears a turtleneck he's gay i mean it's
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:40.360]  all right right okay you're superior kill me i love you i mean it's like can we grow up and
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:47.640]  say no to these people can we not go along with our own annihilation and destruction
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:53.080]  by these mad scientists look spend half your time watching football and half your time learning
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:28:00.360]  how they're killing you give me half your time and i think suddenly you're not going to care about
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  tom brady anymore and i'm not against tom brady and and rogers and all of them because they seem
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:11.720]  like patriots but okay they're coming out against the vaccine mask great hey guys how about you
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:19.240]  coming out against it all because we don't have much time left they are killing the soil of the
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:27.160]  planet aluminum doesn't just give you Alzheimer's a very small about of nano size aluminum kills
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:33.640]  the bacteria and the life in the soil they're murdering the earth but they're the environmentalist
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:39.080]  so it's liberal they're doing it to save you from the sun while they kill the earth

[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.000]  peril there's nbc news reporting the chem trails that don't exist
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:02.200]  the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:08.040]  free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:13.320]  trying to create a post-human world for the united states of brazil and of course triggered by the
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:18.600]  briggs in the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:24.520]  that's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build back
[1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:31.080]  better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:36.360]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:42.120]  ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:47.960]  now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't
[1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:53.400]  meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19

[1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:15.640]  alex jones waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:28.760]  so
[1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:39.000]  when i look at rachel mannell or chris haze drooling and hoping for the prospect of my arrest for
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:46.280]  january 6 when they know the federal government stood down they knew there was a thousand federal
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:51.240]  commandos there that watch what happened and watch me try to stop people going into building and
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:57.160]  watch the police stand down when i sit there and see that i don't get mad at rachel mannell
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:03.400]  and chris haze and the rest of those people when i see those clips i realized they're just paid for
[1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:09.080]  mercenary cannon fodder being paid by big pharma and by the power structure on record i mean you
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:16.360]  look at leftist programs even the smaller podcast and youtube channels and they are just flooded
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:25.640]  with black rock and with vanguard and with jp morgan and goldman sacks and raytheon and weapons
[1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:33.960]  makers i mean they are they are working for the man and you know you see people smart enough
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:38.040]  that are already their own person like a bill mar trying to get away from it or a joe rogan
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:44.520]  getting away from it or a tucker carlson getting away from it but then you see the real cannon
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:53.560]  fodder of this and it makes you sad and so i get sent without even looking no matter if it's a
[1:34:53.560 --> 1:35:02.200]  desktop or my phone young turks a bunch of other shows and i even delete my history just so i get
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:09.880]  a fresh thing and it's still the same stuff and i look at it and i watch it and and and so this
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:17.080]  morning i'm sitting there in the bathtub like six a.m drinking a coffee and i got an ipad and i'm
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:23.560]  sitting there and it's just feeding me this so i watched a couple videos and it was like
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:31.720]  the bill back better is paid for and five trillion dollars of spending doesn't create inflation
[1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:37.480]  because it's paid for i mean like two plus two equals five thousand i mean we're talking cuckoo
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:42.120]  land and then i see another clip i click on that and of course you could see all these hosts saying
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:47.640]  the same thing in the same order like all the nightly news things you know sponsored by fizer and
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:53.080]  it's oh we're taking calls of course leftists can't actually take live calls they can't control that
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:58.040]  they might actually get confronted and they can't have that so they they they take calls to an
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:04.760]  answering machine and then on the answering machine they play the clip and it's like i'm so afraid
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:09.560]  the right wingers are going to put us in camps you know they're going to have a dictatorship
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:14.040]  what do we do it's like well we're fighting hard maybe we'll keep them from putting us in camps
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:20.680]  the left works for the big corporations the left is censoring everybody the left is saying arrest
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:24.520]  their opposition the left is now in the news saying republicans shouldn't be able to go to
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:30.760]  college because they're part of a hate group they're pulling down statues of george washington
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:37.720]  and and thomas jefferson and so i saw this clip and i didn't watch this guy when he had my ex wife
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:41.480]  on i didn't see the news feeding it i didn't watch it we normally talks about me because that's
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:47.480]  that's not interesting but i have because in my feed watched it and you hear these talking points
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:53.400]  and you hear the projection you know the republicans are going to put us in camps the republicans
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:58.120]  are going to create a dictatorship and you know what yeah the rhino neocon republicans
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:01.400]  and actually run the democratic party and watch all those wars killing millions of people they
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:06.520]  actually want that i mean the atlantic monthly all these people they they do want to arrest their
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:13.080]  opposition so yeah the republicans like the like the the organizations that are anti
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:19.400]  alice jones anti-free speech there are a bunch of those people like the lincoln project but
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:24.200]  no he's talking specifically about trump people specifically about people like us
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.960]  i mean you never see the left criticizing their leaders i criticize trump all the time i've got
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:35.960]  big problems with him but you hear this and it's it's such a murder of the truth it's such an
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:43.080]  inversion of reality that it makes your head spin and they sit there pathetically wanting to be
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:52.440]  leaders you know trying to win the establishment bootlicker award and pushed by the system and
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:58.040]  and and then the whole system controlling and bullying and dominating and other youtubers oh
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:01.960]  no one's gonna try to make you take a shot now six months later well of course you've got to take
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:09.080]  the shot it's just incredible to watch them sign on to this and to look at the bottom of the barrel
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:10.360]  because even
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.960]  brian williams knew to finally give up had no ratings everyone hated him everybody remembered
[1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:23.800]  he was a liar about being shot down a helicopter but see these people are like ten rows down from
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:28.920]  brian williams and they're never gonna give up because they're all hoping for that slot with
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:35.160]  the 200 000 viewers on msnbc they're all hoping to be a real boy if they could just censor right and
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:41.160]  just twist right it just follow the talking points just right maybe they could be somebody
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:49.240]  and so they want to demoralize us they want to break our will and they're not breaking our
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:55.240]  will the way they think but how pathetic and sad they are does hurt me it really does i mean i would
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:39:00.040]  think they couldn't get anybody to carry this evil out at this point i saw another clip he did
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:04.760]  like i mentioned i started watching three or four of them where he's like it's ridiculous why the
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:10.360]  build back better program is all paid for and trillions of spending doesn't create inflation
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:14.520]  and it's just like yeah pouring gassy on yourself and lighting on fire doesn't do it either i mean
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:24.200]  it's just pathetic that money he's getting won't be worth anything once this program gets in place
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:33.160]  so people like pacman who thinks he's gobbling through our freedoms and winning he's destroying
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:39.240]  his own future he's pretending he's an intellectual he's pretending he's here to save everybody
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:44.680]  he's pretending he's fighting the man and people that want to create a dictatorship when we have
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:50.840]  a corporate big tech censorship surveillance dictatorship in place now debanking millions
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:55.240]  of people and announcing it it wants a civil war and all this crap
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.680]  just the betrayal of humanity the patheticness of it
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.320]  it's just so sad here it is
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.600]  hi david i just heard you say on the stream that if the united states becomes a full-blown
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:21.480]  dictatorship by 2024 yeah you will be leaving the country so i've been thinking about this a lot
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:27.160]  myself and is it by the way stop this back up to the first i'll put the whole two and a minute
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:33.000]  clip we'll go to break them back with us he admits it's a voicemail but he sits there and has a
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:40.440]  conversation with it because again they they won't have anybody live so even that's a deception
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:45.240]  it's like looking at pure deception is it's bizarre it started over started over
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:55.000]  oh you cut the front part off no no no i i i want the front part i want where i want the front part
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:02.520]  uh where where he's like up there okay here's our voice line here's how you call and then we
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:08.360]  censor and decide what we want i mean it's just it's all just like these weird weak people seeking
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:14.680]  power and seeking control and oh there's a dictatorship oh god we better flee to another
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:20.760]  country there's a dictatorship they had a rasmus and poll and a bunch of others where 48 percent
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:27.320]  of democrats want to put unvaccinated camps china is putting people that don't submit to them in
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:35.240]  camps you people are in a biomedical tyranny but again that's what betas do they follow and
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:39.880]  they're scared and they know the system's corrupt and they know it's scary and they go well i'm just
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:45.640]  going to sell out the system and make excuses because i want to be a winner it's like in 300
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:50.360]  where the hunchback goes out and sells them out because he wants to be a general but you're not

[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:29.320]  influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:34.040]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:39.160]  would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:45.000]  sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually

[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:44.920]  nodding with it and talking to it because you're so scared to actually talk to people
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:51.720]  and give them the power of being live that's what the left always claims jones has fake callers
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:56.360]  jones has fake reviews because they're fake because they rig everything because they're
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:02.200]  so scared they got to control it all and then to here because we can show you the rascals and
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.640]  poll nobody wants to put you in a camp that's a democrat nobody wants to arrest you nobody wants
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:13.320]  to have political prisoners no no no no no no no no that's the republicans that support trump
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:16.520]  trump who are the ragtag group trying to get back control the country
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:23.480]  but could we get marshal out of republicans absolutely could that party be just as bad
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:28.680]  with neocons running it yes but the neocons are allied with the democrats they're the ones
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:34.120]  pushing all this on record here it is we have a voicemail number that number is two one nine
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:40.360]  two david p here's a voicemail i received with a very practical question about if it came time
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:44.280]  to leave the country would you still be able to leave the country to get a very good question
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:50.120]  hi david i just heard you say on the stream that if the united states becomes a full blown
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:57.000]  dictatorship by 2024 yeah you will be leaving the country so i've been thinking about this a lot
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:04.200]  myself and is it too late if you wait until it's a full blown dictatorship will you even be able
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:09.320]  to leave the country if you're that concerned about it happening should you be making plans to
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:15.320]  leave before it goes full blown dictatorship yeah this is a fair question which is our hit pause
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:18.840]  back in five seconds i'm not gonna edit this i want you to hear it in its congruity
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.000]  they admit and i've played the clips from the devils group that you and all of it that it's a
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:31.880]  world id where you won't be able to travel leave your house quote one half foot if you don't have
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:36.520]  the vaccine passport and i have a whole stack of articles i'll show you about that and they're
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:42.360]  saying that that republicans are the ones that pass the law to put put kill switches in all the
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:49.720]  cars which is now law and i mean the republicans are horrible weak pathetic cowardly folks on average
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:54.200]  i don't like them but but they're not the people in the driver's seat like the democrats and imagine
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  though this fear porn though the trump supporters are going to have a dictatorship are you kidding
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.960]  towards soros has got almost every district attorney and attorney general under his control
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:13.880]  and you sit there and act like you're not the establishment that is a lie on its face
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:22.520]  continue with this garbage this is a fair question which is like if things completely
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:29.080]  changed overnight in the us and all of a sudden no one was allowed to leave the plan of saying
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:34.840]  i will stay if and until it gets really bad doesn't work because if it got so bad you
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:40.760]  wouldn't be allowed to leave i don't you know what when we talk about the canadian political
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:44.760]  scientists who said the us could be back in five seconds you know exactly no no you'll say
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:50.120]  you've got the media you've got the universities you've got the military you've got the banks
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:55.560]  you've got hollywood and you're po you're like hey don't worry you don't need to leave we're
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:51:01.240]  raping america really good we got drag queen story time going on okay we got the evaluation of the
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:06.920]  dollar we got cloured pivot we're gutting this bitch we're revolutionaries we're alpha males
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:14.200]  we're going to screw this country like a tide billy go that's a little translation the exhilaration
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:18.840]  of joining with evil the exhilaration of joining with the un the exhilaration of joining with claus
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:24.920]  schwaab the exhilaration of you're a team player you get lots of money now let's continue bus could
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:31.000]  be a dictatorship by 2030 or whatever else the case may be i believe that will it would be a continued
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:36.360]  slow slide in that direction and i am counting on the the more projection that's what they're
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:42.280]  doing to us that i would have time to get out if such a time came now would i if it's so slow
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:46.520]  that the frog doesn't realize it's getting burned right total protection would i know when it's
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:50.760]  time to leave these are all fair questions but i don't think it would be like an overnight no more
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:56.840]  plus yeah so they're doing this to us classical corporate takeover censorship demanking arrest
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:03.000]  tyranny collapsing and then he's talking about them as victims talk about talk about a fantasy
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:08.280]  talk about a simulation he's in his own but he knows it's not a simulation he loves this for
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:15.400]  his little groveling followers that actually drink this kool-aid let's continue but maybe some people
[1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:20.520]  in the audience uh have a different perspective on the bonus show today we will talk about the

[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:31.880]  to fund themselves is bad if i was telling my children who not to be it's that guy i mean
[1:52:31.880 --> 1:52:37.320]  he's a disgrace and i don't say that like god i feel good about myself no he makes me feel pathetic
[1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:46.840]  look at those eyes man that that's that that dude is gone ladies and gentlemen thank you're
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:52.760]  lucky stars every day you're not dav pacman
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:59.560]  look at that that is a freaking predator right there who thinks he's smarter than you
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:01.880]  thinks he's better than you and he's gonna beat you he thinks
[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:08.280]  no joe rogan and bill marr they're all smarter than you big man
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:15.960]  man because you know they've they've played both sides but now they know who's gonna win
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:18.440]  you're on the wrong side of history
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:26.840]  and i'm so sorry for what's gonna happen to you by your own decisions
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:37.080]  but he's an archetype a sample out of the fetid latrine or cesspool that is the system
[1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:44.840]  is that's the vanguard that's the that's the stay behind network that's the scorched earth
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:53.960]  leaving as they've got as as the globalist back off to armored fortresses and and and dig into
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:58.840]  their underground bases literally you think the people that have the underground bases call
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:05.880]  up people like pacman no pacman never talked to the new world order pacman never got tried to
[1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:11.640]  get hired by the kiss of your group because pacman's a loser he's a sellout he's not a real man
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:17.160]  he's not a knight at the round table he didn't actually have a real discussion
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:23.720]  with the power structure he worships see i said no to the evil power structure not because i was a
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:29.960]  hero because i had god i had a connection to the infinite i knew this was a failure this was not good
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:35.720]  i didn't join with god and justice because i was a good person i did it because i had discernment
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:42.920]  and wanted to be with god mr pacman is not with god
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:50.280]  and he is everything you don't want to be all right i'm done talking about it
[1:54:52.920 --> 1:55:01.320]  i got a clip here i want to play that is important listen to this the canadian broadcasting company
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:07.480]  state run controlled by trudeau says that without any evidence the russians are in control of the
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.040]  trucker convoy you know they don't want to take forced injections of an mrna experimental shot
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:16.760]  they don't want to stay locked up with their houses until they can't have their neighbors over
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:22.600]  they don't want to live under martial law so because they want freedom the russians are in
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:27.720]  control that's right because see the globalists know their weaknesses they're a foreign multinational
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.720]  corporate takeover it's like well we're a foreign takeover what do we do well jones is trying to
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:36.200]  expose claus schwaab the un takeover people can galvanize against us we'll just say it's the russians
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:39.800]  because we're all chinese agents on the globalist side you know they're saying so let's just say
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:44.840]  we're russians because the russians don't have their act together we can bully them again and that's
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:54.680]  it so here's the cbc the canadian broadcasting system company telling you the russians that's
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:59.880]  wrong you stand on the cold you drive your truck and do us you didn't do that yourself the russians
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:07.320]  were in control of your mind here it is you know given canada support of ukraine in this current
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:14.840]  crisis with russia i don't know if it's far-fetched ask but but there is concern that russian actors
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:21.160]  could be continuing to fuel things as this as this protest grows but perhaps even instigating it from
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:28.920]  from the outset well again i'm gonna defer to our partners in the public safety the trained
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:34.280]  of officials and experts in that area so so that's like saying little green men from mars could be
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:40.600]  doing it or maybe unicorns are doing it or maybe witches on brooms i mean give me a break the russians
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:44.440]  have the biggest country in the world they can't even run their own country they're under globalist attack
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:50.760]  but they're not getting into the new world order in the hollywood pedophiles and that's why the
