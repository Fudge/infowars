[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.000]  Well that's what the globalists and the Democrats and the deep state and the World Economic Forum
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  and Klaus Schwab and so many more would like to see and that's Infowars flatlining.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  Infowars life functions terminated.
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  But we're still here, myself, the great crew and you all in this together.
[01:02.000 --> 01:09.000]  Now Owen Shroyer here one more day for Alex Jones, he will be back today most likely after the show
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  but we may be hearing from Alex before the end of the show as major developments in the Sandy Hook case
[01:20.000 --> 01:33.000]  in Connecticut where the judge has just suspended attorney Norm Paddis for six months
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  allegedly for conduct she didn't like during the Sandy Hook trial.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  Now this is more interesting than just dealing with Sandy Hook or Alex Jones attorney Norm Paddis
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  because Norm also represents me I was due in court later this month so that's going to throw a wrench into my legal defense
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  with my two ongoing cases arrested for supporting Trump.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  Total Democrat persecution in my view so it looks like that's going to affect me as well not to mention
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  the numerous other January 6 defendants that Norm Paddis is currently in the middle of trial defending with jury selection
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  ongoing the likes of Joe Biggs and others.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  Now did that play into this decision I guess you're just going to have to make up your own mind on that.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  But there you go, Alex Jones attorney Norm Paddis suspended law license for six months he is appealing it
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  he is in trial and court cases right now he's a very busy attorney defending more than just Alex Jones
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  and really I mean I don't want to put words in Norm's mouth I mean I would consider Norm a classical liberal
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  in the sense that he supports free speech in the sense that he doesn't like big government corruption
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  running people's lives ruining people's lives.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  But that's just a quick take on that from me we may be hearing from Alex on that before the end of the day
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  I don't know about hearing from Norm considering he's going to be pretty busy today not just with his ongoing trials
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  but dealing with this suspension that came down today so that's big news we'll be continuing to cover it
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  at infowars.com and I can't belabor that story because I've got so much other important news developing today
[03:31.000 --> 03:42.000]  obviously 0 for 11 McCarthy now all signs point to 0 for 12 incoming whenever they decide to run that gambit again
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  and it looks like it'll be starting here just momentarily but I'll just tell you it's going to be 0 for 12
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  so this is going to be hilarious to watch but there's other news developing there
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  and like I said it's amazing to just sit here and watch this play out and it couldn't be more obvious
[04:01.000 --> 04:11.000]  and I suppose to the same voices that were anti-Trump in 2015 and 2016 using virtually the same rhetoric
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  basically oh if you support Trump and you don't support Bush or whatever they were wanting at the time
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  the country's over it's a doomsday scenario worst thing ever Trump will destroy the country
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  the exact same threats that the exact same people were telling us about Trump are now the exact same people
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  and the exact same threats telling us if we don't get McCarthy it's a doomsday scenario
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  then there's the issue of this whole January 6th anniversary nonsense that we'll be getting into as well
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  they are going to milk this cow forever I mean they tell you January 6th is worse than September 11th
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  so of course they're going to be doing their ceremonies and their grandstanding
[04:52.000 --> 05:21.000]  and folks we've got other big news today it is a loaded transmission absolutely loaded
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  everybody should be on Vitaminal Fusion and DNA Force Plus
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  just look at DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ tenant so much more
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  document it to clean out your cells, your mitochondria
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  take your amuses from the next level and even have your telomeres that's your DNA last longer
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  this is the opposite of what the globalists are doing with their poison shots
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  this is actually giving your body the tools it needs to regenerate
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  get DNA Force Plus and Vitaminal Fusion for a limited time for 50% off
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  you've got until next Monday and your purchase supports the broadcast

[05:57.000 --> 06:22.000]  and keep us on air infowarstore.com
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  I'm not feeling pressure with all the major news breaking today
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  filling in for Alex Jones I feel blessed I feel excited
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  and I'm honored to be here with you today on this Friday January 6th 2023
[06:37.000 --> 06:44.000]  and I ask God for the vision and the strength and the patience and the clarity
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  to be super effective in this important transmission today
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  and there's about four or five stories that are just of the utmost importance
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  that any other day would be the top story you'd spend all three hours on it
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  in a three hour transmission or it's going to be four hour transmission today
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  I'll be doing all four hours and you'd spend all four hours on that
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  maybe take calls get special guests but there's like four or five stories
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  maybe even six quite frankly that have reached that level of importance
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  that I'm really going to have to be doing my best work here today
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  so I just ask God to give me the vision and the strength and the clarity
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.000]  to be ultimately effective transmitting this news to you live
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  here on the Alex Jones show Owen Troy filling in Alex will be back today
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  we may even be hearing from him live on the show
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  so where do I begin let's just briefly lay out the big stories
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  now I mentioned the big story with Norm Pattis Alex Jones attorney
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  my attorney other January 6 defendants who are in trial right now their attorney
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  he's just been suspended by the Connecticut judge
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  from the Sandy Hook case
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  now think what you want about that
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.000]  that just went down this morning legitimate illegitimate
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  persecution politically driven I'll leave that up to you
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  maybe we'll hear from Alex or Norm sometime
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  but Norm obviously busy and Alex as well trying to get back into the office
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  and back to work
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  but I can't even belabor that big story today because here we go again
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Kevin McCarthy is about to lose a seventh excuse me a 12th seventh please
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  seventh seventh wasn't embarrassing enough for him
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  he's going to go for 12 today
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  and according to his own words he could be over a hundred by the end of the month
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  he'll be he'll be all for 100
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  I mean if they do three to if they do if they do four votes a day for the rest of the month
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  and McCarthy doesn't lose in McCarthy loses every time he's going to be all for 100
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  sorry I'm laughing it's just hilarious
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  but but okay we'll have that and here's what I'm going to do
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  and really I should maybe try to do this in the first segment if I can if I can't
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  we'll come back and do it immediately in the next segment
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  there are four big issues right now
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  there's Kevin Pelosi McCarthy
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.000]  four big issues right now that are Pelosi's rules that Kevin McCarthy wants to keep intact
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  that the 20 Republican holdouts want to get rid of
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  now I'll tell you those four rules and why it's so important
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  which to me just proves that Kevin McCarthy is doing the bidding of the deep state
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  he would have conceded on these four issues if he was really working to make America great again
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.000]  if he was really working for a non-swamp favoring rule book for the 118th Congress
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  so we're going to get into the importance of that as the 12th vote begins
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  but we also have this whole January 6th ceremony
[09:56.000 --> 10:06.000]  remembrance like at September 11th phenomenon that needs to be addressed
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  and there's going to be a bit of a
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  I'll admit that it's going to seem
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  a little bit inconsistent here with my coverage today
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  dealing with what the Democrats did this morning
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  versus what the Republicans are about to do
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  keeping Kevin McCarthy away from the speaker position in the gavel for the 12th time
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  where I'm going to point out the Democrat unification
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  and say see this is what Republicans never do
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  but then also going to be supporting the fact that Republicans aren't unifying for Kevin McCarthy
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  so I'll admit there's maybe even a double standard coming from me today
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  but is it really double standard if I see it and admit it
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  and then explain why I feel that way
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  we will
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  but what the Democrats did on the Capitol steps today is just disgusting
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  and every single one of those Democrats that took part in that ceremony
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  know they were lying
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  know that they lied to the American people about January 6th
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  and Brian Sicknick and all the other stuff
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  and it's quite frankly it's beyond insulting
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  you know I'm not the family of Ashley Babbitt
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  I'm not the family of Roseanne Boylan
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  I'm not actually family with the people that died on January 6th
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  but it's funny that the Democrats get up there talking about people that died on January 6th
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  and the violence
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  all the people that died on January 6th were Trump supporters
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  but they don't tell you that
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Trump supporters killed by police
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  they don't tell you that
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  I mean think about it's
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  it's numbing
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  it's mind-numbing
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  that for years
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  Democrats will have massive displays
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  massive ceremonies telling you how bad cops are
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  specifically after a policeman kills an unarmed person
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  like George Floyd
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  which I'm not even saying that was the case
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  I believe it was the drug overdose that led to George Floyd's cardiac arrest
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  as the autopsy said
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  but the mainstream media lies and continues to lie about it
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  fine
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  but see the point is that Democrats will have these words
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  the point is that Democrats will have these massive grandiose displays
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  saying how police officers kill unarmed Americans
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  and then they'll riot for months on end
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  and justify it because of the police behavior
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  but then with their January 6th ceremonies
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  where it was police officers that killed five unarmed people
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  or four unarmed people that day
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  and then they get up there and they have a ceremony celebrating it
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  but it's worse than that
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  I'll explain coming up
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  now you've got the issue where
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  and look I took a lot of flak for this
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  I had callers calling in and disagreeing with me
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  and that's perfectly fine I am perfectly okay with that
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  but I said I believe that it was the hit that caused the cardiac event
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  on the football field on Monday night
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  that could have potentially been made worse with the vaccine
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  I still don't know his vaccine status
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  they still haven't made any public statements
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  as far as that's concerned
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  but after the doctors that were working on him made their statement yesterday
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  and then follow up reports from other doctors who weren't working on him
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  but are going on TV doing interviews pretending like they know
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  and they're all saying the same thing
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  nothing to do with the vaccine
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  nothing to do with the vaccine
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  don't talk about the vaccine
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  well wait a second
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  if you come out
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  and you're honest
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  and the truth of the matter
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  is that DeMar Hamlin did not get a COVID-19 vaccine
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  then fine
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  go on air and say
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  the COVID-19 vaccine had nothing to do with this
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  because he didn't get it
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  but they're not saying that are they
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  all they're saying
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  is that it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 vaccine
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  but they don't tell you that's because he didn't get it
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  now at this point
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  at this point because you see here's the difference
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  I didn't come on air and say
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  that this was because of the COVID-19 vaccine
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  because I don't know if he's been vaccinated
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  I can sit here and I can point to
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  thousands of other cardiac events
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  we did whole gigantic news reports and compilations
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  of hundreds of other athletes that we know got the vaccine
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  and that we know had a cardiac problem
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  and others where we know of kids that died after getting the vaccine
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  where they admitted the vaccine killed them
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  so I've got all the cases that show
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  the COVID-19 vaccine has killed tens of thousands of people
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  that's according to the own government records
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  there is no debate there
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  just lies and propaganda and denial
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  but see I wouldn't say
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  that the COVID-19 caused the cardiac arrest
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  because I don't know his vaccination status
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  so tell me why
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  a doctor, multiple doctors
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  would go on TV and tell you
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  and say in utmost authority and confidence
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  that this has nothing to do with the COVID-19 vaccine
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  even though they do not tell you
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  whether or not he's been vaccinated
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  if you said he never took a COVID-19 vaccine
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  therefore this couldn't have been caused by the vaccine
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  then fine, fair enough
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  but they don't do that
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  they just say don't ask about the vaccine
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  don't ask about the vaccine status
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  and this had nothing to do with the vaccine
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  stop talking about it
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  well I'll tell you what
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  the minute that you can show us
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  the proof that he never took the vaccine
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  then people will stop talking
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  about this being related to the vaccine
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  and we can have the other debate
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  about the future of football
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  but they just say don't ask
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  don't tell, nothing to do with the vaccine
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  really did he get the vaccine?
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  hmm, seems like it would matter
[15:56.000 --> 16:25.000]  for you to say it had nothing to do with it
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  well, that's what we're talking about
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  because they're also some of our best selling products
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  and we don't have them, we can't find the operation

[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  but that's just where we're at

[20:06.000 --> 20:26.000]  it's Alex Jones
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  and you know what's interesting about
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  this process now as we're
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  on day four of it
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  is
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  not just the futility
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  that we continue to see exercise
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  we understand that now
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  what's interesting is
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  we started to yesterday
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  get a better idea into what
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  the major
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  issues were as far as why the holdouts
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  will not vote for McCarthy
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  and so we're gonna get into that here in a second
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  but what's odd is
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  that's not getting the focus
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  of all of these speeches on the floor
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  and of all of these speeches trying to say
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  why we need McCarthy or don't
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  or people just taking the stand
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  to make their own points
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  nobody's really getting into the issues
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  of the matter which is odd to me
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  and even when they go on TV
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  many are not really
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  discussing the issues either
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  I don't
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  understand that
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  but that has been the case
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  and while the Republican
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  holdouts have still with another night
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  all been on message all been on point
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  all been unwavering all been effective
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  the one thing I think that's lacking here
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  is a proper
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  explanation of
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  why they're holding out and when you get
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  an explanation into that
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  I think it'll make more sense
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  and so I was looking
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  into that yesterday and I have a better idea now
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  of what is the situation
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  let's start with
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  two of them that are extremely important
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  and these are Pelosi rules
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  by the way
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  that Pelosi made
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  and one is
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  a single
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  member of the House
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  can step up and basically has the power
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  to remove Speaker
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  the Speaker of the House
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  and
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  Pelosi changed that, that rule
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  had been in for a while, Pelosi changed that
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  so I think that it had to be four
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  or I don't remember the exact number
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  but she basically made it a lot harder
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  to get an ouster of the Speaker
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  well of course Pelosi wants that
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  she likes centralized power
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  and she knew she had the gavel
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  and she wanted to make sure she maintained it
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  especially considering
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  the heat that was put on her
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  from AOC and the squad
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  ahead of the vote for Speaker
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  where they were going to do a little holdout like this
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  but basically they caved
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  before it went down
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  then Pelosi made the rule so that not a single
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  Pelosi removed
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  McCarthy won't concede that
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  but it makes sense doesn't it
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  if the Speaker of the House
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  is no longer doing the will of the Republican Party
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  or the Speaker of the House has got out of line
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  or the Speaker of the House isn't doing the will of the people
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  then one person can step up
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  and have the ouster begin
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  why doesn't McCarthy want that
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  that's pretty important
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  here's another one
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  of utmost importance
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  and this might even be bigger
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  than the last one
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  campaign funding
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  of the primaries
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  the holdouts
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  want to stop the major Republican
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  super PACs
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  and donor class and the GOP
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  from getting involved
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  in primary funding
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  why well isn't the why obvious
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  and when you realize how obvious the why is
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  then you realize how obvious it is
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  why they don't
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  they don't
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  want that to stop
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  why would the Republican Party
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  want to be involved in the
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  campaign financing of the primaries
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  so desperately
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  well isn't it obvious didn't we just see why
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  in the midterms
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  because they get involved
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  in the primary process
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  they can make sure
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  that people they hope
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  like people like Joe Kent and others
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  can't even get past the primary process
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  so the Republicans
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  will get to hand pick
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  from the very beginning
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  who they want in office
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  with their funding
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  so does that make sense so
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  if you have two candidates coming up
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  let's say in Washington like Joe Kent
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  it's a
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  it's a damn shame we don't have congressman Joe Kent
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  but the Republicans didn't help with that and they're glad
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  they want to keep that trend continuing
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  so the Republicans can come in and they can say
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  okay here's the primary process
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  who's going to do our bidding
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  who's going to cave to our will
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  who can we control
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  and when they have that answer or they'll just select their person
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  and insert them into any race they want
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  and then they have the power of the purse
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  of their hundreds of millions of dollars
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  which they all brag about Kevin McCarthy raising
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  every time whether it's Dan Crenshaw
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  or all these other people that go on television
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  and tell you how great McCarthy is
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  and that's how much money he raises
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  what does that do for you at home just curious
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  McCarthy raising a bunch of money
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  does that help you at home
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  do you really care about that is that your biggest priority
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  not saying it's not important
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  but so that's what the Republican Party wants
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  they want to be able to control
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  the primary process
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  and so you may notice this
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  the nice way of going after politicians
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  you don't like
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  and it's probably the more professional way
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  and sometimes I slip off on this
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  and you know I'll resort to name calling
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  and insults and I try not to do that
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  but you know you get with a guy like Dan Crenshaw
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  you can't help yourself
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  but the polite professional way is to say
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  okay we're going to primary you
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  right
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  instead of just coming out and saying Dan Crenshaw
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  this guy sucks
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  I patch McCain
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  you just say wow Dan you've really embarrassed yourself
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  and you've really shown
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  the people that you don't care about
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  the country
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  without the DC establishment and elites
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  we're going to primary you
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  well that's a threat
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  because in the primary process
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  there's more of a level playing field
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  but if the Republicans are involved
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  in the financing of it
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  well then all of a sudden one guy
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  can get 10 million dollars in the primary process
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  and then the other guy or gal
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  is forced
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  to do fundraising on their own
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  which is obviously a lot harder
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  when running a campaign
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  to get the millions of dollars in fundraising
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  so in the primary process
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  if you know you've got millions of dollars
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  from the Republicans you can focus on your campaign
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  they'll pay for all your ads
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  they'll pay for all your events
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  and you don't even have to worry about campaign fundraising
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  so you see why that's so important
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  why won't McCarthy concede on that
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  because he loves the power of the purse
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  he gets all the DC elite
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  money
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  and he wants the ability to dole it out as he sees fits
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  and if that harms people
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  like
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Joe Kent
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  then they don't care because they don't like Joe Kent
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  they don't want him in there
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  he would be probably another holdout
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  against McCarthy so you see how that works
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  they also want to vote
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  on term limits
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  this is a more minor issue to me
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  quite frankly I think it goes both ways
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  I can see why term limits are a good thing
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  you look at someone like Nancy Pelosi
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  Chuck Schumer there's your argument for term limits
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  but it goes both ways
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  look at Rand Paul
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  you want Rand Paul to not be able to keep
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  running and getting into office
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  not to mention
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  if you have term limits
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  who ends up really running things in congress
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  well a lot of these staffers
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  the staffers can be there for decades and decades
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  and some of these new people get in
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  and if you don't have anybody there that's long in the tooth
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  you're kind of looking around for help
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  maybe not knowing what to do
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  and then the staffers end up running everything
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  so I think that one's a give and take
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  they also want a stricter border
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  they want a fair tax act
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  and then the other big one is
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  they want a balanced budget
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  is what they say
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  but really here's the practical exercise
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  it's that
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  they want new rules
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  when it comes to these bills
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  you can't
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  have a bill land on your desk
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  with 48 hours left
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  to approve it
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  so they're going to get rid of that
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  they haven't really proposed an exact time
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  but really the number should be at least
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  two weeks
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  it should be a two week minimum
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  if you're going to put a bill on my desk
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  plus they want single vote, single issue
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  appropriations bills as well
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  so this massive bill doesn't come out with 100 things on it
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  that they don't even know about
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  this is the opposite of what the globalists are doing
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  with their poison shots
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  this is actually giving your body the tools it needs
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  to regenerate
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  get DNA Force Plus

[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  it's Alex Jones
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  and now your host Owen shroyer
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  isn't that really what it's all about
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  we're sick of government lies
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  we're sick of government corruption
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  same thing with the media
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  use itself as the government
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  it does I mean can't you see that
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  by the arrogance that they go on TV at night
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  you better vote McCarthy
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  against a hostage situation
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  when nobody wants McCarthy
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  when you talk to the average American
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  that votes Republican you talk to the average conservative
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  nobody wants McCarthy
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  only the swamp
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  only the deep state and now we know why
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  because it's tyranny it's centralized power
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  they want Kevin McCarthy to have centralized power
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  without the ability to remove him
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  if he's not acting well
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  they want the ability to put a thousand page bill on your desk
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  and you get one night to read it
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  with 100 different issues in it
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  and then the one issue and it's like funding veterans
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  or something then if you don't vote for it
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  so they want one issue bills
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  one vote one issue bills
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  they want time to read gigantic spending bills
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  they want
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  to get the Republican Party and all the big money
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  out of the primary process
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  for a more fair primary process
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  so we can primary swamp creatures
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  like Dan Crenshaw
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  who's really just
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  really disgraced himself this week
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  as if
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  I mean he was already like hanging by a thread
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  just hanging
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  by a thread
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  of any public support
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  from the conservative Republican community
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  that's all gone now he's completely broke
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  and so
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  I hope I did a good job in the last segment laying out
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  the issues that the holdouts have
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  but in case I didn't do a good enough job
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Matt Gaetz
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  has just stepped up to the podium
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  and he is speaking right now
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  and so here is Matt Gaetz explaining why
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  I suspect the 20 holdouts
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  will once again not vote for McCarthy
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  here it is
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  several believe
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  that one earns the position
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  of speaker by
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  raising enormous sums of money
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  and there is no doubt that
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  the individual that was nominated
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  by Mr. Garcia is
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  the LeBron James of Special
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Interest Fundraising in this town
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  there is nobody better but I would suggest
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  that there are qualifications
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  for speaker that are far more important
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  there are attributes that are far more important
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  Jim Jordan has those
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  and I am submitting
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  his name for nomination at this time
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  I heard my colleague
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  from California Mr. Garcia say
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  that we seek pure selfless intent
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  and I could not agree more
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  with that assessment
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  Mr. Jordan indeed
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  is reflective of pure
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  selfless intent
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  I don't know that the same can be said
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  for the Republican alternative
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  let's start with purity
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  many of you
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  have seen the reports that there are
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  negotiations to determine whether or not
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  on this side of the aisle there can be a deal
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  a meeting of the minds
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  a grand bargain that would allow us to
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  proceed with the speakership
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  and I want all of my colleagues to know
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  regardless of your perspective on me
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  how
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  impure some of those negotiations
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  have gone and I want the country to know
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  the principal goal
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  of the people who are objecting
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  to Mr. McCarthy on the Republican side
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  is that we don't believe the rules
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  of this place unlock
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  the potential of all of the members
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  to be able to cast votes
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  on individual bills and to offer
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  amendments on appropriations
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  acts and we're also concerned
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  about spending that has ballooned
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  our debt and borrowed
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  against the future generations
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  of American citizens
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  and Mr. McCarthy said well goodness to
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  the objectors why do you want to be
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  on the oversight and judiciary committee
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  and you never submit your names to be on the
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  rules committee or the appropriations
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  committee and so gosh if you'll get a list
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  of folks who are willing to come early
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  on fly in days for rules
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  and folks who are willing to take on
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  the extra burden of our appropriators
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  who work so hard then
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  I'll certainly work to do that and so
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  we endeavored in good faith
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and pure good faith to create
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  that list and then what did Mr.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  McCarthy do he went out to the media
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  and came to other members of the conference
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  and said see they just want jobs for themselves
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  that is
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  not pure
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  selflessness
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  selflessness is not
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  selling shares of yourself
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  to the lobby core and then doing their
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  bidding at the expense of the
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  American people
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  but there certainly is
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  intent and it's
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  an intent driven almost exclusively
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  by personal ambition
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and that ambition is paralyzing
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  the house now
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  Madam clerk at this time there is great trust
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  in Mr. Jordan and that's why
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  I am nominating him and there is
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  insufficient trust in Kevin McCarthy
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  there are some
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  who have been objecting to Mr. McCarthy
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  who are working on perhaps
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  changes to the rules changes
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  to circumstance that would
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  convert the speakership from
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  the great awesome
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  powerful position it is now to
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  more of a ceremonial position
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  almost akin to the speaker
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  in the British House of Commons
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  I referred to it previously as a straight
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  jacket that some of us were trying
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  to construct with better rules
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  and better personnel because we do
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  not trust Mr. McCarthy
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  with power because
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  we know who he will use it for
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  and we are concerned it will not be
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  for the American people we trust
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Jim Jordan I nominate him
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  I think that is about as well said
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  as it can be right there for Matt Gaetz
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  now the vote is under way
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  it's just begun I don't think
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  anything changes here folks I have no
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  reason to believe anything changes
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  I don't know if the votes
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  for somebody other than
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  McCarthy will be the number 20
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  as they have been in the past but
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  I still believe McCarthy won't get
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  the votes
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  do we want to go to this floor and
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Boebert now guys too let's pick up
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  the audio of Boebert here quickly
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  who unanimously was elected
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  as chairman whom I believe
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  can unite this
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  republican conference
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  and put forward
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  the agenda that we all promise
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  to work hard on and serve
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  our American people to the best of
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  our abilities with I believe that
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  Kevin Hearn will be a fighter
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  for our national debt
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  I get texts on a regular basis at how
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  inflation is hurting families
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  how grocery prices
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  are skyrocketing
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  he has crafted
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  a budget that balances
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  and will bring that to the floor
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  to help the American people
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  Madam Clerk I nominate
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  Kevin Hearn as speaker thank you
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  so you've got Hearn, you've got Jordan
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  they'll get some votes I don't know if
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Donald's will get some votes but I guess it will be
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  20 again I don't know if anybody's flipping yet
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  and I will say this
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  you know
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  actually I got a lot of messages
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  people saying hey I've emailed
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  my congressman I've emailed my representative
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  I've sent them a message I've called their offices
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  and told them please stop
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  voting McCarthy and so I imagine
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  that they're being inundated at this point
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  with messages, emails, phone calls
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  telling them not to vote for McCarthy
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  so much so I think a lot of them
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  have just decided we're not answering emails anymore
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  they told their staff don't even respond anymore
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  and
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  and people were calling in
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  and I mean it's kind of a weird
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  scenario because you're dealing with
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  infowars that is like
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  right here live I mean this is as
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  live and transparent
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  and connected to you
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  the audience like this is
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  all of us I'm up here behind the microphone
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and we got the crew in here switch in and run the cameras
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  everything but this is a live
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  show that it
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  consists of millions of people
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  and so people
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  were calling in yesterday because that's what we do
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  we're open here everybody gets to talk
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  it's like the real congress here
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  and people are calling in
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  and we were hoping to get Marjorie Taylor Green on yesterday
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  saying you need to ask this you need to say this
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  you need to do this which of course
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  probably is why she didn't come on
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  I'm not blaming the audience for that
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  that's what we do here we're open we talk
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  and I don't know that that's the case but basically
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  you know we never got Marjorie Taylor Green on
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  and her staff put answering our calls
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  and I would always say even when the callers were skeptical
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  I'd say look I like Marjorie Taylor Green
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  I think she's a good person
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  she has her reasons for voting
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  for McCarthy again
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  hopefully she can come on and explain it
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  never came on but I will say
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  if Marjorie votes for McCarthy
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  again today
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  that's just a little concerning at this point to me
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  again I'm not saying I'm not
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  changing tune
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  on my general
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  perspective from Marjorie Taylor Green
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  I still think she's a good person
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  I still think she's one of the good guys
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I don't think she's controlled opposition
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  as others have suggested
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  and others have made even
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  more aggressive suggestions about Marjorie Taylor Green
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  this week
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  I'm not on that board
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  but I will say at this point
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  why has Marjorie Taylor Green not changed her vote
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  why is she so loyal to Kevin McCarthy
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  I really at this point don't understand it
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  I would like to give you an explanation
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  now would be the day to switch your vote Marjorie
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  now would be the day to say
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  look I was loyal to Kevin
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  I wanted to be part of this Republican Party
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  that got behind Kevin
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  it's not working and so I'm not going to be voting for
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  Kevin McCarthy today
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  we'll see if that's the story but I doubt it
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  taping this important announcement
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  on the afternoon of Thursday January 5th
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  2023
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  and that means you've only got four days to act
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  if you want to get a vitamin mental fusion
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  and DNA Force Plus
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  both at 50% off
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  next Monday the products are going back to full price
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  because they're close to selling out
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  and we won't have more back in stock for months
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  everybody should be on vitamin mental fusion
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  and DNA Force Plus
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  just look at DNA Force Plus with the PQQ
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  and the CoQ tenant so much more
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  you're documented to clean out your cells
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  you're mitochondria take your abuses from the next level
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  and even have your telomeres
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  that your DNA lasts longer
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  this is the opposite of what the globalists are doing
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  with their poison shots
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  this is actually giving your body the tools it needs
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  to regenerate
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  get DNA Force Plus
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  and vitamin mental fusion for a limited time
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  for 50% off
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  you've got until next Monday
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  and your purchase supports the broadcast
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  keep us on air
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  please take action now for your own wellness and your own health
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  and keep us on air
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  infowarstore.com
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  so when I first started taking survival skills
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  basically I was 275 pounds
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  I was barely holding on to a job
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  so the first one I got was the original
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  survival shield the X1
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  you came out with that too you had with a deep
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  burden source you know and I got really excited about that
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  so I took it and man in two weeks
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  I went from brain fog
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  to like literally like my brain
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  was enlightened you know I could think
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  again I could connect with people
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  again and over the course of
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  the next couple of years I got my health back
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  and I religiously take basically all
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  of your supplements they're all
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  recently is knockout literally
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  it works but anyway so the point is

[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  free of the globalist system and the only

[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  eggs as well and they're excellent
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  they're all different formulas
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  but this one is particularly the
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  strongest one we have
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  so John and Al
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  sold out for more than five months

[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  of the new world order
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  it's alex jones
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  all right the vote is underway
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  we have had one
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  interesting development here byron donalds
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  has switched his vote back
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  to kevin mccarthy
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  bobert bishop
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  and i forget the others
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  and gates just
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  so four other votes right now
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  bishop bobert gates the other name
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  skipped my head right now
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  but donalds switches his vote
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  back to mccarthy
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  now i want to get ahead of another thing
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  as lauren bobert
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  puts this message out last night
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  we're not because this is all the
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  naysayers to the 20 republican holdouts
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  you're just making a point you're just grandstanding
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  you just want clicks you just want campaign donations
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  i don't believe that for a second to be the case
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  lauren bobert says we're not making a point
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  we're making a change i agree
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  and i would just say this to get ahead of an issue here
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  to the republicans
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  and i hope that they can get this
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  message some way or another
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  obviously they're voting right now
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  but
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  to the republican holdouts
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  if mccarthy does
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  end up becoming speaker
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  without the concession somehow
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  even if he becomes speaker today
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  or next week
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  and we don't get all the concessions that we want
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  that are common sense stuff
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  do not put your tail behind your legs
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  do not feel ashamed
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  do not feel embarrassed because
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  you've already been given the next winning
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  argument platform
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  if mccarthy wins
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  the republican holdouts
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  need to come out and make a joint statement
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  and just say hey look
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  we tried to do something for the american people
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  we tried to finally get some change
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  instituted in dc
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  and we failed to swamp one again
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  so here's our message to the american people
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  watch as dc
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  specifically conservatives and republicans
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  watch
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  as dc politics
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  doesn't change at all
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  with kevin mccarthy as speaker
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  it's beautiful it's perfect
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  because now you've put the onus
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  back on the gop
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  and back on kevin mccarthy
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  to actually at least
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  pretend like they care about the american people
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  and they won't
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  and you'll see politics as usual in dc
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  and you'll see massive amnibus
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  spending bills with less than 24 hours to read them
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  and you'll see primary funding
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  going to the deep state swamp
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  nominations not the grassroots
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  conservatives
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  and it'll just be the same thing in dc
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and so
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  i just hope that if mccarthy does
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  end up getting beyond the threshold here
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  that the republicans don't
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  hide and quiver but instead stand tall
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  and say okay hey we put forth
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  a good faith effort we tried to do something
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  to get some change finally in dc
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  it failed now you watch your government
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  business as usual they'll
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  add trillions to the debt
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  they'll do nothing about the border
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  they'll primary grassroots conservatives
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  out of the process and dc will continue
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  to dominate the rest of the country so
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  enjoy it watch it we tried to stop it
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  we failed we'll try again next time
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  simple as that that's all they have to do now
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  i think actually even though that's what i would
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  do and what i think they should do
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  i will tip my hat to matt gates
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  who i think has made another move
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  of political brilliance here
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  representative matt gates
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  threatens to resign from congress if republicans
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  give democrats control of the chamber
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  just to elect mccarthy a speaker
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  of the house
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  again i think this is brilliant even though
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  i'm saying hey don't put your tail behind your legs
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  and between your legs and run
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  i don't really view that's what gates is doing
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  i think gates is just going all in here
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  and saying hey look
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  if the democrats are willing
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  to work
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  to get mccarthy in or republicans
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  are willing to reach across the table
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  and threaten us by putting a democrat in charge
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  then fine let them do it
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  we'll call it out and i'll walk away
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  from the whole thing
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  i think it's another act of political brilliance
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  from matt gates because it highlights
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  the issue here
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  that clearly mccarthy is the
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  swamp candidate clearly mccarthy
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  is who the democrats even
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  want in there
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  sure they'd prefer jeffries but they'd
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  prefer mccarthy
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  as the one is
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  with better odds than jeffries
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  so that will just
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  highlight that issue and that's going to be the key here
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  now the one thing i
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  wish the holdouts would do better
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  is
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  voicing
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  their concerns and voicing these concessions
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  better so the american people understand it better
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  the amazing thing is the american people though
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  are really
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  tuned in more than ever and i think they just
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  understand generally speaking
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  why we don't like kev mccarthy
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  and why he represents the swamp
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  and why he represents the dc elite
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  i think the american people understand that
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  basically speaking but
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  they need to understand the issues here
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  better so that they can understand
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  if
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  god forbid mccarthy gets in and railroads dc
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  down our throat again
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  we'll know how and why it happened
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  with the primary spending
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  with the unable to remove
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  the speaker when he goes rogue or goes
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  swamp
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  and the border and all these other issues
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  quickly here's some other headlines
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  why do
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  201 GOP representatives
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  continue to vote for kevin mccarthy
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  who gets an f
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  in liberty score from conservative review
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  conservative review a great
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  outlet if you want to look at voting records absolutely
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  and they've got their own system
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  for analyzing voting records
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  with the principles of liberty
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  and kevin mccarthy
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  gets an f of course he does
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  he's a swamp creature
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  he's the lebron james of special interest money
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and doling it out to
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  who will work for
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  the swamp instead of the american people
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  but here come the threats
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  conservatives warn of
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  doomsday scenario
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  if mccarthy fails in speaker race
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  where democrats neuter gop power
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  doomsday scenario folks in case you haven't
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  noticed it's already a doomsday scenario
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  in dc
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  debt is
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  off the map it's ridiculous
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  $1.7 trillion
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  spending bills that you can't even read
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  before you can vote for them
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  congress is already a mess
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  the government is already
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  a doomsday scenario
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  whether it's mccarthy in there or not
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  that doesn't change mccarthy extends
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  the doomsday scenario and they just tell you
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  the exact opposite and i'm not surprised
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  by the names and the figures doing it like fox news
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  is brian kilmeade
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  fox news brian kilmeade labels anti mccarthy
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  gop representatives insurrectionist
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  doesn't surprise me one bit
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  brian kilmeade is a dc east coast
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  elitist always has been
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  he likes to dictate policy from his
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  his
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  big big table at fox news
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  his big radio show at fox news
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  he likes to dictate to you
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  how things should go brian kilmeade
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  likes to dictate down to the people
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  what you should think and what you should do
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  when it comes to politics and we're reversing
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  that trend brian
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  but i wasn't surprised
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  i wasn't surprised by any
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  of this and you may remember
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  on monday when i came on and host the show
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  i said
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  ignore the hemmingen hawing
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  ignore the threats ignore the doomsday this
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  doomsday that it's 2016
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  with trump all over again it's the same dc
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  elites east coast elites
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  swamp dc creatures that didn't want
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  trump in in 2016
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  that are now telling you kevin mccarthy is the best option
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  in 2023
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  don't buy it don't listen to
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  it ignore it just like you did
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  because these are just
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  elitists who like being
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  able to feel powerful by dictating
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  policy and politics from the top
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  down and of course the swamp repays
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  them by giving them all the swamp
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  creature guests for their tv shows
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  and their radio shows and that makes
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  them feel prestigious
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  and i'm really upset that donald's
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  changed his vote
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  especially after the attacks he was under
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  democrat cori bush claims black
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  representative brian donald's perpetuating
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  white supremacy after
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  historic speaker nomination imagine
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  you know because they love black people so much
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  right so you had a black man nominated
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  by the democrats and a black man nominated by the republicans
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  but one of the black
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  men was called a white supremacist
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  you know which one it was of course
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  you do it was the republican
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  so that's upsetting that
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  and i'm not saying that brian donald's
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  switched his vote because of the democrat lies
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  and attacks on him
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  i'm just sad he did
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  considering the democrat lies and attacks
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  on him by the way what was the one other
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  thing when i came on here for the first broadcast
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  of the new year that i did i say
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  besides don't listen to the hemming
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  and hawing from the dc elites complaining
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  that mccarthy can't get in
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  i said one of the big stories going into
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  2023 now is
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  the market is finally going to catch up post
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  covid and post biden
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  and now we've got all kinds of news on that
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  and then the guest
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  that's going to be joining me in the next hour we're going to be talking about
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  that with him as
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  well but ladies and gentlemen
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  remember info wars dot com
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  is supported by you we don't have big dc
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  interests we don't have big donors
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  you notice the commercials here are big pharmaceutical commercials
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  or big hollywood commercials
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  or big food commercials

[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  and it's not
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  easy to do with the giant legal bills
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  the giant
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  electricity bills that are going up now
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  the giant bills for the data
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  that we use
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  to house our own websites
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  we don't get to use youtube
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  we don't get to use these
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  big platforms facebook to house our stuff
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  we had to build our own that cost
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  a lot of money
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  and so when you shop at info wars store dot com

[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  very shortly
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  alex may decide to do that as soon as he gets back
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  in the office
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  continuing to monitor the vote
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  and then a guest joining me
[57:42.000 --> 58:10.000]  coming up in the next hour
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  it's bad news
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  because they're about to be sold out
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  because they're also some of our best selling products
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  and we don't have them
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  we can't find the operation
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  so it is a real conundrum
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  but that's just where we're at

[58:48.000 --> 59:14.000]  info wars store dot com
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  now the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  but this sucker is amazing
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  look for yourself

[59:48.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  info wars store dot com
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  not every member of congress is present for this vote now
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  and so McCarthy's threshold
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  is a lot lower
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  if he wants to win
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  so McCarthy actually has his best chance now
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  of winning
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  speakership today
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  with some of these flips
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  and the lower number needed
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  as the threshold to get the majority
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  considering not everybody is
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  present to vote today
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  so you may get
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Kevin McCarthy today
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  only time will tell
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  and
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  unless
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  I think there may have to be another flip or two
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  as we continue to vote
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  but it's going to be right down to the wire
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  so unless somebody flips from McCarthy to somebody else
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  McCarthy's actually got a shot today
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  and so boy oh boy
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  I mean that's going to be a nice gut blow
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  it'll be politics as usual
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  and so we'll just put up with two more years
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  of the swamp running over us
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  and the conservatives in this house
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  will learn the hard way
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  so fine you'll have to learn the hard way
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  the American people have already learned it
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  the Republican voting base
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  they don't want McCarthy
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  and even Donald Trump's
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  support of McCarthy
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  didn't move the needle for McCarthy
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  that shows you how much the American people
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  are uninterested
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  these representatives inbox is being flooded
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  with their constituents saying
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  please don't vote for McCarthy and then getting ignored
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  so this is good
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  I mean it's not going to be good that McCarthy gets in
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  we're going to get screwed again
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  but throughout the process a lot of good stuff has happened
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  and so members of Congress
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  are going to learn the hard way that they're going to get
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  screwed and double crossed by McCarthy
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  with the
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  massive spending
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  and the primary funding
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  and the border
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  and I mean do you really think
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  McCarthy is going to launch an investigation
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  into the Biden family do you really think that
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  the Biden crime family
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  do you really think McCarthy is going to launch any of that
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  spearhead any of that or is he just going to focus on raising money
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  and then making sure the Republican
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  handpicked
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  candidates get in
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  every time
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  so
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  that's fine so people will learn the hard way
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  some people already know this
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I think most of the voters already know this
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  but looks like some of the members
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  the new members of Congress maybe some of the returning members of Congress
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  will have to learn the hard way
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I don't think that McCarthy is going to give him anything
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  I don't expect anything from Kevin McCarthy on the border
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  I mean that one is so obvious
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  it's like maybe he'll do that one
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  just because it's so easy
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  and he has little say in it anyway
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  so he can do a lot of
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  jawjacking on the border
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  issue when he can't do anything
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  the real issue is going to be the funding
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  the real issue is going to be the rules with the bills
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  and the primary funding
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  and the real issue is going to be the fact
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  that you're not going to be able to remove him
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  if he goes sideways
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  so
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  this one's going to be interesting it's going to come right down to the wire
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  and
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  I think that
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  will have
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  a conclusion
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  within the hour probably within the next
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  30 minutes
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  and we'll learn quickly
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  what if any concessions were made
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  to get these votes to flip
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  towards Kevin McCarthy
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  oh man
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  you know it kind of sucks in a way
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  because we thought maybe finally
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  maybe finally
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  we had some good moves happening
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  inside congress to start the 118th congress
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  but isn't this everything right now
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  to start the 118th congress
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  is it going to be the swamps will
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  or is it going to be the will of we the people
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  and
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  we've had hope that hey whoa we might have a change here
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  maybe some of we the people might get a little hope
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  with these republican holdouts maybe we can actually
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  do something about this ridiculous
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  out of control US government
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  hmm but then McCarthy will likely
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  get in
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  and for the 118th congress
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  all hope will be lost
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  but I don't want to be totally
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  negative today
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  sometimes people watching this
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  process play out while they're paying
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  attention more than they ever have
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  is a good thing
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  but I'm telling you right now
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  McCarthy's got a shot today folks
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  he's got a shot with this 12th vote
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  good news and some bad news on multiple fronts
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  the good news is
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  vitamin mineral fusion and DNA 4th plus
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  are still 50% off
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  the bad news is
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  they're very close to selling out
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  and by Monday of next week
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  and I'm cutting this out on January 5th
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  2023 we're going to have to go back
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  to full price and about a week after that
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  they'll be sold out
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  so that's good news you can still get the products
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  it's bad news because they're about to be sold out
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  because they're also
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  some of our best selling products
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  when we don't have them we can't find the operation
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  so it is a real conundrum
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  but that's just where we're at
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  we'll thank all the listeners for your ongoing support
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  but if you want vitamin mineral fusion
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  it's so incredible for your immune system
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  your whole body and DNA 4th plus
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  that helps your telomeres last longer
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  and cleans out your mitochondria and so much more
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  so follow the line supplements
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  at infowarstore.com
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  still 50% off until this coming Monday
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  they're going to be sold out for months and months
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  thanks for all your support
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  at infowarstore.com
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  we'll be monitoring this number
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  and I don't even know what the number he needs today is
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  I think it's 215 today
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  I don't think he needs 218 today
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  but we'll continue to monitor that
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  now I'm joined by
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Tyler Bennett from
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  jonestaxrelief.com
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  now ladies and gentlemen
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  everybody has to pay taxes
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  believe me you hate it I hate it
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  I wish it weren't the case
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  but we all got to pay taxes
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  and you want to make sure you've got a tax attorney
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  for handling cases that you might be involved in
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  or just your general taxes
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  for your business your personal reasons
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  that you can trust that knows the law
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  knows the books and knows how to give you
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  the best deal possible
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  and that is Tyler Bennett from jonestaxrelief.com
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  and so
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  Tyler as we're watching this
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  changing of the guard with congress
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  and the 118th congress coming in
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  and a lot of political changes
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  happening as well
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  as we move to the new year
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  what do you think about for your clients
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  what do you think about for your personal books
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  what do these new year
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  mean
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  what does a new year mean as far as taxes are
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  concerned whether it be a personal
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  interest or a business interest
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Tyler Bennett jonestaxrelief.com
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  well nice to see you again
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Owen and the reality
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  situation is like what you just said
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  there's a changing of the guard that's happened
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  so the last commission of the IRS
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  was Chuck Riddell right
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  he was on here last time we spoke about how
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  the IRS has made more money than ever
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  before and Chuck Riddell was
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  focusing on one thing
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  and that's answering the phone
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  anybody that's ever called the IRS knows
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  they have a severe issue there with answering
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  phone calls but now that commission
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  of the IRS is over there's been a change
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  of the guard and now we have Daniel
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Warfell in who is far
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  left and he has even stated
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  that he is going to go after tax
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  cheats this is a quote
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  those people in bitcoins
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  so again it's more
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  the same where you're guilty until
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  proven innocent with this
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  political party and they're going to come
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  after and take your money so
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  I gotta stop it right there because I'm a little
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  you're telling me
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  this guy Daniel Warfell
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  said that bitcoin holders are tax
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  cheats he said
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  that he's going after tax cheats
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  like bitcoin holders
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  that's what he said so again
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  guilty until proven innocent
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  just because you have the asset of course
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  does not make you a tax
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  cheat now we're going to get into this a little bit
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  different because there was a TIGDA report now
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  that's the FBI
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  of the IRS
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  and what they found is that the IRS
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  isn't even equipped to make these decisions
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  we'll get into that
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  in a second I want to finish this point
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  here which is we all heard about the
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  inflation reduction act
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  which of course the Biden administration
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  is talking about all these things they're going to do
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  but they snuck in the 87,000
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  agents to the IRS
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  and the 80 billion dollars to the IRS
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  correct and here's the thing
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  the new commissioner of the IRS is saying
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  7,000 of those 87,000
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  people are going to go towards
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  answering the phone which was the last
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  commission of the IRS sole
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  focus that's only
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  less than 7% of what they want to do
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  the remaining 80,000 people
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  are becoming auditors to audit
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  the middle class and that's what's happening
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  I'm just stunned
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  at this animosity
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  I mean this is like
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  is this normal I mean you think somebody
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  gets a new position at the IRS
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  they want to come in at least with a neutral
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  perspective like hey you know I'm here to do my
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  job and have neutral but to come in with this
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  animosity towards crypto holders
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  or specifically Bitcoin holders he mentioned
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Bitcoin holders is that
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  unprecedented or is this should we
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  expect this now
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  it's unprecedented
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  but we should also expect it because it's definitely
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  the
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  that's what the regime has been echoing since day
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  one they don't trust you they want to take
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  your money they think everybody is out there
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  cheating
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  the tax fan of cheating the government and of course
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  they have already said that who they're going to go after
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  is the middle class right when they
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  change their 1099K
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  reporting requirements and all that
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  who suffers the middle class
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  not the fat cats at top
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  if they just paid a little bit more
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  in taxes if we wrote rewrote the
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  the tax code that way the tax
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  gap which is the difference between
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  what the IRS makes
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  and what the United States spends every year
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  would be not only closed but we'd be
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  operating in a surplus and
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  instead of going after the right people the
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  by the administration finds it easier
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  to go after the middle class
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  because they don't have the types of
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  attorneys and trust
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  and corporations
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  that take a lot of manpower
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  to go through and find out
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  if this person is actually
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  playing by the rules or not
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  it's much easier for the IRS
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  to target any
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  random person in the middle class and make
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  a crazy accusation
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  that again you're guilty until proven innocent in this
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  in this context that now you're going to have
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  to prove that you did not do this thing
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  or hire counsel
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  you know to get you out of the mess
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  and it's just not fair
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  to the middle class it's insulting
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  and it's
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  yeah it's very much
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  much of the same from this regime
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  this is the new normal but yes watch out
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  because they absolutely do not have your back
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  they're going to stab you in it
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  so what does this mean then
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  as the middle class is about to have
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  the magnifying glass put on it by the IRS
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  specifically people holding
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  bitcoin
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  what does this practically mean
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  are people going to need to expect a call
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  from the IRS
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  a visit from the IRS
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  so I have right here
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  oh and this is the
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  there it is
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  that is the
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  general for tax administration
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  and what they do is they're like the FBI
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  for the IRS they also
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  they do crime stuff but what they also do
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  is look at the IRS itself
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  and say hey is this organization
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  working the right way and they audit it
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  so that was an internal audit they just did
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  what they found out is
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  all these new tax laws that the
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Biden administration has pumped into place
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  the IRS does not
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  have the infrastructure both in terms
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  of people
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  processes systems
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  but also their cloud their main computer
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  that handles all the tax returns
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  is not ready to handle
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  all the tax changes that the Biden administration
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  has put into law
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  and when you look at this report most of it
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  is redacted you see that
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  is hard to read but the parts that
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  aren't redacted we can tell that
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  the TIGDA is saying listen
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  the IRS can't even handle the
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  $600 1099K
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  requirement and that's why
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  on December 23rd
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  a day before Christmas last year real
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  sneakily the IRS lifted it up
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  and said okay we're not going to do that until next year
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  it wasn't because they're giving you a Christmas present
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  it was because they realized that
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  it was going to be more work for them
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  than not because they didn't have the infrastructure
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  in place and here's the thing
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  they did it too late
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  so that means more than half of the people
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  that were under that regime
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  were going to get 1099Ks
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  are still going to receive it because
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  they made this last second decision on December 23rd
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  so a lot of these 1099s are already
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  in the mail or on the way
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  and so what we're going to have is a lot
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  of small business owners and regular
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  people who just sent money to their friends
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  that now have erroneous 1099s
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  that the IRS doesn't
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  even care about but they sent out
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  because it was before
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  they made this last minute change
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  when they realized that they couldn't handle
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  all the changes they made
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  so get ready for a lot of mistakes
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  this year from the IRS
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  and again it's your duty
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  my duty the taxpayers duty to
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  correct it because the IRS will not
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  and they will just take your money and that's what we have to watch out for
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and that's what I was going to say
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  obviously the IRS is not going to make mistakes
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  in your favor so how do people prepare
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  for this so
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  the first level
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  of preparation is knowledge right
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  so the first thing you need to know is that this
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  is happening and many people did
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  not know but on December 23rd
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  halfway through the day
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  the IRS
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  changed the law and said no longer
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  2022 or excuse me 23 is the first year
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  for the $600
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  1099k they moved it a year
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  but I'm telling you everyone's still going to get one
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  because they did it so last minute
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  and what you need to know is if you get one
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  it does not mean you have to pay taxes on it
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  because they pumped that up into next year
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  and so
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  you may get erroneous 1099s
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  in the mail the other thing
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  too is what TIGDA found out is not
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  just from the $600 one
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  but like the commissioner
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  of the IRS said they're going after the crypto
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  people what TIGDA found out
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  is if you have any crypto
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  accounts at all whether or not you're reporting
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  your account or reporting
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  or a good tax payer or not
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  simply by having it right now
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  the issues
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  the programming bugs
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  in the IRS's computer
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  are going to flag your account simply by having it
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  at all now remember
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  let's take a pause right there because we got to go to a break here Tyler
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I'm very curious about this
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  and this is going to be important stuff
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  as we enter the new year folks because
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  when the IRS makes a mistake
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  it's not going to be in your favor and then
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  you got to make sure that you don't make a mistake
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  because then ultimately you're going to pay for
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  both their mistake and your mistake
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  that's how this works we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  this is the opposite of what the globalists are doing with their poison shots
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  this is actually giving your body the tools it needs
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  to regenerate
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  get DNA force plus

[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.360]  Well, so do I.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.800]  And I've been the most affected individual
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.360]  in the fight against the globalist,
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.200]  and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.760]  But, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.120]  I can't do it without your support.

[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.800]  we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.360]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.440]  on every front, but I'm not gonna back down,
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.400]  and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.240]  So please, keep me on the field.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.920]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.680]  while getting great products at the same time
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.400]  that will empower you and your family.

[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.280]  Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.040]  it looks like McCarthy is gonna fall short by two votes.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.600]  They just took final roll,
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.400]  and it looks like McCarthy's short two votes,
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.320]  but he did get his highest threshold yet at 213.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.640]  Now they're still crunching the numbers.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.880]  They're still crunching the numbers here,
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.640]  but only seven voted other today where it was 20,
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.600]  so 13 flipped to McCarthy today.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.600]  And as far as I can tell,
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.000]  that has nothing to do with concessions made.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.080]  Maybe they just wanna go home,
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.080]  and maybe they've actually fallen for the lies and attacks
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.520]  of the fake news establishment DC elitists
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.320]  saying, doomsday, oh, you're so bad,
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.120]  you're a terrorist, you're an insurrectionist.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.080]  Is that why they flipped their vote?
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.400]  Or maybe they just wanna go home,
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.880]  because I haven't seen any concessions made from McCarthy,
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.120]  and if there were, you wouldn't have had Gates and Biggs
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.240]  and Bobberts and the rest still voting other.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.680]  So, however, it looks like McCarthy's still gonna fall short
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.640]  of two votes today, and look at how mad he is.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.840]  He is pissed.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.520]  It's two votes short.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.360]  All right, we're gonna continue to monitor this.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.200]  I think it's two.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.000]  I'll give you the official numbers when we have them,
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.880]  but I believe it's gonna be two,
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.480]  with I think five people didn't make roll today,
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.560]  as some people had to go back to be at funerals,
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.560]  wife pregnant, mother-need surgery, stuff like that.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:43.560]  And so, wow, by the skin of his teeth,
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.040]  just falling short, it looks like Kevin McCarthy,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.200]  though he did get some flips.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.560]  All right, now, getting back to Tyler Bennett
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.400]  from jonestaxtrelief.com.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.240]  Now, Tyler, this is gonna be a pivotal thing
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.640]  for a lot of people, and this is why it's important
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.960]  they understand this, heading into the new year.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.760]  The IRS makes mistakes, they never favor you.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.080]  But also, if you make a mistake, you pay the crime,
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.960]  you pay the toll, so essentially you're in a situation
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.480]  where if you make the wrong move,
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.760]  you're gonna pay for the IRS's mistake,
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.480]  and you're gonna pay for a mistake if you make it.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.000]  So, tell people how they can avoid that,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.640]  and what you guys at Jonestaxtrelief will do
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.280]  to offer them some comfort should they be
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.360]  in a compromising potentially situation with the IRS.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.560]  Well, that's right, Owen.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.240]  And so, let me address that first.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.200]  If you are in a potentially compromising situation
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.040]  with the IRS, and let me just say this,
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.720]  if you are a taxpayer, then you potentially are,
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.520]  because they are going after everyone, like I said.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.520]  But there's three types of situations
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.920]  you could possibly be in.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.800]  Either right now, you need your taxes filed for this year,
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.400]  and you wanna pay, as a warm-blooded American,
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.200]  you wanna pay the least amount as physically possible,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.520]  that's your legal right as a taxpayer,
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.840]  and so we can help make sure you do that.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.560]  Or if the IRS has already gotten to you,
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.440]  and they owe you money, or you owe them money,
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.800]  the state is saying that you owe them money,
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.880]  they're coming after you, maybe they're levying
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.560]  your bank account, or taking other collection activities
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.840]  against you, we can stop these debt in their tracks,
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.240]  we can make them honor your rights that you have,
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.800]  that they are violating, and remember,
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.960]  as we talked before, they don't care if they violate
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.680]  your rights, because they're not attorneys,
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:30.120]  they are clerks that operate off of what they do.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.760]  And then there's the future, which is,
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.720]  hey, I'm planning on making more money next year
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.480]  than this year, because I started a business,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.280]  I'm doing better, all these things.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.080]  Well, the reason the IRS, Owen,
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.840]  made so much money last year, and the year before,
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.800]  is because when the COVID disaster hit,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.120]  and everybody lost their salary job,
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.440]  they all started businesses, but the thing is,
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.160]  as many of these people are overpaying in taxes,
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.040]  because they're not familiar with filing schedules,
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.240]  seeing small business tax returns,
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.600]  and the amount of deductions, such as the pass through
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.680]  deduction 20%, that you could take,
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080]  and make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.000]  So if any of these situations apply to you,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.240]  I can help, we can absolutely make sure
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.600]  you're in the correct entity structure going forward,
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.240]  and you're paying the least amount of taxes.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.960]  And if you already owe the government,
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.320]  we'll negotiate for that back tax.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.360]  Now, how we got into this situation
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.480]  in the first place this year, is remember,
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.880]  I was at the IRS conference in November,
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.440]  I talked to Chuck Riddell, and he said,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.200]  the single biggest focus of the IRS during his commission
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.120]  was getting people to answer the phone.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.880]  And now, during this time, the Democrats,
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.880]  and Biden passed this giant law, the Inflation Act,
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.880]  which added 87,000 people to the IRS, $80 billion, right?
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.880]  But what the new regime does,
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.840]  what the new commissioner of the IRS has said,
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.000]  oh, we're only gonna put 7,000 of those people
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.440]  towards the actual problem.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.120]  The rest of it, we're gonna shake down the middle class.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.200]  And now, here's where the IRS's problem was,
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.160]  and this is what the TIGDA report found out,
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.080]  is okay, fine, the Democrats pushed through all these bills
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.040]  because they want people to pay more taxes,
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.680]  get audited, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.640]  But the IRS doesn't have the infrastructure to do it.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.520]  And so TIGDA's looking at this Rubik's Cube of complexity
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.680]  that they have to figure out
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.600]  before they can even make these moves.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.280]  And so does that mean that,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.600]  oh, we're in a safe harbor until they figure it out?
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.760]  No, no, that is not how the government works.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.560]  They are going to attack first
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.720]  before they realize whether they are even in the right
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.560]  or in the wrong.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.200]  That's where the danger lies.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.600]  And even the Treasury Inspector General has said
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:44.120]  that the IRS is not equipped to handle what they're doing.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.040]  And that's why they have backtracked
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.800]  in a lot of the stuff they've said over recent days.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.240]  Now, remember, we're talking about stuff
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.720]  that spent the last two years coming into law,
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.880]  and then they spent the last two weeks reneging on it, right?
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.960]  And that's not enough time for the government,
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.720]  the bureaucracy to really change.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.920]  And so that's why we're gonna have a lot of mistakes.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.120]  And like you said, Owen,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.200]  when the mistake comes down from the IRS
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.840]  and ain't the IRS, it's gonna pay the bill, it's you.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.360]  And so that's why you have to have proper representation
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.920]  to make sure they're not taking advantage of you.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.600]  So what's the move here?
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.920]  What can you offer to say,
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.040]  somebody who wants to start a business this year,
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.920]  whether you have small intentions or large intentions,
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.320]  what are the services that jonesetactureleave.com can offer
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.920]  because I would imagine for a lot of people
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.720]  that are going into business for themselves
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.560]  to start a new year,
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.000]  there's probably a lot of questions, a lot of concerns,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.800]  and there's really no clarity that you get.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.600]  I mean, they don't teach you this stuff in school,
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.400]  so you're kind of walking around blindfolded
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.000]  until the IRS takes it off and says, hey, pay the toll.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.400]  Correct, Owen, and that's absolutely correct.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.240]  Information is the one thing
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.480]  that they want to keep from the people
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.840]  because that is what gives us power, right?
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.520]  And so what we are offering in this permetrualist time
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.120]  is we have a three-year audit protection program.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.240]  So if you're in the type of situation
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.880]  that we talk to me and we find out that, listen,
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.120]  you're in the area that potentially could get audited,
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.360]  we have protection plans that we can give you
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.720]  that for the next three years,
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.400]  which is hopefully the rest of that commission of the IRS
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.040]  before the Republicans take control, again, we'll see,
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.560]  but for the next three years,
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.840]  you won't have anything to worry about
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.040]  if the IRS ever comes to you, we're representing you,
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.080]  and those letters will come to us and we'll take care of it.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.000]  So that's what I can offer straight up for everybody
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.440]  because like I said, it doesn't matter
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.160]  if you have a small business or not,
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.280]  they're gonna audit a lot of people
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.240]  who do not deserve it this year.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.680]  But as I said before, there are many entities
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.680]  such as C corporations, LLCs, trust instruments,
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.560]  excuse me, that we can create and put people in
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.840]  so that you are paying the lowest amount of taxes.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.160]  Now, until the Democrats change this
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.080]  and they do want to, the corporate tax rate
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.840]  is still the lowest tax rate of all income tax, right?
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.080]  It's 21%.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.480]  You and me, Owen, we pay on a sliding scale up to 37%.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.120]  So just simply if you're making a lot of money,
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.000]  being in the right entity structure
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.560]  could save you literally half the amount
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.280]  that you're paying in taxes.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:23.040]  You know, that's just crazy to think
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.440]  and I wanna expand on that when we come back
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.760]  from this break coming up because I mean,
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.200]  I would imagine that there's things
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.040]  that you're gonna be doing
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.680]  if you're just starting a business.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.920]  There are things that you're gonna be doing
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.440]  where if you don't get out ahead of this stuff,
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.560]  you're gonna end up behind it and it, you know,
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.080]  it may seem like, hey, I don't wanna get involved
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:42.920]  with taxes and stuff.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.120]  I'll deal with that later down the road when it's a problem.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.000]  When really it'd be advantageous to deal with it now
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.160]  before it becomes a problem.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.840]  We'll talk to Tyler Bennett from JonesTaxRelief.com
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.200]  about that on the other side.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:29:00.200]  We'll talk to Tyler Bennett from JonesTaxRelief.com.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.400]  Get DNA Force Plus with the PQQ
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.080]  and the CoQ tenant so much more.

[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.480]  Take your immune system to the next level
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.560]  and even have your telomeres, that's your DNA, last longer.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.800]  This is the opposite of what the globalists are doing
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.120]  with their poison shots.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.280]  This is actually giving your body the tools it needs
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.840]  to regenerate.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.960]  Get DNA Force Plus and Biomedical Fusion for a limited time

[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.040]  Good news and some bad news on multiple fronts.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.600]  The good news is, vitamin mineral fusion and DNA Force Plus
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.240]  are still 50% off.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.960]  The bad news is they're very close to selling out.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.680]  And by Monday of next week, and I'm cutting this ad
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.880]  on January 5th, 2023, we're going to have to go back
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.960]  to full price and then about a week after that,
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.400]  they'll be sold out.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.360]  So that's good news, you can still get the products.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.520]  It's bad news because they're about to be sold out
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.880]  because they're also some of our best selling products.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.560]  When we don't have them, we can't find the operation.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.080]  So it is a real conundrum, but that's just where we're at.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.440]  We'll thank all the listeners for your ongoing support.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.880]  But if you want vitamin mineral fusion,
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.160]  it's so incredible for your immune system,
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.080]  your whole body and DNA Force Plus
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.560]  that helps your telomeres last longer
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.880]  and cleans out your mitochondria and so much more.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.560]  You can get them both exclusively.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.600]  Top of the line supplements at infowarstore.com.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.000]  Still 50% off until this coming Monday,
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.720]  they're going to be sold out for months and months.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.040]  Thanks for all your support.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:00.080]  Now please visit infowarstore.com.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.280]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.080]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.080]  This is an information war.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.800]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.320]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.760]  or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.000]  that info wars has popularized
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.200]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.680]  and we know how to beat them.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.360]  But we can't do it without funding.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.760]  And we make it easy to fund with great products
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.520]  and power you and your immune system
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.920]  and your family as well.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.480]  You can also make straight donations

[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.360]  We're nonviolent.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.520]  But every time you donate money,
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.560]  every time you buy products,
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.600]  every time you keep us on air,
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.800]  you are literally nonviolently politically
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.240]  punching the new world order in the nose,
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.560]  punching their lies in the nose.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.440]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.600]  We're going over the top.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.040]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.080]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.

[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.760]  But doing deep research,
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:12.360]  we made contact with the top company in the United States.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.960]  And it turned out they were supplying
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.120]  almost all the raw materials to the companies
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.600]  that we were already using.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600]  So we've gone directly to the source,
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.280]  and that means we can give you lower prices
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.280]  on the very same high quality supplements,
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.120]  and in some cases even better.

[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.360]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:12.360]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.920]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:32.920]  We've got Tyler Bennett on with us from jonestaxrelief.com,
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.360]  and now, this is what I'm thinking about
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.720]  if I'm a small business owner or say
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.800]  I'm just gonna go into business for myself
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.400]  to begin the year 2023, you know,
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:04.320]  this stuff can seem obviously confusing,
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.360]  and so a lot of people wanna put it off,
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.640]  and they'll just say, I'm gonna deal with my business stuff,
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.360]  I'll put up with the tax stuff till later in the year.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.800]  Problem is that can cause issues for you.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.600]  You wanna get out ahead of this, so talk about that.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.800]  If you're starting a business for the year 2023,
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.600]  and you wanna get out ahead of potential tax issues
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.000]  with jonestaxrelief.com, explain that process for us.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.280]  I don't, so remember, when you're a small business owner,
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.600]  you're on schedule C, that means you can take deductions
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.160]  against the income you make, and this is very different
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.440]  from a salaried employee who is only able to take schedule
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.880]  A deductions that would be like your mortgage, et cetera,
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.160]  but anything in pursuit of your profit as a small business
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.800]  is a deduction that you can write off,
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.480]  and this is including deductions, excuse me, expenses
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.280]  that you've incurred even before you started your business.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.320]  So the official rule right now is there's up to $5,000
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.560]  in startup costs that aren't even associated
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.320]  with your business that we can write off
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.120]  before you even start your business.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.600]  Once you start it, many businesses run a loss
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.400]  for a few years before they become profitable,
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.840]  and remember, we can always carry forward those losses,
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.320]  so it's very, very important that we file correctly,
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.640]  and we make note of the losses that we did take,
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.800]  whether we not take them or use them or not,
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.360]  we at least notate them so that way
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.640]  when you are making money in the future,
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640]  we make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.400]  because you had expenses that were heavily loaded
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.800]  earlier on in your business,
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.160]  and that's just how most businesses are, right?
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.040]  And we need to make sure that you're taking those deductions
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.720]  and not overpaying the IRS,
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.920]  both on what you actually owe and your liability,
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.400]  but also as a small business owner,
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.480]  you have to make estimated tax payments,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.320]  and so listen, if you get a refund back
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.480]  at the end of the year,
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.160]  that means you overpaid your taxes,
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.400]  and you gave the IRS an interest-free loan,
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.880]  and so we're not in the game of
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.720]  giving the government interest-free loans,
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.600]  they would not do the same to us,
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.280]  so we wanna make sure we take all that upfront
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.120]  and give them only exactly what they need,
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.560]  because if you get back a refund check for 99 cents,
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.720]  that means you did it correctly
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.120]  because you didn't loan the government more money
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  just so they can make more money
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.720]  when they would not give you the exact reciprocity, right?
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.200]  So here's the thing,
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.680]  is if you're starting a business this year,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.520]  start taking notes of everything you're spending money on,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.160]  because even before you have that business name,
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.200]  even before you have that entity,
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.840]  we can, as long as it's heading that direction,
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.480]  we can use those expenses that you've encumbered
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.000]  to get to that point, and that's very, very important.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.880]  Now, if I want to have kind of a stress-free process here,
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.840]  is that what Jonestatchelief.com offers,
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  where I can just kind of not have to think about this,
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.040]  not have to stress about this,
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.760]  just, hey, I take care of my work,
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.640]  I hand over the books or whatever you guys need,
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.920]  and then I don't have to think about that,
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.400]  if there's anything you'll come to me,
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.120]  or how does that work?
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.040]  That's right, Owen.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.440]  So, listen, the small business is out, owners out there,
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.800]  the reason you're successful is because you know
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.000]  what you do and you do it well, right?
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.200]  And that's not necessarily taxation,
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.440]  that's this whole world that nobody learned about in school,
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.360]  and so let us take that burden off your back
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.400]  so that you can focus on what brings in more money
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.000]  to your business, and you can focus on growing
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.360]  and becoming a better business, and better person,
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.280]  and better for your family as well,
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.360]  and let us focus on the government and Greedy Joe.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.480]  Yeah, and you know, that's the thing too, where it's just,
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.560]  you want to, like you said,
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.960]  you want to focus on what you're doing,
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.320]  you want to focus on your business,
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.960]  you want to focus on your product, your solutions,
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.000]  your whatever it is, your service that you're offering,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.320]  and the tax stuff can just become such a burden
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.440]  or such a headache, and it just tangles up
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.600]  in your head all these numbers,
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.120]  and now all of a sudden, you look up,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.560]  and it's like, oh, the business day's over,
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.360]  I didn't even do any business today,
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:37:59.840]  I'm trying to figure out my taxes,
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.280]  and so that's where jonestaxrelief.com
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.080]  comes into service here,
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.960]  so that you're not stressing about that stuff,
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.840]  you're not sitting here figuring out,
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.400]  am I paying right taxes, did I follow
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.720]  the right corporation, did I get all my deductions right?
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.800]  No, you're focused on the product, the service,
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.280]  the business that you're running, jonestaxrelief.com
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.040]  are gonna be the ones making sure
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.960]  that you're all up to date on your taxes.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.320]  Is that what most small business owners find?
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.720]  I mean, do they find that this is such a helpful service
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.200]  so that they don't even have to think about that,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.520]  they can be more profitable?
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.000]  Absolutely, Owen, and the other thing too,
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.600]  is even if you're not a small business owner,
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.280]  or you are, but you're doing everything by the books,
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.320]  as we know, we just discussed before,
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.800]  the regime is out to get anybody they can,
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.760]  and so that's why we're offering audit protection,
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:51.880]  so if you get audited for any reason,
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.040]  you're protected by us, and we will go to court for you,
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.240]  if it takes that far, and make sure
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.000]  that you're fully represented, and nothing bad happens to you,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.040]  and this is for the business owners, the salaried employees,
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.840]  any taxpayer of the US government,
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.440]  because everybody is under the gun right now.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.840]  Yeah, and it's really too bad,
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.200]  you know, because I kind of see,
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.160]  look, the way the government is going,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.640]  folks, this isn't just about, hey, I wanna make it,
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.400]  so I'm not getting a tax refund back,
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.840]  a lot of people look at that as kind of like
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.200]  a little bonus cash, right, to begin the year, whatever,
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.480]  oh, I get this little bonus cash,
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.360]  well, you'd rather not pay it to begin with,
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.400]  but you know, here's my kind of worst case scenario
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.680]  that I don't think is really that beyond the pale.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.200]  I could see a day in the future,
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.280]  especially if another Democrat gets in in 2024,
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.320]  I could see a day in the near future
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.440]  where they're not even gonna give you a refund anymore.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  I mean, they'll just get rid of refunds altogether,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.960]  and you'll just be stuck paying that bill,
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.880]  giving them a free loan every year.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.400]  Listen, that's not that far-fetched at all,
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.800]  because they're already raising,
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.280]  or they wanna raise the tax brackets,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.600]  they've done so sneakily, and I keep saying this,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.440]  because this is a sneaky thing that the government does,
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.200]  and nobody really, it's hard to understand,
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.160]  but when there's massive amounts of inflation,
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.680]  and they raise the tax brackets not to match inflation,
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.440]  you're paying more in taxes, and it's hard to think about,
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.920]  but if inflation goes up and the tax brackets
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.400]  do not go up to match it, you're paying more in taxes,
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.360]  and where this is really affecting us right now
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.520]  is on the state level.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:27.520]  There's 38 states that have raised their income tax,
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:30.720]  but they have not raised their standard deductions
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.640]  and similar deductions equally,
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.140]  and so what that means is by sneakily through inflation,
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:38.800]  they have raised your tax rates,
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.280]  so they're already doing it sneakily,
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.560]  they've talked about doing it openly,
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.160]  and yeah, I do think that if the regime,
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.400]  this regime keeps going long enough,
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.960]  then yeah, the Democrats wanna tax you all your money.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.360]  Remember, back in the early 20th century,
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.480]  there was taxes as high as 90%,
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.560]  so we don't wanna see anything like that again,
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.720]  but remember, taxes are one of those things
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:04.200]  that does change with the regime,
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.200]  so it is very, very politically charged and motivated,
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.480]  and because the Democrats are in office right now,
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.400]  that's why everything is headed this way.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.440]  Like I said, let's make an entity right now
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.040]  while we're still grandfathered in
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.680]  under the old corporate rules
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.560]  before Sleepy Joe changes everything
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.760]  because it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.280]  and like you said, oh, and if the Democrats
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.620]  keep staying in office, it'll keep going that way.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.880]  Now, in this country, there's usually a sign curve
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.800]  after the Americans are gonna get sick
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.040]  of the Democrats after a while,
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.320]  and they'll vote back in a Republican,
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.680]  and then it'll ebb and flow like that,
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.200]  but yes, if it keeps going this way,
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.440]  absolutely, that's what's gonna happen.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.720]  They did it before, and they'll do it again.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.720]  Has the IRS been more against the American people,
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.520]  or dare I say, an evil organization as it is now?
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.680]  You know, Owen, that's the thing is,
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.520]  honestly, over the last, for Commissioner Redell's IRS,
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.160]  they had stopped collections during the COVID.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.080]  They said, listen, there is a pandemic happening.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.680]  Besides a few people that owed a lot of money,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.720]  they buy and foremost stopped collections,
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.360]  but now that the Democrats are back in,
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]  and it's a new commission,
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.640]  and even though they made more money last year than ever before,
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.000]  now they have decided we don't care.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.760]  There was people that got away with what they consider
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.960]  to be a crime or murder last year
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.960]  in that the IRS just wasn't collecting against them,
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.200]  and so that's why they're mad.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.520]  They said these people have had two years
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.720]  to basically mess around, and now they're coming after you,
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.600]  and that's why they are so militant about it.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.120]  And folks, that's why, we gotta take a break here, Tyler,
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.080]  but folks, that's why I said at the beginning of the year,
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.600]  the market is gonna catch up.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.800]  Post COVID, post Biden, it's finally catching up in 2023.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.240]  All the inflation and stuff,
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.840]  that was pancakes compared to what we're gonna get.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.800]  that has just taken place.

[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.240]  are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.640]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.920]  Natural chemicals found in the hips
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.880]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.080]  including those with osteoarthritis
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.360]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.520]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.280]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.200]  in nutrition, immune defense,
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.360]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.520]  It has been reported that intake of both
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.960]  is often inadequate,
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.960]  even in affluent populations like here in America.

[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.920]  but for over two years,
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.400]  it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.

[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.440]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  I wanna get a little more newsy here with Tyler Bennett
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.480]  from jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.960]  We've laid out all the issues, folks,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.040]  why you need Jones tax relief.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.280]  Small business, big business personal reasons.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.740]  If you don't have somebody on your side
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:36.180]  dealing with the IRS or your taxes,
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.480]  then you could potentially be setting yourself up
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.440]  for a disaster situation.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.400]  So go to www.johnstactureleaf.com.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.400]  If you have any other questions, they'll take care of you.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.360]  But Tyler, just to get a little more,
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.680]  just to get a little more subject oriented here,
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.920]  I was saying this, and I was warning people,
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.320]  the post COVID, post Biden market crash
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.760]  really has not hit yet.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:00.600]  They've kind of tried to keep our head above water
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.840]  and people might be surprised by that.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.000]  And they say, what are you talking about?
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.760]  We've had the supply chain disaster.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.160]  We've had the inflation.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.760]  We've had the consumer price index,
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.240]  the producer price index.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.640]  Yes, but folks, that's just kind of like the beginning.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.720]  That's like the grumblings before the main wave hits
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.200]  or before the main earthquake hits.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.920]  And just to go through some headlines here to highlight this,
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.000]  Amazon announces massive unprecedented layoffs
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.720]  citing uncertain economy, almost 20,000 people fired.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.600]  Corporate insiders aren't betting on a market rebound.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.800]  Cooler hiring and milder pay gains
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.960]  could aid inflation fight, in other words,
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.840]  nobody's hiring and you're getting paid less money
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.200]  and you're getting taxed more
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.840]  and your grocery bill and energy bill goes up.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.640]  This is a depression written all over it.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.760]  11 signs that the economic tipping point
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.360]  that everyone has been waiting for has now arrived.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.760]  Even Cardi B, the rapper understands.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.920]  Cardi B slams Biden over inflation.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:54.280]  Rapper says grocery store prices have tripled,
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.480]  outraged at $7 for a head of lettuce,
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.560]  Bed Bath and Beyond shares plummet,
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.320]  company warns of potential bankruptcy.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.680]  But despite all of this, one thing remains consistent
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.080]  and that's members of Congress
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.440]  still beat the stock market every time, amazing.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.960]  Members of Congress beat the S&P 500 again,
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.040]  unusual trades resulting in huge gains.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.800]  So the politicians that crush us politically and financially,
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.680]  they always know where to go to make the money.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.280]  But the little guy, you and I,
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.360]  are always the ones left footing the bill.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.800]  And so Tyler, talk about this.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.080]  I have a bad feeling that 2023,
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.440]  one of the big stories looming is gonna be,
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:35.840]  we finally feel the impact of the post COVID,
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.000]  post Biden election, where yeah,
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.280]  we've got inflation maybe it'll get up to 15%,
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.640]  but really it's gonna be the grocery bills,
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.440]  it's going to be the energy costs,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.320]  and it's going to be the taxes.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.000]  So, I mean, people are gonna be nickel and diming,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.280]  they're gonna be reanalyzing their budget.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.040]  Folks, getting your taxes right
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.680]  and finding out how you can pay legally
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:56.560]  the lowest amount of taxes is gonna be something
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.480]  you're going to want to do, especially this year.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.600]  Absolutely, Owen.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.920]  So when we talk about the pandemic
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.840]  in the last couple of years and what happened,
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.760]  it is very much the case that it has been
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.640]  a delayed reaction, right?
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.840]  There was this thing back in 2020,
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:16.240]  people lost their jobs, cities shut down,
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.560]  there was stimulus checks,
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.600]  there was trillion dollars added into,
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.480]  more than that added into the economy.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.240]  And because of that, the real effects
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.480]  and the government is the one
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.800]  that started to feel these effects
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.600]  and that's why everyone else is now,
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  I work closely with the IRS and we started seeing that,
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.440]  well, the real depression, the real recession,
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.640]  the inflation effects, the negative economy, if you will,
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.200]  really started about halfway through last year
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.320]  is where it started to pick up.
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:48.040]  And this year, we're gonna see it in full,
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:53.920]  you know, full force here in that there is less jobs,
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.400]  there's less, and then for the employers,
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.960]  there's less qualified people that wanna work
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.760]  because we've created over the last two years,
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:03.360]  this economy where people are used
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.840]  to just getting checks from the government
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:05.680]  and they don't wanna work.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.760]  So that hurts our economy as well
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.600]  and everyone else that's working because guess what?
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.920]  Now you have to work harder to make less money
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.400]  because everyone else is being fed by the government
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.640]  which makes our whole dollar worth less.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.880]  And so that's what's happening the last couple of years
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.200]  and now it's coming to a head
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.080]  because everyone's gotta go back to work
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.080]  and the tax breaks that have existed for COVID are over.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:34.400]  So this year, for example, there's several things
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.240]  that you can no longer do even though we're still very much
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:41.120]  in this global depression.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.360]  What ended this year was the additions
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:46.600]  to the earned income tax credit.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.860]  That has been lowered by 66% what you can take.
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:53.040]  And also the child tax credit was up
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:58.040]  as high as 3,600 last year is now down to $2,000.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.560]  So it's severely, yeah, kneecap the amount of deductions
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:07.280]  that you can even take in this uncertain economy.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:09.280]  So they're coming at you both ways.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.680]  And there is one more thing in the news
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.360]  that we do have to talk about here.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.160]  And that is the way fair decision that happened back in May
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.400]  because this is gonna affect small businesses
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.160]  or any business that sells stuff online
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:25.880]  or over interstate borders.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.560]  So classically, as you may know or may not,
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:33.880]  the classic rule was if I have a store in California
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.600]  and I'm selling to people in different states,
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.680]  not California, by as long as I sell something
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:39.760]  to someone in a different state,
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.080]  traditionally I didn't have to pay sales tax on that,
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.920]  the person who bought it.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:45.240]  There was no sales tax due in that transaction.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.720]  Now, if I sold my product to someone in the same state
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:50.600]  I lived in, in a sales tax state like California,
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.600]  then I have to pay.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600]  But this Supreme Court decision last year
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.920]  which takes effect now has said that no, it doesn't matter.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:59.560]  If I have a business where I sell things,
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:03.040]  if I sell it to someone in a state where there is sales tax
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.760]  and I'm in a state where there's sales tax,
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.320]  we best believe there is now an additional sales tax liability
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.280]  that did not exist last year or the year before.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.360]  And so the small business owners need to be ready
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:16.000]  and prepared for this because the states,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.560]  remember always more hungry and more aggressive than the IRS
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.480]  because the feds can just print off money technically,
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.880]  but the states can't and they will take it from you
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.760]  and they shoot first and ask questions later.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:31.760]  And why this is scary is because there was a survey
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.880]  that was done once the Supreme Court case was adjudicated
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.880]  and 46% of small business owners that sell stuff
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:44.640]  on the online marketplace self-identified
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:49.640]  as not being registered for all the requirements of this year.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.200]  So if this is you, if you know that there's changes
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.600]  in the laws or maybe you didn't know
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.400]  and you're not prepared for it, we can help you out,
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:01.280]  we can help you so that you're 100% ready for 2023
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.460]  no matter with the additional taxing requirements
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.400]  of different states that you might be selling to.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.120]  And this is important because like I said,
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:09.880]  not only will the states come after you,
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.520]  but when they audit you, they just make numbers
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.920]  out of thin air and they're gonna come after you hard.
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.280]  So let's prevent that from happening
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.040]  and get you on the right place going forward
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:20.600]  because they changed that law last year
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.200]  and it's another sneaky thing
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.520]  that really this is a major change.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:28.560]  The last 50 years of taxation,
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.800]  you only had to pay sales tax to the state
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.800]  that you lived in if you sold something in that state.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.240]  Well, now that's completely different.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.000]  You owe sales tax no matter what
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.720]  and you need to be aware of that.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.520]  You know, here's what I think the biggest fear out there is
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.440]  for small businesses, big businesses,
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.400]  it doesn't make a difference.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:47.480]  Even just for personal people
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.040]  is getting blindsided by the IRS
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.680]  or getting blindsided by something.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.400]  I mean, right, that's the big fear
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:58.400]  and you want that big 340 pound left guard
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.200]  that's gonna make sure that that end
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.080]  is not gonna come in blindside you,
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.080]  make you fumble and lose the ballgame.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.080]  I mean, that to me is kind of the biggest fear
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:06.920]  in all of this.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.680]  Yeah, you know, you're gonna deal with the taxes,
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.720]  you know, you might deal with the IRS, it's painful,
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.920]  nobody likes doing it,
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.880]  but it's like, you don't wanna get that blindsided hit
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.200]  that knocks you right out.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.720]  And so talk about what jonestatchelete.com offers
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.800]  to make sure that you don't get that blindside.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.440]  You're always gonna have that protection.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.600]  And God forbid, if something is coming after you,
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.760]  there's gonna be a warning.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.800]  Absolutely, Owen.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:31.480]  So again, I wanna iterate because the IRS
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.440]  is kind of going after everyone right now.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.960]  If you make over $20,000, there's a target on your back,
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.400]  which is everybody.
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:40.840]  And so here's the thing,
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.640]  if you want that peace of mind, we offer,
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.080]  audit protection doesn't matter why they're auditing you,
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.400]  what reason, we will see it through
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.720]  and make sure that they do not take your lunch
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:55.840]  or even a dime more than what is owed to you.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.240]  Or excuse me, to them.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.680]  And usually when they audit you,
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.600]  it's because they have some kind of information
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.280]  on the state level half the time, it's completely erroneous.
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.280]  And we will tell them that, we'll write them a legal brief
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.840]  saying, showing them exactly where they can stick it,
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:10.360]  because not in our taxpayers, okay?
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.920]  And then also, like I said before,
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:15.680]  if you already owe money, listen, there's no time,
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.080]  like right now, to fix that problem,
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.560]  because all those 80,000 people, as the commissioner just said,
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:24.760]  are gonna be purposed towards making your life
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:25.600]  a living hell.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.480]  And so I don't want that to happen.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.720]  Give me a call and we will make the IRS's life
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.600]  a living hell instead of yours.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.080]  And you know, folks, you just heard Tyler Bennett
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.360]  with us for the last hour,
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.040]  you've probably heard him on with us before.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.640]  I mean, come on, don't you want your tax attorney?
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.600]  Don't you want the people handling your taxes
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:45.360]  with a mindset like this, with a thought process like this?
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.440]  Isn't this the kind of people you want handling your taxes
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.680]  that you know are gonna go to bat for you?
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:52.400]  Maybe even with a little malice, a little animosity
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.680]  towards the state, towards the IRS?
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.920]  Might be what you want.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.840]  I know it's what I'd want.
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:00.400]  That's why jonestaxrelief.com is where we suggest you go
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.720]  for all your tax needs, whether it be personal,
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:05.440]  small business, big business, corporation, all of it.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:08.280]  jonestaxrelief.com and Tyler Bennett,
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.640]  always great to have you on.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.280]  Thanks for getting into all this with me
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.480]  and all the people out there that you help saving money.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.680]  I know they say thank you too.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.600]  Absolutely and happy new year.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.120]  And look forward to saving everybody
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.640]  as much money as possible.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.480]  And yes, we do have animosity towards the state and the IRS.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:25.320]  There you go.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.240]  That confirms it right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.560]  All right, jonestaxrelief.com, 800-290-8160.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.440]  That's 800-290-8160 for more information
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.320]  on how jonestaxrelief can help you.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.240]  All right, when we come back,
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.120]  we're getting ready to move to a 13th vote.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.560]  And then Dr. Peter McCullough, big stuff coming up.
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.080]  Good news and some bad news on multiple fronts.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:55.640]  The good news is, vitamin mineral fusion and DNA force plus
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:58.320]  are still 50% off.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.000]  The bad news is they're very close to selling out.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.800]  And by Monday of next week,
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.360]  and I'm cutting this out on January 5th, 2023,
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.080]  we're gonna have to go back to full price.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.440]  Then about a week after that, they'll be sold out.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.280]  So that's good news.
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.360]  You can still get the products.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.560]  It's bad news because they're about to be sold out
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.920]  because they're also some of our best selling products.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:20.600]  When we don't have them, we can't find the operation.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:24.120]  So it is a real conundrum, but that's just where we're at.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.480]  We'll thank all the listeners for your ongoing support.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.960]  But if you want vitamin mineral fusion,
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:29.200]  it's so incredible for your immune system,
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.080]  your whole body and DNA force plus
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.560]  that helps your telomeres last longer
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.920]  and cleans out your mitochondria and so much more.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.560]  You get them both exclusively.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:39.600]  Top of the line supplements at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.000]  Still 50% off until this coming Monday.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.760]  They're gonna be sold out for months and months.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:46.080]  Thanks for all your support.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.480]  Now please visit infowarstore.com.
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:54.680]  has just taken place.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:57.560]  I wanna encourage you all to go to infowarstore.com
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.680]  and check it out for yourself
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:02.880]  because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:04.560]  Down and out sleep support,
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:07.920]  liquid is very fast acting, taken out of the tongue.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:11.040]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin,
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.680]  passionflower, valerian root extract,
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:16.160]  lemon balm and German chamomile.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.800]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:22.560]  to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:25.280]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.320]  with all the stress we have in this world.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.200]  We've got some other great sleep aids as well
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200]  and they're excellent, they're all different formulas.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.280]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:38.120]  So down and out, sold out for more than five months.
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:40.520]  Now back available at infowarstore.com.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.960]  So get better, deeper rests, boost your immune system
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:46.360]  and support the info war
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.760]  with down and out sleep support at infowarstore.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.940]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:04.640]  All right, James Comer is giving a great rousing speech
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:06.080]  right now in front of the house
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.160]  ahead of the 13th vote that will soon commence.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.600]  Now sadly, I do want to go to this quickly,
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:14.800]  but it's being reported that some of the members
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.880]  switched their vote because they wanted to get out of there,
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.720]  they wanted to go home or apparently wanted to be part
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.440]  of some January six ceremony.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.680]  Now that's what the establishment media is reporting,
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:26.680]  whether you believe that or not, I don't know,
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.880]  but that's what they're saying.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.800]  Oh, they skipped the vote, they changed their vote,
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.240]  they flipped their vote because they want to get out of there,
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:32.280]  they want to go home or they want to go
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.720]  to a January six ceremony.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:34.640]  That's what's being reported.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:37.080]  But this James Comer speech has been great so far.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:38.440]  Let's pick it up live.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:42.920]  Committee to deal with potential waste, fraud, or abuse
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:45.280]  of the COVID funds, not a single hearing.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:50.960]  And we all know, despite what Dr. Fauci said,
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.840]  American tax dollars were sent through EcoHealth Alliance
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.280]  to the Wuhan lab in China for gain of function research.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:04.480]  Sheer for that, Republicans, this is huge.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.240]  Has it come before Congress in the House of Representatives?
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.200]  The American people deserve answers on COVID-19
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.640]  and Speaker Kevin McCarthy has given the Republican majority
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:19.800]  the tools necessary to make that possible.
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.240]  I disagree with that, but okay.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:27.240]  I'd love to see how Kevin McCarthy's done any of that.
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:31.520]  The past six years investigating a president
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.920]  for potential wrongdoing in Ukraine and Russia.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.480]  Now let me say this loud and clear.
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:43.800]  The Republicans will also investigate a president
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:47.680]  for potential wrongdoing in Ukraine and Russia
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.920]  as well as China.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.120]  The American people have a lot of questions
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  for Dr. Fauci, Christopher Ray, Merrick Garland,
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.840]  Secretary Mayorkas.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.320]  We can't have those questions.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.880]  We can't ask those questions until we get organized
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.560]  and elect our speaker.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:11.920]  The role of the oversight committee under Speaker Pelosi
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:16.920]  was a full-time committee to harass the previous president,
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.240]  a committee to advocate for wage social issues,
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.680]  which the oversight committee had absolutely no jurisdiction
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.120]  and a committee totally uninterested
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:28.680]  in the American taxpayer.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:33.480]  In a Republican majority under Speaker Kevin McCarthy
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.720]  and many of my friends embedded in these negotiations,
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.640]  the House Oversight Committee with strong members,
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.960]  strong members like Byron Donald and Andy Biggs
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.480]  and Jim Jordan will return to its original mission
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:51.640]  of identifying waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.720]  in the federal government
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.920]  and holding unelected bureaucrats accountable.
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.960]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.720]  before we're joined by Dr. Peter McCullough
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:01.560]  on the other side,
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.240]  go ahead and just pull that down for a second.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.440]  Now this is what's gonna be interesting here.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.880]  This is, look, even if McCarthy gets in on this 13th ballot,
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:14.560]  there was still a massive victory had here
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.520]  by Matt Gaetz and the holdouts
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.160]  because here's what you've done now.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:21.400]  You've now put the onus on Kevin McCarthy
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.000]  to follow through with what Republicans
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.880]  like James Comer want to be done
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.360]  with investigations into Fauci, investigations into Biden,
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.280]  and some of the other things he's mentioning here,
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:36.400]  getting a rousing standing applause.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.760]  So you've now forced McCarthy to either do this stuff
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.640]  or he's gonna look even worse than before
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.480]  and you're gonna have members of Congress
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.920]  like James Comer and others
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.320]  who are putting their faith in McCarthy
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.680]  to get this stuff done.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:51.200]  When he doesn't, they're gonna realize,
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.280]  okay, I shouldn't have listened to the swamp.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.200]  I shouldn't have listened to the deep state.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.840]  I got tricked, I got confused.
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.200]  McCarthy stabbed me in the back
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.240]  and so they're gonna have to learn this the hard way.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.720]  And you have a situation where McCarthy
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.160]  is basically getting in as the speaker of the house
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:10.320]  already under massive scrutiny,
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.360]  already under the magnifying glass
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.800]  and everything he does is gonna be scrutinized
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:15.760]  and watched closely.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.720]  And if he doesn't do the will of the people
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.680]  and he doesn't do the will of the Republicans
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:22.560]  that want to see these investigations into Fauci
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.080]  and into Biden and other such things done,
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.520]  then there's gonna be a massive upheaval
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:28.760]  and he's gonna be ousted
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:33.200]  even though he won't get the one individual ouster rule.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.240]  He's gonna continue to maintain the Pelosi rule
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:37.240]  that I think it takes five or so.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:39.360]  There'll be 10, there'll be 20, there'll be 30
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.520]  and the disgraceful fall of Kevin McCarthy
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:43.160]  will end up being a more positive thing
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.000]  for the Republican Party.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.320]  So really it comes down to this.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.160]  Either Kevin McCarthy will be fully exposed
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.280]  as a deep state operative
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.440]  or he's gonna be forced to do the will of the people
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.840]  and the people that voted McCarthy
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:54.120]  are gonna have to learn the hard way.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.200]  Shouldn't have listened to the GOP establishment.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.240]  I got screwed again.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:01.400]  Taking this important announcement on the afternoon
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:04.520]  of Thursday, January 5th, 2023.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.720]  And that means you've only got four days to act
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:08.960]  if you want to get vitamin mineral fusion
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:12.200]  and DNA Force Plus, both at 50% off.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.040]  Next Monday, the products are going back to full price
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.640]  because they're close to selling out
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.880]  and we won't have more back in stock for months.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:20.880]  Everybody should be on vitamin mineral fusion
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.240]  and DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:24.680]  Just look at DNA Force Plus with the PQQ
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.400]  and the CoQ tenant so much more.
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.160]  Document it to clean out your cells, your mitochondria,
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.760]  take your immune system to the next level
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:34.840]  and even have your telomeres that your DNA lasts longer.
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.080]  This is the opposite of what the globalists are doing
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.400]  with their poison shots.
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.560]  This is actually giving your body the tools it needs
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.120]  to regenerate.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.160]  Get DNA Force Plus and vitamin mineral fusion
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:47.400]  for a limited time for 50% off.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.120]  You've got until next Monday
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.640]  and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:52.560]  Keep us on air.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:54.400]  Please take action now for your own wellness
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.400]  and your own health and keep us on air.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.500]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:03.580]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:06.780]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:10.700]  and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:12.780]  Well, it's a great honor and privilege
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:15.180]  to be joined now by Dr. Peter McCullough
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:19.140]  and there is so much that we've got to get to with Dr. McCullough.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.580]  First of all, a big,
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.580]  a big honor to be here with you.
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:24.580]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:29.180]  Thank you to Dr. McCullough. First of all, a big announcement.
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:31.060]  Folks, you know about the wellness company,
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:33.220]  started with Dr. Peter McCullough and others
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:36.060]  and now onlinehealthnow.com,
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:39.180]  onlinehealthnow.com folks, the resources are available,
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.740]  the good doctors are being made available to you
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.780]  and this is all good news because we've learned
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:46.860]  not just to not have trust in our government institutions
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:47.660]  when it comes to health,
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.420]  but actually to have complete distrust.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:53.220]  Unfortunately, with everything we've seen post COVID
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.100]  and so Dr. McCullough joins me now.
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:57.140]  I also want to talk about the Fauci files.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.220]  I want to talk about the situation with Damar Hamlin,
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:01.340]  the NFL player, but Dr. Peter McCullough,
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:02.780]  as we bring you on today,
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:04.140]  where would you like to begin?
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.860]  I know there's a lot of things on your mind
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:07.260]  and plate right now as well.
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:11.860]  Well, let's start with some good news on Damar Hamlin,
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:15.900]  the Buffalo Bill's safety, full cardiac arrest on Monday night,
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.900]  now three and a half days into it,
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:20.900]  as I correctly prognosticated for America
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:23.020]  on Tucker Carlson on Tuesday night.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.220]  He's well in his way to making a full neurologic recovery.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.820]  He reports today he's able to face time with his teammates,
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.980]  he's off the mechanical ventilator,
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:33.940]  and I watched the press conference Owen with the doctors
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:36.260]  at your Cincinnati Medical Center,
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:39.380]  and I think what's important is what they didn't say.
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:42.860]  They didn't say that he had a readily identifiable
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:45.980]  in general heart condition like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
[02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:50.060]  or various forms of electrical conduction system diseases.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.660]  I think where the doctors are heading
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:53.980]  to the same diagnosis I mentioned
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:57.140]  to the American people on Tuesday night,
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:01.540]  that I think we're looking at COVID-19 vaccine induced
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.820]  myocarditis and sudden cardiac death.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.700]  That's indeed if he's taking the vaccine
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:10.500]  and it's time for the patient, the family, the bills,
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:13.740]  the NFL, the media to come out
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:16.260]  and just disclose his vaccine status.
[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:18.140]  Well, and let's get into that right now
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:22.860]  because this is a difficult subject to breach
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:24.420]  for multiple reasons because look,
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:26.740]  we do believe in medical privacy,
[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:28.460]  but here's the problem.
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:31.700]  That has been so damaged since COVID,
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:33.660]  whether it's, oh, everybody has to wear a mask
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:34.980]  or everybody has to take a vaccine
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.420]  and oh, I wanna go have a cheeseburger
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:37.260]  or go to a ballgame,
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.700]  I have to show my vaccine status.
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:41.380]  So it's kind of like that whole protective thing
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.540]  where, hey, we appreciate everyone's medical privacy.
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:46.580]  Look, we weren't the ones that blew that damn up,
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.020]  Dr. McCullough, we were not the ones that blew that damn up.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.460]  So the very people telling us,
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:52.780]  hey, you're not allowed to know about his vaccine status.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.180]  Well, now hold on a second.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:55.940]  You were the ones that wanted us to walk around
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.940]  with basically a barcode on our head,
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.020]  letting people know whether they've had a vaccine or not
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:02.260]  just to get access to places.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:06.300]  So you guys blew up the medical privacy issue, not us,
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.460]  but getting back to that,
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:10.420]  it goes beyond just this NFL football player
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:12.340]  and that's why I think this is so important.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:14.980]  Hundreds of millions of Americans took this vaccine
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:18.300]  under false pretenses, many of them are concerned
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:20.500]  with what may be going on inside their body,
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:23.180]  not even to mention all the other NFL players
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:24.540]  that may have taken this vaccine
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:26.100]  or been forced to take this vaccine,
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:28.220]  again, under false pretenses.
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.620]  But as we know, the doctors in the press conference yesterday
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:34.420]  didn't mention anything about the vaccine
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.740]  and we've had other doctors go on TV
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.580]  since other networks say, don't bring up the vaccine,
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:41.140]  it has nothing to do with the vaccine.
[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:43.140]  But Dr. McCullough, as you have stated
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:45.380]  and as I have stated, I said, look,
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:48.660]  I don't know if his cardiac arrest was caused by the vaccine
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:51.180]  because I don't know if he had a vaccine,
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.460]  but they don't seem to have that same logic.
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:55.420]  They don't know whether he's had the vaccine or not,
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.700]  but they're still willing to go out there
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.100]  and say for sure it wasn't caused by the vaccine.
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:05.780]  Oh, and the FDA says the vaccines cause myocarditis.
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:10.780]  Before COVID-19, our guidance in cardiology says
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:15.180]  we cannot let players go on the athletic field
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:18.700]  with clinical or subclinical myocarditis.
[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.860]  This is the chain of logic.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:22.740]  The DHS and the White House
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:27.140]  through the COVID community core program in 2022,
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:31.020]  they floated out $13 billion to prominent organizations,
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.580]  including the NFL.
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:36.020]  So our tax dollars supported the NFL
[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:38.460]  in mandating the vaccine on the players.
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:41.300]  The FDA says the vaccines cause myocarditis.
[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.900]  Now they've all gotten the vaccine.
[02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:46.260]  The FDA says 95% of the players took the vaccine
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:49.300]  and they publicly disclosed who didn't take the vaccine,
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.660]  including teammate Cole Beasley.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:53.300]  So we have a situation here.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:57.020]  Even the NFL has a public disclosure policy
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:10:59.980]  on injuries and medical problems for the players.
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:02.220]  At this point in time,
[02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:04.580]  there needs to be full disclosure of what's going on.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:08.060]  I imagine his next steps are gonna be cardiac MRI,
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.500]  blood testing, but every minute that they remain silent
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:15.020]  on what caused it, it leads me to believe even more
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:18.500]  that this is COVID-19 vaccine induced myocarditis.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.620]  Yeah, and since you bring that up,
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.660]  I did have questions about that.
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:23.620]  So I'm glad you went there.
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.940]  In that press conference,
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.460]  they were talking about how they hadn't run these tests
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:31.020]  and a lot of tests still needed to be run.
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:32.540]  And I was a little confused by that
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:34.380]  because the reports were saying
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:36.100]  that they were running tests on him the whole time
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:37.380]  that he was there.
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:38.660]  And then they came out and said,
[02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.700]  well, we haven't run the necessary test.
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:42.420]  I don't wanna think these doctors are lying to us.
[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:43.260]  I'm not saying that.
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:45.220]  I'm just confused as a layman here.
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:47.500]  What kind of tests could they have run
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:49.380]  while he was basically on live support
[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:50.540]  on the breathing machine?
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:53.220]  What kind of tests could they have run then
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.380]  and but also couldn't because of a situation
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.460]  that they might be able to start running now
[02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:59.740]  that may be able to give us answers
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:01.380]  as to what was going on with him.
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.940]  You know, in the first few days,
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.300]  I'm sure he was on the ventilator.
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:08.860]  He was paralyzed and sedated.
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:11.180]  He had standard ICU monitoring,
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.580]  electrocardiographic and pulmonary monitoring.
[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:15.660]  He did have cardiac echocardiography.
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:16.500]  I'm sure of that.
[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.060]  So they already know in generally the structure
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:21.060]  and the flow within the heart.
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:22.500]  They did detailed blood testing.
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.300]  I'm sure they did cardiac trachotin, BNP,
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:29.420]  Gilectin-3, SD2, all the standard cardiac biomarkers
[02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:31.300]  for advanced cardiomyopathy.
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:33.620]  And in addition, they did electrolyte tests.
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:35.420]  They knew if he had a low potassium
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:38.020]  or low magnesium, as at the start of the game,
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:40.900]  so it's extremely unlikely he was dehydrated.
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:43.140]  And there was no mention of all that.
[02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:45.620]  So I gotta tell you, when doctors don't mention it,
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:48.140]  chances are it's all normal.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.220]  And if that's the case,
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:52.620]  we're now starting to head towards a key test
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.700]  which he could not have on the ventilator.
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:57.900]  And that's cardiac MRI with late-gatalinium contrast.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:01.540]  And so once he's stable enough to go to the MRI unit
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.380]  for a cardiac MRI, that'll be the next important test.
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:06.180]  There'll be probably an invasive test
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.460]  called coronary angiography,
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:11.140]  another one called electrophysiologic testing
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:14.780]  because it'll test for the coronary circulation
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:16.460]  to the heart, make sure it's normal.
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:19.100]  And then the electrical stability is very possible
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.060]  who'll need an implantable cardiac defibrillator.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:24.700]  So you're thinking then, as reports are,
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.780]  that he's taken off the breathing apparatus today
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:31.100]  and maybe getting back to some normal behaviors
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:33.660]  that maybe perhaps the next 24 or 48 hours,
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.580]  he starts to undergo some of these other tests
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.860]  that might give us a better idea of what was going on.
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:39.700]  That's true.
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:41.780]  In fact, he was off the ventilator last night
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.460]  and he was able to FaceTime.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:46.660]  He was able to do complex mental function.
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:49.940]  So I anticipate he's gonna have a full normal
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:52.620]  neurologic recovery, which is wonderful.
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:53.620]  And now it's stable.
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:55.420]  There's really no rush for the other tests
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:56.860]  as long as he's on the monitor.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.060]  But a key one will be cardiac MRI.
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:01.180]  We'll be looking for the results of that one.
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:02.620]  Now, is this the type of thing
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:05.020]  where he will either be diagnosed
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:06.860]  with a myocarditis situation
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:10.900]  or could they potentially find one of these fiber clots
[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:13.460]  that we've seen in so many vaccinated patients,
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:16.020]  some getting up to six feet long?
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.980]  Is this the process where that would be identified?
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:21.940]  Yeah, I really doubt a blood clot
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:23.980]  because he's in such good shape.
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:27.700]  He's great mobility and it would be unlikely
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:30.260]  that that precipitated this electrical cardiac arrest.
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:33.580]  Now, believe me, blood clots have happened in the pro athletes.
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:37.300]  Maxwell, a New York Jets player is sidelined
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.140]  because of blood clots among others.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:42.100]  So, there will be assessment for that,
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.820]  but I would doubt that clinically.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:45.860]  I think it's a primary cardiac problem.
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:49.700]  Now you bring up the electrical issue here with the heart.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:52.100]  Where does that come into play?
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.500]  Because obviously this is why the people continue
[02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:56.860]  to talk about the comatio cordis
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:59.540]  because that deals with the electrical issues there.
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:01.260]  What about with the vaccine?
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.540]  Because I don't hear too many people talking
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:04.060]  about the electrical problems with the heart.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:05.380]  How does that play in here?
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:09.500]  When the COVID-19 vaccines,
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:12.740]  when they install the genetic code for the spike protein,
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:15.420]  it causes inflammation and a small scar
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:17.500]  to balance weeks or months afterwards.
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.980]  And that's the site where a re-entrant
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.020]  abnormal cardiac rhythm takes over
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.020]  in the setting of a surge of adrenaline,
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:27.860]  which would be the context of him making that tackle.
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:29.340]  Big surge of adrenaline
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:32.060]  and then he goes into a re-entrant arrhythmia.
[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:34.260]  All experts, myself included,
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.260]  have ruled out this comatio cordis suggestion,
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:40.020]  which has happened in baseball players
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.140]  across players, hockey players.
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:44.900]  That's due to a projectile to an unprotected sternum.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:46.980]  Football players take a helmet into the sternum,
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:48.260]  you know, virtually upside it down.
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:49.100]  Let me just pause right there
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.020]  because we gotta take a break.
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:51.540]  Let's continue that on the other side.
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.500]  This is an important issue with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:54.500]  We will be right back.
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:55.980]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:58.980]  a very exciting development has just taken place.
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:01.860]  I want to encourage you all to go to infowarstore.com
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:03.220]  and check it out for yourself
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:07.220]  because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:10.060]  Gallon out, sleep support, liquid,
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:12.500]  is very fast-acting, taken out of the tongue.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.460]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin,
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:18.220]  passionflower, valerian root extract,
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:20.740]  lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:24.660]  All of these compounds are documented on record,
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:27.740]  to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:30.380]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.420]  with all the stress we have in this world.
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:34.340]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well,
[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:35.180]  and they're excellent.
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:36.340]  They're all different formulas.
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:40.460]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:43.140]  So, John and Al sold out for more than five months.
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:45.740]  Now, back available at infowarstore.com.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:48.580]  So get better, deeper, more, more,
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:51.980]  go to infowar.com to get better, deeper, rest,
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:54.740]  boost your immune system, and support the infowar,
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:57.500]  with Gallon out, sleep support, and infowarstore.
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:01.420]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:04.500]  American citizens should be allowed
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.580]  to basically question that event
[02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:08.900]  in any way that they deem fit.
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:10.700]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:12.180]  That's what they wanna take away,
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:13.780]  your ability to speak freely.
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:15.500]  So they're gonna go for Mike Lindell next,
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.940]  or they're gonna go for Steve Bannon,
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:18.500]  or they're gonna go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:20.220]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago,
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:21.740]  but only 28 years.
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:23.420]  And I knew they were planning all of this,
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:25.820]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:27.820]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:29.420]  And now, because we've been so successful
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:30.940]  warning the population of the planet,
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.580]  not just America, we're public enemy number one
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:35.420]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:37.460]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:39.260]  how successful Info Wars has been
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:40.780]  because of your past support.
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:42.020]  So I salute you and I thank you,
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.580]  and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:47.460]  three double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:50.180]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:52.100]  1776 is the promo code.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:54.860]  The destination is infowarstore.com,
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:57.580]  and I thank you all for your support.
[02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:59.740]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:03.100]  There's a war in the environment, the food,
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:07.260]  the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections,
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:10.140]  to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.340]  But through Mother Nature,
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:15.780]  the creator gave us compounds
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:18.620]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.860]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great,
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:23.780]  but we've got a real game changer now.
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:26.100]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:28.020]  It's Info Wars Platinum,

[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:56.420]  and your wellbeing to try these out and fund the Info War.
[02:18:57.780 --> 02:19:00.660]  Why does the establishment spend so much time
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:02.340]  demonizing Info Wars,
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:05.460]  attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:07.580]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:09.220]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:10.780]  They know we've got their number.
[02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:15.500]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.180]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature,
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:19.780]  incredible compounds that will supercharge
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:23.340]  our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.

[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:44.980]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.

[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:02.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:05.900]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:08.500]  6��
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.780]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:29.340]  We've got Dr. Peter McCullough with us.
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:31.660]  A couple breaking news stories real quick.
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:35.340]  The 13th vote for Speaker has just began.
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:41.940]  You still have Biggs and Boebert and others holding out, three of them right now.
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:45.880]  The vote just went to Byron Donalds and he didn't vote.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:50.700]  So I don't know if he's just not there right now or if he's deciding to abstain, but did
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:53.300]  not vote Donald, so we'll be maintaining that.
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:57.280]  But as soon as that others number gets to seven, I think that's the threshold unless
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:59.900]  a Democrat or three vote for McCarthy.
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:05.460]  I think the simple majority is now 215 based on the last vote tally.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:06.980]  I don't know why they won't tell us this.
[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:11.140]  I mean they still say on Fox News, even after the vote was over, McCarthy appears to lose.
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:12.140]  No, he lost.
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:15.420]  So they're just totally in the tank for McCarthy and they're just not even giving us all the
[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:18.540]  information, but we'll continue to monitor that.
[02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:22.740]  Another story I have just been told, and I've not had any time to look into this, I've
[02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:29.540]  just been told that Ashley Babbitt's mother has been arrested in Washington D.C.
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:34.620]  So again, this is just breaking, I don't know the full story, it's just been reported
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:35.620]  to me.
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:38.020]  Ashley Babbitt's mother arrested in Washington D.C.
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:43.140]  So I guess the January 6th ceremonies continue, they killed her daughter in cold blood two
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:44.140]  years ago.
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:45.940]  I guess now they just want to go after her mother too.
[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:48.580]  These are sick people we're dealing with in D.C.
[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:53.020]  All right, now back to the discussion at hand with Dr. Peter McCullough, all right.
[02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:59.900]  So Dr. Cometo Cordis is what they kept telling us and I think we've all pretty much heard
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:03.700]  of that now and we've seen the diagrams and everything that it means.
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:09.740]  And so it sounds like there's kind of a balance here where it was not necessarily the hit
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:15.460]  that caused a Cometo Cordis, but it was the hit, the adrenaline of the whole thing that
[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:19.860]  perhaps caused him to go into cardiac arrest because there may have been some underlying
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:22.260]  issues ahead of that.
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:28.580]  So kind of pick it up where you last left off, why you think now it's completely fair
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:34.460]  to rule out the Cometo Cordis even though that's what they want us to think it is.
[02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:40.740]  How doctors do this, Owen, is we rule it out what's called mechanism of injury.
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:46.460]  The pads that protect the sternum, it's called the sternal plates and football are there
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:47.460]  for a reason.
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:53.620]  In a study in American Journal of Cardiology in 2007, they prove that the football pads
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:59.020]  that go over the sternum now completely prevent any chance of Cometo Cordis.
[02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:01.060]  So we can completely rule that out.
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:05.220]  The players take helmets in the chest, virtually every set of downs.
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:09.220]  I ruled that one out basically after I watched the replay a few times.
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:15.620]  I think it's ridiculous that any doctor went on TV and suggested that it's just as ridiculous
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:22.140]  as doctors who went on TV and said it's not the vaccine without knowing the vaccine status.
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:23.140]  Yeah.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:26.100]  And I mean, I kind of, and I got a lot of flak for this too.
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:31.340]  I said, I believe it was the hit that caused the event, but perhaps it was a vaccine status
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:34.860]  or injury that made a bad situation worse.
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:36.540]  And so we're still waiting for answers.
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:41.260]  But you know, here's the conversation that I see or the future of the conversation, Dr.
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:42.260]  McCullough.
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:46.540]  And that goes two ways at this point, because look, I've covered the NFL long enough to
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:50.460]  know they're going to, they're going to try to not be honest.
[02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:51.460]  Let me just put it that way.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:54.540]  They may not come out and lie to you, but they're going to do everything they can to
[02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:57.220]  not be fully transparent and honest about this.
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:59.620]  But I don't know if they're going to have a choice because the conversation goes two
[02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:01.460]  ways at this point, Dr. McCullough.
[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:06.260]  And as you just stated, if we can rule out Cometo Cordis, well, now we've got to have
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:11.980]  this discussion, which is one, football is now a sport where what is considered a routine
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:16.620]  tackle can cause potentially life ending event.
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.860]  That's a discussion that is even going to have to be had if they're going to tell us
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:24.780]  this has nothing to do except he just had an event because of this play, or they're
[02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:28.660]  going to have to come out and say, well, okay, there was an underlining condition that caused
[02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:30.580]  his cardiac event.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:35.140]  And if it was caused by the vaccine, well, now you've got a whole nother issue.
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:40.500]  All the other NFL players are going to be concerned, but either way, either way, the
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.100]  NFL players should be concerned.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:45.660]  I think this Saturday and Sunday are going to be very interesting days because you're
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:49.340]  either going to have the conversation where a normal routine hit for the NFL could be
[02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:56.700]  potentially life ending, or all these vaccinated players are at a risk of having a cardiac
[02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:58.420]  arrest event on the field.
[02:24:58.420 --> 02:24:59.900]  Which way does the conversation go?
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:04.220]  I mean, I don't see it going any other way here, Dr. McCullough.
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.220]  It's true.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:09.940]  You know, I want to bring up one other possibility that fits with your analysis.
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:16.100]  There's a paper that appeared in European Journal of Cardiology case reports in 2021
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:23.620]  by Gregory Massouli and pointed out that patients who have myocarditis, these two cases in this
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:26.860]  paper were not due to COVID vaccines, it was before COVID.
[02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:31.460]  But if they do sustain blunt trauma, it can trigger a cardiac arrest.
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:36.580]  So not commercial cortis, but just the adrenaline and then also the mechanical force.
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:42.380]  You're right, the players looked so unbelievably pale and nauseated.
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:47.420]  I know they were incredibly concerned about Damar, but many of them probably thought,
[02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:52.580]  wait a minute, could I be the next person to go down on the field to play?
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:54.180]  And that's, I think, what was so shocking.
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:57.620]  And we've seen really severe injuries in the NFL before.
[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:00.420]  Obviously, we've seen broken bones, broken legs.
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:02.100]  We all remember that.
[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:06.780]  There have been severe head, neck, back injuries that have caused some pretty serious scenes
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:07.780]  on the field.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:11.260]  The ambulance is to come out, guys getting basically cut out of their equipment.
[02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:16.580]  And the difference has been, though, normally, either within a short period of time or before
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:21.020]  they even put the player in the ambulance, they either have signs of life or can confirm
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:23.780]  that, hey, he's had a serious injury, but he's going to be okay.
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:25.580]  We have the situation under control.
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:26.580]  That was not the case there.
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:31.460]  They sat there for almost 10 minutes and watched them trying to revive Damar Hamlin.
[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:34.340]  Thank God they were finally able to do so, but it took almost 10 minutes.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:37.980]  So a lot of the guys were probably sitting there thinking, is this it for him?
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:40.140]  Is my friend, is my brother, is my colleague?
[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:41.140]  Is this it?
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:45.180]  Is this the last time we're going to see him going off this field in the ambulance?
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:46.940]  A very real situation.
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:49.620]  And again, like you said, it hasn't really been addressed.
[02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:51.860]  It hasn't really been rectified.
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:54.260]  It's got to be tough for an NFL player now.
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:57.660]  The sport has always been dangerous, but this is a new level of danger.
[02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:01.260]  Like you said, you could see it on their faces.
[02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:02.260]  That's true.
[02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:07.860]  If the doctors came out and said, listen, he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or he had
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:11.340]  an unusually low potassium level, there's a clear cause.
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:16.060]  I think everybody could, their attention levels will go down, but we've had now three and
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:20.980]  a half days of silence of what the doctors think caused it, three and a half days of
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:23.620]  silence on whether or not it took the vaccine.
[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:27.420]  The FDA says the vaccines caused myocarditis.
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:32.980]  The autopsy studies show if people found dead after the vaccine, that myocarditis can be
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:34.340]  fatal.
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:37.820]  Everybody in the stadium, everybody on the field knows this now.
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:41.780]  In fact, this just occurred about a week after the Rasmussen report.
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:46.900]  Oh, and the Rasmussen report was a large survey of Americans.
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:52.180]  And the bombshell finding was that 28% of Americans know somebody who's died of the
[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:55.300]  COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:28:00.100]  And so again, I understand why, I mean, look, if I'm the NFL, you're really trying to thread
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:05.220]  the needle here because the NFL loves to rub shoulders and be in good standing with the
[02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:09.060]  establishment so they don't want to go against the grain on the vaccine status.
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:13.900]  But at the same time, the NFL has to have some sort of self preservation here to say,
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:19.100]  are we going to sacrifice our good standing with the establishment and say the vaccine
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.380]  may have been a problem here, or are we going to try to maintain good standing with the
[02:28:22.380 --> 02:28:27.740]  establishment and tell the players, hey, your next routine tackle might cause you to have
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:31.300]  a cardiac arrest event and need resuscitated on the field.
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.420]  Again, I just, I don't know how it goes either way.
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:35.100]  Now, Dr. McCullough is with us.
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:38.700]  I do want to move on because I want to talk about the Fauci files as well.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:40.020]  These are big developments, folks.
[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:44.940]  And you just heard James Comer on the floor of the house say, when we get back in control
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:50.380]  of this house, whatever it takes to get this vote finished, we're going to investigate Anthony
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:51.380]  Fauci.
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:52.380]  It's a big development.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:29:22.340]  Dr. Peter McCullough's take on it on the other side of this break.
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:43.100]  Here's how

[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:43.500]  and they're excellent. They're all different formulas. But this one is particularly the strongest one

[02:32:11.980 --> 02:32:17.660]  industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez,
[02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:22.700]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:27.020]  including myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because
[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:31.420]  of this platform. And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:36.220]  weren't for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:43.020]  Cast, the super Tim Cast IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video
[02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:47.980]  for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone. We need to support free speech
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:53.180]  systems right now. So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Info Wars,

[02:32:56.060 --> 02:33:05.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:25.260]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now
[02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:32.540]  your host, Owen Troyer. All right, monitoring the 13th boat that is on the way. Some interesting
[02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:36.620]  developments there, but we'll just wait until the final tally before we report on it. And then
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:43.580]  also I'm getting information. Ashley Babbitt's mother arrested for allegedly jaywalking in DC
[02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:49.260]  today. This is just so despicable, man. This country is so sad and corrupt. First Ashley Babbitt
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:53.660]  gets murdered in cold blood, her killer walks free, and then the mother gets arrested on the
[02:33:53.660 --> 02:34:00.140]  anniversary of her daughter's death two years later. It's just sick, man. DC is a sick, disgusting,
[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:07.100]  twisted place. May God have mercy on the Babbitt family. And may God have mercy on our souls
[02:34:07.100 --> 02:34:11.740]  for what we've done here. It's just sick. Now getting back to the conversation here, part of
[02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:17.340]  that sickness is Anthony Fauci, quite frankly. And so Dr. Peter McCullough with us here to discuss
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:23.020]  the latest upcoming Fauci files, which we were expecting to get today. I thought at least we're
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:26.700]  going to have them by the end of the week. So I'm not sure if they plan on releasing those
[02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:31.820]  later this afternoon or they're going to delay it. But you know, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:39.100]  All the lies that Fauci has told have now been completely proven as lies. He knows nothing
[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:42.540]  about gain of function research. Really, we have your signature on gain of function research. We
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:46.460]  have you on multiple videos talking about gain of function research. I mean, so he can deny it all
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:51.900]  he wants. We have the paper trail. We have his own words out of his mouth. Of course, the COVID-19
[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:57.740]  vaccine. He lied about the safe and effectiveness of that. And so if he thinks he can just scurry
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:02.700]  away here and hide from any justice, I don't know if it's going to be so easy. You know,
[02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:06.700]  he might have gotten away with what he did during the AIDS pandemic. They made a movie all about
[02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:11.260]  him, the Dallas Buyers Club. He was the bad guy. Fauci was the bad guy in the Dallas Buyers Club
[02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:17.580]  movie. And he got away with that. This COVID scam, though, I don't know if it's going to be so easy
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:24.140]  for him to get away here, Dr. McCullough. I agree. I think he's in trouble. You know, keep in mind
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:29.980]  his official position in the US government was small. He was the division head of the National
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:35.340]  Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That's not a big position. And then without any
[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:41.180]  type of vote or vetting, he was elevated to a much higher position in terms of an advisor on
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:48.700]  coronavirus. He's already been deposed and said he can't recall over and over again. These files
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:55.260]  are going to be an indictment over malfeasance in so many areas. And I anticipate they're going
[02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:02.140]  to investigate conflict of interest, connection with his spouse and National Institutes of Health
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:08.300]  Ethics, gain of function, research. How did he communicate with this CDC? And then also with
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:15.500]  Twitter and the FBI. I think he's being set up, honestly, like most small people in government,
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:22.140]  to be a scapegoat. I think he'll be a scapegoat for what is a much larger operation. And that is a
[02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:26.540]  national security operation that became the COVID-19 pandemic response.
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:34.700]  I mean, if that's the case, there's no way a guy like Fauci goes down on his own. I mean,
[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:38.380]  I figure if that's the case, he's going to be grabbing onto the ship that put him there,
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:44.220]  try to drag it down with him. We've already heard through the release of some of these
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:53.260]  Twitter files that the CDC and the FBI were hand in glove with Twitter on crafting this
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:59.580]  false narrative, this government narrative that worked to suppress any forms of early
[02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:06.060]  treatment and protocols, suppress any information on vaccine safety and risk mitigation, and then
[02:37:06.060 --> 02:37:12.700]  massively promote these frequent vaccinations into individuals that's resulted in record
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:18.460]  numbers of injuries, disabilities, and deaths. So I can tell you the questions I have is,
[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:23.980]  you know, who is giving the FBI and the CDC their direction? And I think it's going to go all the
[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:27.500]  way up the intelligence community. I really do. I think it's going to go all the way to the White
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:32.460]  House. There'll be a lot of smaller people like him who will be scapegoated. Well, how about this?
[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:37.900]  Because you've been really on the front lines of this when the front line doctors first came out,
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:41.740]  and when we were talking about COVID and then moving on to the COVID vaccines,
[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:46.940]  with the misinformation or disinformation or outright lying we've gotten from our government
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:50.940]  and health officials, you've been boots on the ground of this really day one leading from the
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:38:00.700]  front. From that point in time to now, what has the system of support looked like? I mean, the
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:06.060]  number of doctors, the amount of information you're able to get out. Talk about kind of this growth
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:13.020]  period from where this began to where we're at today. From the very beginning, we were communicating
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:19.500]  through a variety of systems and we learned to use more and more systems over time. I do have to
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:26.220]  say, I think there's been two big advances. The first one is sub-stack and scientists started to
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:31.820]  learn that we could communicate rapidly through sub-stack and give cited references and materials
[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:37.980]  to one another. Then the other big advance was Elon Musk. What happened at Twitter was amazing.
[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:43.100]  I had one of the top Twitter doctor accounts, mainly doctors followed me. I was suspended for
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:47.980]  two months with a case number. I was probably the least suspended out of all the prominent
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:55.660]  doctors. Now I'm back and without the unfollow, the blacklisting and the shadow batting,
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:02.220]  my followers are growing greatly. I think sub-stack and Elon Musk have been the two biggest sources
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:08.700]  that have promoted the First Amendment right to free speech, which scientists have to
[02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:15.660]  and helped us battle against this big tech government false narrative that's been imposed
[02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:22.620]  on the people. So where Fauci or these government institutions were able to censor you and censor
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:27.340]  other doctors and censor this information about COVID or the vaccines, the origin of COVID,
[02:39:27.340 --> 02:39:32.140]  the truth about the vaccines from getting out, you guys found the workaround and that was sub-stack.
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:38.460]  Now, I do recall at the time, you may recall this as well, they tried to censor you guys off
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:42.700]  sub-stack too. The people that ran sub-stack said, no, we're not going to engage in that
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:46.620]  censorship. So then sub-stack became a good place for you to share information. But now that you're
[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:51.660]  back on Twitter, sharing it there, it's getting a big response. And I think too, not just Elon
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:56.460]  Musk opening up Twitter as a platform for you to get the truth out, but also Elon Musk has been
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:40:01.660]  extremely skeptical. Elon Musk has called for investigations. Certainly that has hurt the
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:07.580]  establishment trying to control this narrative. That's completely true. Let me give you an example.
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:12.780]  Today, there's been a discussion about this cardiac MRI in Damar Hamlin. Well, I quickly
[02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:21.020]  produced on Twitter the guidelines from the MHRA in the UK. The UK has guidelines for COVID-19
[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:26.300]  vaccine-induced myocarditis. Let's say an MRI should be done. That gives you an idea of how
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:31.500]  rapidly we can exchange information. I agree with you. I think Musk has blown this wide open.
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:37.740]  I had no idea that the CIA was implanted within Twitter. Almost certainly they're in Facebook and
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:44.140]  YouTube. Remember, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram still have full censorship and government false
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:50.460]  narrative operations going on. Twitter is open now, sub-stacks open, getter and choose social,
[02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:56.620]  I think, are fine. But by the way, America has learned a lot about censorship in the last three
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:41:02.780]  years. Well, and you know, we were almost under a misinterpretation here where we would say,
[02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:06.860]  hey, we'll just speak about Twitter because that's what we have the information on right now,
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:10.380]  thanks to Elon Musk. We'll just say, hey, Twitter was censoring me, Twitter was censoring me.
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:16.460]  But now we learn, actually, it was the FBI. Actually, it was the Democrats, Hillary Clinton,
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:20.700]  Adam Schiff, Mark Warner. I mean, here we thought it was big tech censorship,
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:25.340]  but what we kind of assumed was going on was some collusion. But now we know it was like,
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:31.740]  no, they were getting direct command from the FBI, from the Democrats to censor us on Twitter.
[02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:39.580]  I'm not sure if we may have just lost Dr. McCullough's feed here, guys. Did we lose Dr. McCullough?
[02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:45.820]  All right. Unfortunately, we have lost Dr. McCullough's feed. That's okay. We're getting into
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:48.620]  big information now. We've got a minute left of this segment. We're about to take a break. We'll
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:56.860]  get him back on. Folks, we're one vote away from another vote from McCarthy losing for a 13th
[02:41:56.860 --> 02:42:03.020]  time. However, he is getting more votes now than he has before. What's interesting, though, is,
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:08.460]  as far as I can tell right now, Donald's, Perry and Mace have all abstained. All right. We've got
[02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:12.460]  Dr. McCullough back with us. We're about to take a break anyway, Dr. McCullough. So just hold that
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:18.300]  thought. I'll re-ask the question. But folks, you know, I don't trust the healthcare industries.
[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:21.900]  I don't trust our government healthcare industries. And so that's why we have
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:27.980]  onlinehealthnow.com. And that's where you get access to uncensored content.
[02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:33.100]  You can schedule virtual appointments and speak with a medical doctor. You can get exclusive
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:38.220]  treatment packages. You can shop for online doctor approved supplements and so much more. So
[02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:41.900]  you don't trust. Maybe you don't want to go to that hospital. You don't want to hear from your
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:49.180]  government health agencies. Onlinehealthnow.com is the solution. And that is, of course, a partner
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:54.540]  of Dr. Peter McCullough's Wellness Company. So this is good news for healthcare in the country.
[02:42:54.540 --> 02:43:20.540]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:50.540]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:44:20.540]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:50.540]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:45:02.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:09.100]  of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum. Now, all three of these revolutionary
[02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:15.100]  products you see in front of you are already number one bestsellers in the market for the
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:19.900]  last few years because they work so well. We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners,
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:25.740]  the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:31.820]  products are found for under other names. And not just under one name, they sell these under three
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:37.260]  or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out. The difference is
[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:44.460]  we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:50.220]  Max Boost. We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would
[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:54.700]  suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare provider
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:57.420]  because they're so powerful. Get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:04.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place. I want to encourage you
[02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:08.860]  all to go to InfoWarsStore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong,
[02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:16.460]  high-quality formula. Gallon out, sleep support, liquid is very fast-acting, take another tongue.
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:22.300]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract,
[02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:27.820]  lemon balm, and German chamomile. All of these compounds are documented on record to help give
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:33.740]  you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep. And that is one of the biggest game changers out there
[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:37.740]  with all the stress we have in this world. And we've got some other great sleep aids as well,
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:41.660]  and they're excellent. They're all different formulas. But this one is particularly the
[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:47.180]  strongest one we have. So, Gallon out, sold out for more than five months. It's now back
[02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:53.500]  available at InfoWarsStore.com. So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system,
[02:46:53.500 --> 02:47:08.540]  and support the InfoWars with Gallon out, sleep support, and InfoWarsStore.
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:48:00.540]  it depends on how these individuals who haven't voted yet either vote or decide not to vote.
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:04.380]  So that's a developing situation. Now, back to Dr. Peter McCullough here.
[02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:09.820]  So we were under this impression, Dr. McCullough, that we were being censored by Twitter and we
[02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:13.820]  were being censored by these big tech companies. You know, we kind of had an idea that it might
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:20.300]  have been at the behest of the Democrats and the deep state just because they were doing
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:25.180]  their bidding. But now we find out, no, it was direct orders, not just not just them working
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:30.300]  in collusion or maybe just being synced up. No, they were under direct command from Democrats
[02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:35.660]  and government agencies to censor doctors and doctors like yourself and so many others.
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:40.780]  How does this change the perspective from you, a doctor that's been censored, or from all the
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:44.460]  doctors and others that have been censored to you? How does this change the story?
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:52.060]  This changes the calculus greatly because I am sure that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and others
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:57.020]  are going to say, listen, we were under U.S. government orders to do this. We were told
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:03.100]  to have this censorship. We were told specifically to block critical information on treatment
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:11.020]  protocols, on evolving information on vaccine safety. We were told to suppress this by the
[02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:16.060]  government. And so the key questions are, who gave these orders? The FBI agents are going to say,
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:21.580]  listen, we were under orders. And that question just has to keep going up the flagpole until we
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:28.940]  can see where this agenda starts. And also, to me, this now doesn't become an issue because
[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:33.820]  there are a bunch of lawsuits out there suing these big tech companies for the censorship. That
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:39.340]  is already ongoing. But this opens a whole other can of worms. I mean, there's no doubt now, in my
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:43.820]  eyes, this is a First Amendment violation. Twitter, these private companies can make the argument
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.420]  saying, hey, what about our First Amendment to censor? Maybe there's a fair argument there. But
[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:52.460]  when it comes to the government, that is strictly prohibited and forbidden. I mean, to me now,
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:57.420]  we're not just discussing a First Amendment violation as a possibility. We're discussing it
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:03.020]  as the case itself. And that to me is why this is getting more serious. Yeah, you want to argue,
[02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:06.460]  does a private company have the right to censor somebody on their platform? Fair argument.
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:11.980]  But the government running that for them? This, to me, is a totally different argument. And I
[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:16.860]  know you're focused on your work dealing with the healthcare problems right now and the COVID-19
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:20.700]  vaccine and everything. But I mean, have you heard from lawyers or other doctors? I mean,
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:25.260]  are we looking at new lawsuits potentially? Because we now learn with the Twitter files that
[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:32.060]  no, it was actually our government calling for us to be censored. So two elements here, Owen,
[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:40.060]  one is Twitter and their culpability. And the concept here is state actor. And the legal
[02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:49.340]  threshold is, did they have substantial encouragement to impede or infringe upon
[02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:55.180]  our civil rights? And I think that answer has already been given that, in fact, they were
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:51:00.300]  actually told to do that. And the second issue now is that the government can be sued. The
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:05.660]  government can be sued for taking away people's civil rights. I think it's going to open up the
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:12.780]  door now. See, this is outside of the Care Act and the Prep Act. This is beyond any type of
[02:51:12.780 --> 02:51:17.740]  indemnification of the crisis and the pandemic. Now this boils down to civil liberties.
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:25.580]  Now, look, there is good news in all of this, bad news, because there is a massive awakening.
[02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:31.260]  I would imagine that the number of doctors that have come out to speak about this is
[02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:37.100]  like quintupled or maybe even more than that since you first began. I mean, we just saw 17,000
[02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:43.180]  doctors warning about the COVID-19 vaccine, a far stretch from where it was when the vaccine first
[02:51:43.180 --> 02:51:48.140]  came out. But so there is some good news, including solutions. Hey, you don't want to go to the hospital,
[02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:52.620]  you don't trust that hospital anymore. Believe me, I get it. I'm the same way. You don't want to take
[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:56.620]  health advice from our government institutions that have lied to us so much. I get it. Believe me,
[02:51:56.620 --> 02:52:02.780]  I'm the same way. So we've started onlinehealthnow.com, partnered with the wellness company and you,
[02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:10.060]  Dr. Peter McCullough. Talk about onlinehealthnow.com, because to me, this is revolutionary to healthcare
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:15.260]  in America. But more importantly, it's a solution to those that have lost complete faith and trust
[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:21.660]  in our healthcare institutions. It's true. I'm really thrilled to be the chief scientific officer
[02:52:21.660 --> 02:52:29.100]  of the wellness company. It is providing really just-in-time healthcare as a cell phone app and
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:35.820]  has providers, doctors, pharmacists, and others to help. It's very affordable with a low monthly
[02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:41.180]  subscription rate. And the supplements are a combination, so they're wonderfully priced in
[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:48.700]  terms of what you get. But importantly, this is free of the influence of Big Pharma, free of
[02:52:48.700 --> 02:52:54.140]  insurance companies trying to tell doctors what to do. Many patients are seeking exemptions from
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:59.100]  these vaccines. Many of them are seeking alternative solutions from Big Pharma. It's all here at the
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:07.420]  wellness company. Now, to me, this is how we can get faith back in any sort of healthcare out there,
[02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:12.940]  because I hear it all the time. Hey, I don't want to go to the hospital. I've got this thing going
[02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:16.860]  on. I don't want to go to the hospital. Hey, the government recommends this treatment for this
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:21.420]  problem I have, but I don't trust the government. They've lied to me so much. And so this is a
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:26.620]  solution for those people. And also, though, I think the real challenge is not just to give the
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:31.020]  peer-to-peer access and not to just give the people a solution to their problems, but also the
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:36.380]  larger problem of the complete lack of trust, the complete lack of believing in anyone from the
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:40.620]  healthcare industry. You're really trying to save that here. I mean, we're trying to restore faith
[02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:47.820]  in this. Right. After three years of hardship and complaints, we're trying to do something
[02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:53.500]  constructive, Owen, that people can look to and say, you know what, this is a solution. Now,
[02:53:54.620 --> 02:54:00.860]  the company is new. Others are coming along as well, and we'll have progress. But what we're
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:06.380]  offering America and hopefully the world will be an alternative, another choice. People have felt
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:10.540]  locked in. And you know what was the straw that broke the camel's back? Because people were told
[02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:16.620]  they had to take a vaccine in order to have a procedure done or to have an office visit.
[02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:20.540]  And that was the line that I think that people were not willing to cross.
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:28.060]  And of course, after all of that, after all the demands to wear the mask and take the vaccine,
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:31.260]  and people couldn't even get treatments. Like you said, I mean, you couldn't even go get a
[02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:35.260]  treatment. You couldn't go to the hospital. I know people that had this issue personally.
[02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:40.060]  Oh, you're not vaccinated. No life saving treatment for you. I mean, wow, as evil as that is,
[02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:45.180]  completely against a hypocritic oath. But so now we're here. And I kind of bring this back to
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:51.340]  the situation where, oh, you're not allowed to know about the NFL player that a cardiac arrest.
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:56.300]  Don't you dare ask about his vaccine status, but oh, you want to go to a concert or a ball game?
[02:54:56.300 --> 02:55:00.220]  Well, you better let us know. You better wear the barcode to let us know that you've had the vaccine
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:04.780]  status. I mean, is there any way? I mean, is this the way we try to level this playing field and
[02:55:04.780 --> 02:55:12.300]  balance this back out again? I think what we do is we basically pound like a sledgehammer,
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:18.380]  and we work to garner public support. I really think that the only court that's open is the
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:24.620]  court of public opinion. You know, we now have some sweeping sources of information. You know,
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:32.700]  our CDC says that only 13% of people are taking boosters of any type. That means 87% of people
[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:37.340]  said, listen, they're done with this. You know, there's one group that could have theoretically
[02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:41.900]  benefited from vaccines. Theoretically, and that was nursing home workers. I've recently
[02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:48.300]  reported on my substack from CDC data, only 10% of nursing home workers are taking vaccines.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:55.420]  I am telling you, people have lost their trust. I see it everywhere. And the only places that are
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:56:03.740]  trying to restore that trust or uplift these now defunct, in my view, healthcare government agencies
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:07.820]  are the very establishments that promoted them from the beginning. I mean, do you ever see a
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:12.700]  situation here? I think there's a lot of guilt where a lot of people that promoted the vaccine,
[02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:18.620]  whether it be on television or elsewhere, they kind of feel guilt, but also embarrassment in
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:21.660]  that they don't want to admit that they were conned or they don't want to admit that they were
[02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:26.860]  part of conning you. As far as doctors are concerned, have you seen any flipping there from doctors
[02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:31.260]  that maybe feel bad about this and have changed their tune? There sure is. You know, there's a
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:38.860]  very prominent UK cardiologist, Dr. Asim Malhotra. He was promoting the vaccines on Good Morning Britain.
[02:56:39.660 --> 02:56:44.540]  It turns out his dad took the vaccine. He thinks his dad died due to the vaccine. His dad was a
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:50.060]  prominent doctor. He spent a long time, I worked with him for over a year to try to come to grips
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:55.100]  with this, about how could he support this, ultimately lose his father and make such a
[02:56:55.100 --> 02:57:00.460]  giant public health mistake as a public figure. He published two analyses that came out in the
[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:05.340]  peer review literature. They have not been challenged. He made his own independent conclusions
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:11.100]  that the vaccines aren't safe, and he's joined me and others in a very vocal call to pull the
[02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:16.540]  vaccines off the market worldwide. Wow. And that's big news. And this is just the dominoes beginning
[02:57:16.540 --> 02:57:21.100]  to fall here. I see the momentum going the right way on this. Remember, folks, you've lost all
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:26.540]  faith in the healthcare institutions, maybe even your own doctor for promoting the COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:31.340]  There's a solution for you. OnlineHealthNow.com partnered with Dr. Peter McCullough and the

[03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:17.980]  I'm sitting here being gas lit by Joe Biden on January 6th. And I'm just, I'm the frustration
[03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:21.900]  and the anger because I'm being lied about. I'm being slandered by this, by this crook
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:31.260]  and the rest of the media. And I'm sitting here listening to this and I'm just like,
[03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:35.340]  I can't go, I can't go back on air and do the show like this. I'm not in the right mental state
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:41.100]  after being gas lit by Joe Biden and the media like this. And so I was like, well, I got to do
[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:45.740]  another hour. And so I'm thinking, well, okay, just, just remove yourself, remove your emotion,
[03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:50.300]  and just come on here and just read headlines or open up the phone lines because there's just no way
[03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:54.460]  I'm going to be able to be good and effective with the gas lighting that Joe Biden just did to me
[03:00:54.460 --> 03:01:01.340]  personally right here with his January 6th speech. And then I'm listening to it and he provides the
[03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:07.340]  perfect antidote to get me back into being okay mentally to come on air because he's reading
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:12.780]  off his teleprompter and we have another end of quote moment. And I'm going to play it for you.
[03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:16.860]  So he's out here, he says, thousands of insurrectionists were hunting down politicians,
[03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:21.180]  trying to kill them, thousands of insurrectionists tried to overthrow our democracy, all just lies,
[03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:28.140]  lies, lies, and they know it's all lies. And then folks, I got to be honest with you here,
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:35.020]  you know, I'm just sitting here watching this speaker vote. And I realized something that
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:39.180]  just happened and I'm not going to go to air with it because I don't want to help the Democrats out.
[03:01:39.740 --> 03:01:46.620]  But I'm just sitting here and I realized, folks, our politicians are idiots. They really are stupid.
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:54.060]  I really don't even want to tell you what I just discovered in regards to the 13th vote.
[03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:59.100]  But you just realize, it's like, why does Kevin McCarthy keep, why did he say he had the votes
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:03.820]  when he didn't? And you did, our politicians, I don't know if it's just laziness, or if they're
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:09.420]  really that stupid, maybe a combination of both. But let me just put it this way. Both sides of
[03:02:09.420 --> 03:02:15.980]  the aisle have completely blown this entire speaker vote multiple times, just completely blown it.
[03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:20.620]  And I'm just going to tell you, I already realized what could have happened with the Republicans,
[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:24.300]  what could have happened with the Republicans, and that's gone away and that's fine. And I just
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:27.980]  realized what could have happened with the Democrats. And there's no way they, I mean,
[03:02:27.980 --> 03:02:31.260]  I don't know how they didn't realize what they just missed the vote on. And I'm going to stop right
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:35.260]  there. I'm just going to stop right there because I don't want to see the worst happen here.
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:43.020]  But wow, our politicians are stupid. And wow, Fox News is disingenuous.
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:48.220]  They still won't admit McCarthy just lost the 13th vote. Now, having said that,
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:54.140]  really, this vote almost doesn't matter because even though this is the closest McCarthy has come,
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:58.860]  there were, I think, six Republicans that didn't even vote. And I think there were a couple
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:03.740]  of Democrats that didn't vote either. The thing is just completely crazy. And apparently,
[03:03:03.740 --> 03:03:09.500]  there's some attending this January 6 thing. But quickly, so Joe Biden here lying again. And also,
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:13.740]  I want you to notice Joe Biden is sick again as well. Joe Biden is currently sick. You can hear
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:18.220]  it in his voice. Something is wrong in him. He's ill. But I'm sitting here being gaslit like,
[03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:22.620]  all right, just calm down, lower your blood pressure, don't get upset. You got to host one
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:26.700]  more hour, just open phones or just read headlines and just don't get too emotional and start ranting.
[03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:34.060]  Okay. And then, and then he gives me the perfect laugh as he flubs it again and reads directly
[03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:40.060]  off the teleprompter. See if you pick it up. Here's Joe Biden. Did not flinch. We the people
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:46.460]  endured. We the people prevailed. And this day of remembrance joined by the vice president of
[03:03:46.460 --> 03:03:53.100]  the second gentleman and all of you. We honor a remarkable group of Americans who embodied the
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:04:02.140]  best before, during, and after January the sixth, 2021. For the first time in my presidency,
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:07.420]  I'm bestowing the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of our nation's highest
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:13.500]  mystic guys, and honors and recognizes, quote, citizens of the United States of America, who
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:19.980]  have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. End of quote.
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:25.980]  Yes. In a few moments, in a few moments, the full citation read end of quote. Like,
[03:04:25.980 --> 03:04:29.980]  was he supposed to read that? Was he supposed to read end of quote?
[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:35.340]  You can hear he's also unhealthy. You can hear in his voice. Folks, this is just I just
[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:40.940]  can't believe how corrupt our media is. I can't believe how corrupt our government is. I just
[03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:51.820]  can't believe it. It's so bad. It's just it's so bad. And now Ashley Babbitt's mother gets arrested
[03:04:51.820 --> 03:05:05.900]  on the two-year anniversary of her daughter getting killed in cold blood and their killer walks free.

[03:06:06.220 --> 03:06:11.980]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. You know, I gotta tell you that listening to this
[03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:15.660]  Biden speech and I was listening to it in the break and I told the crew just to turn it off because
[03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:25.100]  I just can't take it. You know? This is the real question. Forget about this House vote.
[03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:29.260]  Forget about January 6th. Forget about all this other news we've covered today and the news I'll
[03:06:29.260 --> 03:06:32.780]  cover here coming up. Just forget about all of it for a second. Forget about whether you're a
[03:06:32.780 --> 03:06:35.900]  Republican Democrat. Just try to forget about all of it. Forget about what you think about me
[03:06:36.540 --> 03:06:40.620]  or InfoWars or Alex Jones or anybody. Just try to just clear your mind.
[03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:43.820]  And let's just try to get on the same page because
[03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:52.060]  you know, I'm just reminded today just how corrupt our country has really become.
[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:59.100]  Just how absolutely corrupt almost all of our government institutions have become.
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:09.580]  And it's so bad. The lies they tell without any remorse, just total unmitigated lying from their
[03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:15.260]  mouth every single day. Same with the TV media. And they just don't even care.
[03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:21.900]  And I guess we don't care either. I don't believe that. There is no, folks, this is,
[03:07:22.460 --> 03:07:28.780]  I just, I'm just at a loss. I'm just at a loss without corrupt our government and our politicians
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:34.060]  and our media is. And it's, yeah, I know that. You know that. Like, duh, that's why I'm here
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:40.060]  at InfoWars. That's why you're here listening. But it's just today is one of those reminders
[03:07:40.060 --> 03:07:45.660]  where it just really is hitting me now. It is really just hitting me now.
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:53.500]  We are really in a dark, twisted, corrupt place right now as a country and as a people.
[03:07:55.340 --> 03:08:01.100]  And it can't go on forever, folks. I mean, this level of corruption doesn't go on forever. I mean,
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:07.900]  you either end up starving out on the streets with nothing or this country is going to collapse
[03:08:07.900 --> 03:08:13.180]  in ways that we just can't even imagine. And maybe that's a good thing. You know, I just,
[03:08:14.700 --> 03:08:20.380]  I don't want to see that. I like America. I like this country. I like the people. I like
[03:08:20.380 --> 03:08:23.820]  everything we've built and accomplished and offered the world. And I mean,
[03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:32.940]  I mean, it's just incredible how corrupt our country is. It's incredible how our media just
[03:08:32.940 --> 03:08:39.420]  lies to us every day and they know they're lying. Joe Biden gets up there and just lies to the
[03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:51.820]  American people. Just lies to you. It's sick. It's demonic. And I'm just, it really just hits heavy
[03:08:51.820 --> 03:08:57.100]  because when you sit here and listen to all the lies that Joe Biden is telling at this
[03:08:57.740 --> 03:09:06.300]  big grandstanding January 6th ceremony and you look at the fraud of the anti police left
[03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:11.580]  that rioted for months on end because George Floyd overdosed on fentanyl while he was getting
[03:09:11.580 --> 03:09:16.860]  arrested and died and they burned cities to the ground and told you how bad police are. And then
[03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:22.380]  a police officer shoots an unarmed veteran and kills her in cold blood and he walks free, not a
[03:09:22.380 --> 03:09:26.540]  single riot. And now on the two-year anniversary of that, the mother gets arrested for jaywalking
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:32.700]  in DC. And then I have to sit here and listen to Joe Biden lie about the whole thing. The president
[03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:38.220]  supposedly. See, it's already, see, that's why I can't, I'm getting too emotional here. So I'm
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:41.500]  just going to leave it there, folks. This is the most corrupt our country has ever been.
[03:09:41.500 --> 03:09:49.020]  And I just prayed a God. I just prayed a God there is some way out of this for us.
[03:09:54.220 --> 03:10:00.700]  And it's not Kevin McCarthy, a speaker. And that's the problem. And that's the damn problem.
[03:10:00.700 --> 03:10:11.340]  I hope I'm wrong about Kevin McCarthy, but I doubt it. I doubt it. And I also suspect
[03:10:13.420 --> 03:10:19.820]  that the 14th vote will happen tonight. And it might be the one that confirms McCarthy.
[03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:27.740]  I don't know what these Republicans that didn't vote in the last one are doing behind the scenes,
[03:10:27.740 --> 03:10:31.580]  but I doubt it's anything else but deciding to vote for McCarthy.
[03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:38.620]  And that would put him ahead. He was just two votes shy, I think, in the last vote.
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:41.660]  And it's funny, you watch the media, they won't even tell you any of this. Like,
[03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:45.180]  Fox won't even tell you the new threshold. They wouldn't tell you the Republicans who voted for
[03:10:45.180 --> 03:10:49.900]  him or didn't vote for them. And then they just say, oh, McCarthy appears to lose 13th vote.
[03:10:49.900 --> 03:10:53.340]  Oh, Republican elect flips votes. Like, they don't tell you the name. They don't tell you
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:59.260]  the threshold. They don't tell you he lost. Just this whole thing is just this sick exercise
[03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:05.420]  to make sure that the people are uninformed and uninspired. And our duty and our motivation
[03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:10.060]  and mission is the exact opposite. I want you to be inspired and I want you to be informed.
[03:11:11.020 --> 03:11:15.100]  And then it's like every other media outlet and all the government wants you to do is be
[03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:24.940]  uninformed and uninspired. I've been hit so hard with a gaslight punch from Joe Biden listening.
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:29.580]  I shouldn't even have listened to his speech. It just, it's so disgusting. It's so demonic.
[03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:36.140]  It's so twisted because this is our world. This is our reality. Really? Really? That's
[03:11:36.140 --> 03:11:40.220]  humanity. That's the human life experience that God intended that I have to sit here and listen
[03:11:40.220 --> 03:11:46.860]  to my president lie to my face over and over again and then the media just picks it up and
[03:11:46.860 --> 03:11:54.700]  runs with it. I can't. I don't know. Let me just start picking up and putting down headlines because
[03:11:54.700 --> 03:12:02.860]  I'm just, it's just really hitting me hard. How evil it all is, how corrupted all is. I'm just
[03:12:02.860 --> 03:12:07.660]  really, I've been, I've been completely thrown off kilter. I literally, I can't even read right now.
[03:12:07.660 --> 03:12:09.980]  I can't even freaking read, man.
[03:12:13.420 --> 03:12:17.100]  Literally, I can't even read guys. Is there like a special report or something? I need to, I need to,
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:19.500]  I need to hit my reset button here.
[03:12:23.500 --> 03:12:25.900]  Go guys, go ahead and give me a couple minutes here. I can't,
[03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:31.500]  I need to, I need to meditate or say a quick prayer. This is just too much corruption for me
[03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:36.860]  to deal with in a week. Just give me a second here. We have a player down on the court. We'll
[03:12:36.860 --> 03:12:42.060]  try to get more information. Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee

[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:52.860]  just a coincidence, a terrible coincidence at that, but just a coincidence. Yes, just a coincidence.

[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:03.340]  and that is when doctors found out he had two blood clots inside his brain. Doctors baffled

[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:43.420]  basketball practice. He died a short time later. A South Carolina high school football player has

[03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:27.020]  that's slapping me in the face right now and it's like oh yeah I forgot our government makes viruses
[03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:31.420]  in the lab to kill us our government makes vaccines and tell us they're safe and effective and then
[03:14:31.420 --> 03:14:36.700]  kills us and I'm literally sitting here like all right let me just see if I can pick up and put
[03:14:36.700 --> 03:14:43.500]  down the news I literally can't even do it I'm so I've been hit so heavily with this corruption
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:48.780]  today I can't even pick up and put down the news folks I can't even do it so I'm probably I'll take
[03:14:48.780 --> 03:14:53.580]  the break and see if maybe I can refocus and reset but I just tried to do it in the two minutes I
[03:14:53.580 --> 03:14:58.940]  can't even do it so I may just open up the phone lines in the meantime folks look I'm sitting here

[03:20:31.980 --> 03:20:38.780]  though kevin mccarthy inches closer to becoming speaker he still has obstacles in front of him

[03:24:53.420 --> 03:24:59.420]  stage that people are fleeing from fleeing from the crime and the corruption and the degradation
[03:25:00.380 --> 03:25:06.300]  they can't get out soon enough and now it's going to get worse and you all know why not just the
[03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:12.940]  ease on crime but joe biden to grant mass amnesty and work permits to 30 000 new illegal immigrants
[03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:18.460]  in one month steven miller demands house jp opened its impeachment inquiry immediately
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:21.740]  we should have steven miller as speaker of the house how about that for a nomination
[03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:28.380]  plan to house former migrants at former chicago excuse me plan to house migrants at
[03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:33.580]  former chicago school delayed i mean community pushback mayor says city is at maximum capacity
[03:25:33.580 --> 03:25:37.180]  oh you don't like all the illegal immigrants coming in then close our border
[03:25:37.180 --> 03:25:44.220]  and by the way they're shutting down schools now to put illegal immigrants in them and the community
[03:25:44.220 --> 03:25:49.740]  says what gives well what gives is that your government cares more about non-citizens than you
[03:25:50.860 --> 03:25:56.780]  but i'm sure it'll go fine right or maybe not 70 percent of berlin's new year's eve riders are
[03:25:56.780 --> 03:26:02.620]  migrants that's nice why is it always new years why are they always running around committing crimes
[03:26:02.620 --> 03:26:07.500]  and raping women on new years seriously it's a story every year in europe migrants illegal
[03:26:07.500 --> 03:26:11.900]  immigrants raping women rioting committing crimes every year on new years very very odd
[03:26:11.900 --> 03:26:17.660]  keeps happening pope benedict warned against western self-hatred and depopulation well he's
[03:26:17.660 --> 03:26:22.220]  gone but we are still witnessing what he warned about aren't we aren't we indeed
[03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:31.660]  you know the democrats all gathered this morning in dc to have a prayer because you know january
[03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:39.180]  6th and it was a lesbian priest that gave the prayer and they were all there on the steps
[03:26:40.860 --> 03:26:45.180]  perpetuating the big lies about january 6th and then biden does it again today
[03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:51.740]  and then even every news channel including fox news covered the democrats lying about january 6th
[03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:55.740]  whether it was biden or all the democrats and their lesbian priests praying today it's funny
[03:26:55.740 --> 03:26:59.740]  they they love prayer when when they're doing it with their lesbian priests but when you talk about
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:06.620]  christian values and prayer they hate it and just a reminder from mario presents official
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:11.980]  folks it wasn't just washington dc with a million trump supporters out there acting peacefully

[03:27:18.220 --> 03:27:25.340]  peacefully rallying as well so let's not forget about that every state capital building on january
[03:27:25.340 --> 03:27:33.580]  6 2021 had thousands of trump supporters peacefully rallying just like they did in dc but of course

[03:33:04.780 --> 03:33:22.460]  broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex
[03:33:22.460 --> 03:33:28.940]  jones show and now your host oen shroyer well i'm actually surprised but it looks like the
[03:33:28.940 --> 03:33:37.660]  answer vote to adjourn is going to win i thought that the macarthe ice would press forward as
[03:33:37.660 --> 03:33:42.860]  close as they are now to getting victory but instead it looks like the adjourn is going to win here
[03:33:44.700 --> 03:33:52.140]  and so uh we may not get a 14th vote today quickly here who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline and
[03:33:52.140 --> 03:34:01.820]  why does no one care well the answer is uh the same to both of those questions america now that
[03:34:01.820 --> 03:34:06.380]  might not be totally accurate but they probably gave the green light to whoever did it because they
[03:34:06.380 --> 03:34:09.900]  wanted to start a war with russia so who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline and why does no one care
[03:34:09.900 --> 03:34:15.500]  well no one cares because it was meant to be a false flag to blame russia to start a war with russia
[03:34:15.500 --> 03:34:21.100]  but that didn't go so well so all of a sudden the who done it isn't relevant you see it was only
[03:34:21.100 --> 03:34:25.580]  relevant if they could blame russia but since they couldn't blame russia they didn't get away
[03:34:25.580 --> 03:34:29.900]  with that lie now all of a sudden who blew it up doesn't matter it wasn't about the Nord Stream
[03:34:29.900 --> 03:34:35.260]  pipeline it was about starting a war with russia a la Gulf of Tonkin to start the war in Vietnam
[03:34:36.300 --> 03:34:43.020]  some good news before i go into the calls here though texas abortions drop to zero saving up
[03:34:43.020 --> 03:34:52.540]  to 5700 babies a month texas abortions drop to zero saving 5700 babies a month way to go texas
[03:34:52.540 --> 03:34:59.420]  and all the other anti-abortion states that have saved now tens of thousands of babies lives that
[03:34:59.420 --> 03:35:04.620]  the democrats and the liberals wanted to snuff out in the womb good for us here in texas and to
[03:35:04.620 --> 03:35:08.860]  the other states where abortion rates are now going down to zero we are literally saving lives
[03:35:08.860 --> 03:35:13.740]  that's some good news here today all right let's take some phone calls on the speaker
[03:35:13.740 --> 03:35:21.340]  race here which i think is now going to adjourn let's start with tony in illinois tony you're
[03:35:21.340 --> 03:35:29.660]  on the alex joneshow go ahead hi uh oh and how are you doing good thanks uh yes uh can you hear

[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:41.980]  tony sisneros i ran for congress five times several times in the past so i know all about
[03:35:41.980 --> 03:35:47.100]  what's going on in dc and i just wanted to let everybody know the whole world know it's about
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:51.340]  money and it's about power you should know that i should know that but the democrats saw that they
[03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:55.580]  lost the house so they're trying to regain it via the speaker seat that's why they're all pushing
[03:35:55.580 --> 03:36:02.620]  for jeffrey you copy now so we have to choose between whether we want the democrats to continue
[03:36:02.620 --> 03:36:08.940]  to control or at least have a uh rhino republican which is a half half donkey or half ass if you
[03:36:08.940 --> 03:36:16.860]  want to say uh influence in the uh i love that that's a half ass republican it's a half ass

[03:36:21.580 --> 03:36:28.540]  there you go you got it you got it now if we know world history english history or american history
[03:36:28.540 --> 03:36:36.620]  okay we know that behind every man's politics it is religion okay i'm throwing a hint here
[03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:43.420]  okay now there was a man in history american history known as thomas nas he was the one who
[03:36:43.420 --> 03:36:49.500]  came up he was a cartoonist he was also a journalist and he came up with the concept of the republicans
[03:36:49.500 --> 03:36:57.020]  are elephants and the democrats are donkey he also had many many cartoons uh revealing
[03:36:57.020 --> 03:37:01.420]  tipping his hand on who's trying to invade america this is an invasion of america
[03:37:01.420 --> 03:37:08.540]  we know it's a communist globalist socialist uh uh invasion okay totalitarian the tyrannical uh
[03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:15.740]  uh uh satanic occultic invasion okay it goes be extinct we start definitely involved in this
[03:37:15.740 --> 03:37:20.220]  and for the witches and and and the powers enforcement in kingdom in kingdom of dark all right
[03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:24.460]  at tony well that's two minutes i you're you're a great caller you got a lot of great facts but
[03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:28.860]  i really wanted to just stick on the issue of the house vote today and i said two minutes max
[03:37:28.860 --> 03:37:33.660]  so i gotta drop you uh but but thank you for the call let's go to josh in new jersey josh
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:41.020]  you're on the air go ahead oh and shroyer how are you today hi good thanks um here are the thoughts
[03:37:41.660 --> 03:37:49.580]  from the northeast on this map we have a bunch of children playing in a playbox trying to grab
[03:37:49.580 --> 03:37:54.780]  the same shovel that everybody else is using and it's because we have no morals and no values
[03:37:55.420 --> 03:38:00.300]  this is not going to end well if we don't get a proper speaker of the house because remember
[03:38:00.300 --> 03:38:06.860]  that speaker of the house is third in line for the presidency and we see the his shovel degenerate
[03:38:07.660 --> 03:38:14.700]  biden and his clown vice president we got to get somebody in there man i don't know what to tell
[03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:20.620]  people uh anymore because everything that i've spoken about that you guys have spoken about
[03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:26.860]  has come true 100 and people are still too stupid to realize it i don't know if there's
[03:38:26.860 --> 03:38:31.740]  a i don't know if we're salvaging this place anymore man i really don't i hope we do but
[03:38:31.740 --> 03:38:39.260]  if we don't get somebody in there like that gentlemen from florida um we're in trouble and
[03:38:39.260 --> 03:38:43.660]  you know here's the one thing here's the one thing i would say if i was gonna make a concession
[03:38:43.660 --> 03:38:50.700]  from the holdout side i would say all right look if we if we want to trust mccarthy
[03:38:51.980 --> 03:38:57.580]  and we want to make sure we salvage this speakership from getting maybe a democrat in
[03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:02.220]  there or something else that could go wrong then okay fine but the one thing they cannot concede
[03:39:02.860 --> 03:39:09.820]  is that we need to have the one uh one representative ouster rule that has been in place forever
[03:39:09.820 --> 03:39:17.580]  until nancy pelosi changed the rules last session so if mccarthy goes sideways goes rogue doesn't do
[03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:22.940]  what he said he would do all it takes is one person to oust him that's the one thing they cannot
[03:39:22.940 --> 03:39:29.180]  concede on i agree with you man but i don't know what these folks are going to do i don't think
[03:39:29.180 --> 03:39:33.420]  it's the blind leading the blind anymore and it's embarrassing and it's quite frankly it's
[03:39:33.420 --> 03:39:38.620]  scary because if we lose any more power and any more respect in this country we're screwed completely
[03:39:38.620 --> 03:39:43.820]  agree and and and you know today has been a reminder of that i've got hope from the republican holdouts
[03:39:43.820 --> 03:39:47.740]  but they're losing ground and then with all the people dying from the vaccines that they
[03:39:47.740 --> 03:39:51.820]  don't want to tell you and the cardiac arrest and then just the corruption and the lies about
[03:39:51.820 --> 03:39:56.540]  january 6 i mean it's just it's just a reminder of how bad things really are but they have officially
[03:39:56.540 --> 03:40:06.220]  adjourned uh until later tonight so we won't get an update we won't get an update till later tonight
[03:40:06.220 --> 03:40:10.620]  josh thank you for the call let's go to robert in chicago robert you're on the alex joneshow
[03:40:10.620 --> 03:40:16.220]  you're on the air go ahead well i agree with both the previous callers but i'd like to just go over
[03:40:16.220 --> 03:40:21.260]  a short list while there's a long list and i'm sure we could build on it of why i'm a no vote for
[03:40:21.260 --> 03:40:27.820]  mccarthy uh you know that the 30 million dollars you took from the ftx script uh crypto scandal
[03:40:27.820 --> 03:40:32.780]  that he withheld the fed funds from america first candidate that's right and that's what they're
[03:40:32.780 --> 03:40:37.260]  trying to do by the way and just so people are clear that's one of the things that the holdouts
[03:40:37.260 --> 03:40:41.900]  are not willing to concede on they don't want the g.o.p and the big money donors getting involved
[03:40:41.900 --> 03:40:49.180]  in primary races so mccarthy can't do that again exactly another one him and his wife wind and
[03:40:49.180 --> 03:40:53.420]  dine with claus schwaab and waiting for him and frank wants a dinner with claus schwaab i didn't
[03:40:53.420 --> 03:40:57.500]  know he and frank wants we're eating with what when it went in him and let's have dinner both him
[03:40:57.500 --> 03:41:03.340]  and his wife spoke at world economic forum look it up it's out there um another one national pulse
[03:41:03.340 --> 03:41:11.020]  dot com not to compete with info wars they have an article supposedly kevin mccarthy has a luxury
[03:41:11.020 --> 03:41:18.460]  rental firm and the largest shareholder is mousy dunes grandson i can't say it's true but is that
[03:41:18.460 --> 03:41:23.900]  natalie winter story yeah i believe it is a natalie she does great work covering the chinese
[03:41:23.900 --> 03:41:29.340]  communists i like the national pulse i like uh i like to sound that's true then we got mcconnell's
[03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:35.820]  family tied to the chinese and both speakerships and both of them we weren't in big trouble yeah
[03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:43.660]  major trouble failed to address the voter fraud in 2020 2022 raff newton yesterday yesterday raff
[03:41:43.660 --> 03:41:49.740]  newton had a poll national poll less than 40 percent or or yeah less than less than half is
[03:41:49.740 --> 03:41:57.980]  what the title is less than half of glp voters would support mccarthy so oh i would say it's like
[03:41:58.620 --> 03:42:03.580]  again i can open up the phone lines i could take calls for days and not find a republican voter
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:09.900]  that likes kevin mccarthy so and then obviously he's going to continue giving money to ukraine
[03:42:09.900 --> 03:42:13.340]  he's he never of course he is and that's another one so thank you for the call robert i'm sorry i
[03:42:13.340 --> 03:42:18.700]  gotta jump but see that's another one and that's why they cannot concede on the one person ouster
[03:42:18.700 --> 03:42:23.420]  if they concede everything else fine they cannot concede the one person ouster because the minute
[03:42:23.420 --> 03:42:27.900]  mccarthy starts going for money for ukraine again get him out now the caller brought up this story
[03:42:27.900 --> 03:42:33.180]  in the national pulse from natalie winters about mccarthy's ties to china but guys it was in the
[03:42:33.180 --> 03:42:38.460]  new york times can we put that back on the screen here before we go to break new york times kevin
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:44.460]  mccarthy's business ties complicate his rise to power the land to land the house speaker position
[03:42:44.460 --> 03:42:49.180]  the californian republican will have to win over opponents who question his ties to silicon valley
[03:42:49.180 --> 03:42:52.460]  and his commitment to right wing causes so i don't know if that one gets into the china issue
[03:42:52.460 --> 03:42:53.580]  uh we'll look more into that
[03:42:57.580 --> 03:43:03.100]  good news and some bad news on multiple fronts the good news is vitamin mineral fusion and dna
[03:43:03.100 --> 03:43:10.700]  force plus are still 50 off the bad news is they're very close to selling out and by monday of next

[03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:26.060]  it's bad news because they're about to be sold out because they're also some of our best selling
[03:43:26.060 --> 03:43:31.500]  products and we don't have them we can't find the operation so it is a real conundrum but that's

[03:44:00.380 --> 03:44:05.900]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[03:44:05.900 --> 03:44:10.620]  holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[03:44:10.620 --> 03:44:15.580]  was the original survival skill the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you
[03:44:15.580 --> 03:44:19.180]  came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited

[03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:30.540]  brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the
[03:44:30.540 --> 03:44:35.740]  course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously took basically all of your

[03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:45.020]  it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[03:44:45.020 --> 03:44:49.660]  is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[03:44:49.660 --> 03:44:54.860]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much

[03:48:36.460 --> 03:48:41.660]  economic forum and that brings in you will know a horari where humans free will is gone that's
[03:48:41.660 --> 03:48:46.140]  why this whole thing the votes i don't think it's relevant anymore because the human free will is
[03:48:46.140 --> 03:48:51.980]  gone we can now track people under the skin with the graphene oxide and the 5g millimeter ways that
[03:48:51.980 --> 03:48:58.220]  are going through now a quick timeline of 2000 years adam and eve to abraham 2000 years abraham
[03:48:58.220 --> 03:49:03.660]  was a physical circumcision of the flesh to signify that they were with god abraham to jesus
[03:49:03.660 --> 03:49:10.140]  2000 years jesus to the return of jesus my guess will be 2000 years but if you go backwards in time
[03:49:10.140 --> 03:49:17.420]  right now 2000 years jesus christ is alive he's on the planet he's 24 years old he begins ministering
[03:49:17.420 --> 03:49:24.060]  at the year of 20 20 29 or 2030 he'll be 30 years old and he begins ministering for his three and a
[03:49:24.060 --> 03:49:29.340]  half years all these guys the world economic forum claus schwaub all of them are saying the rise of
[03:49:29.340 --> 03:49:37.180]  the uber man the new age man comes in 20 29 or 2030 that runs exactly in timeline with the first
[03:49:37.180 --> 03:49:43.740]  three and a half years of the of the ministering of jesus christ on the planet and all these guys
[03:49:43.740 --> 03:49:49.340]  all the tech that's out there everything that they're talking about i mean we we have the 20 29
[03:49:49.900 --> 03:49:54.780]  it's it why are they saying this timeline if they know exactly well it's certainly interesting and
[03:49:54.780 --> 03:49:59.660]  just to add a little bit more to that you know they've changed the calendars in the days and
[03:49:59.660 --> 03:50:02.860]  everything in the months so many times who even knows that the calendars we have are the same
[03:50:02.860 --> 03:50:08.300]  that we had then but um brine i thank you for the call very important uh information they're very
[03:50:08.300 --> 03:50:13.500]  interesting to think about uh on the larger scale away from just us politics but on the large world
[03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:18.140]  human scale uh let's now go to josh in georgia josh you're on the air go ahead
[03:50:22.540 --> 03:50:30.620]  on a shout out to the uh x2 shout out to the uh brain force and uh on this mccarty vote man i
[03:50:30.620 --> 03:50:35.900]  just want to say i hate to have everybody swallow a huge blackbill but you know deep down inside
[03:50:35.900 --> 03:50:40.460]  that he's going to get it and thank god there's six people that are going to stand up and actually
[03:50:40.460 --> 03:50:44.780]  fight for something that the american people deserve and it's disgusting what these people
[03:50:44.780 --> 03:50:50.460]  are doing to our country it's disgusting where the laughing stock of the entire world i'm sick of it
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:55.820]  i'm tired of these politicians and 2023 is going to be the year that you see these people that took
[03:50:55.820 --> 03:51:02.540]  the covid vaccine start dropping like flies and this is all disgusting and i'm pissed dude and these
[03:51:02.540 --> 03:51:08.220]  politicians need to grow some cojones and stand up and actually do something for the people that
[03:51:08.220 --> 03:51:13.020]  voted them in the office instead of sitting there and voting for themselves to get raises
[03:51:13.020 --> 03:51:17.820]  and voting for themselves thank god they're willing to go into the office for four or five days this
[03:51:17.820 --> 03:51:23.420]  week to cast the same freaking vote a hundred times so mccarty can finally get it in because
[03:51:23.420 --> 03:51:28.620]  they want to go home to their mansion and have their nice luxurious dinners while we sit here
[03:51:28.620 --> 03:51:34.540]  and struggle to pay for gas and we struggle to pay our bills and 5g is going up everywhere and
[03:51:34.540 --> 03:51:38.540]  they're going to be tracking a trace in us and there's nothing that the american people can do
[03:51:38.540 --> 03:51:43.740]  to stop it because these are our representatives right here have a good one oh and i love you i'm

[03:52:54.380 --> 03:53:00.300]  all when the activists today though not all when the you know the host for for info wars all right
[03:53:00.300 --> 03:53:06.220]  well what do you guys understand that mtg uh she's been on the war room with spina and uh
[03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:11.180]  leading up to the vote and as i understand that her position on kevin macarce was that
[03:53:12.380 --> 03:53:19.660]  if um he didn't win the democrat might have won it and then it was all gonna be worse
[03:53:19.660 --> 03:53:27.500]  she's been proven wrong 14 times so on that note i do ask you please they adjourn the the
[03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:32.940]  the votes and whatnot please reach out to her she didn't come on the show yesterday reach out to her
[03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:38.060]  get to her heart or whatever you need to do but like let's hear from her why is she doing this we
[03:53:38.060 --> 03:53:43.500]  know the other dude is from the world economic forum asked you know let's ask mtg what does she
[03:53:43.500 --> 03:53:49.420]  think about ashley babitz mom getting arrested today and what does macarce think about that
[03:53:49.420 --> 03:53:54.300]  let's put him on the spot and let's uh let's hear from them directly what is well you know and
[03:53:54.300 --> 03:53:59.980]  just generally speaking just generally speaking agnacio i you know the one thing here that that
[03:53:59.980 --> 03:54:06.140]  i resonate with is that throughout this entire process we're not really hearing much of substance
[03:54:06.140 --> 03:54:11.100]  you know where does micarty stand on the january 6 where does micarty stand on ukraine we don't get
[03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:15.740]  much substance in fact micarty doesn't talk at all nothing has changed micarty never talks about
[03:54:15.740 --> 03:54:18.780]  that's why it's like i don't know he's a conservative he doesn't tell me he's a conservative i don't
[03:54:18.780 --> 03:54:22.460]  know what he does he's a fundraiser is what he is he's a fundraiser for the swamp that's what we
[03:54:22.460 --> 03:54:27.420]  keep hearing from people like dan cranshaw i don't want a fundraiser for the swamp i want an american
[03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:33.500]  patriot that's right and that's why we're going to back up the stakes that are standing trump
[03:54:34.140 --> 03:54:40.380]  uh too bad that we lost a few i know we lost anna polina luna and uh paul gussard in the last vote
[03:54:40.380 --> 03:54:47.260]  that's okay hey they can still come back to matter and we've still got a vote tonight micarty still
[03:54:47.260 --> 03:54:51.980]  doesn't have the votes um but i think this one tonight is going to be if he doesn't get the
[03:54:51.980 --> 03:54:57.100]  votes tonight and we continue to go through the same groundhog day situation then then it's just
[03:54:57.100 --> 03:55:01.740]  ridiculous and and micarty should be embarrassed and all the people that keep voting for him should
[03:55:01.740 --> 03:55:06.140]  be embarrassed he never had the votes but you've just sent the american people the same message
[03:55:06.140 --> 03:55:11.820]  you've been sending to us since i've been living in this great country that you are politicians
[03:55:11.820 --> 03:55:17.580]  don't give a damn what we the people think what we the people say or what we the people want
[03:55:17.580 --> 03:55:21.180]  and you're going to sit there and do the same thing over and over and over again
[03:55:21.180 --> 03:55:27.020]  till you get the result you want that's like if you go to the casino with a dollar or a penny
[03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:32.620]  let's say and you go pay the play the penny slot and you put the penny in and pull it and you don't
[03:55:32.620 --> 03:55:39.580]  lose and then you go tell the casino owner no i want to play the casino penny slots until i win
[03:55:39.580 --> 03:55:44.780]  even if i only have one penny that's that's that's what this feels like maybe not the best example
[03:55:45.660 --> 03:55:51.500]  but i just don't get it why do you do this i what what is what is so great about kevin micarty
[03:55:51.500 --> 03:55:56.540]  i'm still unconvinced all right let's squeeze one more caller in andrew mic andrew in new york
[03:55:56.540 --> 03:56:02.620]  andrew go ahead in four um yeah the caller has done a pretty good job talking about
[03:56:02.620 --> 03:56:09.980]  mccarty's corruption fcx and all that stuff but we already know when mccarty stands and everything
[03:56:09.980 --> 03:56:17.100]  we already know that he he backs up to january 6 and all that it definitely should not be greasy
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:23.980]  entitled mccarty it should be big or something like that and i think that it's under control
[03:56:23.980 --> 03:56:28.380]  and a lot of stuff is happening behind the scenes and i think they are going to have a real speaker
[03:56:28.380 --> 03:56:34.140]  like any bigs or Steve baden and somebody like that you know i wish that was the case but i'm
[03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:39.420]  not seeing that and and i will say the one knock i do have against the holdouts is that they never
[03:56:39.420 --> 03:56:44.940]  really brought a legitimate serious candidate to the table uh donalds didn't want it he flipped
[03:56:44.940 --> 03:56:49.900]  jordan said he didn't want it he flipped or i don't know if he flipped but but he he said he
[03:56:49.900 --> 03:56:55.980]  didn't want it so yeah i mean that's the one that's the one blind spot on them was they never
[03:56:55.980 --> 03:57:01.340]  brought somebody who actually wanted it that they could present as a viable candidate and uh and i
[03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:06.620]  think they need to change that ahead of this 14th imperative vote because to me this is the big
[03:57:06.620 --> 03:57:11.580]  backbreaking vote as we conclude the week and if they move forward and keep trying to shove mccarty
[03:57:11.580 --> 03:57:17.020]  down our throat then we know that this is the swamp trying to dictate its will on the american people
[03:57:17.020 --> 03:57:22.380]  and if the holdouts can't bring forward a candidate that they can all get behind who wants the speakers
[03:57:22.380 --> 03:57:28.620]  at position who can't lead from the front going on tv saying why they want to be speaker then then
[03:57:28.620 --> 03:57:32.780]  we really i don't i don't see eventually they're just gonna get mccarty in there so that's what
[03:57:32.780 --> 03:57:36.700]  we have ahead of us that does it for the alex joneshow remember to shop at infowarstore.com
