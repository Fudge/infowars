[00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:09.637]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:11.218]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:12.778]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:41.729]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us on this 10th day of December, this Thursday, the 10th day of December 2009.
[00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.592]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:56.649]  We're gonna have Patrick Henningsen on location in Copenhagen join us again for a quick report on the latest developments.
[00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.611]  G. Edward Griffin in studio.
[00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.594]  And we've just talked to Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:06.817]  We are 99% have him locked down.
[00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:15.223]  We're just debating the best time to have him pop in today to talk about the aftermath of what went on earlier today in Denmark.
[00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:24.388]  Climate Denier Calls US Activist Hitler Youth As Americans For Prosperity Protest.
[00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:31.773]  So you've got a George Soros-backed group, and this is being reported on in the George Soros-funded Huffington Post.
[00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:36.415]  This is a guy that funds fake revolutions all over the world.
[00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:41.118]  Showing up and taking over Lord Christopher Monckton's speech.
[00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:44.020]  Now, notice, We Are Change will politely go up
[00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:49.389]  During book signings or during press conferences, and will ask questions.
[00:01:49.389 --> 00:02:10.438]  And the media demonizes them, calls them ruffians, security guards in many cases, rough them up, beat them up, police arrest them for politely asking questions, and then as they're being drug out, they loudly say that Climategate is a, you know, complete fraud, that man-made climate change isn't real and it's a giant tax and spend global bureaucracy.
[00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:18.061]  But these guys just come in, take over the stage, goes on for 20 minutes, screaming at everyone, doing whatever they want.
[00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:27.504]  And it's the same old little yuppies in their $1,000 suits, flown in on private jets to carry out their George Soros operations.
[00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:31.326]  And these people you see protesting, Lord Monckton, they'll all be running cities.
[00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:36.628]  They're going to be all literally in your house, in your farm, in your ranch, all over the country.
[00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:39.569]  These types have been caught moving into property they take.
[00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:54.937]  And so when Lord Monckton calls them Nazis, when he calls them Hitler Youth, that is exactly what the Hitler Youth would do is they would come shut down the speeches of minority groups standing up against Hitler.
[00:02:54.937 --> 00:03:05.066]  And of course in Copenhagen it is the minority group in their little tiny hotel down the street from the billions of dollars being spent on the globalists and their private jets and half the
[00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.110]  Police force of the country of Denmark, they're protecting them.
[00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:21.069]  Meanwhile, it's come out that Bilderberg founder Prince Bernhard tried to overthrow Indonesia and set himself up as viceroy.
[00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:30.415]  This is the founder of the World Wildlife Fund and one of the real Nazis that want to use environmentalism as a pretext to reduce the world's population.
[00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:32.876]  What do you think Hitler spoke about?
[00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:38.400]  And so you do have these brown shirts in there shutting down the event.
[00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:44.877]  And they're very, very proud of themselves.
[00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.941]  But that's good news that they're attacking Monckton.
[00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:54.752]  Because Monckton is effective and is hurting them because he's traveling all over the world.
[00:03:55.905 --> 00:04:22.250]  Going on radio and TV and doing print interviews pointing out the fraud that the Al Gore-ites told us the ocean was going to turn into acid, acid rain, told us the earth was going to be an ice age, then heating, global warming, now it's just climate change, any change is the end of the world, sea levels are going to rise by hundreds of feet, just asinine baloney and the entire cover-up of Al Gore
[00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.293]  Running around saying that the man-bear-pig is gonna get us.
[00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:30.416]  Half man, half bear, half pig.
[00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:32.438]  Man-bear-pig.
[00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.580]  And only I can save you.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.463]  Only I, Al Gore.
[00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:44.689]  Pay me taxes and I will save you.
[00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:50.374]  Yes, let me micromanage and run your life and I will save you.
[00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:59.958]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break to break down the latest on Climate Game.
[00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.261]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.783]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.065]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:13.685]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:14.726]  There is a solution.
[00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:23.368]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:06.907]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:08.188]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:09.009]  It's very real.
[00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.250]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.891]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:17.374]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:04.226]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:05.147]  Number one.
[00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:08.570]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.430]  Number two.
[00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.315]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:15.075]  It's true.
[00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:19.939]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:20.400]  Number three.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.324]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:29.048]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.811]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:36.275]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.275 --> 00:07:40.439]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:49.647]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.647 --> 00:07:51.429]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.670]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.774]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:08.462]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.462 --> 00:08:11.444]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:20.141]  It looks like Lord Monckton can probably only come on in the middle of G. Edward Griffin, but that's fine.
[00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:21.902]  We'll just have him on together.
[00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:24.744]  I'm working on getting Lord Monckton on earlier than that.
[00:08:24.744 --> 00:08:26.425]  Not in the last hour or so.
[00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:33.577]  Dealing with brown shirt youth corps invade Moncton's speech.
[00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:39.459]  So George Soros is sending in his pirates not to ask real questions in a press conference.
[00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:58.127]  See, We Are Change tries to go to press conferences and ask questions and the press can ask questions as long as they don't question ClimateGate or Al Gore being caught lying about carbon dioxide levels going up and then temperature going up when on record he now has been forced to admit carbon dioxide goes up after temperatures go up.
[00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:04.790]  When We Are Change tries to ask nice questions like, Sir, what do you think of Climategate?
[00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:10.096]  They literally have their security guards or police physically grab you and start dragging you out.
[00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:14.381]  Then We Are Change begins to yell, This is a fraud!
[00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:15.442]  This is a lie!
[00:09:15.442 --> 00:09:17.385]  Same thing with the Tea Parties and other great groups.
[00:09:19.502 --> 00:09:22.845]  Brown shirt youth corps invade Moncton speech.
[00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.786]  They tried to shut it down.
[00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:30.251]  Hitler youth attempt to crush freedom of speech while chanting cult-like environmental mantras.
[00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.720]  And you know what?
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.163]  These are Hitler youth.
[00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:39.146]  They are real, live Hitler youth.
[00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:41.168]  I have actually studied Hitler.
[00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:42.650]  I have actually read his speeches.
[00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.453]  I have actually read Mein Kampf, or my struggle.
[00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:49.056]  I have actually studied the mindset of the Nazis.
[00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:55.802]  They were radical, vegetarian, environmentalists that wanted to set up a planetary government
[00:09:56.463 --> 00:10:06.429]  And then carry out the orderly extermination of the population.
[00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:22.900]  And on record, Brazil, the United States, and just a few other major grain producers going to ethanol, Brazil more than a third, the US a third of its fields used for ethanol production,
[00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:29.720]  Directed by the federal government, told to do it, told by the UN, it was great.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.526]  And it turns out it's doubled world food prices and it's caused millions and millions of people, conservatively, to starve to death.
[00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:39.777]  Regularly, 15 million starved to death a year.
[00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:42.359]  They're now reporting that 20 million starved to death last year.
[00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:43.980]  It's gonna be even worse this year.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:51.266]  So, hey, I call starving a couple million people to death, or 5 million people to death, I call that pretty Hitlerian.
[00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.988]  It's almost more Stalin-esque, though, or Maoist.
[00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:57.450]  Maoist, that Mao would just shut your food off.
[00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:03.014]  Mao didn't let people grow crops and took them into centralized factories, and the Chinese government
[00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:06.529]  says 86 million died.
[00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:07.409]  The U.S.
[00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:10.891]  textbooks say 64 million.
[00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:12.151]  It's over 60 mil.
[00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:16.693]  The Chinese government admits, oh yes, we killed 80 plus mil.
[00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:19.875]  80 plus mil, okay?
[00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:21.835]  And they don't care how many millions they kill.
[00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:22.896]  In fact, they want to kill them.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:43.874]  And there's all these new books and documents finally hitting mainstream news where Paul Ehrlich and John P. Holdren and all these top Obama people wrote books and white papers about how they wanted to exterminate the majority of the population and forcibly sterilize everybody and drug everyone and do all of this.
[00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:46.536]  It is unbelievable.
[00:11:46.536 --> 00:11:49.398]  And so, yes, these are Hitler youth.
[00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:55.108]  Hitler Youth attempt to crush freedom of speech while chanting cult-like environmental slogans.
[00:11:55.108 --> 00:12:04.652]  Groups of agitant green youth corps invaded the stage during Ward-Montgomery's speech at an American for Prosperity event in Copenhagen yesterday.
[00:12:04.652 --> 00:12:06.212]  Now again, they just took over the whole event.
[00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:07.153]  They just shut it down.
[00:12:08.308 --> 00:12:14.773]  All we are changing, and all I want, is for people to be able to ask questions of this liar and confront him and take over media coverage.
[00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:15.894]  Not these guys.
[00:12:15.894 --> 00:12:17.575]  They wanted to shut down the speech.
[00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:26.122]  And remember, the London Guardian, government officials, Lord Monckton's named them by name, they have called, it's in the article, for his arrest and execution.
[00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:29.745]  They want to kill Lord Monckton.
[00:12:29.745 --> 00:12:34.128]  They want to kill climatologist Dr. Timothy Ball.
[00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:37.371]  They openly say, execute us for treason.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.301]  Now, We Are Change doesn't want to kill Al Gore.
[00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:44.742]  We want him to go to prison for fraud.
[00:12:44.742 --> 00:12:49.203]  He's been caught in fraud and swindles.
[00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:53.424]  I'm going to cover this, but I want to play some of the audio from the intro.
[00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:58.965]  I want to play it from the intro as the group putting it on.
[00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:05.047]  Introduce Lord Monckton, and then they come in and take over
[00:13:06.789 --> 00:13:07.950]  The event.
[00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:30.068]  So, here it is, and I'm going to come back and comment on these modern-day Nazis jackbooting free speech by the little minority group there in Copenhagen trying to counter all the slick globalist power and money and glitz, openly setting up world government, doubling the amount of taxes on the third world through carbon tax that the first world's going to be under.
[00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:32.410]  I always told you that bait-and-switch was going to happen.
[00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:32.791]  Here it is.
[00:13:35.694 --> 00:13:38.656]  Good afternoon, Philadelphia, and good evening here in Copenhagen.
[00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.098]  We have a great crowd of folks here in Copenhagen.
[00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:45.621]  An intrepid band of free market activists who are joining us.
[00:13:45.621 --> 00:13:48.163]  Copenhagen has been an eye-opener for me.
[00:13:48.163 --> 00:13:57.991]  I have to tell you, having never attended a United Nations-sponsored conference, I kind of hope this is my last one, I believe, but it's been an eye-opener for us.
[00:13:57.991 --> 00:14:00.152]  We can, excuse me, across the country, really.
[00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:05.584]  And I'll tell you this, it's interesting that we're here.
[00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:08.310]  We're being a team.
[00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:14.325]  Stop!
[00:14:14.325 --> 00:14:14.645]  Clean energy!
[00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:14.765]  Stop!
[00:14:14.765 --> 00:14:15.025]  Clean energy!
[00:14:15.025 --> 00:14:15.145]  Stop!
[00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:15.465]  Clean energy!
[00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:15.566]  Stop!

[00:14:41.823 --> 00:14:44.085]  We are sick of revolution!
[00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:51.249]  You are listening now to the shouts in the background of the Hitler Youth.
[00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:29.473]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.473 --> 00:15:32.115]  There you have it, shutting down free speech.
[00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:33.576]  Completely dominating it.
[00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:39.479]  Mainstream media there, giggling and laughing, all part of the staged event.
[00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:42.481]  Brown shirt youth corps invade Moncton speech.
[00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:49.472]  Now, George Soros is copying our tactics, but taking it up about 10 notches.
[00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:56.243]  If We Are Change ever tried, or the Tea Party's ever tried to take over the stage, police would probably gun them down.
[00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.137]  I mean, they would call it a terror attack on the news.
[00:16:00.137 --> 00:16:09.244]  But these little scallywags, these little gutter snipes, these collectivists that literally want to move into your house and kick their feet up on your desk.
[00:16:09.244 --> 00:16:12.967]  They want you out under machine gun point, laboring for them in the fields.
[00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:14.108]  I'm not kidding.
[00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:15.509]  These people are parasites.
[00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:17.790]  They know what they're doing.
[00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:24.816]  Yeah, you heard a real environmentalist who was on with us yesterday who was part of all this and then found out it was all a scam.
[00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.668]  Found out it was all about making money.
[00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:36.040]  I have been to smart growth conferences, and they just laugh and go, of course they were taking over the land and the money.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.445]  I mean, literally, in press conferences, they just laugh about it.
[00:16:40.219 --> 00:16:45.925]  Because this was back in the late 1990s when they were really on top of things before anybody was standing up to them.
[00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:50.669]  And it was all bankers, all business people, just laughing.
[00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:53.052]  Just absolutely laughing.
[00:16:53.052 --> 00:17:01.259]  Somewhere we've got the video of my interview with Michael Dell.
[00:17:02.332 --> 00:17:08.017]  He gave a press conference and I went up and talked to him about the globalization, new world order plan, land grabbing.
[00:17:08.017 --> 00:17:09.138]  He just laughed at me.
[00:17:09.138 --> 00:17:12.280]  I said, I've got reports you're planning to move your factories to China.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.403]  And he said, oh, another conspiracy theory, Alex.
[00:17:15.403 --> 00:17:16.504]  I aired that on TV.
[00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.325]  The Austin Chronicle wrote about it.
[00:17:18.325 --> 00:17:19.967]  So it's on record that I had that interview.
[00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:23.690]  But in the past, there was no real cataloging of anything.
[00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.032]  It was just thrown in giant piles.
[00:17:26.032 --> 00:17:29.895]  Somebody should dig out all that stuff and get it on the web.
[00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.136]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:42.957]  A Huffington Post write-up of the incident attempts to characterize Monckton as the villain of the story because he called the teenage Brownsirts, out for what they were, crazed Hitlerjugend.
[00:17:42.957 --> 00:17:59.085]  The youth activists representing a number of youth action groups including SustainUS, the Sierra Student Coalition, I mean that's all Rockefeller Soros, the Cascade Climate Network, Rockefeller Soros, and other American youth NGOs, that means kept creatures of the UN,
[00:18:00.325 --> 00:18:06.550]  Kicked off the protest by holding banners in front of the camera reading, climate disaster ahead and clean energy now.
[00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.751]  Would that be the ice age?
[00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:09.733]  Or the acid rain?
[00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:12.315]  Or would that be the ocean turning into acid?
[00:18:12.315 --> 00:18:14.217]  Or would that be the global warming?
[00:18:14.217 --> 00:18:15.358]  Now it's just climate change.
[00:18:15.358 --> 00:18:17.800]  They, you know, teach the kids the seasons are abnormal.
[00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:31.504]  The activists who are invited delegates to the UN's Copenhagen Summit, they get to go in, nobody else does, betrayed the dictatorial agenda of the United Nations and the climate change movement as a whole by having zero tolerance for any dissenting opinion.
[00:18:31.504 --> 00:18:36.747]  Crashing and shouting down a small conference of people who had merely gathered to present the other side of the debate.
[00:18:36.747 --> 00:18:38.569]  Who, by the way, were locked out of the big UN event.
[00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:47.621]  They then proceeded to wave plastic American flags made in China before chanting environmental mantras that have no basis whatsoever in reality.
[00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:52.144]  We're representing the majority of Americans on this, particularly young Americans common in one of the brown shirts.
[00:18:52.144 --> 00:18:53.045]  No, you don't.
[00:18:53.045 --> 00:19:00.851]  In reality, as the most recent polls show, Americans who think global warming is caused by human activity, including vehicle and industrial emissions, are now a minority.
[00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:02.313]  We have direct links to the mainstream polls.
[00:19:02.873 --> 00:19:09.335]  You are listening now to brown shirts in the background of Hitler Youth, said Monckton as the green thugs interrupted his speech.
[00:19:09.335 --> 00:19:23.059]  Monckton mentioned the fact that the same youth corps had green spray-painted Copenhagen with Orwellian messages in a frightening throwback to the red, white, and black swastikas that littered the city during the time when it was occupied by the Nazis.
[00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:25.840]  Another brown shirt, Laura Comer, claimed,
[00:19:26.843 --> 00:19:31.066]  We're representing the majority of Americans on this, particularly young Americans.
[00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:36.531]  The Real America Wants Clean Energy, Not More Fossil Fuel Funded Lies About Science.
[00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:40.786]  When it's actually the oil companies funding them.
[00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:47.932]  In actual fact, the Climate Gain emails clearly illustrate how the vast majority of big oil money is behind the climate change alarmists, not the skeptics.
[00:19:47.932 --> 00:19:58.983]  Indeed, the entire Copenhagen event is sponsored by a consortium of giant corporations that includes British Petroleum and Dutch Royal Shell, run and founded by the real Nazi, Prince Bernhard.
[00:20:00.523 --> 00:20:00.763]  Hello.
[00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:15.757]  I think you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:20.920]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.181]  Boy was I wrong.
[00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:25.343]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:20:25.343 --> 00:20:29.185]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:20:29.185 --> 00:20:32.407]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:20:32.407 --> 00:20:32.947]  Wow!
[00:20:32.947 --> 00:20:34.488]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:20:34.488 --> 00:20:35.709]  I was awestruck.
[00:20:35.709 --> 00:20:37.390]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.912]  This information can bless many people.
[00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:40.412]  Thank you.
[00:20:41.113 --> 00:20:41.873]  Thanks again!
[00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:44.996]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:45.597]  Thank you.
[00:20:45.597 --> 00:20:49.020]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.620]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:03.960]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.004]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.004 --> 00:21:10.625]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:11.385]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:11.786]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.786 --> 00:21:12.886]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:15.848]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.848 --> 00:21:19.731]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:21:27.055 --> 00:21:27.356]  Right!

[00:21:31.258 --> 00:21:32.598]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.598 --> 00:21:36.460]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.243]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:10.564]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:10.564 --> 00:22:17.010]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:25.858]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:26.218 --> 00:22:35.403]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:35.403 --> 00:22:40.006]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:41.827]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:44.328]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:03.657]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[00:23:03.657 --> 00:23:06.279]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?

[00:24:10.021 --> 00:24:11.843]  I got it!
[00:24:11.843 --> 00:24:13.064]  Watch me!
[00:24:13.064 --> 00:24:18.968]  The globalists are panicking.
[00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:22.191]  Climategate has devastated them.
[00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:27.095]  But they were still moving forward in a ragged fashion.
[00:24:27.095 --> 00:24:27.976]  Hemorrhaging out.
[00:24:29.523 --> 00:24:45.107]  As news of the premeditated fraud spreads and as people go, wait a minute, these are the same folks that got caught lying with the hockey stick graph, faking an increase in temperature that was disproven two years ago.
[00:24:45.107 --> 00:24:50.608]  This is the same Al Gore that lied about carbon dioxide going up and then temperature going up when it's the reverse.
[00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:56.281]  This is the same Al Gore that says polar bears can't swim, one of the greatest land swimmers.
[00:24:56.281 --> 00:25:12.077]  These are the same people that said in the 70s and 80s on the cover of Newsweek and Time, all this stuff's getting dredged back up and put on the internet for everybody to see, saying we would be in an ice age by 2000 if we didn't have taxes to build giant carbon dioxide factories.
[00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:12.938]  Guess who said that?
[00:25:12.938 --> 00:25:14.720]  White House science czar John P. Holdren.
[00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:25.052]  He's always wanted to play God and build giant... They call it geoengineering because this planet's already livable, but if we did it on Mars, it's called terraforming.
[00:25:25.052 --> 00:25:32.595]  Yes, they wanted a global tax to spray particles into the air to heat the atmosphere.
[00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:33.956]  On record!
[00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:37.877]  And then it started heating in the 90s because it's natural to go up and down.
[00:25:37.877 --> 00:25:44.380]  There's all sorts of different cycles that the geological record shows, that the ice court record shows, that the
[00:25:46.052 --> 00:25:49.533]  They get a lot of evidence from ancient lakes.
[00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:50.414]  From the mud.
[00:25:50.414 --> 00:25:54.095]  It's like tree rings going down through time.
[00:25:54.095 --> 00:26:01.458]  They've gone down over 500,000 years in some of the Scottish lakes.
[00:26:01.458 --> 00:26:03.178]  In the Great Lakes.
[00:26:03.178 --> 00:26:04.959]  Lakes that have been there for millions of years.
[00:26:06.104 --> 00:26:20.473]  And they, in all the lakes, they can go down in the Great Lakes, they can go down in Scotland, they can go down in Russia, they can go down into ancient lakes in Africa, they can go down 200, 300, 400, 500,000 years and find carbon dioxide at 5, 10, 15, 20 times the level.
[00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:20.893]  This is a fact!
[00:26:20.893 --> 00:26:23.315]  Humans had nothing to do with this!
[00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:42.840]  But they're talking about a one, less than a one two thousandth increase.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.383]  Oh my gosh, we're all dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:46.765]  What are we going to do?
[00:26:46.765 --> 00:26:48.207]  It's all over.
[00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:51.891]  Oh my gosh, we better pay Al Gore and the UN and the IMF and World Bank a bunch of money.
[00:26:52.637 --> 00:26:55.682]  So, all their other frauds are coming out.
[00:26:55.682 --> 00:26:56.764]  And they know it's fraud.
[00:26:56.764 --> 00:26:58.667]  They just make up new disasters.
[00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:07.380]  But finally, they've put out what six months ago the New York Times reported, a new big think tank policy report that the White House reissued quietly to its staff.
[00:27:08.277 --> 00:27:19.966]  In the Energy Department and in the EPA saying, look, we're not going to say warming, we're not going to say cooling anymore, we're going to say climate change and our deteriorating atmosphere.
[00:27:19.966 --> 00:27:21.808]  And now suddenly that's all you hear.
[00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:27.172]  Our deteriorating atmosphere, our climate change.
[00:27:27.172 --> 00:27:32.857]  Climate change on a planetoid hurtling through deep space orbiting a sun.
[00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:42.363]  We're on a giant spacecraft, a giant rock with a molten center.
[00:27:42.363 --> 00:27:44.023]  Mountains are thrust up.
[00:27:44.023 --> 00:27:46.284]  Giant asteroids hit the planet.
[00:27:46.284 --> 00:27:50.306]  We are bathed in high-powered radiation.
[00:27:50.306 --> 00:27:53.888]  Yes, we are creatures on a planet that developed
[00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:57.403]  In a high radiation atmosphere.
[00:27:57.403 --> 00:28:03.688]  If aliens from a far away star system came here who hadn't developed right up next to a sun.
[00:28:03.688 --> 00:28:06.009]  I mean, we're right up next to a sun.
[00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:10.653]  Right up next to one in the measurements of space.
[00:28:10.653 --> 00:28:14.936]  We are creatures that walk outside and our sun cooks in the radiation.
[00:28:14.936 --> 00:28:19.359]  We bathe in radiation.
[00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:23.122]  Life formed on this earth in giant volcanoes spewing
[00:28:26.158 --> 00:28:28.599]  Boiling magma out everywhere.
[00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:37.084]  Our atmospheres were methane.
[00:28:37.084 --> 00:28:43.127]  The truth is, you'd have to blow the planet into bits to kill life on this planet.
[00:28:44.229 --> 00:29:01.043]  The truth is, this planet has taken thousands of giant impacts of half a mile, mile long, three mile wide, giant asteroids, rocketing in at 40,000 miles an hour, blowing holes the size of the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:02.364]  That's what the Gulf of Mexico is.
[00:29:02.364 --> 00:29:05.867]  It's a meteor impact point.
[00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:09.110]  Where I sit in Austin, Texas, when that mega meteor hit,
[00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:21.550]  The entire of Texas, New Mexico, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras has the same ocean rock thrown up as magma.
[00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.311]  The same rock is everywhere.
[00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:26.953]  Boiling magma is everywhere.
[00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:28.914]  Now cooled, of course, for millions of years.
[00:29:29.861 --> 00:29:42.670]  Where I sit was in thousands of feet of boiling magma from a giant, three mile long, huge iron ore meteorite hitting at 40,000 miles an hour.
[00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:46.873]  Where Yucatan now stands.
[00:29:46.873 --> 00:29:50.876]  We're Cozumel.
[00:29:50.876 --> 00:29:52.277]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:54.799]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:57.481]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:55.844]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:05.022]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.022 --> 00:32:08.245]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:13.049]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:32:13.049 --> 00:32:19.454]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.454 --> 00:32:21.676]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:22.516]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.516 --> 00:32:23.037]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.037 --> 00:32:23.817]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:24.978]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:24.978 --> 00:32:27.220]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.109 --> 00:32:48.395]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.395 --> 00:32:57.502]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:32.520]  Yeah, I'm taking fight!
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:40.788]  Stand tall!
[00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:44.631]  I'm on top as long as I'm facing down tyranny!
[00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.334]  And I love it!
[00:33:56.216 --> 00:33:57.997]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:57.997 --> 00:33:58.717]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:58.717 --> 00:34:02.658]  Central, we're here live.
[00:34:02.658 --> 00:34:04.959]  Wide open phones ladies and gentlemen at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:05.019]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:16.681 --> 00:34:18.502]  And we will get you up and on air.
[00:34:18.502 --> 00:34:23.066]  Lord Monckton coming up to talk about the Brownshirts taking over his event today.
[00:34:23.066 --> 00:34:28.230]  The latest on Copenhagen in studio, G. Edward Griffin.
[00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:36.176]  We've got another live report with a live reporter joining us via video Skype from Copenhagen, part two of his report.
[00:34:38.177 --> 00:34:44.042]  Also, ABC Nightly News last night covered We Are Change, simply confronting Al Gore.
[00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:48.987]  They peacefully walked up during the book signing, bought the $30 book, and said, hey, what about Climategate?
[00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:49.808]  Can you comment on that?
[00:34:49.808 --> 00:34:54.532]  And they grabbed him, threw him out.
[00:34:54.532 --> 00:35:00.077]  But meanwhile, look at this headline up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:02.299]  Paul Watson's writing about it.
[00:35:02.299 --> 00:35:03.821]  The Financial Post of Canada
[00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:06.933]  One of the biggest papers in Canada.
[00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:09.095]  The real inconvenient truth.
[00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:13.119]  The whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:23.690]  Now I've seen, no exaggeration, hundreds of articles in England, Germany, Australia, Canada, calling for cutting the British population by 50%.
[00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.073]  Times of London.
[00:35:26.073 --> 00:35:27.635]  The head environment official in England.
[00:35:28.666 --> 00:35:31.830]  The United Nations calling for a one-child policy.
[00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:38.758]  They're going to raise your taxes, and that's what they say this is for, so that you can't afford to have more than one child.
[00:35:38.758 --> 00:35:41.942]  And if you try to, they're going to come and take your child.
[00:35:41.942 --> 00:35:44.425]  That's the Chinese policy.
[00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:46.167]  That's how they operate.
[00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:47.789]  This is unbelievable.
[00:35:48.695 --> 00:36:00.385]  A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth rate currently, which is one million births every four days.
[00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:09.634]  Yes, but all the trends show it will plane out at eight and a half billion in 2022, and then we'll start dropping down to below six billion because once a country industrializes,
[00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.712]  They then stop having two children for every two parents.
[00:36:14.712 --> 00:36:21.196]  It drops to 1.3 as the global average from Japan to Germany to England.
[00:36:21.196 --> 00:36:22.537]  Every nation, the average is 1.3.
[00:36:22.537 --> 00:36:23.017]  Some are 1.5, 1.1, 1.2.
[00:36:23.017 --> 00:36:24.658]  The average is 1.3.
[00:36:24.658 --> 00:36:26.560]  Yes, they're having 4.1 children on average in the third world.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.201]  And under the Copenhagen Climate Tax Agreement,
[00:36:42.762 --> 00:36:49.208]  That states that they will cut industrial capacity in the third world and double, right at double, their taxes.
[00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:53.092]  So, that will actually keep them in a poor level where they continue to have more children.
[00:36:53.092 --> 00:36:59.899]  So actually, the globalist, greeny-weeny policies are actually causing a larger population.
[00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:05.464]  This is an absolute Hitlerian system.
[00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:09.767]  That's why we say brown shirt, youth corps, invade Moncton speech.
[00:37:09.767 --> 00:37:19.493]  Whether these young fools know it or not, working for George Soros and the Rockefeller and Ford foundations, whether they know it or not, they are working for a Hitlerian system.
[00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:23.932]  Unbelievable!
[00:37:23.932 --> 00:37:30.657]  The world's other species, vegetation, resources, oceans, arable land, water supplies, and atmosphere are being destroyed.
[00:37:30.657 --> 00:37:32.238]  See, now the atmosphere is being destroyed.
[00:37:32.238 --> 00:37:33.358]  No longer global warming.
[00:37:33.358 --> 00:37:36.320]  The atmosphere is being destroyed.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.523]  Are pushed out of existence as a result of humanity's soaring reproductive rate.
[00:37:40.523 --> 00:37:49.970]  Ironically, China, despite its dirty coal plants, its world leader in terms of fashioning policy to combat environmental degradation, thanks to its one-child-only edict,
[00:37:51.223 --> 00:37:53.444]  What does Dr. Eric Bianca UT call for?
[00:37:53.444 --> 00:37:56.424]  A planetary, quote, police state to enforce this.
[00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:58.925]  What does, what does Gore Vidal call for?
[00:37:58.925 --> 00:38:01.285]  A planetary regime to enforce this.
[00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:02.706]  What does John P. Holdren call for?
[00:38:02.706 --> 00:38:05.006]  A planetary government to enforce this.
[00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:06.327]  What does Maury Strong call for?
[00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.067]  A planetary government to enforce this.
[00:38:08.067 --> 00:38:11.768]  What does my film Endgame, The Obama Deception, and
[00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:13.586]  Completely dictatorial.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.760]  And they go on.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.841]  The fix is simple.
[00:38:38.841 --> 00:38:39.541]  It's dramatic.
[00:38:39.541 --> 00:38:43.183]  And yet the world's leaders don't even have this on their agenda in Copenhagen.
[00:38:43.183 --> 00:38:45.123]  Yes, they do.
[00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:55.888]  Instead there will be photo ops, posturing, behavior, blah blah blah about climate science and climate fraud, announcements of giant wind farms, then cap and trade subsidies.
[00:38:56.832 --> 00:38:59.775]  None will work unless China one-shot policies impose.
[00:38:59.775 --> 00:39:02.017]  Unfortunately, there are powerful opponents.
[00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:08.784]  Leaders of the world's big fundamentalist religions preach in favor of procreation and fiercely oppose birth control.
[00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:13.088]  And most political leaders in emerging economies perpetuate a disastrous catch-22.
[00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:19.619]  And then they go on to how they care about the children.
[00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:20.780]  Many children, i.e.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:28.904]  sons, stave off hardship in the absence of social safety net or economic development, which in turn prevents protection or development.
[00:39:28.904 --> 00:39:32.606]  When the global climate tax is meant to shut down development, that's stated.
[00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:48.921]  China has proven that birth restrictions is simple policy, smart policy, and middle-class grows and its citizens have housing, health care, education, food, and the one out of five human beings who live there are not overpopulating the planet.
[00:39:48.921 --> 00:39:59.903]  For those who balk at the notion that government should control family size, just wait until the growing human population turns twice as much pastureland into desert as it now is the case.
[00:39:59.903 --> 00:40:03.084]  Or when the Amazon is gone, which is another lie, the elephants disappear,
[00:40:04.892 --> 00:40:05.692]  For good.
[00:40:05.692 --> 00:40:09.373]  And wars erupt over water, scarce resources, and spatial needs.
[00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:09.914]  Oh really?
[00:40:09.914 --> 00:40:15.935]  The State Department memorandum 200 by Kissinger states they want to cause wars and cause food shortages to cause wars.
[00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:19.196]  The point in Copenhagen's talking points are beside the point.
[00:40:19.196 --> 00:40:26.039]  The only fix is if all countries dramatically reduce their populations, clean up their mess, and impose mandatory conservation measures.
[00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:30.220]  The National Post wanted to send one of their chief writers here who's writing a book.
[00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:35.008]  To interview me, and I told him no.
[00:40:35.008 --> 00:40:35.728]  And you know what?
[00:40:35.728 --> 00:40:39.250]  I'm just going to start telling all the media no.
[00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:47.134]  I don't want to talk to the newspapers and the magazines so they can try to spin and distort what we say.
[00:40:47.134 --> 00:40:51.657]  I had a reporter here three days ago, and it was all the cliches.
[00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:59.241]  It was, don't you just need to think there's a global government so subconsciously you think there's order to the universe that you can't handle disorder?
[00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:02.808]  And I said, world government's being announced everywhere.
[00:41:02.808 --> 00:41:04.930]  One-child policy's being announced everywhere.
[00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.052]  World leaders are calling for global government.
[00:41:07.052 --> 00:41:08.514]  And he was like, you really believe that?
[00:41:08.514 --> 00:41:11.077]  And I'm like, no, it's a fact.
[00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:14.060]  And he goes, isn't this just really all about you making money?
[00:41:17.113 --> 00:41:19.694]  And I said, I said, this is all the cliches.
[00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:25.636]  I said, what does it matter if I make money putting out my political view and my ideas so I can fund my own operation?
[00:41:25.636 --> 00:41:28.416]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[00:41:28.416 --> 00:41:35.619]  And I went on to say, I spend all my time and energy trying to make sure that the money that comes in here actually gets spent on fighting the New World Order.
[00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:36.879]  But see, there's that guilt trip.
[00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:40.280]  Oh, you're not allowed to fund your own media operation.
[00:41:42.776 --> 00:41:53.661]  They try to cow us into being poppers, into not trying to take control of the system legally and lawfully, not trying to build our own media systems to counter them.
[00:41:53.661 --> 00:41:54.421]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:41:54.421 --> 00:42:07.707]  All the mainstream newspapers are in the process or have already gone bankrupt, not just because people are web-based news, but because you are universally mistrusted, and the people are now starting a long process of awakening.
[00:42:10.267 --> 00:42:15.794]  Paul Watson, who's our hardest working writer and I salute him, is writing three, four articles a day.
[00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:19.178]  He can't even keep track of the evil.
[00:42:19.178 --> 00:42:26.748]  Paul, you need to do a blurb about this National Post article.
[00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:29.091]  You need to do a blurb about this National Post article.
[00:42:31.075 --> 00:42:50.547]  And just take the last 50 articles, where the head of the government, the environment program in England called for a 50% population force reduction, where the Prime Minister of Australia called for a 50% reduction because it's all globally organized, and all the articles where they're calling for a one-child policy and a tax on children.
[00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:52.328]  And that's what this carbon tax is!
[00:42:53.916 --> 00:42:57.238]  Do you understand how diabolical this is?
[00:42:57.238 --> 00:43:02.180]  It isn't a bunch of idiot tree-huggers that just mean well and got their science wrong.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.901]  These are vicious Nazis.
[00:43:04.901 --> 00:43:07.082]  It's the only way to describe them.
[00:43:07.082 --> 00:43:11.605]  But in truth, they're worse than the Nazis because they are the progenitors of the Nazis.
[00:43:11.605 --> 00:43:18.028]  It is the liberal, fake, limp-wristed, control freak, power cult,
[00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:33.395]  Groups in England 150 years ago, really 200 plus with Sir Malthus, who came up with this idea.
[00:43:33.395 --> 00:43:40.940]  They came up with this idea to exterminate and reduce births because England didn't know what to do with its exploding population.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:47.545]  So they shipped them as slaves, indentured servants to Australia and the United States and Canada.
[00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:50.867]  And of course, they're the best, heartiest people to ever come out of England.
[00:43:53.336 --> 00:44:05.088]  And they built the West that we now marvel at, that these parasites perch on top of and suck off of!
[00:44:05.088 --> 00:44:06.610]  The truth is, it's the commoner.
[00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:11.820]  Whether they be black or white, Hispanic, Asian, that is the salt of the earth.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:22.943]  Not the arrogant, control freak, degenerate elites of the planet that want to get everybody out of their way so they can enjoy the fruits of the earth and so they can enjoy all the life extension technologies.
[00:44:22.943 --> 00:44:27.285]  Do you understand how vital it is that I broke down the eugenics program at the end of my 2002 film?
[00:44:27.285 --> 00:44:27.945]  9-1-1, the road to tyranny.
[00:44:35.509 --> 00:44:40.472]  How vital my film on eugenics and the UN takeover, America Destroyed by Design, is?
[00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:43.513]  Do you realize how vital Endgame is?
[00:44:43.513 --> 00:44:49.356]  Do you realize how life and death it is that everyone see this?
[00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:50.497]  It is life and death!
[00:44:50.497 --> 00:44:53.779]  These people are taking over right now!
[00:44:53.779 --> 00:44:55.960]  And we are turning the corner.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.661]  Finally, people are getting it.
[00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.462]  Because the globalists are coming out of the closet.
[00:44:59.462 --> 00:45:03.284]  They're coming out in the open, out of the shadows, showing us who they are.
[00:45:07.383 --> 00:45:13.604]  They've taught all you foolish trendies on the right wing that war and tyranny and police state is cool.
[00:45:13.604 --> 00:45:20.406]  They've taught all the trendy leftists that big government and socialism and one-child policies are avant-garde.
[00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:22.887]  You are fools!
[00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:26.788]  Even if you hate poor people when you see them in the grocery store.
[00:45:26.788 --> 00:45:29.268]  Even if you hate commoners.
[00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:34.469]  Most of you fools, even if you make $10 million a year, are not members of the elite.
[00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:36.150]  Did you get the memo not to drink the water?
[00:45:37.008 --> 00:45:40.869]  Did you get the memo not to take the inoculations like they got the memo in Germany?
[00:45:40.869 --> 00:45:43.751]  Their military and their government does not take it.
[00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:44.931]  They tell them, do not take it.
[00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:47.072]  This is a sterilant.
[00:45:47.072 --> 00:45:48.472]  And it's a soft kill.
[00:45:48.472 --> 00:45:53.474]  It only sterilizes around 30% of people that take it.
[00:45:53.474 --> 00:45:56.315]  But it reduces the fertility of everyone else.
[00:45:56.315 --> 00:46:03.518]  Why do you think the sperm count in Europe, the US, and England is down by over 85% and nowhere else?
[00:46:03.518 --> 00:46:05.659]  Their sperm count's not down in a village in Africa.
[00:46:07.691 --> 00:46:15.015]  They've done major studies of Anglo-Saxon Westerners living in South Pacific Islands.
[00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:20.718]  Their sperm counts are right up there at 100%, baby.
[00:46:20.718 --> 00:46:24.660]  You like being sterilized?
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.621]  You like being killed?
[00:46:27.045 --> 00:46:29.748]  You better grow up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:29.748 --> 00:46:40.161]  You better realize that we're facing a threat far more dangerous than Mao Zedong and Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin.
[00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:52.195]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to get all into the latest climate gate, latest police state gate.
[00:46:52.195 --> 00:46:55.918]  The globalists are taking over healthcare, industry, banking.
[00:46:55.918 --> 00:46:58.299]  Now they want to continue the banker bailout.
[00:46:58.299 --> 00:47:02.182]  I mean, it's just all happening right now, and it's only the beginning.
[00:47:02.182 --> 00:47:05.305]  This is the New World Order crashing the gates.
[00:47:05.305 --> 00:47:07.026]  They are spilling over the wall.
[00:47:07.026 --> 00:47:07.987]  If this was the Alamo,
[00:47:09.332 --> 00:47:11.754]  Those of us fighting the globalists are like Davy Crockett.
[00:47:11.754 --> 00:47:12.595]  We're out of ammo.
[00:47:12.595 --> 00:47:14.496]  We're swinging our muskets.
[00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:15.797]  And let me tell you something.
[00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:17.018]  A lot of us are going to get killed.
[00:47:17.018 --> 00:47:18.219]  We're going to get imprisoned.
[00:47:18.219 --> 00:47:21.142]  This is only going to get worse and worse in the years to come.
[00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:27.106]  But... You take my life, but I take yours too.
[00:47:27.106 --> 00:47:29.188]  You fire your musket, but I run you through.
[00:47:29.188 --> 00:47:33.532]  And when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand because there's no turning back.
[00:47:33.532 --> 00:47:34.953]  The bugle sounds.
[00:47:34.953 --> 00:47:36.674]  The charge begins.
[00:47:36.674 --> 00:47:38.576]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:50.146]  Screams of pain, the smell of the horse's breath, the rush of the foreign troops as we all hurtle into certain death.
[00:47:55.182 --> 00:47:56.223]  That's what's so sad.
[00:47:56.223 --> 00:47:58.144]  On this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:47:58.144 --> 00:48:05.768]  All the stupid globalist followers and their minions and their zealots and the new religion they're openly announcing in hundreds of newspapers in the last week.
[00:48:05.768 --> 00:48:08.729]  A new global earth religion run by the UN.
[00:48:08.729 --> 00:48:14.352]  Again, we told you that over a decade here with the UN documents.
[00:48:14.352 --> 00:48:16.714]  All of us fighting with each other, we all lose.
[00:48:16.714 --> 00:48:18.855]  I'm not the enemy of some thug cop.
[00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:19.835]  They're just brainwashed.
[00:48:19.835 --> 00:48:20.736]  I want to wake them up.
[00:48:20.736 --> 00:48:22.597]  I want them to be a free man, a free woman.
[00:48:22.597 --> 00:48:24.478]  I want them to stand with us in honor and truth.
[00:48:25.865 --> 00:48:37.713]  None of us win fighting with each other as the globalists sit back in their technological ivory towers as technocrats manipulating us, understanding our human psychology, understanding our weaknesses, playing us off against each other.
[00:48:37.713 --> 00:48:47.100]  The fight is out there with the New World Order, FBI, police, military, bureaucrats, stupid greenie weenies, all of you people, fake right-wingers.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.202]  The fight's out there with the New World Order!
[00:48:51.394 --> 00:48:55.935]  There's no more time to screw around people that are in the system and people that exercise power.
[00:48:55.935 --> 00:49:01.116]  Judges, and legislatures, and congressmen and women.
[00:49:01.116 --> 00:49:02.657]  We've been right about everything.
[00:49:02.657 --> 00:49:05.257]  Our testament has proven to be absolutely right.
[00:49:05.257 --> 00:49:10.258]  Do you want to wait around and see the rest of what we've warned you about come true?
[00:49:10.258 --> 00:49:16.700]  Is it going to take your 25-year-old son coming down with leukemia from the inoculations for you to wake your butt up?
[00:49:20.973 --> 00:49:24.514]  Is it gonna take your 40-year-old wife getting Alzheimer's?
[00:49:24.514 --> 00:49:27.454]  All these young people getting it now?
[00:49:27.454 --> 00:49:30.035]  From the aluminum being sprayed on us?
[00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:32.695]  And the aluminum being put in the water supplies?
[00:49:32.695 --> 00:49:35.896]  Oh yes, that's what they add to the water supply.
[00:49:35.896 --> 00:49:44.378]  I mean, what is it gonna take for you to get it through your head?
[00:49:44.378 --> 00:49:46.198]  That on this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.244]  It's a fake war with each other.
[00:49:50.244 --> 00:49:51.665]  It's a divide and conquer.
[00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:53.307]  Wake up to the New World Order.
[00:49:53.307 --> 00:49:55.068]  Wake up to the social engineering.
[00:49:55.068 --> 00:49:57.591]  Wake up to the technocracy.
[00:49:57.591 --> 00:49:59.733]  Wake up to the globalist controllers.
[00:49:59.733 --> 00:50:01.234]  Read their documents.
[00:50:01.234 --> 00:50:13.025]  Don't roll your eyes at me when I tell you they're putting over 150 chemicals on the lowest level, some areas over 300, in the water.
[00:50:13.025 --> 00:50:14.046]  You better wake up.
[00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:17.094]  You better find out what's in the vaccines.
[00:50:17.094 --> 00:50:21.657]  You better go to a Walgreens and say, can I have the flu shot insert, please?
[00:50:21.657 --> 00:50:25.019]  Not their little fake fact sheet that they give the public.
[00:50:25.019 --> 00:50:28.141]  Ask for that and they'll say, no, mercury cannot hurt you.
[00:50:28.141 --> 00:50:29.621]  And then read the insert.
[00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:30.602]  This may cause cancer.
[00:50:30.602 --> 00:50:32.643]  This may sterilize you or hurt fertility.
[00:50:32.643 --> 00:50:33.764]  This has mercury in it.
[00:50:34.994 --> 00:50:36.715]  This may cause cancer.
[00:50:36.715 --> 00:50:41.617]  And then ask them, well why does this fact sheet say none of this is in it, but then the actual insert says it?
[00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:43.358]  And then from there you can wake up.
[00:50:43.358 --> 00:50:44.839]  From there you can understand.
[00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:47.881]  From there you can save yourself and your family.
[00:50:47.881 --> 00:50:49.501]  I don't want to fight you.
[00:50:49.501 --> 00:50:51.162]  I don't want you to be my enemy.
[00:50:51.162 --> 00:50:57.165]  I don't want the globalists to play us off against each other.
[00:50:57.165 --> 00:50:58.326]  We'll be right back with your calls.

[00:52:02.038 --> 00:52:06.039]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:09.300]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.721]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.408 --> 00:52:14.090]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:20.476]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.476 --> 00:52:25.540]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:35.668]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.768 --> 00:52:38.109]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:39.709]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.709 --> 00:52:42.170]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.291]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:49.453]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.453 --> 00:52:58.556]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:10.899 --> 00:53:11.800]  We're good to go!
[00:53:31.772 --> 00:53:32.112]  I think so.
[00:54:06.894 --> 00:54:13.935]  We began tonight's broadcast with the powerful blast of bitter cold and snow that's blanketing much of the country, and it's powerful to be sure.
[00:54:13.935 --> 00:54:16.476]  But its effects will be short-lived.
[00:54:16.476 --> 00:54:25.177]  In contrast, in Copenhagen right now, world leaders are focused on the long-term and potentially devastating effects of climate change, global warming.
[00:54:25.177 --> 00:54:34.899]  And for all the scientific ammunition being presented at the UN conference, some stolen emails are giving encouragement to global warming skeptics.
[00:54:34.899 --> 00:54:36.159]  David Wright has our closer look.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:44.206]  Just as the world seems finally poised to do something about global warming, an inconvenient scandal.
[00:54:44.206 --> 00:54:48.490]  Let's start with the science that has been so settled for all these years.
[00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.453]  Skeptics of climate change suddenly have plenty of new fodder.
[00:54:51.453 --> 00:54:55.436]  There's increasing evidence of scientific fascism that's going on.
[00:54:55.436 --> 00:55:01.262]  A thousand emails dating back more than a dozen years stolen from a top climate research center in Britain.
[00:55:01.502 --> 00:55:05.585]  For the taxpayers' sake, let's look at this controversy from top to bottom.
[00:55:05.585 --> 00:55:11.989]  As the controversy heats up, the consensus about making the tough choices to curb carbon emissions threatens to crumble.
[00:55:11.989 --> 00:55:14.711]  Poor Al Gore!
[00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:20.035]  Global warming completely debunked via the very internet you invented.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.204]  In the emails, the scientists are downright dismissive of naysayers.
[00:55:25.204 --> 00:55:30.909]  In one message, a researcher at Lawrence Livermore Labs offers to beat the crap out of a leading skeptic.
[00:55:30.909 --> 00:55:38.936]  In another, Penn State's Michael Mann suggests hiding data from dissenters, writing, this is the sort of dirty laundry one doesn't want to fall into the wrong hands.
[00:55:39.096 --> 00:55:45.359]  Imagine somebody going through all of the emails you ever sent, looking for a single word or phrase that could be twisted.
[00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:51.082]  One of the most damning email exchanges credits man with a trick to hide the decline in temperatures.
[00:55:51.082 --> 00:56:00.706]  In another, the head of the National Center for Atmospheric Research writes a colleague, the fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.
[00:56:00.706 --> 00:56:08.170]  It shows human nature at work, but I don't think it casts any aspersions on the science.
[00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.912]  Global warming may be a scientific issue, but it's also a hot-button political debate.
[00:56:12.912 --> 00:56:16.353]  So right now, the scientists aren't the only ones on the defensive.
[00:56:16.353 --> 00:56:17.934]  Politicians are, too.
[00:56:17.934 --> 00:56:23.256]  There's nothing in the hacked emails that undermines the science.
[00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:28.779]  That may be true, but the emails threaten to undermine the political effort underway in Copenhagen.
[00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:29.659]  This is going to get worse.
[00:56:29.659 --> 00:56:35.682]  They are going to use this and blow it up way beyond anything that the evidence supports.
[00:56:35.942 --> 00:56:40.144]  At a recent book signing in Chicago, Al Gore was a soft target.
[00:56:40.144 --> 00:56:41.584]  Research Climategate!
[00:56:41.584 --> 00:56:42.845]  This guy's a fraud!
[00:56:42.845 --> 00:56:43.745]  It's a scam!
[00:56:43.745 --> 00:56:51.968]  The protesters wasted little time posting their antics online, where their message now has a worldwide megaphone.
[00:56:51.968 --> 00:56:56.130]  David Wright, ABC News, Washington.
[00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:59.991]  So, there is the propaganda.
[00:56:59.991 --> 00:57:01.091]  A soft target.
[00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:04.333]  See, they used a term associated with terrorism.
[00:57:04.333 --> 00:57:04.393]  Oh!
[00:57:05.458 --> 00:57:11.304]  The We Are Change people found a soft target, an unguarded target.
[00:57:11.304 --> 00:57:17.890]  Of course, they didn't show that they peacefully kept asking when they got up to be able to talk to Al Gore at the book signing, hey, what do you think of climate gay?
[00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.672]  Then they would be grabbed and drug out.
[00:57:20.672 --> 00:57:28.520]  They won't use terrorism analogies about the brown shirts that literally took over and shut down Lord Monckton's little speech today.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:53.328]  By the way, we have another top scientist joining us in the last 30 minutes of the radio show today that you definitely don't want to miss, who is also in Copenhagen confronting these people.
[00:57:53.328 --> 00:57:55.068]  Lord Monckton is set to be popping in.
[00:57:55.068 --> 00:57:56.189]  We're setting that up.
[00:57:56.189 --> 00:57:57.529]  He's confirmed he can come on.
[00:57:57.529 --> 00:57:58.770]  We just need to set up the time.
[00:58:00.595 --> 00:58:02.999]  G. Edward Griffin in studio.
[00:58:02.999 --> 00:58:06.987]  Patrick Henningsen who popped in with us yesterday via video Skype.
[00:58:06.987 --> 00:58:12.417]  He'll be joining us again with a short report in day four of the global government.
[00:58:14.266 --> 00:58:15.186]  Meetings that are going on.
[00:58:15.186 --> 00:58:18.368]  I'm going to come back and go to Mike, Sean, Arnold, Ben, Bruce and others.
[00:58:18.368 --> 00:58:35.196]  I want to encourage everyone to get on DVD, Endgame, to make copies of it, to explain to people the environmental movement or a group of eugenicists already poisoning your water supply and sterilizing you through vaccines, calling for global one-child policies.
[00:58:35.196 --> 00:58:38.237]  Order Endgame today at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:38.237 --> 00:58:39.278]  Get it out to everyone.
[00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:45.303]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.303 --> 00:58:47.627]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.851 --> 00:58:53.852]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.852 --> 00:58:59.175]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.175 --> 00:59:01.235]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.235 --> 00:59:06.238]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.238 --> 00:59:07.418]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.418 --> 00:59:08.539]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.539 --> 00:59:10.419]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.419 --> 00:59:11.500]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.701]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.701 --> 00:59:15.041]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:16.342]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.562 --> 00:59:21.828]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.828 --> 00:59:25.413]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.413 --> 00:59:29.237]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.237 --> 00:59:30.458]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.458 --> 00:59:31.360]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.461]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.461 --> 00:59:33.402]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.402 --> 00:59:34.223]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.483 --> 00:59:37.524]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.524 --> 00:59:39.725]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.725 --> 00:59:40.726]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.726 --> 00:59:41.946]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.946 --> 00:59:43.767]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:09.933]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.933 --> 01:00:11.514]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.514 --> 01:00:13.075]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.075 --> 01:00:17.258]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.258 --> 01:00:21.321]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.017 --> 01:00:30.141]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls right now that I'm going to go through.
[01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:31.703]  All the latest financial news.
[01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.985]  The global government establishment in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:00:33.985 --> 01:00:34.867]  Huge developments there.
[01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:37.468]  More research.
[01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:44.894]  Ecoscience, written by the White House Science Czar, blames Judeo-Christian religions for overpopulation and environmental destruction.
[01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:50.939]  That's the same thing in the National Post out of Canada, calling for a global one-child policy enforced by the United Nations.
[01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:54.221]  Your children will be taken if you have more than one child.
[01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:58.064]  CPS will visit all homes and decide if you can even keep the one child.
[01:00:58.064 --> 01:01:02.888]  These people are the hell force, the spawn of hell.
[01:01:02.888 --> 01:01:04.910]  Mike in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:09.173]  Yes, how are you doing today, Mr. Jones?
[01:01:09.173 --> 01:01:10.514]  Just overwhelmed by everything.
[01:01:10.514 --> 01:01:19.801]  I mean, it's one thing to know they were going to set up world government, but to see it openly happening and the public still going about their business sucking their thumbs is just too much to handle.
[01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:25.166]  I was hoping to kind of get you to compare a couple of things, which I see is very similar.
[01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:31.111]  The way they're using this ClimateGate CRU data and it's been compromised.
[01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:45.232]  And the same way that they used the NIDRD document and they dispersed the NIDRD document through SISME and the THAAD and British Intelligence and the OSP sent it out and also received it.
[01:01:45.232 --> 01:01:53.295]  And every time they would present it as though it was a collaborating report, but it was all coming from the same source.
[01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:58.756]  And this CRU data, you know, when they tried to show that it's not good data,
[01:01:59.281 --> 01:02:04.145]  Yes, the point you're making is the CRU for the IPCC that this East Anglia University was the main clearinghouse that
[01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:25.659]  Made sure that all the data coming in from other major institutions was in line with the fraud, and the emails show that.
[01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:35.143]  And yes, and now there's scandals in Australia, Canada, the US, Germany, as they're finding that their data was cooked in line with this.
[01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:49.970]  I just think it's very comparable with the Niger document because I remember seeing... Fake WMDs, yellow cake, uranium out of Niger, Africa, absolutely unified fraud.
[01:02:49.970 --> 01:03:03.097]  And then we got the White House memo, we got the Downing Street memo, where there were Bush and Blair in two meetings admitting there were no weapons, saying how do we lie to the public, how do we stage shootdowns of our aircraft to blame it on Saddam?
[01:03:03.097 --> 01:03:04.618]  Yes, it's a total fraud.
[01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:15.065]  We know the Italian data is good because we also have information from Assad and we have information from British intelligence that says the same thing.
[01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:16.106]  Well, yes it does.
[01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:17.747]  It came from the same place.
[01:03:17.747 --> 01:03:19.368]  This climate data, it's bad data.
[01:03:21.411 --> 01:03:25.472]  But they point to, you know, first they'll quote one source and then another.
[01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:26.413]  Yes.
[01:03:26.413 --> 01:03:26.673]  Yes.
[01:03:26.673 --> 01:03:32.515]  Climategate comes from the fount, or the source, like of spring pouring out of the side of a mountain.
[01:03:32.515 --> 01:03:34.015]  It is the beginning of the stream.
[01:03:34.015 --> 01:03:35.276]  It is the mouth.
[01:03:35.276 --> 01:03:36.416]  It is the progenitor.
[01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:40.358]  It is the goose that laid the lying, fraudulent egg.
[01:03:41.398 --> 01:03:43.961]  And it's a great point you make.
[01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:51.588]  So the Al Gore, the UN, they all keep saying, but we have all these other peer-reviewed journals citing the same baloney from the same source.
[01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:54.631]  Anything else?
[01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:57.253]  Peer-reviewed journals.
[01:03:57.253 --> 01:03:59.696]  But it's all from the same place.
[01:03:59.696 --> 01:04:01.157]  Thank you for letting me get this in.
[01:04:01.157 --> 01:04:03.139]  I find it extremely insulting.
[01:04:04.626 --> 01:04:09.330]  I know that they're lying to us, but some lies are just more insulting than others.
[01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:22.921]  Well, sir, frankly, saying the Earth's warming is a human's is somewhat insulting, but saying polar bears can't swim, and showing photos of them hunting on ice flows, saying, oh look, it's going to die, and telling kids that in public school everywhere?
[01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:25.223]  I mean, that is insulting, sir.
[01:04:25.223 --> 01:04:29.207]  That is the most asinine, ridiculous propaganda ever seen.
[01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:35.071]  When polar bears hunt on the ice and have been recorded to swim 300 miles.
[01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.792]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:43.757]  I mean, it's just... I've seen national television, I hardly watch TV, saying the penguins are drowning!
[01:04:43.757 --> 01:04:45.338]  Penguins don't fly!
[01:04:45.338 --> 01:04:46.759]  They can hardly walk!
[01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:50.542]  They're a swimming bird that hunts fish!
[01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:53.164]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[01:04:53.164 --> 01:04:55.825]  How stupid do they... Penguins can swim!
[01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.447]  They're not drowning!
[01:04:58.447 --> 01:04:59.288]  I mean, come on!
[01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:07.254]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:07.254 --> 01:05:09.357]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:05:09.357 --> 01:05:11.600]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.262]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:03.753]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.753 --> 01:08:08.156]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.156 --> 01:08:13.961]  All right, I'm going to try to run through as many calls as possible and suspend my ranting for a few minutes before I get into more of this news.
[01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:17.123]  We have four guests coming up today.
[01:08:17.123 --> 01:08:23.588]  G. Edward Griffin, Lord Monckton, Patrick Henningsen,
[01:08:26.027 --> 01:08:35.795]  And of course, Tom Harris, who's an engineer, director, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set up to counter the IPCC and the UN lies.
[01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:36.976]  They're currently in Copenhagen.
[01:08:36.976 --> 01:08:38.877]  He's coming on as well.
[01:08:38.877 --> 01:08:42.961]  We're also working on a Nobel Prize winning climatologist to come on and expose the fraud.
[01:08:42.961 --> 01:08:46.744]  Of course, I don't know what that means now.
[01:08:46.744 --> 01:08:48.085]  Obama just got his today.
[01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:52.668]  Oh, and defended how war is part of peace.
[01:08:52.668 --> 01:08:53.508]  War is peace!
[01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:54.509]  I think I've heard that before.
[01:08:54.509 --> 01:08:57.231]  I think it was a novel called 1984.
[01:08:57.231 --> 01:09:00.113]  Sean in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:00.933]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:08.058]  Well, Alex, I can't thank you enough for being out there for all of us.
[01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:14.723]  You're really the voice that we have been needing to be out there for us for a long time.
[01:09:14.723 --> 01:09:17.585]  I've been screaming some of the same things that you're talking about.
[01:09:18.462 --> 01:09:20.843]  Since the early 1980s.
[01:09:20.843 --> 01:09:23.804]  And it eventually cost me my career in the Navy.
[01:09:23.804 --> 01:09:24.184]  Wow.
[01:09:24.184 --> 01:09:33.988]  But, uh, that's not the main reason I called, uh, my wife and I are pitching to, uh, transfers to the United States, uh, coming through your territory.
[01:09:33.988 --> 01:09:36.309]  And there's a twofold reason for my call.
[01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:46.493]  Number one, I need to know any updates on, uh, payment checkpoints, uh, going through your territory or anywhere across the central part of the U.S.
[01:09:46.493 --> 01:09:47.093]  if you've got them.
[01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:48.108]  I don't know.
[01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:07.126]  Working 12 hours a day, and that's a cutback from 16, 18 hours a day.
[01:10:07.126 --> 01:10:11.409]  A few days ago, I did Coast to Coast AM and looked at the clock.
[01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:14.190]  I did a total of 17 hours of work.
[01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:19.894]  It is just all nose to the grindstone fighting these people, and I just don't have an open house.
[01:10:19.894 --> 01:10:23.095]  I can't meet with people, but God bless you, and I appreciate your call, Sean.
[01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:23.936]  Let me say this.
[01:10:23.936 --> 01:10:25.697]  Yes.
[01:10:25.697 --> 01:10:31.020]  In the last year, it has been mainly in Tennessee papers, but also in Arkansas and Oklahoma papers.
[01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:44.213]  California papers, it just goes on and on, of Army checkpoints, Marine Corps checkpoints, National Guard checkpoints, in the mainstream newspaper, searching people's cars randomly.
[01:10:44.895 --> 01:11:04.283]  They had a four-state drill, was it eight months ago, then another one three months ago, centered around Tennessee, and it said FEMA, Homeland Security, FBI, BATF, State Police, Local Police, County Sheriff's Departments, Army, Marine Corps, National Guard, Air Force, Military Police, and
[01:11:05.154 --> 01:11:13.081]  The governor came out and said, I didn't say you could have these checkpoints, and the military said we're doing it anyways, and it was in the newspapers, the army running checkpoints.
[01:11:13.081 --> 01:11:18.285]  So yes, state police everywhere under federal grants are doing warrantless checkpoints.
[01:11:18.285 --> 01:11:23.130]  In Texas, under federal grants, they passed a law where without warrants they take your blood.
[01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:26.092]  And they just announced on the news, no longer needed warrants in America.
[01:11:28.439 --> 01:11:30.100]  It is just hellish.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.043]  And then the cops come up, it's happened to me, and they say, I want to search your car.
[01:11:33.043 --> 01:11:34.184]  And you say, well, this is America.
[01:11:34.184 --> 01:11:36.425]  What's your due process?
[01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.326]  What's your probable cause?
[01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:43.231]  And they flip out because they've been given training manuals that say that's a sign of terrorism.
[01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:48.155]  And it's just, they are totally destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:11:48.155 --> 01:11:49.776]  And the average cop isn't a bad person.
[01:11:49.776 --> 01:11:50.817]  They're just brainwashed.
[01:11:50.817 --> 01:11:51.898]  It's just so sick.
[01:11:52.847 --> 01:11:54.909]  We're just totally going into police state.
[01:11:54.909 --> 01:12:03.016]  Northcom has announced in the last year and a half, first they were going to deploy 4,000, then 40,000, then 100,000, now 379,000.
[01:12:03.016 --> 01:12:09.282]  Army Times reported regular Army Marine Corps to be deployed in the next three years in brigade homeland operations.
[01:12:09.282 --> 01:12:09.982]  I mean, it's just...
[01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:12.252]  Off the charts insane.
[01:12:12.252 --> 01:12:16.313]  My film Fall of the Republic has all their press releases, videos, statements.
[01:12:16.313 --> 01:12:18.694]  They're training school kids to tattle on their parents.
[01:12:18.694 --> 01:12:24.716]  Videos are coming in everywhere of kids training with police to set up checkpoints and help do gun confiscations.
[01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:31.739]  New York Times reports on it and says, oh look, the Explorer Scouts are trained to go into buildings and take on veterans that won't turn their guns in.
[01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:35.701]  And then it shows the mock dead veterans that the kids kill.
[01:12:36.201 --> 01:12:39.164]  People go, I don't care if a 14-year-old's training, I'll take them on.
[01:12:39.164 --> 01:12:43.528]  They'll be 18 years old in a few years, bubba.
[01:12:43.528 --> 01:12:45.850]  The point is, it's happening.
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:48.852]  And it is just hellish, what's going on.
[01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:59.262]  Yes, I do need to set up some public events in the future, so people can come and meet and hang out and... I just, what's the point of having a hotel event?
[01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:07.469]  Unless you get one where two, three, 4,000 can be there, and that costs like 50,000 bucks to rent that for one day in a cheap hotel.
[01:13:07.469 --> 01:13:09.911]  You have no idea how expensive it is.
[01:13:09.911 --> 01:13:14.173]  And people complain, you know, you gotta charge 25 bucks to be, so I just don't have the events.
[01:13:14.173 --> 01:13:27.862]  I mean, I can sit here and just talk to everybody, free on the radio, everybody can tune in, AM, FM, shortwave, satellite, podcast, and we can have the news, cover the issues, I can make films, and fire and forget.
[01:13:28.582 --> 01:13:33.785]  I make a film, drop it on PrisonPlanet.tv for members to download and burn to disk.
[01:13:33.785 --> 01:13:35.586]  They hit the streets everywhere.
[01:13:35.586 --> 01:13:38.207]  It goes for free up on YouTube, Google, everywhere else.
[01:13:38.207 --> 01:13:40.048]  Tens of millions see it.
[01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:48.192]  Or I could spend tons of energy having a public event that doesn't have one-one-thousandth the firepower.
[01:13:48.192 --> 01:13:52.834]  I build hydrogen bombs in the Infowar.
[01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:56.756]  I build weapons of truth that devastate enemy operations.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:04.103]  And, you know, I'm in here building info weapons right now.
[01:14:04.103 --> 01:14:04.983]  And it's hard to do.
[01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:09.986]  A lot of people are long on talk, short on action.
[01:14:09.986 --> 01:14:11.867]  Not us.
[01:14:11.867 --> 01:14:18.890]  And so there, there's my philosophy on really not ever doing public events anymore.
[01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:21.452]  Hell, I don't know if I'll ever even do another one.
[01:14:21.452 --> 01:14:21.872]  I mean, I...
[01:14:24.386 --> 01:14:33.091]  I like meeting people and at a primitive level it satisfies, but this is the 21st century.
[01:14:33.091 --> 01:14:43.178]  And so I sit here in my InfoWars command center doing the best job I can.
[01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.879]  Let's talk to Arnold in California.
[01:14:44.879 --> 01:14:47.140]  Arnold, you're on the air.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.382]  Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:14:49.382 --> 01:14:51.663]  I do appreciate your show and appreciate everything you do for us.
[01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:56.431]  And just as a plug, Governor Ventura's show yesterday was awesome.
[01:14:56.431 --> 01:14:57.491]  He did a great job.
[01:14:57.491 --> 01:15:00.992]  I was actually surprised by some of the things that they allowed him to say.
[01:15:00.992 --> 01:15:03.372]  But the reason I'm calling this is two things.
[01:15:03.372 --> 01:15:06.713]  First of all, I was in the military in the early 90s.
[01:15:06.713 --> 01:15:09.914]  And during that time, we worked.
[01:15:09.914 --> 01:15:11.354]  I was in the Marines.
[01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:14.635]  We did some work, allegedly, with the DEA.
[01:15:15.495 --> 01:15:19.317]  To go look for marijuana plants in the Cleveland National Forest.
[01:15:19.317 --> 01:15:21.397]  Yeah, that's how they broke the ice.
[01:15:21.397 --> 01:15:23.958]  That's how they broke the ice 25 years ago or more.
[01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:26.819]  I guess it started in about 1981.
[01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:29.080]  And from there, it's just total control.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.301]  Go ahead.
[01:15:30.301 --> 01:15:31.141]  Correct.
[01:15:31.141 --> 01:15:34.983]  And I remember them talking about Composita Comunitaria.
[01:15:34.983 --> 01:15:40.565]  But if I remember correctly, they said that that did not pertain to us because we were working with another federal agency.
[01:15:41.007 --> 01:15:42.207]  Yeah, it's total lies.
[01:15:42.207 --> 01:15:51.751]  I've had top JAG lawyers, judges on, and they are just blown away by the way Posse Commentatus has been rendered a useless vehicle.
[01:15:51.751 --> 01:16:01.555]  Correct, but the main reason why I'm calling, my brother came over to my house yesterday, and he was sharing this story with me, and it kind of set me back a little bit.
[01:16:01.555 --> 01:16:07.517]  He was sharing with me that he went to a friend's house to share one of your DVDs, I think it was 9-11 Road to Tyranny?
[01:16:08.672 --> 01:16:32.901]  That friend had a friend that was in the military, active duty army, and when my brother put, he's also an evangelist, when he was evangelizing and he put the DVD in, this active duty army person got up in arms and threatened my brother, told him that he was going to call his superior and get my brother for terrorist threats.
[01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:37.223]  This army individual was on the phone three to four times, calling his superior,
[01:16:37.842 --> 01:16:45.924]  And from that point and forward, my brother was uneasy with the way everything... Oh yeah, no, no, the military's being taught that free speech is illegal.
[01:16:45.924 --> 01:16:53.046]  In Road to Tyranny, from 2001, well it came out in 2002, but the video's from 2000, we show you the training manuals
[01:16:57.247 --> 01:17:03.089]  That they show state police, military, and others, and it says, if you talk about the Constitution, you're a terrorist.
[01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:03.929]  It actually says that.
[01:17:03.929 --> 01:17:10.111]  Then we have FEMA training police that that's the case, the actual video sent to us by a firefighter who was at the meeting in Kansas City.
[01:17:10.111 --> 01:17:16.853]  Then we show, from a squad car video, a woman, Navy veteran Abby Newman, no criminal record, pulled over.
[01:17:16.853 --> 01:17:20.314]  They find a police state 2000 in the back of her car, in the trunk.
[01:17:20.914 --> 01:17:21.014]  Sure.
[01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:44.432]  And they go, I can't believe we found one of the extremists, we found one of the terrorists, she's got a pocket constitution, is this illegal?
[01:17:44.432 --> 01:17:49.757]  And they start heavy breathing, and then the commander comes over and goes, I may think she's allowed to have that.
[01:17:49.757 --> 01:17:52.679]  I think she may be allowed to still have that in America.
[01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:57.604]  It's a constitution, what they've sworn an oath to, so you see the total brainwashing.
[01:17:57.604 --> 01:18:02.649]  So yes, of course, so is your brother in the military, or was this guy calling the military on him?
[01:18:03.587 --> 01:18:05.628]  This guy was calling the military on him.
[01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:10.829]  It was off-base, everything was in... This all took place in the city of Sacramento.
[01:18:10.829 --> 01:18:12.570]  But is your brother in the military?
[01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:13.890]  No, he's not.
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:19.272]  So the military guy is calling the military thinking that a U.S.
[01:18:19.272 --> 01:18:22.032]  citizen isn't allowed to have a video.
[01:18:22.032 --> 01:18:24.513]  Basically, that's what took place.
[01:18:24.513 --> 01:18:26.054]  And to me... So how did this end?
[01:18:26.054 --> 01:18:26.614]  How did this end?
[01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:40.613]  Well, the way it ended was this guy in the army was looking out the back window like if he was expecting somebody to break through the window at any time to come to arrest my brother, basically.
[01:18:40.613 --> 01:18:42.274]  And see how they're completely insane?
[01:18:42.274 --> 01:18:45.757]  You know, the Nazis seem insane, but they were told by their government
[01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:49.157]  To take children and line them up and shoot them in the back of the head.
[01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:50.477]  And so they did it.
[01:18:50.477 --> 01:18:52.478]  And so they're the bad guys.
[01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:56.139]  A lot of the military's awake, but this guy's obviously a lunatic of tyranny.
[01:18:56.139 --> 01:19:11.883]  And look, Kelly Rushing, no criminal record, upstanding, old family, Lyon County, Kentucky, in the newspaper, gave a state police officer a Ron Paul video and rode to tyranny on one VHS slow play.
[01:19:12.543 --> 01:19:12.623]  Yeah.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:43.923]  For Ron Paul's congressional 45-minute neocon speech and for Road to Tyranny, they wanted him to spend six years in jail consecutively for two counts of, quote, anti-law enforcement material, and the jury found him not guilty.
[01:19:43.923 --> 01:19:52.245]  But that judge and the Kentucky State Police want to put Americans in prison for Ron Paul video.
[01:19:52.245 --> 01:19:54.785]  They charged him for the Ron Paul video.
[01:19:54.785 --> 01:19:57.966]  Now, that's what America has turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:00.538 --> 01:20:02.960]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.862]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:20:04.862 --> 01:20:06.703]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[01:20:06.703 --> 01:20:08.144]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:20:08.144 --> 01:20:10.927]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:20:10.927 --> 01:20:16.572]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:20:16.572 --> 01:20:18.253]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:20:18.253 --> 01:20:20.875]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:21.336]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:20:23.357 --> 01:20:24.637]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:20:24.637 --> 01:20:27.138]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:20:27.138 --> 01:20:31.039]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:20:31.039 --> 01:20:33.179]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.
[01:20:33.179 --> 01:20:38.501]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[01:20:48.603 --> 01:20:48.923]  Call the number.
[01:20:53.064 --> 01:20:54.187]  Call now for your free CD.

[01:21:01.181 --> 01:21:02.222]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.222 --> 01:21:07.747]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:07.747 --> 01:21:08.287]  I get it.
[01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:17.915]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:19.316]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.316 --> 01:21:23.700]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.741]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[01:21:25.741 --> 01:21:27.783]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:31.165]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.165 --> 01:21:35.448]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.448 --> 01:21:37.050]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:40.452]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:40.452 --> 01:21:44.835]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:44.835 --> 01:21:45.736]  You should, too.
[01:21:45.736 --> 01:21:46.877]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:46.877 --> 01:21:50.119]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.299 --> 01:21:50.359]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.359 --> 01:21:50.479]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:50.719]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:53.321]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:53.321 --> 01:21:55.022]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:55.022 --> 01:21:56.484]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:11.238 --> 01:22:13.899]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.899 --> 01:22:20.300]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:25.341]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:28.642]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:22:28.642 --> 01:22:35.463]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.944]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.944 --> 01:22:39.525]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.525 --> 01:22:41.986]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.986 --> 01:22:44.107]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:44.107 --> 01:22:49.269]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:49.269 --> 01:22:58.352]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:00.919 --> 01:23:02.904]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:23:02.904 --> 01:23:06.171]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:23:06.171 --> 01:23:09.659]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:23:10.606 --> 01:23:19.811]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:22.032]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[01:23:22.032 --> 01:23:27.755]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:32.518]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:23:33.178 --> 01:23:38.182]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:23:38.182 --> 01:23:41.264]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:23:41.264 --> 01:23:46.808]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.

[01:23:57.716 --> 01:23:59.097]  This call could save your life.
[01:24:20.601 --> 01:24:25.002]  The public is being trained that there's no free speech in America.
[01:24:25.002 --> 01:24:28.343]  First free speech zones, it spreads out from there.
[01:24:28.343 --> 01:24:33.385]  We knew more than 10 years ago the police were being trained that talking about the Constitution is illegal.
[01:24:33.385 --> 01:24:34.525]  We have the training manuals.
[01:24:34.525 --> 01:24:39.027]  Now you see it in the MIAC report and the Homeland Security reports.
[01:24:39.027 --> 01:24:45.749]  Yes, it's insane for anyone that understands what America is all about or any free country is supposed to be about, but it's really happening, Arnold.
[01:24:47.352 --> 01:24:56.459]  And there's just a lot of mentally ill people that work for the system and they think that criticizing the government is illegal.
[01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.861]  We better watch out.
[01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:05.067]  Because the government goes through the police and military and finds these mentally ill, weak-minded people and promotes them.
[01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:07.529]  Let's talk to Ben in Virginia.
[01:25:07.529 --> 01:25:10.051]  Ben, you're on the air.
[01:25:10.051 --> 01:25:12.533]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:25:12.533 --> 01:25:14.915]  Ah, total world government's coming in like a flood right now.
[01:25:14.915 --> 01:25:16.176]  We're defending as best we can.
[01:25:17.344 --> 01:25:17.984]  Awful.
[01:25:17.984 --> 01:25:20.145]  Yeah, well I just had a couple of things to say.
[01:25:20.145 --> 01:25:21.405]  First off, a suggestion.
[01:25:21.405 --> 01:25:24.085]  I was thinking that maybe you could do an infomercial.
[01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:27.506]  I think that'd be a great infobomb.
[01:25:27.506 --> 01:25:30.047]  You know, I've thought about trying to produce an infomercial.
[01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:33.287]  It's just the time and energy and the money it takes.
[01:25:33.287 --> 01:25:40.549]  You know, we're not as big as some people imagine, but it is a good idea.
[01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:42.589]  I had another thing.
[01:25:42.589 --> 01:25:46.530]  If you want to make a little bit of money off of these global warming nuts, all you've got to do is make a bet.
[01:25:47.133 --> 01:26:01.846]  You fill up a glass of water halfway with water, and then you put it in the microwave for about a minute just to get the water warm, and then you add ice cubes until there's ice up over the top of the glass, and you say, when the water melts, will it flood?
[01:26:01.846 --> 01:26:05.169]  And this is the exact same thing that will happen with the ice caps.
[01:26:05.169 --> 01:26:10.534]  Of course it won't flood, because as you know, those ice caps are displacing their own amount of water in
[01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:13.231]  The, uh, in the sea that they're in right now.
[01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:18.096]  Well, actually, as you know, when water freezes, it displaces a lot more space.
[01:26:18.096 --> 01:26:19.897]  So, uh, the test has been done.
[01:26:19.897 --> 01:26:25.803]  You can pile it all the way up with ice, and then it'll melt and be lower than the top of the glass.
[01:26:25.803 --> 01:26:27.965]  Just make the bet, and they'll fall for it.
[01:26:27.965 --> 01:26:29.467]  You make five, ten bucks every time.
[01:26:29.946 --> 01:26:31.607]  I know.
[01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:33.008]  It's incredible.
[01:26:33.008 --> 01:26:36.409]  You can go up to these people and say, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:26:36.409 --> 01:26:39.731]  And because it sounds scary, they'll say, ban it.
[01:26:39.731 --> 01:26:43.513]  And you can also go up and say, hey, you know, polar bears can't swim, I hear.
[01:26:43.513 --> 01:26:46.555]  Let's make a bet that there are more polar bears and that they can swim.
[01:26:46.555 --> 01:26:47.835]  And they'll say, OK.
[01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:53.798]  And then you can show them, you know, nature films of them swimming and hunting and that their numbers are higher.
[01:26:53.798 --> 01:26:55.039]  And they'll go, what?
[01:26:56.141 --> 01:26:59.062]  Make them a bet that penguins can swim, and they'll go, no they can't!
[01:26:59.062 --> 01:27:00.042]  They're all drowning!
[01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:03.423]  I mean, these people, these people believe anything.
[01:27:03.423 --> 01:27:06.524]  They just love being morons and being fooled by everything.
[01:27:06.524 --> 01:27:08.004]  I appreciate your call, Ben.
[01:27:08.004 --> 01:27:08.985]  Bruce in Michigan.
[01:27:08.985 --> 01:27:09.765]  Bruce, go ahead.
[01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:12.146]  Hey.
[01:27:12.146 --> 01:27:13.186]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.106]  How you doing?
[01:27:14.106 --> 01:27:15.226]  Good.
[01:27:15.226 --> 01:27:21.528]  Hey, I just want to let you know you're doing a great job, and up here we meet on a Thursday night.
[01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:22.348]  There's a bunch of us.
[01:27:22.348 --> 01:27:24.029]  We watch your videos, David Icke.
[01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:25.282]  Thank you.
[01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:56.178]  I mean, the analogy is this.
[01:27:56.178 --> 01:27:59.660]  I'm sitting here at an anti-aircraft gun.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:03.122]  There are so many targets coming in, bombing our liberties.
[01:28:03.122 --> 01:28:12.969]  I am blasting them, blowing them to bits, and I don't have time to jump in a car and drive a thousand miles to maybe
[01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:18.772]  Maybe be able to take on some enemy forces in the Info War.
[01:28:18.772 --> 01:28:21.133]  I have got so many targets.
[01:28:21.133 --> 01:28:25.174]  Everything we do turns to solid gold in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:28.335]  If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.
[01:28:28.335 --> 01:28:35.617]  And we are just here absolutely waking people up because of you, the listeners, spreading the word.
[01:28:35.617 --> 01:28:40.458]  And so, again, making the films, doing the radio show, making the YouTube videos,
[01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.328]  The people are ready to hear the truth.
[01:28:43.328 --> 01:28:47.892]  The people are waking up in mass everywhere.
[01:28:47.892 --> 01:28:49.213]  And I have a wanderlust.
[01:28:49.213 --> 01:28:51.335]  I would love to travel around the country.
[01:28:51.335 --> 01:28:55.618]  I would love to be able to go and speak to crowds.
[01:28:55.618 --> 01:28:57.820]  I really get fired up in front of crowds.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.603]  I give good speeches, so I've been told.
[01:29:00.603 --> 01:29:03.865]  And I'm a decent orator, especially in front of crowds.
[01:29:07.463 --> 01:29:17.710]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I am here hour after hour every day just studying what's going on so that I understand what's happening so I can go out and present to people what's really going on.
[01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:30.199]  I mean, I went to Hardin, and the good news is about half the people that drove by or were in shops or stores or gas stations were listeners.
[01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.481]  Half the people in the middle of Montana.
[01:29:33.692 --> 01:29:35.534]  And it's the same thing everywhere I go.
[01:29:35.534 --> 01:29:40.519]  And that's a gauge of just how many people we're reaching, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:40.519 --> 01:29:41.580]  It is incredible.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.723]  So more people are awake than you or I even know.
[01:29:44.723 --> 01:29:47.265]  It is so good what's happening.
[01:29:47.265 --> 01:29:48.947]  But people need to be waking up.
[01:29:48.947 --> 01:29:51.389]  I mean, world government's openly been announced.
[01:29:51.389 --> 01:29:52.791]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.791 --> 01:29:55.313]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.313 --> 01:29:58.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.404 --> 01:30:04.946]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.946 --> 01:30:05.867]  Number one.
[01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:09.289]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.289 --> 01:30:10.149]  Number two.
[01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:15.032]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.032 --> 01:30:15.792]  It's true.
[01:30:15.792 --> 01:30:20.335]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.655 --> 01:30:21.476]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.476 --> 01:30:25.059]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.059 --> 01:30:28.982]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.982 --> 01:30:29.782]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.782 --> 01:30:32.544]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.544 --> 01:30:36.227]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.227 --> 01:30:37.008]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.008 --> 01:30:41.151]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.151 --> 01:30:45.915]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.195 --> 01:30:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.163]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.163 --> 01:30:54.426]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.426 --> 01:30:56.749]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:00.799 --> 01:31:03.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:09.143]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.143 --> 01:31:11.184]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.184 --> 01:31:16.186]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.186 --> 01:31:17.367]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.367 --> 01:31:18.487]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.487 --> 01:31:20.388]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.388 --> 01:31:21.449]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.449 --> 01:31:23.650]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:24.990]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:26.311]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.511 --> 01:31:31.776]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.776 --> 01:31:35.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.184]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.184 --> 01:31:40.425]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.425 --> 01:31:41.326]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.326 --> 01:31:42.427]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.427 --> 01:31:43.368]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.368 --> 01:31:44.169]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:47.490]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:50.611]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:51.531]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.781 --> 01:32:05.088]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.088 --> 01:32:09.614]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.614 --> 01:32:11.897]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:11.897 --> 01:32:13.519]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.519 --> 01:32:14.561]  There is a solution.
[01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:23.207]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:32:23.207 --> 01:32:30.652]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:32:30.652 --> 01:32:36.316]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:32:36.696 --> 01:32:42.722]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:32:42.722 --> 01:32:46.866]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:32:46.866 --> 01:32:54.333]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:57.637]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:33:21.668 --> 01:33:30.591]  If the people stand up and take action against the New World Order, it cannot stand.
[01:33:30.591 --> 01:33:33.872]  These con artist criminals will fall.
[01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:39.474]  They're in danger of toppling right now at the key moment at the birth of their world government.
[01:33:39.474 --> 01:33:46.656]  Meanwhile, scores of mainstream newspapers are calling for one-child policies worldwide in the last week.
[01:33:47.486 --> 01:33:55.728]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, Clay, Danny, Michael, Kyle, and others, and I'm going to run through the news before Patrick Henningsen joins us from Copenhagen, a reporter there.
[01:34:16.946 --> 01:34:24.168]  G. Edward Griffin in studio, Lord Monckton popping in to talk about how the George Soros crowd took over one of his events today.
[01:34:24.168 --> 01:34:41.793]  And we also have, joining us from Copenhagen, Tom Harris, engineer, executive director of the International Climate Studies Coalition, a massive scientific group set to counter the IPCC-UN fraud and Climategate.
[01:34:41.793 --> 01:34:43.053]  That is all coming up today.
[01:34:44.733 --> 01:34:54.057]  For the next five minutes, I am honored with our once-a-month visit with Acola Blue, Jill Lawrence, Regional Director of Sales.
[01:34:54.057 --> 01:34:56.138]  You can go to acolablue.com and find out more.
[01:34:56.138 --> 01:34:59.740]  They do this promotion for a few days once a month.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:07.443]  It starts today, Thursday, and runs till Monday, December 14th of next week.
[01:35:07.443 --> 01:35:11.785]  You get a huge discount.
[01:35:13.206 --> 01:35:14.207]  On the Ecola Blue 28.
[01:35:14.207 --> 01:35:18.249]  I guess that comes out to a 20% discount.
[01:35:18.249 --> 01:35:22.671]  This atmospheric water generator where you can trust the government and drink the tap water.
[01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:23.591]  Going to Jill Lawrence.
[01:35:23.591 --> 01:35:24.692]  Jill, good to have you on with us.
[01:35:24.692 --> 01:35:26.693]  Hi Alex, thanks so much.
[01:35:26.693 --> 01:35:28.213]  My pleasure, truly.
[01:35:28.213 --> 01:35:30.294]  Yeah, isn't that the truth?
[01:35:30.294 --> 01:35:40.479]  Any level of government and the municipal water supply systems are really under scrutiny because of a good reason.
[01:35:40.479 --> 01:35:41.100]  They're failing.
[01:35:42.662 --> 01:36:05.406]  This is a way, the Ecola Blue, that we have a brand new product launching today which we're so excited about because it took something that was already extraordinary now to a remarkable level of engineering and it really gives you and your family the gift of peace of mind because you don't have to worry about being
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.242]  Part of the municipal water supply system.
[01:36:09.242 --> 01:36:11.464]  How many pharmaceuticals are in the water?
[01:36:11.464 --> 01:36:13.646]  How many pollutants are in the water?
[01:36:13.646 --> 01:36:15.567]  Did a terrorist get to the water?
[01:36:15.567 --> 01:36:16.508]  All that kind of thing.
[01:36:16.508 --> 01:36:22.893]  Because this generates water, as you well know Alex, right out of the air in your very own home.
[01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:26.176]  So it's an amazing, amazing thing.
[01:36:26.176 --> 01:36:29.719]  We're just dancing in the streets with this new unit, this Ecolablu.
[01:36:29.719 --> 01:36:35.724]  Yeah, describe to folks the line of products, how an Ecolablu works, and the new line you're launching today here on air, Jill.
[01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:47.017]  Okay, well, the basic premise is an atmospheric water generator, which is something that extracts the moisture or the humidity out of the air.
[01:36:47.017 --> 01:36:49.138]  If you think about a cloud, that's a good example.
[01:36:49.138 --> 01:36:56.103]  A cloud is an accumulation of water vapor before it drops the rain to the ground kind of thing.
[01:36:56.103 --> 01:36:59.485]  And so we beat that kind of natural cycle.
[01:36:59.485 --> 01:37:03.108]  We take it out of the air with this atmospheric water generator.
[01:37:03.809 --> 01:37:08.012]  High-tech, the most advanced in the whole industry.
[01:37:08.012 --> 01:37:26.883]  Extract the moisture from the air in your own home, then we run it with our new system, our new Ecologalist 30, through 12 filter and purification systems, which gives you... You remember Ivory Snow, Alex, where they were highly touting that it was 99.9% pure?
[01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:28.744]  That was the zenith of purity?
[01:37:28.744 --> 01:37:30.545]  Well, that's our purity level.
[01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:32.206]  You can't get better.
[01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:36.842]  And it just eliminates anything that could cause a problem for you.
[01:37:36.842 --> 01:37:39.424]  So it runs it through all this filtering system.
[01:37:39.424 --> 01:37:47.210]  And then it delivers eight gallons of crystalline pure water for your family every single day.
[01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.271]  It's amazing.
[01:37:48.271 --> 01:37:51.334]  You need no water source.
[01:37:51.334 --> 01:37:51.994]  None.
[01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:52.895]  Just the air.
[01:37:52.895 --> 01:37:54.856]  And we do have air, thank God.
[01:37:54.856 --> 01:37:58.639]  So the new system, the new Ecola Blue System, we have a 28.
[01:37:59.727 --> 01:38:10.176]  Which is still wonderful, and you're right, we are discounting it from the original price of $13.50 to $9.99, so you save $351.
[01:38:10.176 --> 01:38:21.345]  You can order that, and or you can order the Ecola Blue 30, which is our brand new unit launching today for the very first time, for $13.99 and get free shipping.
[01:38:21.345 --> 01:38:24.247]  So if you go to ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com,
[01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:49.504]  You can take advantage of it by entering the coupon code, guess what, Alex Jones, and just put that all together, A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S, and you'll get your shipping for free with the Ecolo Blue unit, or you'll get this huge 26% reduction in the Ecolo Blue 28.
[01:38:49.504 --> 01:38:54.767]  So that runs through until midnight on Monday, December 14th.
[01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:55.708]  You can also call.
[01:38:57.010 --> 01:39:05.218]  People are there to answer all your questions, anything you want to talk about relative to the units, and that's at 800 toll-free number 800-691-6043.
[01:39:05.218 --> 01:39:05.278]  800-691-6043.
[01:39:05.278 --> 01:39:10.883]  So you'll find everybody in a very festive mood today because we're celebrating this incredible, incredible breakthrough.
[01:39:10.883 --> 01:39:12.224]  This new unit has
[01:39:20.747 --> 01:39:48.987]  What an LCD touchscreen and it is really sexy it is very user-friendly You can control the temperature of your hot water your cold water Just at the touch of a screen and you can also determine when you want the machine to generate water for you You can have it process at night only if you want to It has it really has a beautiful new sleek design and it also has a much lower energy usage
[01:39:49.594 --> 01:39:51.736]  We've done something pretty amazing.
[01:39:51.736 --> 01:40:01.866]  It's a remarkable reduction in what already was pretty low energy usage, but now we've got a machine that operates efficiently at about 300 watts only.
[01:40:03.502 --> 01:40:05.324]  Compared to about $4.50 for the 28.
[01:40:05.324 --> 01:40:06.546]  They're both excellent.
[01:40:22.146 --> 01:40:31.572]  Uh, water cooler, Robbie the Robot water cooler without the water bottle on top, and it just grabs the humidity out of the air, then sends it through all the great filtration systems.
[01:40:31.572 --> 01:40:35.654]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:40:35.654 --> 01:40:42.878]  Those are huge discounts on both these units, but you rarely see some new item discounted out of the gates, but I know you guys are excited about it.
[01:40:42.878 --> 01:40:44.479]  So the Ecolablue 30.
[01:40:44.479 --> 01:40:47.481]  Folks, you have until next Monday evening to take advantage of this, but don't wait.
[01:40:47.921 --> 01:40:54.783]  Go check out the great line of products at acolablue.com or check out the banners on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:40:54.783 --> 01:40:57.803]  Have a great weekend coming up, Jill, and thank you so much for joining us.
[01:40:57.803 --> 01:40:58.464]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:40:58.464 --> 01:41:01.084]  Don't forget the coupon code, Alex Jones.
[01:41:01.084 --> 01:41:01.744]  Alex Jones.
[01:41:01.744 --> 01:41:03.065]  I've heard of that guy before.
[01:41:03.065 --> 01:41:04.825]  I thought that would ring a bell.
[01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:05.465]  Thanks so much.
[01:41:05.465 --> 01:41:06.586]  Enjoy the rest of the minute.
[01:41:06.586 --> 01:41:07.306]  Thank you, Jill.
[01:41:07.306 --> 01:41:07.726]  Thank you.
[01:41:07.726 --> 01:41:08.326]  God bless you.
[01:41:08.326 --> 01:41:10.507]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:41:10.507 --> 01:41:13.747]  Okay, I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:41:13.747 --> 01:41:15.568]  I mean, what's been happening with ClimateGate?
[01:41:17.489 --> 01:41:33.087]  And the global government being established and the Danish text leak of the official treaty is that I'm really shocked into amazement, even though I knew this was all coming, even though I knew our enemies operating plans.
[01:41:35.336 --> 01:41:39.444]  I am grieving for the world and my nation and for my family.
[01:41:39.444 --> 01:41:47.499]  I mean, I really know that these people are murdering killers who want to have a global one-child policy and who are spiking the water supply and the vaccines with steroids and chemicals.
[01:41:48.786 --> 01:41:49.746]  I mean, I have hundreds.
[01:41:49.746 --> 01:41:53.008]  We've bought hundreds of textbooks they wrote, hundreds of white papers.
[01:41:53.008 --> 01:42:03.792]  I'm knee-deep in new John P. Holdren and Ehrlich and Pianka and Gore Vidal and Al Gore talk of forced population reduction articles the last two days.
[01:42:03.792 --> 01:42:09.214]  We're there openly saying it in Playboy magazine, you name it.
[01:42:09.214 --> 01:42:17.737]  And to have the new treaty that openly states it's a world government, that it's meant to shut down the third world and the first world, that the third world was suckered and told
[01:42:19.013 --> 01:42:22.575]  That they were not going to have to make cuts.
[01:42:22.575 --> 01:42:27.797]  Turns out they've got to make right at double the cuts the West does.
[01:42:27.797 --> 01:42:32.679]  The IMF and World Bank will take all this private tax money and then loan it back to the countries.
[01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:37.521]  I mean, this is total global feudalism and slavery.
[01:42:37.521 --> 01:42:41.402]  And I can't believe that we are still called the kooks by the mainstream media.
[01:42:41.402 --> 01:42:42.923]  I mean, I know that's their job, but
[01:42:46.365 --> 01:42:47.906]  It's just so illegitimate.
[01:42:47.906 --> 01:42:48.886]  It's so criminal.
[01:42:48.886 --> 01:42:52.627]  It's so obviously ridiculous.
[01:42:52.627 --> 01:42:56.689]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:42:56.689 --> 01:43:04.592]  And I read article after article in national and international papers calling for forced one-child policies and calling for taking people's children.
[01:43:04.592 --> 01:43:15.456]  And I read all the government textbooks, how they're going to raise all the children in dormitories and how after they've bankrupted almost everyone, they're going to take your children and raise them in government facilities and those that have enough money to
[01:43:16.448 --> 01:43:30.615]  Be able to still take care of their families, you're gonna have home inspections, and the universities are just disgorging millions of new bureaucrats and control freaks to run our lives, and... It's just so horrible!
[01:43:30.615 --> 01:43:33.397]  I just don't want it to happen!
[01:43:33.397 --> 01:43:38.899]  I want justice and goodness and honor!
[01:43:38.899 --> 01:43:43.162]  I want to be free!
[01:43:43.162 --> 01:43:43.522]  But no!
[01:43:44.972 --> 01:43:55.977]  In the government documents, in the government reports, Ron Paul's the bad man, I'm the bad man, Dr. Tim Ball's the bad man.
[01:43:55.977 --> 01:44:02.440]  You have these criminals running around demonizing good people.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:10.363]  You have them openly deploying military on the streets, openly setting up checkpoints everywhere, openly introducing draconian gun-grabbing bills.
[01:44:15.117 --> 01:44:17.039]  The elite are in the middle of a revolution.
[01:44:17.039 --> 01:44:18.180]  They are the revolutionaries.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:19.601]  They are taking over our society.
[01:44:19.601 --> 01:44:21.283]  They are lawless criminals.
[01:44:21.283 --> 01:44:24.166]  They are illegitimate criminals.
[01:44:24.166 --> 01:44:28.310]  The big global corporations get $50 billion plus in U.S.
[01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:34.395]  auto bailouts to pay to move General Motors and others to Brazil, China, and Eastern Europe.
[01:44:34.395 --> 01:44:38.139]  Publicly!
[01:44:38.139 --> 01:44:38.900]  Worst of all,
[01:44:40.299 --> 01:44:43.981]  Third World Under Attack from Genocidal Climate Change Policy.
[01:44:43.981 --> 01:45:03.633]  That's an article that everyone, if we could get every person in the world to read that, or even 20% to see that article, and to read the quotes and the documents and the statements of how the elite want to shut off the energy sources to kill the third world, and they know that if moderate carbon cuts are made, a billion people will die in the next decade.
[01:45:03.633 --> 01:45:09.137]  That is a billion dead people killed by a Nazi-like eugenic system.
[01:45:13.348 --> 01:45:18.090]  Little children with their ribs sticking out, collapsing and dying.
[01:45:18.090 --> 01:45:26.673]  Little children being forcibly given smallpox and polio shots that are live smallpox and polio.
[01:45:26.673 --> 01:45:28.493]  Associated Press killing them.
[01:45:28.493 --> 01:45:29.954]  UN doing it on purpose.
[01:45:29.954 --> 01:45:33.415]  The AP reports it like it's a good thing.
[01:45:33.415 --> 01:45:38.657]  Oh, well, yeah, the shots were filled with live virus, killed them, but so what?
[01:45:38.657 --> 01:45:40.158]  Oh, a weaponized strain was in there.
[01:45:40.158 --> 01:45:40.758]  I mean, it's just...
[01:45:43.078 --> 01:45:45.540]  It's just so incredible.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.281]  And they're gonna pass it.
[01:45:47.281 --> 01:45:50.243]  Even if we beat it in the US, they're implementing it at the state level.
[01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:52.164]  And they're gonna kill all these people.
[01:45:52.164 --> 01:45:53.865]  They're gonna kill them.
[01:45:53.865 --> 01:45:57.688]  And you can go to any major university and see the people with their Rasta fake hair.
[01:45:59.104 --> 01:46:04.327]  The wannabe white Rastafarians in their sandals and patchouli going, it's what we've got to do for the earth.
[01:46:04.327 --> 01:46:07.168]  And I just want to knock their Nazi teeth out.
[01:46:07.168 --> 01:46:17.033]  Don't you understand the real Nazis have fake Rasta hair and limp wrist and you know they're walking around at coffee shops acting real cool and I just want to knock their teeth out.
[01:46:17.033 --> 01:46:23.517]  I want to take them to Africa and Latin America and let them see a kid with their ribs sticking out with diarrhea pouring out of them dying.
[01:46:23.517 --> 01:46:25.118]  I want to crush your skull!
[01:46:27.045 --> 01:46:29.786]  Because I'm just a normal mammal.
[01:46:29.786 --> 01:46:39.371]  I'm a normal, normal creature that when I see innocents being torn apart, my instinct is as a warrior to stand up and fight.
[01:46:39.371 --> 01:46:41.052]  I'm not worried about being killed.
[01:46:41.052 --> 01:46:42.813]  I'm not worried about being set up.
[01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:44.314]  I'm not worried about being tortured.
[01:46:44.314 --> 01:46:47.976]  I'm not worried about being demonized in the mainstream media.
[01:46:47.976 --> 01:46:53.439]  I'm only worried about you, the listeners, buying into COINTELPRO, spinning your wheels, infighting.
[01:46:54.019 --> 01:46:56.140]  The fight is out there with the New World Order.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:58.261]  The fight is with the North American Union.
[01:46:58.261 --> 01:46:59.842]  The fight is with the UN.
[01:46:59.842 --> 01:47:07.987]  The fight is with the IMF and World Bank and their private owners, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of London, Bank of England, based in London.
[01:47:07.987 --> 01:47:09.168]  The fight is out there!
[01:47:15.876 --> 01:47:19.357]  I want all of you to redouble your efforts against the New World Order.
[01:47:19.357 --> 01:47:21.217]  I want you to get serious.
[01:47:21.217 --> 01:47:22.337]  I want you to get focused.
[01:47:22.337 --> 01:47:34.080]  I don't want the globalist divide-and-conquer programs they run to keep you from getting involved and realizing that you can warn people about the tap water, and about vaccines, and about the chemtrails, and about real issues.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:42.962]  And you can go into your counties and cities and rural areas and teach people they don't have to sign the animal ID, premises ID, that waives your rights to your property to the feds and makes you a serf.
[01:47:44.122 --> 01:47:48.885]  I want to warn people about the slavery we're going into.
[01:47:48.885 --> 01:47:50.085]  That's all I want to do!
[01:47:50.085 --> 01:48:08.335]  I have zero fear of being killed, zero fear of being demonized, zero fear of them putting me on a rack and torturing me for 10 years and turning me into a drugged out zombie they can trot out on television like they're doing their patsies with this new 9-11 trial.
[01:48:08.335 --> 01:48:09.816]  I'm not worried about that.
[01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.397]  I'm worried about these people winning.
[01:48:12.495 --> 01:48:21.823]  And if you'd get the spirit of freedom and the spirit of action in your gut, nothing on earth can stop you from beating these people.
[01:48:21.823 --> 01:48:22.924]  And I want them defeated!
[01:48:22.924 --> 01:48:35.614]  These are sniveling, sicko, control freak murderers, and I've had it with them!
[01:48:35.614 --> 01:48:36.155]  I've had it!
[01:48:37.287 --> 01:48:38.608]  With fake liberals!
[01:48:38.608 --> 01:48:40.710]  They're a bunch of eugenicist cult members!
[01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:45.613]  I've had it with fake conservatives, a bunch of imperial, warmongering scum!
[01:48:45.613 --> 01:48:52.918]  I've had it with all your injustice and all your foolishness!
[01:48:52.918 --> 01:48:54.359]  I've had it.
[01:48:54.359 --> 01:48:54.860]  I've had it!
[01:48:56.718 --> 01:48:59.420]  These people are waging war on you!
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:02.482]  And so many of you fools think you're part of the system, you're not!
[01:49:02.482 --> 01:49:03.523]  You got that?
[01:49:03.523 --> 01:49:04.183]  You got me?
[01:49:04.183 --> 01:49:05.344]  This is real!
[01:49:05.344 --> 01:49:06.225]  Mao was real!
[01:49:06.225 --> 01:49:07.265]  Hitler was real!
[01:49:07.265 --> 01:49:08.426]  Stalin was real!
[01:49:08.426 --> 01:49:11.488]  And Al Gore is real!
[01:49:11.488 --> 01:49:18.633]  Barack Obama telling Congress, hey, I don't care if you don't shut down the carbon and shut down industry in America, I'm gonna do it without you.
[01:49:18.633 --> 01:49:23.676]  That criminal should be impeached right now!
[01:49:23.676 --> 01:49:25.738]  Clay in Alabama, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:49:27.449 --> 01:49:28.649]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:49:28.649 --> 01:49:30.370]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:34.191]  I'm a, uh, air conditioner contractor in Alabama.
[01:49:34.191 --> 01:49:38.852]  And, uh, something that's always a gripe, man, this is the way to vent it.
[01:49:38.852 --> 01:49:45.534]  Uh, DuPont's patent on Freon ran out in 2003.
[01:49:45.534 --> 01:49:56.698]  So, if nothing had changed in 2003, anybody could have manufactured Freon for air conditioners, and that had to pay a DuPont licensing fee.
[01:49:56.698 --> 01:49:56.838]  So,
[01:49:57.642 --> 01:50:07.329]  No, no, their own, I don't want to hold you over so you can talk, but their own lobbying documents from the 70s said, we've got to launch a lie saying Freon's eating the ozone layer.
[01:50:07.329 --> 01:50:14.593]  In truth, during different times of the year, it always gets thin because our patent's up and we've got to make them take our new product.
[01:50:14.593 --> 01:50:17.555]  And yeah, no, look, it's, it's the big end industry.
[01:50:17.555 --> 01:50:18.756]  It's the big banks.
[01:50:18.756 --> 01:50:19.497]  It's big oil.
[01:50:19.497 --> 01:50:22.018]  It's big chemical that is running all of this.
[01:50:22.018 --> 01:50:22.439]  Go ahead.
[01:50:22.439 --> 01:50:23.239]  Okay.
[01:50:24.847 --> 01:50:34.533]  The price of foyer that goes on home air conditioners is more than quadruple because of punitive taxes to get people to not use it any more than they have to.
[01:50:34.533 --> 01:50:43.778]  At the end of this month, just a few days from now, it will be against the law to sell any new R22 air conditioner.
[01:50:43.778 --> 01:50:48.761]  It will all be this 410 Puron.
[01:50:48.761 --> 01:50:53.264]  And already, the price of the 22 that we're putting in those systems is more than quadruple.
[01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:55.651]  Stay there.
[01:50:55.651 --> 01:50:56.353]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.353 --> 01:51:00.881]  They set the precedent what light bulbs you can have, what toilets you want, and now how many kids you can have.
[01:51:04.352 --> 01:51:17.547]  Healthy Hearts Club presents Heart and Body Extract supports clean, clear arteries, healthy blood pressure levels, healthy circulation and blood flow, regular heart rate and beat.
[01:51:17.547 --> 01:51:20.130]  What if you could avoid heart attacks?
[01:51:20.130 --> 01:51:23.493]  What if you could avoid emergency room visits?
[01:51:23.493 --> 01:51:25.416]  What if you could avoid surgery?
[01:51:25.996 --> 01:51:26.596]  How?
[01:51:26.596 --> 01:51:27.597]  With this!
[01:51:27.597 --> 01:51:29.698]  Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:29.698 --> 01:51:32.559]  100% organic, no negative side effects.
[01:51:32.559 --> 01:51:34.981]  Guaranteed to work or your money back.
[01:51:34.981 --> 01:51:35.581]  Call now!
[01:51:35.581 --> 01:51:35.641]  866-295-5305.
[01:51:35.641 --> 01:51:35.921]  866-295-5305.
[01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:36.341]  Or order online.
[01:51:45.746 --> 01:51:46.127]  I think so.
[01:52:01.539 --> 01:52:04.902]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.902 --> 01:52:08.826]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.826 --> 01:52:12.550]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:20.077]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:52:20.097 --> 01:52:20.377]  I think so.
[01:52:45.675 --> 01:52:47.255]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:47.255 --> 01:52:50.016]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:52:50.016 --> 01:52:52.317]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[01:53:09.190 --> 01:53:15.195]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[01:53:15.195 --> 01:53:15.916]  Here's why.
[01:53:15.916 --> 01:53:24.142]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:53:24.142 --> 01:53:28.186]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:53:28.186 --> 01:53:30.528]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank.
[01:53:31.068 --> 01:53:34.050]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:35.570]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:43.114]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:53:43.114 --> 01:53:47.417]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:47.417 --> 01:53:49.498]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:49.498 --> 01:53:53.580]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:54:02.744 --> 01:54:12.810]  I just want to say live on air that I swear eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds and bodies of men.
[01:54:12.810 --> 01:54:18.593]  As Thomas Jefferson said, you need to get angry and focused with steel will.
[01:54:19.514 --> 01:54:21.515]  To commit yourself to fight these people.
[01:54:21.515 --> 01:54:24.737]  I found out about the Globalists 16, 17 years ago.
[01:54:24.737 --> 01:54:27.699]  Took me two, three years to figure out a battle plan.
[01:54:27.699 --> 01:54:35.084]  I didn't intend to beat them myself, and I never will beat them by myself, but I have had devastating effects on their agenda.
[01:54:35.084 --> 01:54:37.306]  One man!
[01:54:37.306 --> 01:54:38.686]  Now, what can you do?
[01:54:38.686 --> 01:54:40.908]  Just start fighting them.
[01:54:40.908 --> 01:54:42.829]  Start exposing them.
[01:54:42.829 --> 01:54:45.611]  Start resisting them.
[01:54:45.611 --> 01:54:48.213]  And they will fall.
[01:54:48.213 --> 01:54:48.653]  Period.
[01:54:49.795 --> 01:54:57.897]  And I look at these little African children and Asian children and I see the reports where the UN goes and shoots them up in Indonesia and all the women have miscarriages.
[01:54:57.897 --> 01:54:58.997]  It is pure evil.
[01:54:58.997 --> 01:55:01.858]  These people are vampire devils.
[01:55:01.858 --> 01:55:05.218]  You better get that through your head.
[01:55:05.218 --> 01:55:08.999]  You better realize this is life and death with these people.
[01:55:08.999 --> 01:55:14.720]  Every day, scores of articles where they say they're gonna only let you have one child and tax you till you bankrupt.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.641]  They're gonna take over every industry.
[01:55:16.641 --> 01:55:17.541]  They're doing it now.
[01:55:19.068 --> 01:55:22.190]  America, you're going to end up like the Ukrainians in Russia.
[01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:28.394]  I'm telling you, you better learn what happened to them, or the Chinese peasants under Mao.
[01:55:28.394 --> 01:55:29.775]  Now back to the air conditioning.
[01:55:29.775 --> 01:55:33.617]  Yes, this is how they set the precedent to run and control everything.
[01:55:33.617 --> 01:55:37.120]  And federal standard on your houses, this is just the beginning.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.601]  And they're going to incrementally put it all into place.
[01:55:39.601 --> 01:55:41.742]  Finish up your point, Clay.
[01:55:41.742 --> 01:55:45.525]  Well, the largest selling refrigerator in the world right now,
[01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.569]  Is R-134.
[01:55:46.569 --> 01:55:49.230]  Hope I'm not getting too technical for everybody.
[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:49.950]  Okay.
[01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:51.990]  But guess who makes the licenses?
[01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:53.811]  DuPont.
[01:55:53.811 --> 01:55:54.691]  DuPont.
[01:55:54.691 --> 01:56:01.113]  And the reason it's that way is because of government action, not because of marketplace forces.
[01:56:01.113 --> 01:56:05.154]  Government action.
[01:56:05.154 --> 01:56:11.675]  Sir, as you know, in the 20s, they began to legalize... Well, a lot of drugs weren't illegal.
[01:56:11.675 --> 01:56:13.476]  And the monopoly over opium
[01:56:14.654 --> 01:56:15.314]  Let me say this.
[01:56:15.314 --> 01:56:26.559]  The price of refrigerants that I have to buy because of government action, not because of government forces, has more than quadrupled in about the last six years.
[01:56:26.559 --> 01:56:27.299]  And I felt awful.
[01:56:27.299 --> 01:56:33.262]  Some of the bills I have to give some of these elderly people.
[01:56:46.984 --> 01:56:55.529]  I know.
[01:56:55.529 --> 01:57:09.357]  And they lied and said it was eating the atmosphere all so they could get a new patent on the other products they came out with and that is nothing compared to what the third... Do you understand, sir, that official numbers are a billion people?
[01:57:10.236 --> 01:57:14.780]  We'll starve to death a billion extra in the next ten years under this climate deal?
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:18.282]  I mean, the people supporting this are murderers.
[01:57:18.282 --> 01:57:21.665]  And I want everyone to know, these are murdering scum.
[01:57:21.665 --> 01:57:24.628]  We have to more than hate them, we have to defeat them.
[01:57:24.628 --> 01:57:30.532]  I mean, how much do you dislike this scum, Clay, that is going to cut off the food and energy to the entire third world?
[01:57:30.532 --> 01:57:34.455]  Well, to me, it just seems like people's empathy is the problem.
[01:57:34.455 --> 01:57:38.759]  Empathy and just, and the media just keeping people so dumb.
[01:57:40.317 --> 01:57:43.018]  I agree.
[01:57:43.018 --> 01:57:51.042]  I mean, I was looking at Americans last night when I was picking up some food, some Mexican food, bringing it home to my family, and they were all like children.
[01:57:51.042 --> 01:57:52.303]  They all talk like children.
[01:57:52.303 --> 01:57:57.285]  They just think the world's a fun, sweet, little, lovey land and the government loves them.
[01:57:57.285 --> 01:58:04.428]  They have no idea, no idea just what type of evil we are faced with.
[01:58:04.428 --> 01:58:05.909]  Well, thank you for taking my call.
[01:58:09.346 --> 01:58:10.947]  Well, God bless you, Clay.
[01:58:10.947 --> 01:58:11.727]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:11.727 --> 01:58:23.033]  We're going to come back and talk to Danny Michael and a few others, and then I'm going to get our first guest up from Copenhagen today via video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:58:25.134 --> 01:58:34.219]  I just pray every night that God help me be strong and fight these people as best I can and that we all be given discernment and that we all be made to be vessels against tyranny.
[01:58:34.219 --> 01:58:36.040]  Please God, just help us beat these people.
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.061]  Please don't let them murder more people.
[01:58:38.061 --> 01:58:41.142]  Please help us defeat them.
[01:58:41.142 --> 01:58:46.085]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:50.574 --> 01:58:54.677]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:58:54.677 --> 01:58:57.559]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:58:57.559 --> 01:58:59.640]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:01.882]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:59:01.882 --> 01:59:03.543]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:59:03.543 --> 01:59:07.866]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:59:08.046 --> 01:59:10.567]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:59:43.183 --> 01:59:53.653]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:56.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.035 --> 01:59:58.718]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.362 --> 02:00:10.189]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:11.771]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:13.354]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.354 --> 02:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:21.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.331 --> 02:00:26.073]  We are live, coming up in T-minus 40 minutes.
[02:00:26.073 --> 02:00:34.677]  Lord Christopher Monckton will be joining us to deal with the story and the video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:00:34.677 --> 02:00:38.319]  Brownshirt Youth Corps invade Monckton's speech.
[02:00:38.319 --> 02:00:43.942]  They didn't come up and ask questions like, we are change and the Tea Party's due of Al Gore, and then are drug off.
[02:00:43.942 --> 02:00:47.104]  They took over and tried to shut the event down.
[02:00:47.104 --> 02:00:50.286]  This is openly funded by George Soros and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:00:52.401 --> 02:00:56.362]  Absolutely amazing, that is coming up.
[02:00:56.362 --> 02:01:05.305]  From Copenhagen, Patrick Henningsen will be popping in with us in the next segment, also reporting on what's happening there.
[02:01:05.305 --> 02:01:08.826]  And here is the Financial Post, one of the biggest papers in Canada.
[02:01:08.826 --> 02:01:17.328]  I see these articles every day in mainstream newspapers in the US, England, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[02:01:18.885 --> 02:01:19.505]  Headline!
[02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:21.086]  The real inconvenient truth.
[02:01:21.086 --> 02:01:23.906]  The whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[02:01:23.906 --> 02:01:31.608]  A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth rate currently.
[02:01:31.608 --> 02:01:34.909]  Now, that is what's behind all the phony environmentalism.
[02:01:34.909 --> 02:01:39.650]  That's why they listed carbon dioxide that humans exhale as a toxic waste.
[02:01:39.650 --> 02:01:43.491]  That's why the EPA is telling Congress, we're your boss, which is upside down.
[02:01:44.659 --> 02:01:46.360]  But backwards.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.364]  And we are going to, quote, have a command and control system over you.
[02:01:51.364 --> 02:01:54.687]  In fact, reprint me that article about command and control.
[02:01:54.687 --> 02:01:54.947]  Please.
[02:01:54.947 --> 02:01:57.309]  Thank you.
[02:01:57.309 --> 02:02:02.553]  This will result in the deaths of more than a billion people in the first decade of these climate cuts.
[02:02:02.553 --> 02:02:07.737]  Now we have the secret text, which The Guardian has reported is real.
[02:02:07.737 --> 02:02:12.601]  The UN is very upset that they plan to double the taxes on the third world, not the first world.
[02:02:14.264 --> 02:02:16.605]  That will result in more than a billion deaths.
[02:02:16.605 --> 02:02:20.747]  The tiny cuts that were set up would result in a billion.
[02:02:20.747 --> 02:02:23.689]  Fifteen million people starved to death a year conservatively.
[02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:25.369]  Conservatively!
[02:02:25.369 --> 02:02:28.291]  This will bring that up to numbers that dwarf it.
[02:02:28.291 --> 02:02:30.132]  I mean, this is murder!
[02:02:30.132 --> 02:02:30.732]  Murderers!
[02:02:30.732 --> 02:02:32.333]  You are murderers!
[02:02:32.333 --> 02:02:41.017]  You patchouli-wearing, fake, liberal, brainwashed cult members who follow the religion of eugenics and go around preaching that humans are evil and parasites.
[02:02:41.017 --> 02:02:42.578]  You are murderers!
[02:02:45.106 --> 02:02:47.167]  Murderers!
[02:02:47.167 --> 02:02:52.488]  And they sold the mindless left, the low-level idiots, that, oh, we're doing this to help the third world.
[02:02:52.488 --> 02:02:54.868]  We'll give them our tax money from the West.
[02:02:54.868 --> 02:02:56.009]  It's the opposite of that.
[02:02:56.009 --> 02:03:08.772]  It is private banks taking all of our money and going in and saying, you've got to do this and that, or we won't give your governments money, and the governments keep the money.
[02:03:08.772 --> 02:03:10.412]  Let's talk to Danny in Pennsylvania.
[02:03:10.412 --> 02:03:11.232]  Danny, you're on the air.
[02:03:11.232 --> 02:03:12.813]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:13.752 --> 02:03:14.934]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:03:14.934 --> 02:03:15.875]  I know time is short.
[02:03:15.875 --> 02:03:20.541]  I just want to say you're an inspiration to us all and hopefully people will awake.
[02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:23.364]  I have a quick question that I always wanted to ask you.
[02:03:23.364 --> 02:03:28.892]  Is there footage, video footage, of the plane being shot down over Shanksville, Pennsylvania?
[02:03:29.887 --> 02:03:45.660]  No, the state police reported F-16s and explosions, and the debris fill was eight and a half miles long, and all the local eyewitnesses said explosions in the air, and the tiny debris filled at Shanksville was just one engine in the ground.
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:47.021]  Okay.
[02:03:47.021 --> 02:03:51.224]  My other question, currently who's more powerful, Henry Kissinger or Zabrinski?
[02:03:51.224 --> 02:03:56.088]  Now I know Zabrinski helped put Obama in office, if not primarily in office.
[02:03:56.088 --> 02:03:57.249]  Henry Kissinger, Henry Kissinger.
[02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:05.478]  Okay, that's interesting because doing research on him, he's actually wanted for war crimes, I believe, in other countries.
[02:04:05.478 --> 02:04:06.339]  Is that correct?
[02:04:06.339 --> 02:04:18.751]  Yes, and at this event, Maury Strong is also wanted for oil for food, robbing the money that was supposed to go to the Iraqi people for himself.
[02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:21.054]  These are ultimate criminals.
[02:04:22.062 --> 02:04:23.423]  The top of the food chain.
[02:04:23.423 --> 02:04:26.564]  Everywhere they go is starvation and death and murder.
[02:04:26.564 --> 02:04:29.745]  And they all just liberal around going, I'm liberal, I'm liberal.
[02:04:29.745 --> 02:04:31.926]  I'm the thinking man's thinking man.
[02:04:31.926 --> 02:04:34.127]  I'm your eco-profit.
[02:04:34.127 --> 02:04:35.528]  I'm so smart.
[02:04:35.528 --> 02:04:37.049]  I invented the internet.
[02:04:37.049 --> 02:04:38.709]  I invented the automobile.
[02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:40.150]  I invented the wheel.
[02:04:40.150 --> 02:04:42.271]  I'm Al Fraud Gore.
[02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:44.852]  Appreciate your call, Danny.
[02:04:44.852 --> 02:04:46.813]  Michael, Chris, Rick, Daniel and others.
[02:04:48.103 --> 02:04:56.731]  Your calls are coming up and our first guest from Copenhagen today as we track the criminal activities of The Globalist.
[02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:57.933]  Trying to contain my anger right now.
[02:04:59.406 --> 02:05:00.486]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:00.486 --> 02:05:05.027]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.027 --> 02:05:05.947]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.947 --> 02:05:09.368]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:10.228]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.228 --> 02:05:15.109]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.849]  It's true.
[02:05:15.849 --> 02:05:20.730]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:21.550]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:25.130]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.130 --> 02:05:28.851]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.051 --> 02:05:29.852]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.852 --> 02:05:32.615]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.615 --> 02:05:36.299]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.299 --> 02:05:37.079]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.079 --> 02:05:41.224]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.224 --> 02:05:45.989]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.269 --> 02:05:50.432]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.432 --> 02:05:52.233]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:02.096 --> 02:07:06.059]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.059 --> 02:07:14.926]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.926 --> 02:07:19.550]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:30.379]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.999 --> 02:07:40.502]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.502 --> 02:07:45.944]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.944 --> 02:07:53.427]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.427 --> 02:07:56.168]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:06.469]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.469 --> 02:08:08.753]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.699 --> 02:08:17.322]  We are live on this December 10th, Thursday edition.
[02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:19.182]  G. Edward Griffin in studio coming up.
[02:08:19.182 --> 02:08:24.665]  Lord Monckton coming up for a brief report on this Thursday edition.
[02:08:24.665 --> 02:08:27.027]  Other guests as well, jam-packed.
[02:08:27.027 --> 02:08:33.530]  We are simulcasting the radio show right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:40.454]  I wanted to get Patrick Henningsen, who was a mainline environmental activist involved trying to save the rainforest,
[02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:50.475]  And then he would try to go talk to these globalist organizations about, well, if we sell carbon credits, can we, you know, use this to buy up rainforests, which he was able to do.
[02:08:50.475 --> 02:08:52.015]  And they said, no, this isn't about that.
[02:08:52.015 --> 02:08:54.397]  It's about money.
[02:08:54.397 --> 02:09:08.004]  And now in the Copenhagen treaty, we learned two days ago that they plan on cutting double the emissions in the third world and in the first world, which will admittedly kill more than a billion people.
[02:09:08.939 --> 02:09:11.769]  Billions and billions of people are on the edge of starvation.
[02:09:11.769 --> 02:09:14.418]  15 plus million starve to death every year.
[02:09:15.404 --> 02:09:22.765]  The globalist state in their own textbooks, they want to use starvation and war, State Department Memorandum 200 to do this.
[02:09:22.765 --> 02:09:31.007]  All of you hippies and fake liberals and trendies, don't you notice all the oil companies are on the news financing the Hoppenhagen garbage?
[02:09:31.007 --> 02:09:35.728]  Don't you notice that the NFL's behind it and all the media's behind it?
[02:09:35.728 --> 02:09:39.349]  The IMF and World Bank, now it turns out will control all the money.
[02:09:39.349 --> 02:09:41.409]  The big central banks that have raped the third world.
[02:09:43.407 --> 02:09:52.461]  They've got all these fake, spray-painted, Hoppenhagen signs up everywhere that are meant to look like grassroots all over Copenhagen.
[02:09:52.461 --> 02:09:54.905]  To make it look like it's grassroots and from the people.
[02:09:57.028 --> 02:10:02.851]  This is a global revolution against the people, and there's no more time for denial.
[02:10:02.851 --> 02:10:13.317]  In all the UN documents, in all the plans, they state that once this grid's in place, they want a bankrupt, industrialized society to force you to only have one child.
[02:10:13.317 --> 02:10:18.300]  Then they say they're going to phase that out next, and put taxes on even one child.
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:22.242]  Financial Post of Canada today, we see these every day.
[02:10:23.871 --> 02:10:27.054]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am knee-deep in the documentation.
[02:10:27.054 --> 02:10:30.358]  These people are Nazis.
[02:10:30.358 --> 02:10:38.025]  The real inconvenient truth, a planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth rate.
[02:10:38.025 --> 02:10:39.747]  Then there's the whole fraud of that.
[02:10:39.747 --> 02:10:41.128]  The UN's own numbers show that by 2022,
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:51.424]  That the Earth's population will plane off at 8.2 to 8.7 billion, then it will start drastically falling.
[02:10:51.424 --> 02:11:00.869]  If they ever allowed the third world to industrialize, even the British Royal Commission of 1949 said this, that would have caused a massive population reduction, even if you believe we're overpopulated.
[02:11:00.869 --> 02:11:04.831]  Because in industrialized countries, on average, have a 1.3 population replacement.
[02:11:04.831 --> 02:11:09.714]  Two parents, two baby boomers, have on average 1.3 children.
[02:11:09.714 --> 02:11:12.655]  That number's even dropping faster in Italy and Japan.
[02:11:12.655 --> 02:11:13.496]  Approaching one.
[02:11:14.505 --> 02:11:16.727]  Not 1.3.
[02:11:16.727 --> 02:11:18.869]  Many cities in Germany are half empty.
[02:11:18.869 --> 02:11:20.290]  The West is collapsing.
[02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:25.635]  Russia's lost 40 million of its people just through lack of replacement.
[02:11:25.635 --> 02:11:29.118]  This is all happening.
[02:11:29.118 --> 02:11:30.599]  This is all going on.
[02:11:30.599 --> 02:11:32.681]  This is eugenics.
[02:11:32.681 --> 02:11:34.643]  It's not about whales and buffaloes.
[02:11:37.625 --> 02:11:38.726]  Please wake up!
[02:11:38.726 --> 02:11:43.289]  Alright, I want to go to Patrick Henningsen, who we had on yesterday, but we had to cut him short.
[02:11:43.289 --> 02:11:56.759]  I wanted him to recap the story of how he's a real environmental activist that found out the truth, what he's seen in the last 24 hours in Copenhagen, Lord Mockton's talk being taken over by brownshirts, and also plug some of his websites.
[02:11:56.759 --> 02:11:57.800]  Good to have you here, Patrick.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.941]  It's good to be with you, Alex.
[02:11:59.941 --> 02:12:00.462]  How are you doing?
[02:12:01.517 --> 02:12:08.699]  You know, knowing that the cuts, look, it was going to kill a billion people with the moderate cuts in the third world.
[02:12:08.699 --> 02:12:11.220]  Now those cuts are many times what they were.
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:19.922]  This death sentence, and we're not just saying that, this is a guaranteed death sentence for tens of millions of people a year.
[02:12:19.922 --> 02:12:25.423]  And I just want to make all the fake hippies that are supporting this go look at the death.
[02:12:25.423 --> 02:12:28.804]  I want them to go see the dead skeletons of those little children.
[02:12:29.784 --> 02:12:31.825]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:31.825 --> 02:12:35.107]  No, well, firstly, I know that the U.N.
[02:12:35.107 --> 02:12:56.060]  spent, you know, tens and tens of thousands of dollars branding the Copenhagen summit as Hope and Hagen, but I won't take credit for this, but Christopher Monckton re-coined the conference the other day, and it's in our film, which is online, and I think we should call it Dope and Hagen from here on out, because that's exactly what you're looking at.
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.380]  Scam and Hagen!
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:58.181]  Death and Hagen!
[02:12:58.945 --> 02:12:59.886]  Murder Hagen!
[02:12:59.886 --> 02:13:02.288]  Slavery Hagen!
[02:13:02.288 --> 02:13:08.673]  We spent the last couple days speaking to people from the developing world, scientists.
[02:13:08.673 --> 02:13:17.741]  We're going to be speaking to the parliamentary members of Mozambique tomorrow to talk about how the whole Copenhagen summit is really kind of a ruse.
[02:13:18.226 --> 02:13:23.069]  Look, you've got to go to the African delegation and go, you know the IMF and World Bank have raped you by design.
[02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:24.730]  Their documents have been public since 2002, how they do it by design.
[02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:27.312]  They are going to get all this tax money and use it to further de-industrialize you.
[02:13:27.312 --> 02:13:28.173]  That is in the treaty.
[02:13:49.448 --> 02:13:56.300]  No, we spoke to, we went down to the pit of the beast, which was the outside of the summit.
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:58.384]  They have something called the Climate Forum.
[02:13:58.871 --> 02:14:07.775]  Which is really, we're all this sort of anarchists and traditional left-wing activists that get important... Let's call them Nazi murderers!
[02:14:07.775 --> 02:14:17.920]  People that want to slaughter the third world, degenerate foundation, banker-funded, fake left-cover opposition, the absolute most dangerous people on earth.
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:18.260]  Go ahead.
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:21.261]  No, granted, you're right, Alex.
[02:14:21.261 --> 02:14:26.484]  You know, some of these are, there are provocateurs woven into this, but the overwhelming majority
[02:14:27.154 --> 02:14:27.535]  Okay.
[02:14:49.941 --> 02:14:56.565]  About a couple of dozen people, a simple question, which is going to be in our film, which we're going to post online in the next couple of days.
[02:14:56.565 --> 02:15:17.016]  If you had the choice, if you had $500 billion in your hands today, and you had the choice to either eliminate poverty in Africa and provide clean water for third world countries, or to combat climate change, which might happen in 100 or 50 or 200 years, 10 out of 10 of the people who are from Europe or America, they said, well,
[02:15:17.923 --> 02:15:22.224]  I think climate change is more important than, you know, saving lives today in Africa.
[02:15:22.224 --> 02:15:23.704]  Because it's their religion!
[02:15:23.704 --> 02:15:29.726]  I mean, that is in eco-science that, well, we're atheists, but people have got to have a religion.
[02:15:29.726 --> 02:15:32.627]  We're going to make climate change a new religion.
[02:15:32.627 --> 02:15:42.869]  Sure, and people were espousing this idea of a utopia where, well, you know, people, 200,000 people a year are dying because of climate change in Africa.
[02:15:43.277 --> 02:15:47.440]  I don't know where these figures come from or how they, you know, sea levels are not rising.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.403]  Those numbers are as real as man-bear-pig.
[02:15:50.403 --> 02:15:52.144]  Yeah, the Earth is not getting warmer.
[02:15:52.144 --> 02:15:56.687]  I don't see how climate change is killing people in Africa.
[02:15:56.687 --> 02:16:09.017]  Now, we spoke to Africans, and almost every single African we spoke to said, no, I will take that $500 billion and I will eliminate poverty and provide clean water and lower infant mortality, eliminate malaria.
[02:16:09.017 --> 02:16:10.318]  These are the priorities for us.
[02:16:11.354 --> 02:16:16.558]  So, you know, this just pretty much tells the tale of the sort of divide we have.
[02:16:16.558 --> 02:16:18.239]  It's a divide of reality, Alex.
[02:16:18.239 --> 02:16:20.621]  Well, notice, that's the master stroke of the globalists.
[02:16:20.621 --> 02:16:22.703]  It's always the opposite of what they say.
[02:16:22.703 --> 02:16:28.167]  They go, oh, this is to free the third world, help the poor by cutting off all their energy.
[02:16:28.167 --> 02:16:32.791]  But see, they only announced that, well, it came out from the secret document two days ago.
[02:16:32.791 --> 02:16:34.852]  They were going to spring that at the last minute.
[02:16:34.852 --> 02:16:40.417]  Are any of these fools understanding that cutting off the energy to the third world is not going to help them?
[02:16:41.414 --> 02:16:47.204]  You know, it really comes down to, and it was really frustrating, you know, we're trying to interview people.
[02:16:47.876 --> 02:16:51.837]  I have a nauseous feeling in my stomach, like, I can't really do this anymore.
[02:16:51.837 --> 02:16:57.600]  There's nothing that we can really say to get people to really listen to the sort of the wider picture.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.180]  And, you know, it comes down to this.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.041]  It's not psychology, Alex.
[02:17:01.041 --> 02:17:07.023]  You know, any of these people, one-on-one for any length of time, I show them Climategate.
[02:17:07.023 --> 02:17:09.224]  I talk about the IPC shortcomings.
[02:17:09.224 --> 02:17:12.205]  I talk about the fact that there is a global decline in temperature.
[02:17:12.865 --> 02:17:16.266]  Um, you can actually get them to open their mind and they will come around.
[02:17:16.266 --> 02:17:24.010]  But when you're talking to people briefly, talking to groups of people, groups of people, the Nazis understood mass psychology really well.
[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:27.451]  Some of these same principles, you know, hope, change.
[02:17:28.027 --> 02:17:30.429]  Well, Patrick, let me ask you this question.
[02:17:58.539 --> 02:18:10.862]  It's been reported that the third world countries, the developing countries, are freaking out over the text of the treaty that states they have to make most of the cuts and that it's an IMF, World Bank, private system that's going to run it.
[02:18:10.862 --> 02:18:16.563]  Do they understand that the previous smaller cuts were going to kill a billion people over the next decade?
[02:18:16.563 --> 02:18:18.644]  Do they understand this is even more monstrous?
[02:18:18.644 --> 02:18:27.106]  I mean, do these feel-good, lazy, trust fund punks realize that they're having a hand in mass murder?
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:30.320]  It's difficult.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:43.589]  You know, a lot of the people who are activists and who come to these events or who are sort of green warriors, as it were, they're really like holdouts from the Beat Generation, just a sort of updated version of it.
[02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:46.531]  And, you know, what you're talking about, Alex, are facts.
[02:18:46.531 --> 02:18:48.012]  You're talking about real documents.
[02:18:48.012 --> 02:18:50.573]  You're reading the UN Agenda 21.
[02:18:50.573 --> 02:18:53.675]  These are things that are publicly available that everybody can go and see.
[02:18:55.963 --> 02:19:02.666]  The types of people who are kind of going along with what I would term as a collectivist movement is really what it is.
[02:19:02.666 --> 02:19:06.268]  It's wanting to get rid of, we need to get rid of intellectual property.
[02:19:06.268 --> 02:19:07.308]  No more patents.
[02:19:07.308 --> 02:19:12.450]  Everything needs to be free and open source and we need a green revolution.
[02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:15.712]  But again, that's the candy coating of the fake left.
[02:19:15.712 --> 02:19:20.494]  At the core, it's all one powerful private central bank that will own everything.
[02:19:21.337 --> 02:19:27.743]  Absolutely, and I think that came out with the Danish text leaks is pretty much, uh, they showed their true colors.
[02:19:27.743 --> 02:19:29.464]  So is that hurting the conference?
[02:19:29.464 --> 02:19:31.206]  I mean, is it in disarray?
[02:19:31.206 --> 02:19:33.588]  I'm reading a lot of countries are saying they're not going to sign on now.
[02:19:34.355 --> 02:19:35.016]  It is, it is.
[02:19:35.016 --> 02:19:40.600]  We saw the early part of this morning when all the different countries were making their comments.
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:54.972]  And all these small countries like Equatorial New Guinea and Mozambique, they don't have nearly the political clout that the United States or the European countries have, but they already see through what is probably... Good!
[02:19:54.972 --> 02:19:55.393]  Stay there!
[02:19:55.393 --> 02:19:57.815]  I want to come back, talk about what else is happening.
[02:20:01.027 --> 02:20:04.570]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:04.570 --> 02:20:06.873]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:06.873 --> 02:20:07.733]  Don't!
[02:20:07.733 --> 02:20:11.177]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:11.177 --> 02:20:18.303]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:20:18.283 --> 02:20:20.265]  's number one debt secret.
[02:20:20.265 --> 02:20:23.949]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:20:24.329 --> 02:20:27.471]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:20:27.471 --> 02:20:34.836]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:34.836 --> 02:20:36.037]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:36.037 --> 02:20:39.219]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.219 --> 02:20:40.580]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:43.702]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:20:44.262 --> 02:20:47.603]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!

[02:20:48.824 --> 02:20:52.665]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:52.665 --> 02:20:54.826]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:54.826 --> 02:20:57.087]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:11.593 --> 02:21:14.276]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.276 --> 02:21:20.662]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.662 --> 02:21:25.867]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.867 --> 02:21:35.856]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.956 --> 02:21:38.297]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.297 --> 02:21:39.897]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.897 --> 02:21:42.358]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.358 --> 02:21:44.478]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.478 --> 02:21:49.620]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:23:01.135 --> 02:23:01.815]  Attention!
[02:23:01.815 --> 02:23:16.862]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:23:17.162 --> 02:23:18.043]  We're good to go!
[02:23:43.643 --> 02:23:44.023]  I think so.
[02:24:01.289 --> 02:24:05.652]  ...to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet.
[02:24:05.652 --> 02:24:13.338]  You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence, and may be the end to the human race as we know it.
[02:24:13.338 --> 02:24:15.179]  What do you mean, the cave-in is over?
[02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:18.742]  I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
[02:24:18.742 --> 02:24:21.364]  What's that?
[02:24:21.364 --> 02:24:25.587]  It is a creature which roams the Earth alone.
[02:24:25.587 --> 02:24:29.670]  It is half man, half bear, and half pig.
[02:24:36.292 --> 02:24:49.663]  There's no such thing as a ManBearPig.
[02:24:49.663 --> 02:24:52.566]  I'm talking, of course, about ManBearPig.
[02:25:04.745 --> 02:25:09.087]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:09.087 --> 02:25:21.491]  Played a little more of that clip than I wanted to.
[02:25:21.491 --> 02:25:30.794]  For some of the older audience that don't know what South Park is, they had an old episode making fun of Al Gore and his fear mongering about the man bear pig.
[02:25:30.794 --> 02:25:32.595]  Half man, half bear, half pig.
[02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:36.190]  And it's as real as man-made global warming.
[02:25:38.271 --> 02:25:45.597]  But it's not funny how many third-world people they're going to kill and how many middle-class people and poor people they're going to ruin here in the United States.
[02:25:45.597 --> 02:25:51.822]  In closing, with Patrick Henningsen, filmmaker, you've already released some YouTube clips of interviews you've done.
[02:25:51.822 --> 02:25:54.644]  Give us some of the names of those clips for folks that want to go find them.
[02:25:54.644 --> 02:25:58.728]  You're making a short film about Copenhagen that's going to be out in the next few days.
[02:25:58.728 --> 02:26:00.449]  Tell us about that, Patrick.
[02:26:00.449 --> 02:26:07.575]  And I would guess you haven't been able to videotape the man-bear-pig, the mythical mermaid-type creature that Al Gore's been warning us about?
[02:26:08.444 --> 02:26:15.767]  We've been looking for him all over Copenhagen, and we've spent most of our time trying to track down the man-bear-pig, but we haven't had any luck.
[02:26:15.767 --> 02:26:35.356]  What we have discovered, though, is Al Gore is basically captain of a ship, and what I can say to real green activists and real environmentalists is that you are on a Titanic, which is captained by Al Gore, and I advise people to get off that ship before you hit the iceberg of truth.
[02:26:36.657 --> 02:26:40.459]  Because if you do, everybody's going to go down who's on that ship.
[02:26:40.459 --> 02:26:42.781]  And it's bad for the science.
[02:26:42.781 --> 02:26:46.002]  The whole practice of science is under threat.
[02:26:46.002 --> 02:26:51.305]  Real environment is under threat, along with all the other things that you've mentioned.
[02:26:51.305 --> 02:26:52.526]  We're going to have that in our film.
[02:26:52.526 --> 02:26:56.208]  We've got a three-part film that's very educational, which we'll have up on YouTube tonight.
[02:26:56.781 --> 02:27:10.528]  It'll be at 21stCenturyWireTV on YouTube and we'll also hopefully have a link at 21stCenturyWire.com and we're doing a more intensive film over the next week which we need to spend time to hunker down.
[02:27:10.528 --> 02:27:16.751]  Give that website out again slowly for people because you're doing groundbreaking work.
[02:27:16.751 --> 02:27:25.015]  It's at www.21stCenturyWire.com and on YouTube just go to 21stCenturyWireTV
[02:27:27.193 --> 02:27:33.117]  And you'll see some of the videos, and there'll be some coming out, a few more coming out over the next few days.
[02:27:33.117 --> 02:27:52.911]  But the big news in Copenhagen yesterday was Lisa Jackson from the EPA gave a speech to a rouse of applause, basically saying that the EPA, under the Clean Air Act of 2007, will be able to regulate the poisonous gas of carbon dioxide without the approval
[02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:55.893]  Or without the associate of Congress.
[02:27:55.893 --> 02:28:05.403]  So it's basically a run around the democratic process saying that it doesn't matter if Congress and Senate pass the cap and trade bill.
[02:28:05.403 --> 02:28:08.346]  We're going to regulate greenhouse gases anyway.
[02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:12.030]  When they say greenhouse gases, they're not talking about really dangerous gases.
[02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:13.552]  They're talking about carbon dioxide.
[02:28:14.733 --> 02:28:32.789]  Look, look, if they were calling for an international agreement that wasn't a global taxation system to private banks that would demand study before they open-air plant or release cross-species animals and plants, that's what's already causing rogue viruses and, I mean, that's what's really dangerous.
[02:28:32.789 --> 02:28:34.971]  That's what can really mess up
[02:28:35.732 --> 02:28:36.613]  Our planet.
[02:28:36.613 --> 02:28:39.437]  Nanotech getting loose.
[02:28:39.437 --> 02:28:42.781]  I mean, that's what the real evidence shows is serious.
[02:28:42.781 --> 02:28:48.227]  The superconducting supercollider, the megacyclotron, the Hadron Collider.
[02:28:48.227 --> 02:28:53.954]  Their own scientists admit that that makes hydrogen bombs look like Tinker Toys and could destroy the planet.
[02:28:54.975 --> 02:28:57.616]  You know, no control over anything real.
[02:28:57.616 --> 02:28:59.216]  No control over overfishing.
[02:28:59.216 --> 02:29:01.617]  I mean, there are some real environmental things.
[02:29:01.617 --> 02:29:03.337]  The global government could care less about that.
[02:29:03.337 --> 02:29:18.441]  You know, I found out Prince Bernhard, founder of the big environmental group World Wildlife Fund, the Nazi, and founder of Bilderberg, he openly used his environmental front for elephant hunting and making money off Tusk.
[02:29:18.441 --> 02:29:19.442]  He was caught doing that.
[02:29:19.442 --> 02:29:21.822]  He would try to overthrow third world countries.
[02:29:21.822 --> 02:29:23.903]  These guys are hardcore criminals.
[02:29:25.214 --> 02:29:27.816]  We went down to the WWF World Wildlife Fund.
[02:29:27.816 --> 02:29:31.238]  They've got a little camp down in the center of Copenhagen.
[02:29:31.238 --> 02:29:33.139]  And who's sponsoring the World Wildlife Fund?
[02:29:33.139 --> 02:29:35.321]  None other than Coca-Cola.
[02:29:35.321 --> 02:29:40.284]  And Coca-Cola has done more to destroy environments in third world than India.
[02:29:40.284 --> 02:29:41.185]  No, it's incredible.
[02:29:41.185 --> 02:29:41.765]  Look, look, look.
[02:29:41.765 --> 02:29:49.170]  The big polluting corporations run this whole deal so they can tax us for air and then ignore all the real environmental crises.
[02:29:49.170 --> 02:29:50.831]  Great job, Patrick Henningsen.
[02:29:50.831 --> 02:29:51.732]  God bless you.
[02:29:51.732 --> 02:29:53.133]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.133 --> 02:29:54.634]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.615 --> 02:30:02.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:06.062]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.062 --> 02:30:09.305]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.305 --> 02:30:14.088]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.088 --> 02:30:20.512]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.512 --> 02:30:22.734]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.234 --> 02:30:24.415]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:24.415 --> 02:30:25.196]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.196 --> 02:30:26.837]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:49.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:58.571]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.243]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.243 --> 02:31:09.588]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.588 --> 02:31:11.630]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:16.635]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.635 --> 02:31:17.556]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.796 --> 02:31:18.917]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.917 --> 02:31:20.818]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.818 --> 02:31:21.879]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.879 --> 02:31:24.080]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.421]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.421 --> 02:31:26.962]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.962 --> 02:31:32.226]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.226 --> 02:31:35.808]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.808 --> 02:31:39.271]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.631 --> 02:31:40.852]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.852 --> 02:31:41.753]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.753 --> 02:31:42.854]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.854 --> 02:31:43.775]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.775 --> 02:31:44.875]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.875 --> 02:31:47.938]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.938 --> 02:31:49.699]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:49.699 --> 02:31:50.620]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.248 --> 02:32:07.253]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.253 --> 02:32:08.514]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:32:08.514 --> 02:32:09.334]  It's very real.
[02:32:09.334 --> 02:32:13.217]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:32:13.217 --> 02:32:17.700]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:20.282]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:32:20.282 --> 02:32:26.066]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:32:26.266 --> 02:32:31.047]  Their best-seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:32:31.047 --> 02:32:33.888]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:32:33.888 --> 02:32:36.609]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:36.609 --> 02:32:43.771]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:32:44.071 --> 02:32:47.793]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:47.793 --> 02:32:48.054]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:48.054 --> 02:32:49.975]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:17.173]  We're good.
[02:33:25.711 --> 02:33:35.515]  Well, in studio with us for the next hour is the one and only G. Edward Griffin, author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, filmmaker, fighting the globalists for more than 40 years.
[02:33:35.515 --> 02:33:37.976]  He's here in Austin to give several speeches.
[02:33:37.976 --> 02:33:41.297]  We'll tell you about that before he leaves us.
[02:33:41.297 --> 02:33:44.818]  We apologize, we have to get Lord Monckton on with him for about 5-10 minutes.
[02:33:44.818 --> 02:33:46.659]  It's the only time Lord Monckton can do it.
[02:33:46.659 --> 02:33:50.580]  He was on with us for a full hour, or more than an hour, just the other day.
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:51.721]  But there has been a new
[02:33:53.593 --> 02:34:03.562]  New event where Brown Shirt Youth Corps from the Rockefeller Foundation and of course George Soros funded groups are admittedly with them, came and took over his speech today.
[02:34:03.562 --> 02:34:04.783]  Completely shut it down.
[02:34:04.783 --> 02:34:08.846]  Didn't go like We Are Change and ask questions in the press conference and then drug out.
[02:34:08.846 --> 02:34:16.553]  No, they just came and took over and no one could stop them because Lord Monckton doesn't have all the big, you know, oil company security people like Al Gore does.
[02:34:16.553 --> 02:34:20.436]  Who owns, by the way, Occidental Petroleum and is one of the biggest people cutting down the rain forest.
[02:34:21.357 --> 02:34:25.239]  That's how this scam works, so that is coming up here in the next 10 minutes.
[02:34:25.239 --> 02:34:27.420]  Lord Monkton should be joining us.
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:29.381]  If not, he'll be in the next hour.
[02:34:29.381 --> 02:34:32.603]  But G. Edward Griffin, I feel like I know you so well.
[02:34:32.603 --> 02:34:36.605]  This is, I believe, the first time that we've met in person, unless my memory fails me.
[02:34:36.605 --> 02:34:38.866]  It is great to have you sitting here in the flesh.
[02:34:38.866 --> 02:34:39.646]  Well, thank you.
[02:34:39.646 --> 02:34:40.607]  It's good to be here, Alex.
[02:34:41.731 --> 02:34:41.891]  Yeah.
[02:34:41.891 --> 02:34:42.931]  We did meet once before.
[02:34:42.931 --> 02:34:45.452]  In fact, I was on your show when you had the old facility.
[02:34:45.452 --> 02:34:46.052]  That's right!
[02:34:46.052 --> 02:34:47.453]  You were in studio before!
[02:34:47.453 --> 02:34:47.753]  Yes.
[02:34:47.753 --> 02:34:49.554]  I was having this deja vu moment.
[02:34:49.554 --> 02:34:49.894]  No, no.
[02:34:49.894 --> 02:34:52.294]  I just watch so much video, I get to where I can't tell anymore.
[02:34:52.294 --> 02:34:52.775]  Right.
[02:34:52.775 --> 02:34:53.435]  I apologize.
[02:34:53.435 --> 02:34:54.735]  We have met.
[02:34:54.735 --> 02:34:55.455]  It's good to be here.
[02:34:55.455 --> 02:34:56.576]  Well met, my friend.
[02:34:56.576 --> 02:34:57.596]  Yes, indeed.
[02:34:57.596 --> 02:34:59.397]  And I really like your studio.
[02:34:59.397 --> 02:35:01.697]  I understand you're doing so well in that.
[02:35:01.697 --> 02:35:06.079]  It's so encouraging because while the Earth seems to be falling apart, you're one of the bright hopes out there.
[02:35:07.336 --> 02:35:14.521]  Well, we're small, but we're a fly on the end of the New World Order's behind, but we're irritating them.
[02:35:14.521 --> 02:35:16.703]  It's more like a mosquito.
[02:35:16.703 --> 02:35:22.307]  Yeah, but we're injecting cyanide into their lives.
[02:35:22.307 --> 02:35:27.571]  Hey, would you like to bow down to Al Gore, Newsweek, the Earth's Prophet, the Thinking Man's Thinking Man?
[02:35:27.571 --> 02:35:30.213]  Oh, how did they spell that?
[02:35:30.213 --> 02:35:31.934]  I would have spelled it differently.
[02:35:31.934 --> 02:35:32.915]  Well, how would you spell it?
[02:35:32.915 --> 02:35:33.696]  With an S and a T.
[02:35:37.158 --> 02:35:41.963]  It's amazing how the media can mytholize things like that.
[02:35:41.963 --> 02:35:44.946]  I think Al Gore has lost his charm.
[02:35:44.946 --> 02:35:48.509]  I think he's lost a lot of the aura of being infallible.
[02:35:48.509 --> 02:35:50.391]  And of course he has a loyal following.
[02:35:50.391 --> 02:35:51.652]  You can't beat that.
[02:35:51.652 --> 02:35:54.094]  They'll follow him right over the edge of the earth if necessary.
[02:35:55.115 --> 02:36:00.861]  I think most of the people were sort of in that grey middle zone, where they weren't sure whether there was global warming or not.
[02:36:00.861 --> 02:36:04.685]  But since Al Gore was saying there was, they went with it.
[02:36:04.685 --> 02:36:08.429]  Now they know that this whole Clamagate thing is blowing all of that apart.
[02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:10.131]  So, I think progress is being made.
[02:36:10.131 --> 02:36:10.772]  That's the bottom line.
[02:36:11.494 --> 02:36:12.094]  Absolutely.
[02:36:12.094 --> 02:36:13.696]  G. Edward Griffin with us in studio.
[02:36:13.696 --> 02:36:17.298]  Lord Monckton coming up to pop in in a little while with us.
[02:36:17.298 --> 02:36:22.401]  The climate gate and now the leaked Danish text, the actual treaty that the U.S.
[02:36:22.401 --> 02:36:29.386]  and others wanted to sign doubles or right at doubles the amount of taxes on the third world and it's meant to destroy their development.
[02:36:29.386 --> 02:36:37.672]  All these major newspapers like the Financial Post calling for quote Chinese style global authority to enforce one child policy.
[02:36:37.672 --> 02:36:41.374]  Isn't that from your research and give us your take on it the heart of what this is really all about?
[02:36:42.395 --> 02:36:43.796]  I think it's very close to the heart.
[02:36:43.796 --> 02:36:51.404]  Yeah, it's not only the control of the population and reproductive rates, but it's the control of all aspects of human endeavor.
[02:36:51.404 --> 02:37:04.157]  And, you know, it's the old story, your listeners know it so well, Alex, that in order to convince the people of the world that they should give up their freedom and they should accept these draconian measures over their lives, you have to scare them.
[02:37:04.798 --> 02:37:24.591]  You have to convince them that there's something very terrible going to happen, either terrorism or crime or drugs or overpopulation or whatever it is, a destruction of the planet, so that people will be so grateful when these politicians come along and propose various types of legislation that's going to take away their freedom.
[02:37:24.591 --> 02:37:28.694]  But they say, don't worry about your freedom, we're going to save your life, we're going to save the planet.
[02:37:28.694 --> 02:37:30.255]  You know, it's the old game.
[02:37:30.255 --> 02:37:33.397]  It's been going on and on for almost a hundred years.
[02:37:35.575 --> 02:37:49.794]  You know, reading the treaty, which I have here in front of me, the state global government, Van Rompuy, the head of the EU says it's world government, Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, Secretary General writes editorials saying it's world government, they're announcing that the Copenhagen Global Treaty,
[02:37:50.775 --> 02:37:57.341]  A tax on all financial transactions, a 2% tax on the GDP off the top, taxes on all fuel.
[02:37:57.341 --> 02:38:05.068]  They admit this will devastate the third world and that they actually want to shut down their development, which will actually make them continue to have all these children.
[02:38:05.068 --> 02:38:16.278]  All the studies show once you're industrialized, you start having less children than you did before and the replacement rate drops to 1.3 children instead of more than two children per group of adults.
[02:38:17.466 --> 02:38:24.851]  Well, I think the mistake is made when the public gives credence to the motives of what these people are doing.
[02:38:24.851 --> 02:38:35.257]  They're always saying they're going to control the birth rate in order to decrease the population explosion, and supposedly, you know, this is for the benefit of mankind.
[02:38:35.257 --> 02:38:39.220]  They're going to control us in this way or that way, and it's always for the benefit of mankind.
[02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:41.381]  It's for our own good, supposedly.
[02:38:41.381 --> 02:38:45.604]  But in reality, we shouldn't give them credence for that, because that's never been their motive.
[02:38:46.304 --> 02:38:49.548]  Their motive is really just raw control over human beings.
[02:38:49.548 --> 02:38:54.454]  So, I don't think it makes much sense to listen to what these people are saying.
[02:38:54.454 --> 02:38:57.037]  They're always distorting the truth.
[02:38:57.037 --> 02:38:59.741]  So, what more can I say on that?
[02:38:59.741 --> 02:39:02.043]  This is sort of like preaching to the choir here.
[02:39:02.043 --> 02:39:05.588]  I think that your listeners certainly know that very well.
[02:39:06.584 --> 02:39:14.387]  But what can I say in addition to that, that we have to really think about the master plan behind all of this.
[02:39:14.387 --> 02:39:22.931]  And the master plan really has nothing to do with controlling the temperature or climate control or preventing overpopulation or none of that.
[02:39:22.931 --> 02:39:24.671]  That's just smokescreen.
[02:39:24.671 --> 02:39:28.773]  That's just propaganda to make us think that they're good guys and they're really looking out for us.
[02:39:29.013 --> 02:39:44.376]  Well the colonial, neo-colonial system of the IMF and World Bank coming in that you talk about so much, loaning our tax money at loan sharking rates where Nigeria gets a billion dollar loan and today they've paid over 60 billion back on that 1 billion.
[02:39:44.376 --> 02:39:57.678]  The IMF and World Bank don't want to help the third world and they've sold this, oh global taxes on all carbon to save the third world and they've told the liberals it's to help the Africans and the Latin Americans when in truth it will admittedly starve even more people.
[02:39:58.138 --> 02:40:00.159]  Of course, that's what I'm saying.
[02:40:00.159 --> 02:40:03.442]  You can't listen to what these people are saying their motives are.
[02:40:03.442 --> 02:40:04.923]  They really want control.
[02:40:04.923 --> 02:40:06.163]  That's what it's all about.
[02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:16.470]  When will the American people wake up to the fact that these leaders, both national and international, have one thing in mind, and only one thing, and that's control over human beings.
[02:40:16.470 --> 02:40:18.952]  That's the bottom line, and all this other talk is nonsense.
[02:40:20.987 --> 02:40:36.033]  Tell us about what you're doing in Austin, and then I want to get into the treating more, the establishment of world government, how long they've been working at this, and where you think they are in this plan, because it seems that they're trying to accelerate their program because so many people are waking up to them.
[02:40:36.033 --> 02:40:37.153]  But I want to get your take on that.
[02:40:37.153 --> 02:40:39.814]  But tell us about some of the events you're going to be holding here in Austin.
[02:40:40.316 --> 02:40:42.537]  Well, I'm here, Alex, and thanks for asking me on that.
[02:40:42.537 --> 02:40:43.777]  I'm here to do a seminar.
[02:40:43.777 --> 02:40:46.378]  We call it a Crash Course on Money.
[02:40:46.378 --> 02:40:50.960]  And just as the name suggests, it has two meanings for the word crash.
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:54.201]  It's a crash course in the sense that it's condensed.
[02:40:54.201 --> 02:40:55.402]  We do it all in one day.
[02:40:57.498 --> 02:40:57.918]  9 a.m.
[02:40:57.918 --> 02:40:59.279]  till 8 p.m.
[02:40:59.279 --> 02:41:20.376]  it's all done so it's a crash course but also it's based on the recognition that we're in a crash economy and people particularly want to know not just about money but how to protect the money they already have from being confiscated through inflation what kind of investments to make if any are good investments and you know how to get out of debt and all the various aspects of how to protect yourselves
[02:41:20.876 --> 02:41:26.944]  And also we're taking a look at the long-term strategies of how to protect your children and your grandchildren.
[02:41:26.944 --> 02:41:31.290]  So we're not just focused on the money side of it, but the system side of it.
[02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:36.997]  We believe very firmly that if you don't preserve the system, it won't make any difference because you won't have any money anyway.
[02:41:37.498 --> 02:41:38.440]  So that's what we're doing.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:44.528]  It's a crash course on money and I hope that if anybody's interested in hearing my views on that, they'll come out.
[02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:51.619]  It's being held on Saturday right here in Austin at, let's see, it's at the Marriott, maybe
[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:55.942]  During the break I can get my assistant to give me the address and all that.
[02:41:55.942 --> 02:41:57.582]  Folks can also just go to your website.
[02:41:57.582 --> 02:41:58.923]  Oh, that's the better way, yes.
[02:41:58.923 --> 02:42:05.426]  Go right to realityzone.com and when they get to the landing page there will be a big banner talking about the crash course.
[02:42:05.426 --> 02:42:09.528]  Right, and we're going to talk about your event you've got coming up tonight in just a moment.
[02:42:09.528 --> 02:42:18.173]  But we now turn in just a moment to Lord Christopher Monckton and while he's speaking we're going to show you some video without the audio.
[02:42:19.213 --> 02:42:19.453]  No.
[02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.691]  We're good to go.
[02:42:55.792 --> 02:43:07.135]  And we have the article here with the groups that are funded by Soros and the Rockefellers and others, and by the UN there, taking over, not letting him have a speech.
[02:43:07.135 --> 02:43:14.437]  And of course, Moncton isn't funded by the powers that be, so he didn't have thugs there to beat everyone up and drag them off, so they just took it over.
[02:43:14.817 --> 02:43:16.299]  Very good to be with you, Alex.
[02:43:42.028 --> 02:43:45.873]  Well, we were having a meeting with Americans for Prosperity.
[02:43:45.873 --> 02:43:50.620]  I'd been asked to come and give a speech about what was in the Copenhagen Agreement.
[02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:51.721]  It's no longer a treaty now.
[02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:55.206]  They've downgraded it to an agreement because they know they can't get a treaty through the Senate.
[02:43:55.206 --> 02:43:56.668]  That's become very clear.
[02:43:56.668 --> 02:43:59.232]  So the whole thing is being driven by your constitution.
[02:43:59.605 --> 02:44:03.608]  Which still has enough force in it to stop them getting away with everything thereafter.
[02:44:03.608 --> 02:44:07.571]  But anyway, I was briefing them on how this was going to be pushed through by Obama.
[02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:09.573]  He was going to start it in Copenhagen.
[02:44:09.573 --> 02:44:14.116]  He was then going to put it before both houses of Congress, try and get it through by a simple majority.
[02:44:14.116 --> 02:44:16.318]  He might even fail that now.
[02:44:16.318 --> 02:44:27.907]  But, as I was beginning to speak, in walked, or rather up jumped, people who'd crept in and sat down quietly initially, and they began a kind of robotic Nazi chant.
[02:44:27.907 --> 02:44:29.448]  It was just like the Hitler Youth.
[02:44:29.998 --> 02:44:49.391]  And indeed, the whole air of this Copenhagen conference has the stink of a Nuremberg rally about it, just at the time when we had hoped that in Europe, in the world, that kind of sort of centralist propaganda and only one system of thought being permitted had been swept away forever.
[02:44:49.391 --> 02:44:55.295]  Here it is re-emerging, no longer red, white and black, but now green is the colour that you find.
[02:44:55.763 --> 02:45:06.768]  On every banner trailing from a public building, green is the colour of the elaborate displays that the Nazis last used to have in all the main squares in Copenhagen.
[02:45:06.768 --> 02:45:14.892]  And now we have exactly the same kind of nasty displays, but this time advertising climate change as the big enemy.
[02:45:14.892 --> 02:45:17.573]  Just as in the old days it was Jews that were the big enemy.
[02:45:17.967 --> 02:45:21.009]  Well, frankly, this has begun to upset many people.
[02:45:21.009 --> 02:45:23.752]  We had a German person who was in our meeting.
[02:45:23.752 --> 02:45:26.614]  He was almost in tears by the end.
[02:45:26.614 --> 02:45:29.596]  He said, he said, I never thought that I would see this.
[02:45:29.596 --> 02:45:31.878]  He said, I thought we were behind all that.
[02:45:31.878 --> 02:45:40.885]  I thought we would never again see the Hitlerjugend on the march, indoctrinated by the party and only putting one point of view.
[02:45:40.885 --> 02:45:43.427]  He was really, really, really upset.
[02:45:44.335 --> 02:45:54.660]  And, of course, that's how terrifying it is for all of us who are here to see the robotic drill with which these people simply talk slogans.
[02:45:54.660 --> 02:46:00.002]  None of them know any climate science, none of them know any economics, none of them understand policymaking.
[02:46:00.002 --> 02:46:08.466]  All of them have been told that the harmless trace gas without which every piece of life, whether plant or animal, on this planet would be dead
[02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:13.333]  Is somehow a dangerous pollutant which is going to set the planet on fire.
[02:46:13.333 --> 02:46:16.556]  It doesn't get more ludicrous or more sickeningly dangerous.
[02:46:17.694 --> 02:46:30.117]  But, Lord Monckton, there is a sense of desperation by these people as more universities come out and are proven to be engaged in fraud via UN collusion, directing this.
[02:46:30.117 --> 02:46:46.001]  And I would like you, in the last few minutes we have with you, to speak directly to the useful idiots, the same type that supported Lenin and Hitler and Mao, to understand that the climate cuts now in the treaty, the Danish text,
[02:46:46.801 --> 02:46:47.022]  Well,
[02:47:06.864 --> 02:47:09.525]  Let me quote from the UN itself, just for once.
[02:47:09.525 --> 02:47:13.926]  There's a man called Herr Ziegler, who is the right-to-food rapporteur for the UN.
[02:47:13.926 --> 02:47:17.387]  His job is to make sure that people are aware that there are folks starving around the world.
[02:47:35.211 --> 02:47:40.734]  And he said two years ago that the biofuel scam was an outrage.
[02:47:40.734 --> 02:47:53.200]  He said that to grow biofuels instead of growing food on agricultural land for people who need it, you grow biofuels instead for clunkers that don't, in the name of saving the planet.
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:48:01.825]  What you're doing is causing mass starvation, food riots in a dozen countries of the world, millions dying, not because of climate change.
[02:48:02.816 --> 02:48:09.019]  But because of the sloganising and the policies of these rich people who are manipulating this for their own profit.
[02:48:09.019 --> 02:48:10.280]  People dying now.
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:12.041]  And Herzegov said this.
[02:48:12.041 --> 02:48:24.468]  He said, at a time when so many are starving around the world, to divert agricultural land from growing food to growing biofuels is, and this is his words, a crime against humanity.
[02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:27.791]  Well said.
[02:48:27.791 --> 02:48:29.994]  I'm going to skip this break.
[02:48:29.994 --> 02:48:33.159]  We've only got a few minutes left with Lord Christopher Monckton.
[02:48:35.427 --> 02:48:44.770]  I mean, how did this end with them taking over your event, vitriolically waving American flags, when this treaty will destroy U.S.
[02:48:44.770 --> 02:48:45.350]  sovereignty?
[02:48:45.350 --> 02:48:59.774]  Even mainstream news is saying the EPA coup of telling Congress, if you don't ratify this, we will quote, and this is ABC News and Reuters, we will quote, have a command and control system over you.
[02:48:59.774 --> 02:49:02.035]  How dare them flap American flags?
[02:49:03.379 --> 02:49:05.379]  That is an outrage, I agree.
[02:49:05.379 --> 02:49:13.361]  What happened was, I simply went for the microphones, which were directional, so that I could still be heard in Pennsylvania and the other parts of the United States.
[02:49:13.361 --> 02:49:15.922]  All over the states, thousands of people linked in.
[02:49:15.922 --> 02:49:20.163]  And the chanters could only be heard very distantly by them in the background.
[02:49:20.163 --> 02:49:25.624]  And eventually, the chanters realized we were just carrying on with the meeting anyway, and they weren't getting anywhere.
[02:49:25.624 --> 02:49:32.166]  So in dribs and drabs, they filed out and quickly, rapidly disappeared, no doubt to report on what they thought was their triumph.
[02:49:33.411 --> 02:49:43.719]  I saw them again this morning at their stand inside the conference centre in the area where people can set up stands to say whatever they want to say.
[02:49:43.719 --> 02:49:47.503]  And they came rushing up to me and they said, how dare you call us Hitler Youth?
[02:49:47.503 --> 02:49:49.704]  Because German television had been there.
[02:49:49.704 --> 02:49:55.569]  They had interviewed me and I had said, almost with tears in my eyes, these people have behaved like the Hitler Youth.
[02:49:55.569 --> 02:49:57.471]  How dare you call us Hitler Youth?
[02:49:57.471 --> 02:49:57.831]  They said.
[02:49:57.831 --> 02:49:59.332]  One of them said, I'm a Jew.
[02:49:59.332 --> 02:50:01.274]  How dare you call me Hitler Youth?
[02:50:01.274 --> 02:50:02.755]  I said, if you ever again.
[02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:12.853]  Come in chanting moronic, robotic slogans, and interrupt the right of free speech of others who happen to differ with you on a matter of public policy.
[02:50:12.853 --> 02:50:17.534]  Then I will once again call you Hitler Youth, for that is what you are.
[02:50:17.534 --> 02:50:22.176]  Never has such behaviour been seen in Copenhagen since Hitler was in control of it.
[02:50:22.176 --> 02:50:25.857]  And if you behave in that way, I will call it like I see it.
[02:50:26.633 --> 02:50:30.035]  But aren't they Hitler Youth, sir?
[02:50:30.035 --> 02:50:37.621]  Because these policies will result in mass starvation and death, and have already resulted in that.
[02:50:37.621 --> 02:50:38.881]  That is the truth of the matter.
[02:50:38.881 --> 02:50:45.366]  I think it's probably fair to say, of course it's very difficult to measure this, it's probably fair to say that more people have been killed
[02:50:45.805 --> 02:50:56.027]  By the Green Movement, with this climate scam and the biofuels taking land out of agricultural production, doubling the price of food, pricing food out of the poor people's pockets.
[02:50:56.027 --> 02:50:57.687]  They simply can't afford to buy the food.
[02:50:57.687 --> 02:51:01.988]  They're living on mud pies made with real mud in Asia, for heaven's sake.
[02:51:01.988 --> 02:51:08.369]  And even they can't now afford the mud pies either, because they've doubled in price, thanks to the biofuels scam.
[02:51:08.369 --> 02:51:11.550]  And so, yes, we are now probably seeing more deaths
[02:51:12.361 --> 02:51:20.745]  arising from the behavior of the Hitler Youth and, more sinisterly, the people who are behind them and paying for them and indoctrinating them.
[02:51:20.745 --> 02:51:26.508]  Those are the ones we really need to track down and root out and shove in jail for the rest of their nasty little lives.
[02:51:26.508 --> 02:51:32.231]  Because we are killing people, probably in larger numbers now, than Hitler did when he killed the Jews.
[02:51:32.231 --> 02:51:42.116]  We're killing them of starvation because the West doesn't care about anything except some putative icicle dribbling somewhere in Greenland.
[02:51:42.774 --> 02:51:53.081]  All of which is entirely within the natural variability of the climate, as we now know from the Climategate emails which expose the fraud that's been perpetrated by these scientists.
[02:51:53.081 --> 02:52:04.609]  On the one hand, they're telling us only this week that this decade has been the warmest since records began 150 years ago, which admittedly is not a particularly surprising conclusion because we've had 300 years of global warming starting in 1695.
[02:52:04.609 --> 02:52:04.909]  However,
[02:52:07.099 --> 02:52:17.509]  What they are saying privately, whatever they're saying publicly, privately they're saying, there has indeed been, as I've been saying on your program and elsewhere for many years, we've had global cooling for many years.
[02:52:17.509 --> 02:52:21.473]  In fact, we've now had global cooling for nine full years.
[02:52:21.473 --> 02:52:23.975]  They're admitting this privately in these emails.
[02:52:23.975 --> 02:52:25.557]  A very recent one said exactly this.
[02:52:26.235 --> 02:52:30.436]  And they're saying it's a travesty that we can't explain it.
[02:52:30.436 --> 02:52:31.577]  I can explain it.
[02:52:31.577 --> 02:52:32.657]  It's very simple.
[02:52:32.657 --> 02:52:35.038]  CO2 doesn't have the warming effect.
[02:52:35.038 --> 02:52:36.678]  You've been pretending it does.
[02:52:36.678 --> 02:52:39.339]  You've been fooled by your own propaganda.
[02:52:39.339 --> 02:52:51.182]  Time to go back, get out the abacus and the counting stones, and do your sums again, and throw away those big fancy Xbox 360 models, because they have been leading you astray.
[02:52:51.182 --> 02:52:54.243]  And get back to real science and real measurement.
[02:52:54.696 --> 02:52:54.896]  All right.
[02:53:20.066 --> 02:53:22.827]  Lord Mocton, you gave us an hour earlier this week.
[02:53:22.827 --> 02:53:23.567]  I know you're very busy.
[02:53:23.567 --> 02:53:24.428]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:53:24.428 --> 02:53:26.929]  We also have G. Edward Griffin here in studio with us.
[02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:29.570]  But in closing, I'd like you to give us your website.
[02:53:29.570 --> 02:53:34.512]  And then also, you sounded a bit pessimistic a few days ago.
[02:53:34.512 --> 02:53:43.776]  Now you sound buoyed, saying that it looks like they're going to have to go the dictatorial, bureaucratic way around the Constitution because it
[02:53:44.256 --> 02:53:56.887]  Even mainstream media is saying their fraud is imploding, especially with the Danish text of the treaty saying the third world has to make right at double the cuts the West did, a bait-and-switch at the last minute.
[02:53:56.887 --> 02:54:07.677]  So give us your website, pleaser, and then in closing, please give us your report, a brief synopsis on things brightening a bit.
[02:54:07.677 --> 02:54:10.079]  Or was I wrong in inferring that from what you said?
[02:54:10.646 --> 02:54:26.671]  No, that's very good, because the website, first of all, is scienceandpublicpolicy.org, and I'm doing a more or less daily blog from the conference on scienceandpublicpolicy.org, so you can get all the details of what's in this treaty, all the small print.
[02:54:26.671 --> 02:54:30.492]  It's all in there, because I'm giving quite detailed results on that.
[02:54:30.492 --> 02:54:32.493]  The reason why I think I remain
[02:54:33.038 --> 02:54:39.460]  Hopeful, apart from, you know, my religion, which teaches us that we should always hope, even in the darkest hour.
[02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:58.805]  But also, I think it is very clear from the shrill hysteria of the propaganda here that these people know, the ones who are peddling this here in Copenhagen, they know this is the last chance saloon, not for that planet, which was saved 2,000 years ago and doesn't need to be saved again, but for them.
[02:54:59.454 --> 02:55:25.458]  They know that if they can't get what they want at Copenhagen, they will never get it again because the investigations into the Climategate emails are going to lead to criminal prosecutions, not only for destroying data which have been validly requested by other scientists to check all these bogus results, but also because these results, in fact several of them, amount to scientific and financial fraud.
[02:55:26.158 --> 02:55:40.593]  And I've had two professors on to me, one from America, one from Canada, just in the last few days, saying they want me to put them in touch with the right policemen in the United Kingdom, and in fact he's a police superintendent in
[02:55:41.593 --> 02:55:53.059]  East Anglia Constabulary, so that they can report how they were manoeuvred, manipulated, had their papers tampered with, delayed publication, prevented publication so they couldn't put alternative views.
[02:55:53.059 --> 02:55:58.242]  They had papers that should have been in the IPCC's reports suppressed so they weren't considered.
[02:55:58.242 --> 02:56:07.927]  All of these games were going on and all of these in furtherance of what is now quite clearly the largest and worst financial fraud the world has ever seen.
[02:56:07.927 --> 02:56:10.548]  So if they don't get what they want at Copenhagen,
[02:56:11.058 --> 02:56:16.023]  They know they'll never get it later because the fraud prosecutions and investigations will have started.
[02:56:16.023 --> 02:56:21.007]  If they do get what they want at Copenhagen, they won't be able to make it stick.
[02:56:21.007 --> 02:56:24.090]  Too many people now have cottoned on to the fraud.
[02:56:24.090 --> 02:56:31.717]  Too many people, ordinary people that is, people who are not in the governing class, the little guy rather than the big guy, the little guy has now woken up.
[02:56:31.717 --> 02:56:37.482]  And if a little guy stands together with the other little guys and just says, boom, the big guys will run a mile.
[02:56:38.328 --> 02:57:08.268]  Lord Christopher Monckton, then it's safe to say with your astute political analysis of this, you've been at the heart of fighting this for more than two decades, that the heart of world government, as Ban Ki-moon and Van Rompuy and all of them have said, their global carbon tax dictatorship is hemorrhaging to death, and are you saying all the king's horses, all the king's men, if we the patriots for liberty continue to expose them, that all the king's horses, all the king's men can't put the lying fraud Al Gore back together?
[02:57:09.690 --> 02:57:15.997]  That's right, I think Humpty Dumpty Gore is now in pieces on the floor, dribbling untidily.
[02:57:15.997 --> 02:57:27.752]  The fact that he has had to lie even about the date of the Climategate emails, where he's trying to say that they were all at least 10 years old, when most of them weren't even, well I say some of them weren't even 10 days old.
[02:57:28.174 --> 02:57:30.916]  Clearly, there is desperation there now.
[02:57:30.916 --> 02:57:42.304]  The fact that this serial liar is lying yet again, and this time about the climate case emails, shows how utterly incredible and useless a figure he has now become.
[02:57:42.304 --> 02:57:46.007]  It's time for him to send back his Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:57:46.007 --> 02:57:50.090]  It's time for Obama to send back his Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:57:50.090 --> 02:57:53.372]  Because the people who should have won it, let's take Irene's son,
[02:57:54.005 --> 02:57:56.768]  Who was nominated for it the same year as Al Gore.
[02:57:56.768 --> 02:57:59.230]  You know what she did when she was a kid?
[02:57:59.230 --> 02:58:09.139]  She taught herself plumbing so that she could go into the German ghetto with her huge toolbox of plumbing tools and into the Warsaw ghetto where the Jews were.
[02:58:09.139 --> 02:58:15.485]  And she would then take one Jewish child every day in the bottom in the Hidden Falls bottom in her
[02:58:16.164 --> 02:58:17.365]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:53.914 --> 02:59:56.297]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.297 --> 03:00:02.523]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.523 --> 03:00:08.430]  Well, we just did 15 minutes with Lord Christopher Monckton, and I appreciate Chamberlain Griffin happily letting him cut into his time.
[03:00:17.028 --> 03:00:19.211]  Jim, we're good for another 40 minutes.
[03:00:19.211 --> 03:00:22.295]  Then we have another guest from Copenhagen, Denmark, joining us.
[03:00:22.295 --> 03:00:30.686]  Tom Harris, engineer, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set up to counter the lies of the UN and the IPCC.
[03:00:31.988 --> 03:00:32.088]  Yeah.
[03:00:48.732 --> 03:00:52.094]  This message from Lord Monckton is most inspiring to me.
[03:00:52.094 --> 03:00:57.857]  It isn't often, you know, you can look at the daily news and come up with something that makes you feel good.
[03:00:57.857 --> 03:01:02.839]  And I really enjoyed that and I feel like doubling the effort today.
[03:01:02.839 --> 03:01:05.601]  He's quite a warrior, isn't he?
[03:01:05.601 --> 03:01:08.402]  And I don't know why I've never heard of him until recently.
[03:01:08.402 --> 03:01:11.884]  I guess he's been doing that job over on the other side for quite a while.
[03:01:11.884 --> 03:01:13.285]  He's always been traveling around.
[03:01:13.285 --> 03:01:14.425]  It's just that it finally hit.
[03:01:14.425 --> 03:01:15.786]  The Internet age is here.
[03:01:15.786 --> 03:01:15.986]  Yes.
[03:01:16.406 --> 03:01:20.788]  And plus, he was excusing him from being fraud ten years ago.
[03:01:20.788 --> 03:01:26.231]  But quickly before we get into meat and potatoes, you also have an event at Bright New Books tonight, right?
[03:01:26.231 --> 03:01:30.272]  Yes, and that's just kind of a preview to the seminar on Saturday.
[03:01:30.272 --> 03:01:32.754]  Also, I'll be answering a lot of questions.
[03:01:32.754 --> 03:01:34.354]  I hope I'll be answering the questions anyway.
[03:01:34.354 --> 03:01:35.475]  I'll be getting a lot of them, I know.
[03:01:36.355 --> 03:01:46.640]  My intent is to do an update on the creature from Jekyll Island, which is the title of the book on the Federal Reserve System, and put it into focus in terms of what's happening today in the economy.
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:51.322]  People want to know, you know, how did the Federal Reserve do this?
[03:01:51.322 --> 03:01:52.263]  What are they still doing?
[03:01:52.263 --> 03:01:53.783]  What are the plans for the future?
[03:01:53.783 --> 03:01:55.064]  I'll be talking about that tonight.
[03:01:55.876 --> 03:01:58.017]  And that's at 7 o'clock?
[03:01:58.017 --> 03:01:59.058]  7 o'clock, mm-hmm.
[03:01:59.058 --> 03:02:05.983]  And that's down on Guadalupe Street at bravenewbooks.com, or people can find out all the details at one of your great websites.
[03:02:05.983 --> 03:02:08.564]  It'll be realityzone.com.
[03:02:08.564 --> 03:02:12.447]  And find out about the hotel event and how to get tickets to that for Saturday.
[03:02:12.447 --> 03:02:13.348]  Yeah, that would be great.
[03:02:13.348 --> 03:02:15.129]  It is not too late, folks, to get into that.
[03:02:16.104 --> 03:02:20.651]  Right, we expect a good crowd, so the earlier the reservation is made, the better off it'll be.
[03:02:20.651 --> 03:02:27.501]  Yeah, and you're powerful on the stage, and you're powerful in person too, on my second time having you in studio, but you're really powerful up there giving a speech.
[03:02:27.501 --> 03:02:28.001]  Well, thank you.
[03:02:29.115 --> 03:02:37.058]  I enjoy doing it, and I have a message that I feel very passionate about, so I guess I just worry about the message and forget about the speech.
[03:02:37.058 --> 03:02:41.259]  You know, every time you're on, I get all these emails from women who just love your voice.
[03:02:41.259 --> 03:02:41.740]  Oh, really?
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:43.180]  Why don't they send me the emails?
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:48.822]  That's the way it works.
[03:02:48.822 --> 03:02:50.943]  Oh my goodness.
[03:02:50.943 --> 03:02:54.284]  But getting into banking,
[03:02:55.915 --> 03:02:57.156]  311 co-sponsors.
[03:02:57.156 --> 03:02:59.356]  It's passed the House committee.
[03:02:59.356 --> 03:03:00.717]  It looks like it's going to pass the House.
[03:03:00.717 --> 03:03:03.658]  The Senate may block it, but that's putting off the inevitable.
[03:03:03.658 --> 03:03:10.160]  People have finally gone past the left and right, the two parties, to the real power structure, the bankers, that you've been fighting for 40 years.
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:10.340]  Right.
[03:03:11.224 --> 03:03:14.186]  You're talking about the proposed bill to audit the Fed?
[03:03:14.186 --> 03:03:15.286]  Yes.
[03:03:15.286 --> 03:03:17.027]  I'd like to comment on that.
[03:03:17.027 --> 03:03:24.911]  I support that, of course, but I have some misgivings, which I'll mention for a moment, and then come back to my support statement.
[03:03:24.911 --> 03:03:34.596]  When I wrote the book, it was published in 1994, I had a little paragraph or two about the Audit the Fed bill, which in those days was routinely sponsored by Congressman Gonzalez.
[03:03:35.316 --> 03:03:38.639]  And I commented then, I said, you know, we don't need to audit the Fed.
[03:03:38.639 --> 03:03:41.160]  What we need to do is abolish the Fed.
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:52.028]  And I complained then, I predicted then, that if we ever had a serious move to audit the Fed, that it probably would be an instrument by which politicians would make a big grandstand.
[03:03:52.028 --> 03:03:54.710]  They would say, we're going to do something about this Federal Reserve.
[03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:56.352]  We're going to audit the Fed.
[03:03:56.352 --> 03:04:01.556]  When in fact, if they did an audit, I think they'll find that for the most part the Fed's not doing anything illegal.
[03:04:02.176 --> 03:04:03.557]  It's a holding company.
[03:04:03.557 --> 03:04:04.638]  It's a cartel.
[03:04:04.638 --> 03:04:06.379]  It's doing what it's supposed to do.
[03:04:06.379 --> 03:04:11.003]  And it would drag on for a couple of years while people had the false impression that something was being done.
[03:04:11.003 --> 03:04:13.785]  Your attack is on the institution and the system itself.
[03:04:13.785 --> 03:04:15.206]  The system itself.
[03:04:15.206 --> 03:04:18.288]  And so I said, you know, do we need to audit the mafia?
[03:04:18.288 --> 03:04:18.328]  No.
[03:04:19.489 --> 03:04:22.951]  Uh, we need to get, you know, get rid of the Mafia if we could.
[03:04:22.951 --> 03:04:25.392]  And I feel the same thing is true with the Federal Reserve.
[03:04:25.392 --> 03:04:30.053]  But it has been audits that brought down Al Capone, and that's Ron Paul's view, is that we'll put it out there.
[03:04:30.053 --> 03:04:32.574]  His fight against them is identifying them as the enemy.
[03:04:32.574 --> 03:04:35.296]  Some polls show 81% of Americans want to abolish it.
[03:04:35.296 --> 03:04:35.816]  Yeah.
[03:04:35.816 --> 03:04:37.276]  Well, now I come back to my opening.
[03:04:37.276 --> 03:04:38.277]  We'll stay there, we got a break.
[03:04:38.277 --> 03:04:39.997]  Come back with your positive point.
[03:04:39.997 --> 03:04:40.318]  Yes.
[03:04:40.318 --> 03:04:43.859]  And then let's get more into ManBearPig.
[03:04:43.859 --> 03:04:44.699]  Yeah.
[03:04:44.699 --> 03:04:45.800]  Do you know about the ManBearPig?
[03:04:46.795 --> 03:04:47.795]  No, tell me.
[03:04:47.795 --> 03:04:50.637]  I'll tell you about Al Gore and the Man-Bear-Pig when we get back.
[03:04:50.637 --> 03:04:53.558]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest in studio.
[03:04:53.558 --> 03:04:56.659]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[03:04:56.659 --> 03:04:57.680]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:00.901]  InfoWars.com, baby!
[03:05:00.901 --> 03:05:06.204]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.204 --> 03:05:10.726]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.726 --> 03:05:13.007]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:13.007 --> 03:05:14.627]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.627 --> 03:05:15.668]  There is a solution.
[03:05:15.888 --> 03:05:24.317]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:05:24.317 --> 03:05:31.785]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:06:00.779 --> 03:06:05.322]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:05.322 --> 03:06:06.243]  Number one.
[03:06:06.243 --> 03:06:09.665]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.665 --> 03:06:10.526]  Number two.
[03:06:10.526 --> 03:06:15.429]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:16.169]  It's true.
[03:06:16.169 --> 03:06:21.033]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.033 --> 03:06:21.873]  Number three.
[03:06:21.873 --> 03:06:25.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.455 --> 03:06:29.158]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:29.338 --> 03:06:30.139]  Number 4.
[03:06:30.139 --> 03:06:32.902]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.902 --> 03:06:36.586]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.586 --> 03:06:37.386]  Number 5.
[03:06:37.386 --> 03:06:41.531]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.531 --> 03:06:46.296]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:06:46.576 --> 03:06:50.741]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:07:01.223 --> 03:07:04.224]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.224 --> 03:07:09.545]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.545 --> 03:07:11.605]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.605 --> 03:07:16.606]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.606 --> 03:07:17.786]  How much do you want?
[03:07:17.786 --> 03:07:18.906]  When do you want it?
[03:07:18.906 --> 03:07:20.787]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:20.787 --> 03:07:21.867]  When will you need it?
[03:07:21.867 --> 03:07:24.067]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:24.067 --> 03:07:25.408]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.408 --> 03:07:26.928]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:26.928 --> 03:07:27.108]  If there
[03:07:27.108 --> 03:07:29.471]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:07:29.471 --> 03:07:32.194]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.194 --> 03:07:35.778]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:35.778 --> 03:07:39.602]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.602 --> 03:07:40.844]  How much will you need?
[03:07:40.844 --> 03:07:41.745]  We don't know.
[03:07:41.745 --> 03:07:42.846]  How much do you want?
[03:07:42.846 --> 03:07:43.767]  All you can get.
[03:07:43.767 --> 03:07:44.468]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.848 --> 03:07:47.911]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:47.911 --> 03:07:50.093]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:50.093 --> 03:07:51.214]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:51.214 --> 03:07:54.136]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.459 --> 03:08:13.700]  Yeah.
[03:08:18.203 --> 03:08:22.604]  No, G. Edward, the Man-Bear-Pig is a South Park episode where they make fun of Al Gore for fear-mongering.
[03:08:22.604 --> 03:08:27.286]  And he says there's a mythical creature in the woods that's going to kill the town if they don't give him a bunch of money.
[03:08:27.286 --> 03:08:30.287]  And it's a half-man, half-bear, half-pig.
[03:08:30.287 --> 03:08:30.967]  Which, of course, is 150%.
[03:08:30.967 --> 03:08:34.768]  And it's just totally ridiculous.
[03:08:34.768 --> 03:08:40.270]  Later we'll play a clip of that and we can find it on YouTube or elsewhere.
[03:08:40.270 --> 03:08:44.091]  But getting into the positive part about auditing the Fed.
[03:08:44.531 --> 03:08:54.339]  Yeah, I think it's a very positive thing because for the first time, people are hearing about the Federal Reserve, and they're hearing about it in a way that causes them to think that maybe something's wrong.
[03:08:54.339 --> 03:09:02.225]  You know, most people have never given a thought to this institution, and then when they do think about it, they think it's a great government agency of some kind.
[03:09:02.685 --> 03:09:04.166]  Now they're hearing audit the Fed.
[03:09:04.166 --> 03:09:04.867]  What does that mean?
[03:09:04.867 --> 03:09:06.869]  Why does someone want to audit the Fed?
[03:09:06.869 --> 03:09:15.576]  So, the reason I support it is because it's causing millions of Americans to realize that there's something fishy with the Federal Reserve System, and that's a big step forward.
[03:09:15.970 --> 03:09:38.596]  I want to get back into the Federal Reserve, but obviously the big issue is the public announcement of world government, the public announcement that it is to be funded by taxes on everything, a UN Directorate over energy taxation, 2% tax off the top of all countries' GDP, a police grid over all air traffic, taxes on that, taxes on food, taxes on fuel.
[03:09:38.596 --> 03:09:42.297]  Why do you think they're moving, throwing everything at us at once?
[03:09:42.297 --> 03:09:42.317]  A.
[03:09:45.923 --> 03:09:51.645]  Well, two questions.
[03:09:51.645 --> 03:09:57.587]  I think that the reason they're throwing everything at us at once now is because we're coming very close to the finish line.
[03:09:57.587 --> 03:10:04.950]  I mean, there's much more to do, and they're just trying to tie it all up as quickly as possible, certainly within the next ten years, I would say.
[03:10:05.350 --> 03:10:12.374]  So, it's come time to button everything down, and you can't kid about it anymore when you're, you know, trying to tie everything down.
[03:10:12.374 --> 03:10:14.855]  You have to call it exactly what it is.
[03:10:14.855 --> 03:10:24.560]  I don't know if they're accelerating their program, or whether it's just like a natural phenomenon when a candle burns brightly, it means it's about ready to burn out, you know?
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:31.003]  So, I think it's accelerated, but whether they've planned it to be that way or not, I wouldn't have any way of knowing.
[03:10:32.890 --> 03:10:41.879]  But why would they go from admitting that they're doing, I mean denying what they were doing, to admitting what they're doing?
[03:10:41.879 --> 03:10:50.948]  I mean, doesn't that hurt them to say, there's no world government, there's no carbon tax plan, just two, three years ago, to, yeah there's a world government, it's going to save Africans by cutting off their power.
[03:10:51.544 --> 03:11:00.848]  Well, I think the answer to that, Alex, is that if they had said, yes, we're building world government, they'd said that three, four, five years ago, people would have been shocked.
[03:11:00.848 --> 03:11:01.868]  They would have been outraged.
[03:11:01.868 --> 03:11:04.009]  They would have said, who wants world government?
[03:11:04.009 --> 03:11:06.790]  But now there is enough crisis going on in the world.
[03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:12.293]  People are frightened of so many things that now they can say, yeah, there's world government and it's the solution.
[03:11:12.833 --> 03:11:14.755]  To all of your problems, everybody.
[03:11:14.755 --> 03:11:19.742]  So see how fortunate you are that we've got this masterful plan to save you?
[03:11:19.742 --> 03:11:28.593]  So I think now they're talking about world government because finally they can present it as a so-called solution to all of the problems that are infecting the planet.
[03:11:29.525 --> 03:11:40.427]  And in the Copenhagen Climate Summit, in disarray after Danish tech's leak of the official treaty that they want to get people to sign, they didn't mean to bring this out until the last few days.
[03:11:40.427 --> 03:11:56.870]  Get the third world all thinking they were going to get to loot the West, because they're playing groups off against each other, and now they find out, oh, the IMF and World Bank will have all the power, not the UN, and this tax money will be doled out to you if you reduce your population and set up a global one-child policy.
[03:11:57.350 --> 03:11:59.814]  So everything is coming out in the open.
[03:11:59.814 --> 03:12:02.057]  People would laugh at Endgame three years ago.
[03:12:02.057 --> 03:12:04.901]  They're not laughing now.
[03:12:04.901 --> 03:12:11.030]  And so the IMF, World Bank, these are arms of the same private central banking system that we live under.
[03:12:11.465 --> 03:12:14.747]  That's right, that has always been the source of the ultimate power.
[03:12:14.747 --> 03:12:21.171]  Certainly here in the United States, people are beginning finally to understand that the power is with the banks, not with the government.
[03:12:21.171 --> 03:12:30.478]  That the government supposedly was to control the banks, but we can see in the recent events in Washington when all of this money is created out of nothing and it goes to the banks and the
[03:12:31.218 --> 03:12:35.080]  The congressmen dutifully vote for it without even understanding what the bills are.
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:36.681]  They never ask any questions.
[03:12:36.681 --> 03:12:38.202]  They never even read the bills.
[03:12:38.202 --> 03:12:39.603]  They just dutifully vote for it.
[03:12:39.603 --> 03:12:44.526]  I think anybody can see now that it's the banks that are running the show and not the government.
[03:12:44.526 --> 03:12:47.067]  So, there will be no difference at the international level.
[03:12:47.067 --> 03:12:51.310]  It is coming out in the open that the IMF and the World Bank will be the center of authority and power.
[03:12:52.042 --> 03:12:59.771]  But the banks want to create a new global government structure because there's no Bill of Rights, there's no Constitution, there's no Declaration of Independence.
[03:12:59.771 --> 03:13:04.896]  It's just pure, even the Guardian admits, secret world government run by private corporate interests.
[03:13:04.896 --> 03:13:08.560]  It actually says that in the text and now the London Guardian...
[03:13:09.477 --> 03:13:11.699]  Is talking like G. Edward Griffin.
[03:13:11.699 --> 03:13:12.920]  This is incredible.
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:13.961]  Yes, it is.
[03:13:13.961 --> 03:13:19.306]  Well, the fact of the matter is they do have documents that appear like they're the Bill of Rights.
[03:13:19.306 --> 03:13:23.530]  I mean, they do have the Covenant on Human Rights that's published there at the United Nations.
[03:13:23.530 --> 03:13:24.551]  They have conferences on it.
[03:13:24.551 --> 03:13:27.073]  The United Nations Unanimous Declaration on Human Rights.
[03:13:27.073 --> 03:13:32.478]  30 points, but in 29 and 30, all the rights given are privileges the UN can revoke.
[03:13:32.984 --> 03:13:36.707]  Yes, and you don't have to wait until you get to the 29th and the 30th one.
[03:13:36.707 --> 03:13:45.873]  Every one of them along the way says, for example, everyone has the right to freedom of speech, except as may be provided for by law.
[03:13:45.873 --> 03:13:49.936]  Everyone has the right to employment, or the right to travel.
[03:13:49.936 --> 03:13:52.138]  Everyone has the right to freedom of religion.
[03:13:52.138 --> 03:13:58.042]  Everyone has all these rights, but in every condition, in every provision, they say except
[03:13:58.542 --> 03:14:07.828]  As may be provided for by law, which means you've got these rights until they pass a law and take them away from you, which means you never had them in the first place.
[03:14:07.828 --> 03:14:09.028]  Well said.
[03:14:09.028 --> 03:14:19.675]  On the subject of the private Federal Reserve, the holding company, the private banks that own and control it, they have stolen trillions of dollars.
[03:14:19.675 --> 03:14:21.536]  They won't say where it's gone.
[03:14:21.536 --> 03:14:22.897]  How do you see this unfolding?
[03:14:25.285 --> 03:14:27.567]  That's a tough question.
[03:14:27.567 --> 03:14:35.496]  I'm taking a moment to think about it because I don't think the mechanisms are in place right now for the will of the people to have much effect.
[03:14:36.496 --> 03:14:44.924]  The government of the United States is firmly in the hands of collectivists who are beholden to this financial global power.
[03:14:44.924 --> 03:14:52.292]  And they care what the American voters think, but not as much as you might suspect that they do.
[03:14:52.292 --> 03:14:56.916]  They don't care so much about people who write them letters as they do about people who write them checks.
[03:14:57.877 --> 03:15:20.294]  And so I think when the public becomes upset by this and starts to demand change, as they're now doing, the politicians are maneuvering and thinking not in terms of how we're going to bring about the change, but how we continue doing exactly what we have been doing and to shut the public out of the debate and to just proceed in spite of the public opposition and concern.
[03:15:20.294 --> 03:15:26.659]  So to answer your question, I see an increasing pressure for genuine rebellion.
[03:15:27.539 --> 03:15:31.821]  In this country, which scares the dickens out of me because I don't think that would be a good thing.
[03:15:31.821 --> 03:15:33.802]  And we've seen the elite preparing for that.
[03:15:33.802 --> 03:15:36.884]  Preparing for it and I think hoping for it.
[03:15:36.884 --> 03:15:45.488]  Because they know that if there is widespread civil violence, that will be the excuse they really want in order to clamp down with martial law.
[03:15:45.728 --> 03:15:47.190]  That's why they've got Northcom in place.
[03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:48.211]  Exactly, yeah.
[03:15:48.211 --> 03:15:52.277]  So I worry a lot about that, but you asked me the question, where do I think it's going?
[03:15:52.277 --> 03:15:59.106]  I think that's probably where it's going to go, and I hope we can reach enough people soon enough to prevent that from happening.
[03:16:00.453 --> 03:16:04.156]  Obviously educating people is a big part of the solution and we're doing that.
[03:16:04.156 --> 03:16:15.544]  But at the same time, as you said, running for city council, county commissioner, school board, we need to start getting into the power structure at the grassroots and start moving into the federal government as well.
[03:16:15.544 --> 03:16:18.526]  The globalists have the long view, that's why they've been successful.
[03:16:18.526 --> 03:16:20.107]  We need to have the long view.
[03:16:20.107 --> 03:16:22.288]  Speak to that and Freedom Force International.
[03:16:22.288 --> 03:16:23.389]  Oh, thanks for that.
[03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:27.432]  That is the mantra that I have been preaching for so many years.
[03:16:27.432 --> 03:16:29.694]  Most Americans have a very short
[03:16:30.154 --> 03:16:35.798]  Well, I'm here to say it's not going to happen in the next election or probably not even the one after that.
[03:16:35.798 --> 03:16:42.464]  Because they give us a Bush, they give us an Obama, same policies, different rhetoric, and just the rope-a-dope continues.
[03:16:59.497 --> 03:17:09.062]  As long as we're committed to this scam between the Republican and the Democrat Party, which appears to be offering people a choice, when in fact it's not.
[03:17:09.062 --> 03:17:11.183]  It's a rigged wrestling match.
[03:17:11.183 --> 03:17:18.307]  As long as people buy into that Republican-Democrat nonsense, there is no hope of changing the system.
[03:17:18.307 --> 03:17:24.731]  So, that's where education comes in, and it's also where the Freedom Force strategy comes in, where we want people who are aware of this
[03:17:25.151 --> 03:17:36.818]  To go into government, to try and become influential in their own government, instead of just standing on the outside of the halls of power, looking in and writing letters of complaint and petition.
[03:17:36.818 --> 03:17:39.760]  We want them to organize and to run for office.
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:50.947]  And then even if they're in low positions, they will gather support by the grassroots, be propelled into higher positions, they can leak documents, they can whistleblow, they can bully pulpit, they can sabotage globalist operations.
[03:17:51.087 --> 03:17:52.487]  You have to be on the inside.
[03:18:13.894 --> 03:18:20.221]  Roman historians talked about the enemy at the gates with their flag openly is not the threat, it's the enemy from within.
[03:18:20.221 --> 03:18:21.442]  Yes, so true.
[03:18:21.442 --> 03:18:23.504]  But we are the cure from within.
[03:18:23.504 --> 03:18:25.106]  The cure is from within too.
[03:18:25.106 --> 03:18:27.328]  So that's what Freedom Force is all about.
[03:18:27.328 --> 03:18:29.070]  We have the long view of history.
[03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:32.854]  We think that this can be turned around, but not by the next election.
[03:18:33.534 --> 03:18:37.798]  So it's a kind of a pessimistic view and an optimistic view at the same time.
[03:18:37.798 --> 03:18:43.742]  It's pessimistic in the sense that we'd all like to see a return to normalcy and prosperity and safety and all of that.
[03:18:43.742 --> 03:18:47.986]  We'd like to see that happen real fast, but it's not going to happen real fast.
[03:18:47.986 --> 03:18:52.149]  But the optimistic point is that if we lay the foundation today
[03:18:52.549 --> 03:19:06.696]  If we get people to understand the basic principles of freedom, and if we get them organized and networked together so they can go into the power centers of society, including the political parties, but also the church organizations, the schools... That's what FEMA's doing!
[03:19:06.696 --> 03:19:10.218]  They're doing what we should be doing, quietly taking over.
[03:19:10.218 --> 03:19:16.101]  The UN document came out last week, where over a decade ago they took over the public schools locally, brainwashing the kids.
[03:19:16.841 --> 03:19:18.381]  But it's not pessimistic.
[03:19:18.381 --> 03:19:19.522]  It's honest.
[03:19:19.522 --> 03:19:24.003]  What's pessimistic is people wanting an instant solution, a silver bullet.
[03:19:24.003 --> 03:19:25.463]  It's got to happen today.
[03:19:25.463 --> 03:19:25.823]  No.
[03:19:25.823 --> 03:19:27.344]  Resistance is victory.
[03:19:27.344 --> 03:19:28.664]  The truth is victory.
[03:19:28.664 --> 03:19:29.404]  Taking action.
[03:19:29.404 --> 03:19:30.764]  I've been doing this 14 years.
[03:19:30.764 --> 03:19:32.765]  You've been doing this 40 plus years.
[03:19:32.765 --> 03:19:35.326]  And just the process of like a woodpecker.
[03:19:35.326 --> 03:19:36.226]  Always attacking.
[03:19:36.226 --> 03:19:37.146]  Always educating.
[03:19:37.146 --> 03:19:38.326]  Always resisting.
[03:19:38.326 --> 03:19:40.667]  Over time it builds an exponential force.
[03:19:41.127 --> 03:19:42.047]  That is unstoppable.
[03:19:42.047 --> 03:19:47.669]  But people like, well, I went out and protested once, or I went to city council once, or I tried to run and didn't win once.
[03:19:47.669 --> 03:19:49.089]  Well, so did Ron Paul.
[03:19:49.089 --> 03:19:53.911]  It's all a process, and we have to realize that they're trying to bend our will.
[03:19:53.911 --> 03:19:59.972]  We've got to push and bend right back, because it's when you don't give up and keep pushing that you're an unstoppable force.
[03:19:59.972 --> 03:20:01.133]  G. Edward Griffin, stay with us.
[03:20:01.133 --> 03:20:01.773]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:03.266 --> 03:20:04.788]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:20:04.788 --> 03:20:06.130]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:20:06.130 --> 03:20:08.052]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:20:08.052 --> 03:20:16.863]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:20:16.863 --> 03:20:22.130]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:20:22.270 --> 03:20:24.072]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:20:24.072 --> 03:20:31.558]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:20:31.558 --> 03:20:35.742]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:20:35.742 --> 03:20:38.264]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:20:38.464 --> 03:20:43.446]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[03:21:02.572 --> 03:21:06.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:09.847]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.847 --> 03:21:11.249]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:11.969 --> 03:21:15.070]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:21.031]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.031 --> 03:21:26.212]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.212 --> 03:21:36.194]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.334 --> 03:21:38.676]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.676 --> 03:21:40.256]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.256 --> 03:21:42.718]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.718 --> 03:21:44.839]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.839 --> 03:21:49.983]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.983 --> 03:21:55.006]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:22:01.167 --> 03:22:11.191]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:22:11.191 --> 03:22:15.692]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[03:22:15.692 --> 03:22:26.476]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:22:26.856 --> 03:22:36.046]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:22:36.046 --> 03:22:40.651]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:22:40.651 --> 03:22:42.473]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:42.473 --> 03:22:44.976]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:22:45.236 --> 03:22:46.077]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:46.077 --> 03:22:48.239]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:22:48.239 --> 03:22:48.999]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.999 --> 03:22:49.620]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:49.620 --> 03:22:50.481]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[03:22:50.481 --> 03:22:52.002]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[03:22:52.002 --> 03:22:53.343]  The price of food continues to rise.
[03:23:10.282 --> 03:23:12.583]  You know that you need to prepare.
[03:23:12.583 --> 03:23:16.366]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[03:23:16.366 --> 03:23:19.968]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[03:23:19.968 --> 03:23:32.356]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[03:23:32.356 --> 03:23:37.519]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice,
[03:23:37.759 --> 03:23:38.299]  I think so.
[03:24:27.581 --> 03:24:37.188]  We've got this segment and part of the next, and then we've got a guest joining us from Copenhagen in the last 20 minutes of this transmission.
[03:24:37.188 --> 03:24:39.890]  G. Edward Griffin is in studio with us.
[03:24:39.890 --> 03:24:48.297]  He's going to be speaking at Brave New Books tonight in Austin, Texas at 7 p.m., and then at the Courtyard Austin Downtown Convention Center, 300 East 4th Street.
[03:24:50.038 --> 03:24:56.043]  Austin, Texas, 78701, 512-236-8008.
[03:24:56.043 --> 03:24:57.625]  Saturday, December 12th.
[03:24:57.625 --> 03:24:59.566]  The registration begins at 8.30 a.m.
[03:24:59.566 --> 03:25:02.028]  because you don't need to go through the registration.
[03:25:02.028 --> 03:25:09.415]  You can come at 8.30 for coffee and pastries or get there at 9.30 as Mr. Griffin starts his presentation at 9.45.
[03:25:09.415 --> 03:25:11.256]  Don't want to miss that Saturday in Austin, Texas.
[03:25:11.256 --> 03:25:13.058]  Okay, we're getting a long view of history.
[03:25:13.678 --> 03:25:28.413]  I think these victories against the Federal Reserve, though, exposing them, their polling numbers going down to less than 20%, the environmentalists being unmasked as private corporate takeover artists, all of this is showing the people, though, that we can have victory.
[03:25:28.413 --> 03:25:29.874]  I mean, I'm seeing the morale go up.
[03:25:30.895 --> 03:25:38.739]  You know, being a public figure, I get off airplanes in Latin America, Canada, towns all over the U.S., and literally, cars stop as I walk down the street.
[03:25:38.739 --> 03:25:39.699]  People everywhere.
[03:25:39.699 --> 03:25:40.860]  And I'm just one guy.
[03:25:40.860 --> 03:25:42.381]  And it's getting insane.
[03:25:42.381 --> 03:25:46.603]  I mean, it's like I've got a major sitcom on television or something.
[03:25:46.603 --> 03:25:50.925]  I mean, I'll be out with Charlie Sheen on the streets of Los Angeles, and people running up to him, they're running up to me.
[03:25:50.925 --> 03:25:52.385]  I mean, it just, it's happening.
[03:25:52.385 --> 03:25:57.208]  I mean, really, that's a sonar ping that, it's bigger than we think.
[03:25:57.208 --> 03:25:57.588]  Gee, Edward.
[03:25:58.188 --> 03:25:59.469]  Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[03:25:59.469 --> 03:26:09.333]  And, of course, the theme that I focus on is that the long view of history is very, very comforting, at least to someone at my age.
[03:26:09.333 --> 03:26:10.814]  I don't know, a younger person.
[03:26:10.814 --> 03:26:15.616]  I remember when I was a lot younger, I was in a bigger hurry than I am now.
[03:26:15.616 --> 03:26:17.857]  But it's comforting to know that
[03:26:19.048 --> 03:26:26.776]  You and I are putting in place principles and organizational structures and strategies that cannot be stamped out.
[03:26:26.776 --> 03:26:30.179]  I don't care how strong the engines of tyranny are.
[03:26:30.179 --> 03:26:36.145]  They cannot overpower the force of the knowledge and the principles that we're building right now.
[03:26:36.145 --> 03:26:43.011]  And that is going to build through the next generation and I think the following generation after that.
[03:26:43.872 --> 03:26:47.376]  Sounds like a far distance down the road, but it's not that far.
[03:26:47.376 --> 03:26:50.920]  I think we're going to see this whole thing turn around within that length of period.
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:52.021]  And that's very comforting.
[03:26:52.021 --> 03:26:55.384]  I can go to bed at night and really sleep well thinking that I have a part.
[03:26:55.384 --> 03:27:04.914]  But they are racing to put the technocracy in place, but that we told the truth, had a testament of who the bad guys were, and what liberty could be, those seeds
[03:27:05.495 --> 03:27:12.420]  Billions of them have been planted, millions have sprouted, but tyranny is almost like water and sunlight to liberty.
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:15.863]  When it comes in, for every action, there's an equal reaction.
[03:27:15.863 --> 03:27:18.725]  I agree with that.
[03:27:18.725 --> 03:27:27.172]  I guess we could say it's fortunate that we live in these tumultuous times, even though it may be rather hectic for us.
[03:27:27.172 --> 03:27:31.054]  Still, if we didn't have all the problems we have today, people would still be
[03:27:32.796 --> 03:27:36.661]  They wouldn't be thinking about the ingredients of freedom.
[03:27:36.661 --> 03:27:39.064]  They wouldn't be thinking about what it takes to be free.
[03:27:39.064 --> 03:27:41.126]  They wouldn't be thinking about our heritage.
[03:27:41.126 --> 03:27:43.849]  They wouldn't be thinking about economic issues.
[03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:45.992]  But there was a choice, another option.
[03:27:45.992 --> 03:27:48.034]  Yeah, because everything was comfortable.
[03:27:48.034 --> 03:27:49.696]  Everything was easy, you know?
[03:27:51.916 --> 03:27:57.159]  If we want to put in place something that's going to have this long view, we need a lot of help, a lot of support.
[03:27:57.159 --> 03:27:59.380]  That means we need to wake up a lot of people.
[03:27:59.380 --> 03:28:03.202]  So in that sense, this growing tyranny is our ally.
[03:28:03.202 --> 03:28:05.523]  But we still have to stamp it out.
[03:28:05.523 --> 03:28:07.124]  We're not going to let it grow, that's for sure.
[03:28:08.134 --> 03:28:12.180]  And we have to make sure the enemy doesn't plant counterfeits out there to misdirect people.
[03:28:12.180 --> 03:28:18.008]  The globalists are masters of creating infighting with people that don't like the system.
[03:28:18.008 --> 03:28:20.211]  We need to really not spend time on that.
[03:28:20.211 --> 03:28:21.113]  That's right.
[03:28:21.113 --> 03:28:22.455]  Yeah, we know that they're doing that.
[03:28:22.455 --> 03:28:23.756]  That's a favored strategy.
[03:28:25.859 --> 03:28:29.001]  We've seen it all throughout history.
[03:28:29.001 --> 03:28:37.528]  I know a little bit about the Federal Reserve System and the first time I came across that strategy in the economic field was in the evolution and the origin of the Federal Reserve.
[03:28:37.528 --> 03:28:48.136]  The very people that conceived the Federal Reserve, then having got it proposed and an actual bill going before Congress, then they started to lead the opposition against it.
[03:28:48.917 --> 03:28:51.359]  In such a way that it was bound to fail.
[03:28:51.359 --> 03:28:52.759]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:28:52.759 --> 03:28:56.922]  If you lead your own opposition, then you can make sure that it will fail.
[03:28:56.922 --> 03:29:00.504]  Well, there was more to the trick, and I know you know this, but why don't you elaborate?
[03:29:00.504 --> 03:29:05.487]  They came out and acted like they were the bankers and said, we don't want this.
[03:29:05.487 --> 03:29:06.948]  Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[03:29:07.208 --> 03:29:07.748]  Right.
[03:29:07.748 --> 03:29:14.812]  Yeah, they said, uh, this Federal Reserve bill is not good for business, it's not good for America, but they did this as bankers.
[03:29:14.812 --> 03:29:24.857]  And they knew that when that story got into the news, people would say, hey, Maude, look at this, these big bankers don't like this Federal Reserve system very much, must be a good bill.
[03:29:24.857 --> 03:29:25.278]  You know?
[03:29:25.278 --> 03:29:28.259]  They knew that that would be the reaction of the average person.
[03:29:28.259 --> 03:29:33.102]  So they're clever, they're smart, they didn't get to be in the positions of power that they are by being stupid.
[03:29:33.542 --> 03:29:35.904]  But we, on the other hand, can't be stupid either.
[03:29:35.904 --> 03:29:38.207]  We must understand that people do that.
[03:29:38.207 --> 03:29:41.069]  They do, uh, provide false leadership.
[03:29:41.069 --> 03:29:50.378]  They do present, uh, false, uh, images out there just deliberately to trick the, uh, the mind of the average... Absolutely.
[03:29:50.378 --> 03:29:50.879]  Stay there.
[03:29:50.879 --> 03:29:51.839]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:29:51.839 --> 03:29:53.041]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.041 --> 03:29:55.583]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.583 --> 03:29:58.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:06.317]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.317 --> 03:30:10.843]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.843 --> 03:30:13.126]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.126 --> 03:30:14.748]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.748 --> 03:30:15.790]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.010 --> 03:30:24.432]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:05.088 --> 03:31:07.970]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[03:32:00.706 --> 03:32:05.250]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:05.250 --> 03:32:06.170]  Number one.
[03:32:06.170 --> 03:32:09.593]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:09.593 --> 03:32:10.454]  Number two.
[03:32:10.454 --> 03:32:15.358]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:32:15.358 --> 03:32:16.098]  It's true.
[03:32:16.098 --> 03:32:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:32:20.942 --> 03:32:21.783]  Number 3.
[03:32:21.783 --> 03:32:25.366]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:25.366 --> 03:32:29.289]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:29.289 --> 03:32:30.070]  Number 4.
[03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:32.852]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:32:32.852 --> 03:32:36.515]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:32:36.515 --> 03:32:36.756]  Number 5.
[03:32:37.296 --> 03:32:41.438]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:32:41.438 --> 03:32:46.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:46.500 --> 03:32:50.681]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:50.681 --> 03:32:52.462]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:33:22.602 --> 03:33:24.523]  Tom Harris joining us in about eight minutes.
[03:33:24.523 --> 03:33:29.866]  He's there at the Copenhagen World Government Summit.
[03:33:29.866 --> 03:33:34.069]  I tell you, all this mainstream media that's still trying to say there's no world government, they look really stupid.
[03:33:34.069 --> 03:33:38.271]  As the UN and others openly announce it, they haven't quite gotten their propaganda together.
[03:33:38.271 --> 03:33:40.093]  I think it's great.
[03:33:40.093 --> 03:33:44.495]  But, G. Edward, in the last six, seven minutes we have with you, I want to give you the floor.
[03:33:44.495 --> 03:33:47.657]  We were talking during the break, you said it is really coming to a head.
[03:33:47.657 --> 03:33:50.299]  And I agree with the long view of history, they're not going to give up overnight, but
[03:33:51.368 --> 03:34:14.188]  I've given the analogy of Climategate being the Death Star plans getting out, and now with their whole program in disarray, the Death Star's blown up, but they're still Imperial Star Destroyers, the Empire's still occupying all our systems, they're still in all our nations, but it's shown the rebellion that if we can blow up one of their biggest operations in the Info War, we can destroy these people, we can defeat them with the truth.
[03:34:16.149 --> 03:34:26.586]  That's so true, and what can I add to that except that the thought that's always on my mind is it's relatively easy for people to know what they don't want.
[03:34:27.793 --> 03:34:29.474]  We can see this growing tyranny.
[03:34:29.474 --> 03:34:30.474]  We can see the lies.
[03:34:30.474 --> 03:34:32.295]  We can see the deceit.
[03:34:32.295 --> 03:34:33.956]  We can see the increasing taxes.
[03:34:33.956 --> 03:34:37.677]  We can see the devastation of our purchasing power, of our monetary unit.
[03:34:37.677 --> 03:34:40.898]  We can see the dumbing down of the kids in school.
[03:34:40.898 --> 03:34:45.200]  We can see all of these things, and we know we don't want that.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:49.742]  And so it's easy, relatively easy, to get people networked together and organized together.
[03:34:49.742 --> 03:34:50.602]  We're going to fight this.
[03:34:50.602 --> 03:34:52.063]  We're going to bring these people down.
[03:34:53.374 --> 03:34:57.738]  I long to hear people talk about what are we going to replace it with.
[03:34:57.738 --> 03:34:58.619]  I want to hear more.
[03:34:58.619 --> 03:35:14.533]  Congress controlling our currency, cutting down the size of government, getting state sovereignty, getting rid of the government-run public schools, not making the superheroes be sports people or actors but being inventors again, getting back to a renaissance society.
[03:35:14.733 --> 03:35:17.094]  Exactly, and also even deeper than that.
[03:35:17.094 --> 03:35:19.496]  We could go and talk about political principles.
[03:35:19.496 --> 03:35:21.537]  What is the proper function of the state?
[03:35:21.537 --> 03:35:23.077]  What is the ideal system?
[03:35:23.077 --> 03:35:25.759]  Where did our system go wrong, or did it go wrong?
[03:35:25.759 --> 03:35:33.043]  These are the things that I want to hear more in the debate, and I recognize you have to mobilize people on the flashpoint, the anger point.
[03:35:33.043 --> 03:35:43.028]  You know, this is what they don't like, but the reason I created Freedom Force, as you so well know, is because I wanted people to think about the political and ideological principles
[03:35:43.348 --> 03:35:52.032]  The things that we should be building into the system after we recapture control of it and we have a chance to create a better system, what will it be?
[03:35:52.032 --> 03:35:53.912]  What would it look like, you see?
[03:35:53.912 --> 03:36:00.335]  And I always want people to learn and think about the differences between collectivism and individualism.
[03:36:00.335 --> 03:36:02.416]  I want to hear those words used more often.
[03:36:02.416 --> 03:36:05.297]  And we've got to educate people the horrors of collectivism.
[03:36:05.297 --> 03:36:09.539]  We know this animal kills people, enslaves people.
[03:36:09.539 --> 03:36:12.200]  Misery and pain is its children.
[03:36:12.796 --> 03:36:26.525]  Yes, and what I want to see is for people to recognize that this is the same animal, whether it is in Nazi Germany or Red China, even today, or in Cuba, or if it's growing in the United States.
[03:36:26.525 --> 03:36:28.646]  It's just the same animal.
[03:36:28.646 --> 03:36:32.109]  So that's what I want to have people think about.
[03:36:32.109 --> 03:36:34.450]  What is collectivism?
[03:36:34.450 --> 03:36:40.234]  Because once you understand the principles of collectivism, you will not tolerate its growth even in your own country.
[03:36:41.815 --> 03:36:55.488]  Yes, I'm very optimistic about this rising tide of resistance to the growing tyranny, but now I think it's time for us to really focus on having people recognize on the positive things we want to replace it with.
[03:36:55.488 --> 03:36:57.090]  And Freedom Force International does that.
[03:36:57.090 --> 03:36:58.531]  Give us your family of websites.
[03:36:59.369 --> 03:37:00.910]  Yeah, it is a family of websites.
[03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:08.353]  The Freedom Force website is where we call it the think tank of our little world, and that's freedomforceinternational.org.
[03:37:08.353 --> 03:37:10.855]  A lot of material there to read and study.
[03:37:10.855 --> 03:37:13.216]  The commercial site is Reality Zone.
[03:37:13.216 --> 03:37:19.559]  That's where people can buy our audios and our videos and our books, and that's realityzone.com.
[03:37:19.559 --> 03:37:25.362]  Of course, we invite everybody to take our free weekly newsletter, and that's called The Unfiltered News.
[03:37:25.982 --> 03:37:32.489]  And they can get that simply by going to RealityZone on the landing page, and there's an... they can see it.
[03:37:32.489 --> 03:37:33.690]  A lot of great material.
[03:37:33.690 --> 03:37:36.793]  You've been fighting this collectivist takeover for more than 40 years.
[03:37:36.793 --> 03:37:42.218]  You're speaking tonight at Brave New Books in Austin, and Saturday at the Courtyard Austin downtown, 945 in the morning.
[03:37:42.218 --> 03:37:44.100]  People should get there earlier than that, though.
[03:37:44.100 --> 03:37:47.163]  G. Edward Griffin, thank you for coming in the studio with us.
[03:37:47.163 --> 03:37:47.864]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:37:47.864 --> 03:37:49.405]  It's always a pleasure to be here.
[03:37:49.405 --> 03:37:49.766]  Keep it up.
[03:37:50.393 --> 03:37:50.874]  I'll try.
[03:37:50.874 --> 03:37:51.675]  You keep it up, too.
[03:37:51.675 --> 03:37:53.598]  You're a real tiger in the fight for liberty.
[03:37:53.598 --> 03:37:54.800]  Had Lord Monckton on today.
[03:37:54.800 --> 03:37:56.002]  You've been in studio.
[03:37:56.002 --> 03:37:56.723]  This has been amazing.
[03:37:56.723 --> 03:37:57.544]  Thank you, G. Everett Griffin.
[03:37:57.544 --> 03:37:58.927]  Thank you.
[03:37:58.927 --> 03:38:01.711]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely...
[03:38:02.850 --> 03:38:16.685]  Honored here today to have engineer Tom Harris, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set up to counter the IPCC science fraud.
[03:38:16.685 --> 03:38:18.868]  It's been proven to be a premeditated fraud.
[03:38:18.868 --> 03:38:23.773]  We don't just have the Climategate documents, we have the UN documents last week where they've been organizing the fraud together.
[03:38:24.514 --> 03:38:25.515]  Yeah, that's great, Alan.
[03:38:47.020 --> 03:38:48.541]  So much is going on.
[03:38:48.541 --> 03:38:59.611]  In a nutshell, tell us about your group, your take on ClimateGate, the Danish text of the treaty where the third world will actually have to make more cuts than the West, devastating them.
[03:38:59.611 --> 03:39:02.413]  Lord Monckton talked about the millions that will kill a year.
[03:39:02.413 --> 03:39:04.615]  Just look what the ethanol scam has done.
[03:39:04.615 --> 03:39:12.342]  And where do you think this conference is going in light of all this evidence of fraud coming out?
[03:39:13.564 --> 03:39:22.428]  Yeah, well, to start out with, the International Climate Science Coalition is a non-profit group of scientists who were not able to get into most of the UN activities.
[03:39:22.428 --> 03:39:25.649]  Some of them actually were, but they disagreed with the UN.
[03:39:25.649 --> 03:39:34.453]  We have with us about 60 scientists who are our advisors, and it was decided that we should actually ask the UN for some basic data.
[03:39:34.453 --> 03:39:40.196]  Because, you know, one of the main concerns after ClimateGate was, if the temperature data is corrupted, how much else is?
[03:39:40.754 --> 03:39:54.822]  And you know, we hear about extreme weather events increasing and all that sort of thing, but many of these scientists are actually experts in that field and they know that the extreme weather records were set in the 1800s and early 1900s when it comes to typhoons and hurricanes and things like that.
[03:39:54.822 --> 03:40:05.327]  So instead of actually making the point to the UN that they're wrong, we thought, well look, if they're not sharing data on temperature, why can't we get them to share data on everything else?
[03:40:05.327 --> 03:40:08.629]  So we sent an open letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations
[03:40:09.031 --> 03:40:16.176]  And it's interesting that the project actually started about a month ago, before the CRU scandal, you know, the climate gate.
[03:40:16.176 --> 03:40:19.959]  And at that time, you know, we were getting signature a day or something like that.
[03:40:19.959 --> 03:40:24.443]  But after the scandal in England, we've been swamped with signatures.
[03:40:24.443 --> 03:40:33.309]  We've been getting hundreds of signatures of leading scientists from around the world who are now saying, well, if that data was wrong and manipulated, we want to see all the data.
[03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:38.173]  So I went through the list and, you know, some of them are leading experts, but they're not.
[03:40:38.553 --> 03:40:50.000]  Not necessarily climate experts, so I pulled out 150 of them who actually are climate experts from 17 different countries who are now demanding that the data be released in a whole range of fields.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:41:05.269]  And it's going to be very interesting to see what the UN do, because in some cases, like their polar bear scare, the data shows that the population has more than doubled since 1960, and that they've been around for about 70,000 years, during which time it was hotter than they're forecasting for the 21st century.
[03:41:06.465 --> 03:41:10.646]  So it's going to be tough for the UN to answer our challenge.
[03:41:10.646 --> 03:41:12.047]  Well, absolutely.
[03:41:12.047 --> 03:41:27.051]  I'm sure you've been following that in New Zealand and Australia and Canada, NOAA, NASA, other universities are being caught fixing the data along with the IPCC, that the UN had this strategy, that people were already trying to get
[03:41:27.551 --> 03:41:28.031]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[03:41:28.031 --> 03:41:30.713]  And I think that if they do start to respond to our challenge,
[03:41:56.942 --> 03:42:12.352]  You know, in a way it would be good because, from our point of view, it would be good because then we can find more of these flaws, but the fact that the UN probably won't respond to our challenge is actually an admission of guilt, because if you think about it, this data was collected with public money.
[03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:22.379]  It shouldn't have been 17 years of trying to get the data before a whistleblower, who is probably the cause of this, not a leaker, not a hacker.
[03:42:22.379 --> 03:42:26.001]  It shouldn't have taken 17 years to get the basic data that was
[03:42:26.365 --> 03:42:28.247]  Well, I mean, you talk about polar bears.
[03:42:28.247 --> 03:42:29.849]  I have seen on television
[03:42:47.648 --> 03:42:55.170]  They're teaching children that penguins are drowning when it's an aquatic bird that can barely walk and can't fly because it's meant to swim.
[03:42:55.170 --> 03:43:01.552]  Polar bears, the greatest land-swimming animal, routinely swim over 100 miles, have been recorded to swim over 300.
[03:43:01.552 --> 03:43:02.653]  They hunt on ice packs.
[03:43:04.113 --> 03:43:09.500]  But just two weeks ago, Austin News said the polar bears are all dying, they're drowning.
[03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:15.087]  They showed video of them floating on ice packs, where they're out killing seals in Beluga.
[03:43:15.087 --> 03:43:22.297]  The fraud of the hockey stick, the fraud of carbon dioxide, simultaneously with temperature rise when it comes, as you know, hundreds of years after.
[03:43:22.817 --> 03:43:27.279]  I mean, everything these people say, the oceans will turn into acid, acid rain.
[03:43:27.279 --> 03:43:35.663]  In the 70s, Holdren said we had to put out giant terraforming factories to double CO2 or we'd be in an ice age by 2000.
[03:43:35.663 --> 03:43:43.486]  I mean, the level of fraudulent quackery is just, this is clearly the greatest scientific fraud in history.
[03:43:43.486 --> 03:43:46.728]  Can you comment on that and then what you're witnessing in Copenhagen?
[03:43:47.884 --> 03:43:49.064]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[03:43:49.064 --> 03:43:55.806]  I mean, obviously, there were big scientific frauds in history, like thinking the Earth was flat, and that six-sevenths of the Earth was covered with land.
[03:43:55.806 --> 03:44:00.367]  There were lots of frauds, but I don't think any of them have cost the world as much as this one.
[03:44:00.367 --> 03:44:03.348]  I mean, this one, they're talking about literally trillions of dollars.
[03:44:03.348 --> 03:44:09.669]  You know, if OECD countries followed Kyoto, the cost, it's estimated, would be about a trillion dollars a year.
[03:44:10.379 --> 03:44:18.764]  And that would mean that for one year's of Kyoto expenditure, they could actually fix the freshwater drinking problem in Africa virtually forever.
[03:44:18.764 --> 03:44:25.047]  And right now there's about 5 million people a year, mostly children, who die in Africa due to bad drinking water.
[03:44:25.047 --> 03:44:28.789]  And that problem could be solved with one year's expenditure on Kyoto.
[03:44:28.789 --> 03:44:35.233]  So independent of, you know, your politics, one of the points we're trying to make is that this is just a bad use of money.
[03:44:35.233 --> 03:44:36.854]  So we're trying to expand the tent.
[03:44:37.276 --> 03:44:48.519]  Not just for right-wing or center, but we're also trying to attract left-wingers, which we're slowly doing, because, you know, left, right, or center, nobody wants to throw a trillion dollars a year down the drain, although sometimes I wonder.
[03:44:48.519 --> 03:44:57.161]  But regardless, we're finding that one of the reasons we haven't been winning up to this point is because we only are attracting our traditional allies.
[03:44:57.543 --> 03:45:03.648]  You know, people like yourself and others who think about the issues, but also people who generally tend to be a bit right-of-center.
[03:45:03.648 --> 03:45:08.252]  But if we're going to win this debate, we have to get a lot more people on our side.
[03:45:08.252 --> 03:45:09.953]  We have to make allies with people.
[03:45:09.953 --> 03:45:14.657]  Well, sir, I agree, but I mean, the way to reach out to the left, and I'm past the left-right paradigm.
[03:45:14.657 --> 03:45:15.518]  I'm more of a libertarian.
[03:45:16.238 --> 03:45:32.730]  And just a realist is conservatively we're talking about millions and millions of people dying a year of a fraction of these carbon cuts are made and now we learn in the draft treaty that third world has to make close to double the cuts of the first world.
[03:45:33.490 --> 03:45:39.956]  I mean, even if the left, you just believe this would be a big money grab to help the third world, it has nothing to do with that.
[03:45:39.956 --> 03:45:47.343]  It's an insider trading carbon derivative system developed by Ken Lay.
[03:45:47.343 --> 03:45:50.126]  I mean, this is just a giant carnival scam.
[03:45:50.897 --> 03:45:56.340]  One of the things that people forget is that there's a lot of investment firms who have invested billions of dollars.
[03:45:56.340 --> 03:46:06.727]  I won't mention the names because I don't want to get sued, but the bottom line is I said to one of the carbon brokers the other day, I said, such and such a company has bought a billion dollars worth of carbon credits.
[03:46:06.727 --> 03:46:07.587]  Now, they don't need them.
[03:46:07.587 --> 03:46:09.448]  They're just doing it on speculation.
[03:46:09.448 --> 03:46:11.990]  So they want to see the climate scare continue.
[03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:14.612]  And he said to me, oh, a billion dollars, that's nothing.
[03:46:14.612 --> 03:46:16.893]  A lot of companies have invested a lot more than that.
[03:46:17.341 --> 03:46:23.586]  And so what you're finding is that some organizations are actually helping fund scare movies.
[03:46:23.586 --> 03:46:27.950]  For example, The 11th Hour by Leonardo DiCaprio, which is like a super Al Gore film.
[03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:29.712]  It's even more exaggerated.
[03:46:29.712 --> 03:46:35.096]  That's actually being funded in part by Swiss Re, which are one of the world's largest insurance companies.
[03:46:35.096 --> 03:46:38.719]  And you have to say, well, why would they fund a climate scare video?
[03:46:38.719 --> 03:46:40.061]  Well, of course, the answer is obvious.
[03:46:40.061 --> 03:46:44.124]  If people think that there's massive climate problems coming, they're going to buy more insurance.
[03:46:44.124 --> 03:46:45.205]  They can raise the premiums.
[03:46:45.566 --> 03:46:50.427]  And so what you're seeing is an enormous vested interest in actually keeping the scare alive.
[03:46:50.427 --> 03:46:55.288]  And that's a scary thing, because how long can the scare continue if the data's wrong?
[03:46:55.288 --> 03:46:59.749]  Well, it might continue for quite a long time if there's enough people funding it.
[03:46:59.749 --> 03:47:08.771]  And that's basically what it comes down to, I think, is that there is billions to be made, even, you know, as some people say, hundreds of billions, if, in fact, the scare continues.
[03:47:08.771 --> 03:47:12.752]  So if scientists laugh, you know, at the conference that we organized, or helped organize,
[03:47:13.355 --> 03:47:17.778]  They said, how long does it have to cool before politicians stop calling it global warming?
[03:47:18.317 --> 03:47:26.539]  Well, actually, it might cool for a long time, and that's what many of the scientists are saying, but the scare may continue anyways, because there's so much money behind it.
[03:47:26.539 --> 03:47:27.440]  That's a good question.
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:37.022]  You're talking to a lot of top, real, non-political climatologists, and, you know, the sun, they say, is the main driver, but also this nuclei coming out of space.
[03:47:37.022 --> 03:47:38.743]  There's a lot of other things going on.
[03:47:38.743 --> 03:47:44.724]  It does appear that most of the climatologists we reach say, no, actually, it's a normal cooling trend.
[03:47:44.724 --> 03:47:47.285]  What is the majority view of the scientists you're talking to?
[03:47:48.237 --> 03:47:50.938]  Well, the majority view is that they don't know.
[03:47:50.938 --> 03:47:52.318]  They have various theories.
[03:47:52.318 --> 03:47:53.578]  It's kind of like a bell curve.
[03:47:53.578 --> 03:47:58.540]  There's very few on the side that say, we are definitely not causing any climate change.
[03:47:58.540 --> 03:48:01.420]  There's very few on the side that say that we're causing all of it.
[03:48:01.420 --> 03:48:06.182]  It's more of a distribution in the middle where the vast majority of them say, well, we don't know.
[03:48:06.182 --> 03:48:07.822]  The science is so immature.
[03:48:07.822 --> 03:48:09.323]  You know, take clouds, for example.
[03:48:09.323 --> 03:48:14.704]  Clouds are a hundred times more influential on climate than humans, all like human activity combined.
[03:48:15.140 --> 03:48:24.628]  And yet, it was only 10 years ago that we thought the net impact of clouds was to contribute to global warming because, of course, it's water vapor and that's a greenhouse gas.
[03:48:24.628 --> 03:48:32.754]  But recently, they've found that, in fact, clouds are a net cooling agent because they reflect more of the sunlight into space than they actually trap in the atmosphere.
[03:48:32.754 --> 03:48:40.280]  So not only have they changed the magnitude of the cloud impact, which, as I say, is far more than humans, but they've even changed the sign.
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:42.622]  So the whole concept of the science is settled.
[03:48:42.992 --> 03:48:43.272]  I think so.
[03:49:00.174 --> 03:49:02.576]  Yeah, this is incredibly complex.
[03:49:02.576 --> 03:49:07.319]  We're a giant planet hurtling through deep space orbiting a gigantic sun.
[03:49:07.319 --> 03:49:16.365]  And they're saying that humans exhaling five and a half pounds or flatulence from bovine that have always been on the planet are deadly.
[03:49:16.365 --> 03:49:17.686]  Oh, but a tax will save us.
[03:49:18.396 --> 03:49:18.956]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:49:18.956 --> 03:49:20.897]  I mean, a lot of this stuff is absurd.
[03:49:20.897 --> 03:49:27.021]  And the sad thing is that many conservatives who actually know it's wrong are saying the wrong thing.
[03:49:27.021 --> 03:49:34.305]  You know, the Conservative Party in Canada, for example, before they came into power, they said they were going to get to the bottom of the climate change Kyoto scare.
[03:49:34.895 --> 03:49:42.240]  Once they got into power, their spin doctors clearly told them they could get more votes if they just changed their tune and said the same thing as Al Gore.
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:49.824]  And so that's what they've done, and I'm really ashamed as a Canadian to have our government saying things they know very well are completely wrong.
[03:49:49.824 --> 03:49:59.470]  We find that it's strange, but with the Liberal government before our current Conservative government, they would allow the occasional climate skeptic to come into committee hearings to testify.
[03:49:59.830 --> 03:50:05.735]  But ever since this supposedly conservative government has come in, they've actually closed the door totally.
[03:50:05.735 --> 03:50:08.397]  Oh yeah, look at Newt Gingrich, look at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[03:50:08.397 --> 03:50:10.779]  This is not a partisan issue.
[03:50:10.779 --> 03:50:16.503]  It's an issue of people that want to regulate and control our economy and vertically integrate it.
[03:50:16.503 --> 03:50:17.704]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:50:17.704 --> 03:50:24.209]  And it's also an issue of a lack of courage on the part of many politicians who know that people like Senator Inhofe are right.
[03:50:24.856 --> 03:50:26.718]  A lot of politicians know that.
[03:50:26.718 --> 03:50:33.286]  I've talked to many of the MPs in Canada behind closed doors, and they know it's a scam, but they're afraid to say it.
[03:50:33.286 --> 03:50:35.889]  And we need a lot more courage and leadership in our government.
[03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:40.011]  Well, I agree with you, sir.
[03:50:40.011 --> 03:50:45.133]  We're going to go to break and come back with a final segment on the other side, so please stay with us.
[03:50:45.133 --> 03:50:52.615]  Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition, is our guest.
[03:50:52.615 --> 03:51:00.258]  We'll talk about what he's witnessing in Copenhagen and if the climate gate information is disturbing this globalist event.
[03:51:00.258 --> 03:51:03.379]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:03.379 --> 03:51:04.540]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.387 --> 03:51:11.150]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.150 --> 03:51:12.511]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.511 --> 03:51:15.132]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.132 --> 03:51:21.575]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.575 --> 03:51:22.836]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.776 --> 03:51:28.061]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.061 --> 03:51:32.946]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:32.946 --> 03:51:37.851]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:37.851 --> 03:51:42.675]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.596 --> 03:51:51.999]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:51.999 --> 03:51:54.500]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:57.581]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:51:57.581 --> 03:52:00.482]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:52:03.101 --> 03:52:07.124]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.124 --> 03:52:10.366]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.366 --> 03:52:15.169]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.169 --> 03:52:21.553]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.553 --> 03:52:23.795]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:52:24.375 --> 03:52:26.736]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.736 --> 03:52:29.998]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:29.998 --> 03:52:36.842]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.842 --> 03:52:39.204]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.204 --> 03:52:40.785]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.785 --> 03:52:43.246]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.246 --> 03:52:45.367]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.367 --> 03:52:50.030]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.490 --> 03:53:03.221]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:54:32.629 --> 03:54:39.314]  Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set up to counter the IPCC.
[03:54:39.994 --> 03:55:01.327]  We've only got about five minutes left right now, sir, and so I'd like to talk about what you're witnessing, what the mood is there, how Climategate is affecting the different 191 countries there, how the Danish text, doubling the cuts for the third world, resulting in just genocidal starvation, what the mood is there right now.
[03:55:02.386 --> 03:55:13.394]  Well, I think you have to realize, first of all, that both India and China have stated off and on throughout the whole year that they have no intention of restricting their economic growth to cut carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
[03:55:13.394 --> 03:55:19.799]  So, I think the chances that they would have agreed to even a more benign treaty on their part were pretty slim to begin with.
[03:55:19.799 --> 03:55:23.862]  And also, in India, we're starting to see the growth of a lot of climate skepticism.
[03:55:23.862 --> 03:55:29.906]  You know, many of the Indian glaciologists, for example, are completely rebutting the UN on Himalayan glaciers.
[03:55:30.356 --> 03:55:34.138]  So, in India, I had an interview today, actually, with an Indian journalist.
[03:55:34.138 --> 03:55:37.919]  We're seeing the rise of climate skepticism like you've never seen it before.
[03:55:37.919 --> 03:55:45.562]  And I think that what's going to happen is that with these increased demands on the third world, they're just going to turn the whole thing down flatly.
[03:55:45.562 --> 03:55:48.864]  And, you know, it's interesting because in the United States, I understand that
[03:55:49.684 --> 03:55:54.768]  Even the Democrats are saying that without agreement from China and India, they're just simply not going to go ahead.
[03:55:54.768 --> 03:55:56.469]  But that's the problem!
[03:55:56.469 --> 03:56:03.553]  We have the AP headline, White House threatens command and control, says EPA will override Congress.
[03:56:03.553 --> 03:56:06.575]  That is putting the cart before the horse.
[03:56:06.575 --> 03:56:08.096]  That is tyranny.
[03:56:08.096 --> 03:56:09.137]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:56:09.137 --> 03:56:10.498]  But you know, I think that's pressure.
[03:56:10.498 --> 03:56:15.041]  A pressure tactic to try to get them to pass Kerry Boxer.
[03:56:15.041 --> 03:56:16.101]  And it might succeed.
[03:56:16.101 --> 03:56:17.022]  The trouble is, of course,
[03:56:17.729 --> 03:56:23.555]  What do you do with all those cheap imports that are coming from countries that are fed to heck with greenhouse gas controls?
[03:56:23.555 --> 03:56:26.638]  I mean, it's just a death sentence for the American economy.
[03:56:26.638 --> 03:56:27.879]  Exactly!
[03:56:27.879 --> 03:56:31.523]  As an engineer, let's say carbon dioxide is a deadly nerve gas.
[03:56:31.523 --> 03:56:32.984]  It kills all plants and animals.
[03:56:32.984 --> 03:56:34.446]  Polar bears can't swim.
[03:56:34.446 --> 03:56:35.246]  Everyone's dying.
[03:56:35.246 --> 03:56:36.287]  Pay all your money to Al Gore.
[03:56:36.287 --> 03:56:37.208]  He will save you.
[03:56:37.208 --> 03:56:38.810]  He's the eco-profit.
[03:56:38.810 --> 03:56:39.811]  Let's say that's all true.
[03:56:41.152 --> 03:56:46.975]  You only put carbon controls on the West, it moves to China, India, Mexico, where they have no controls.
[03:56:46.975 --> 03:56:56.540]  Overall, the devil gas, the man-bear-pig gas, that's a South Park episode if you don't know, sir, increases, increases, then we're all dead!
[03:56:56.540 --> 03:56:58.461]  I mean, it'll kill us!
[03:56:58.461 --> 03:57:03.143]  One of the craziest things is China passed the United States in net carbon dioxide emissions in 2007.
[03:57:05.134 --> 03:57:14.097]  And even without these kinds of international agreements, you know, even if they just allowed them to continue to grow, they're going to be double the United States within about 20 years.
[03:57:14.097 --> 03:57:20.218]  So, in fact, if you don't get them on side, the CO2 emissions for the world are going to virtually stay unchanged.
[03:57:20.218 --> 03:57:22.039]  I mean, they're going to continue to rise, I should say.
[03:57:22.492 --> 03:57:29.335]  But, you know, one of the important things to realize is that throughout the world, there's countries who are now starting behind closed doors.
[03:57:29.335 --> 03:57:32.176]  Saudi Arabia did it, actually, in the UN meeting.
[03:57:32.176 --> 03:57:40.739]  They're starting to look at the ClimateGate data, and they're starting to say, this is actually a social engineering project more than it is environmental.
[03:57:40.739 --> 03:57:45.961]  And we've heard within the Canadian government people telling me, look, it has nothing to do with environment anymore.
[03:57:45.961 --> 03:57:46.661]  It's all politics.
[03:57:47.285 --> 03:57:49.267]  Sir, you're a very influential man.
[03:57:49.267 --> 03:57:52.270]  Let me just... I want to mail you a copy of my film, Endgame.
[03:57:52.270 --> 03:57:56.294]  Sir, they admit at the UN this is eugenics.
[03:57:56.294 --> 03:58:02.099]  They want to cut... Maurice Strong, the head guy, says it's to destroy industrial society.
[03:58:02.099 --> 03:58:03.801]  And we need to... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:58:04.369 --> 03:58:08.830]  Yeah, Kyoto is the flagship of the world governance program.
[03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:10.311]  I mean, you can see that very clearly.
[03:58:10.311 --> 03:58:14.532]  If you control the world's CO2, you're controlling most of the world's energy.
[03:58:14.532 --> 03:58:24.495]  And if you're controlling the world's energy, just as Russia demonstrated when they turned off the taps on the natural gas supply to Europe, you basically control whoever is at the other end of the tap.
[03:58:24.495 --> 03:58:29.496]  All right, reporting to us from Copenhagen, Tom Harris, climatescienceinternational.org.
[03:58:29.496 --> 03:58:30.056]  Thank you, sir.
