[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.780]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.780 --> 00:16.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.900 --> 00:33.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.420 --> 00:38.760]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us on this 10th day
[00:38.760 --> 00:45.140]  of December, this Thursday, the 10th day of December, 2009, we're going to be live here
[00:45.140 --> 00:48.820]  for the next four hours.
[00:48.820 --> 00:54.540]  We're going to have Patrick Henningson on location in Copenhagen, join us again for
[00:54.540 --> 00:59.740]  a quick report on the latest developments, G. Edward Griffin in studio.
[00:59.740 --> 01:06.900]  And we've just talked to Lord Christopher Monkton, we are 99% have him locked down.
[01:06.900 --> 01:12.380]  We're just debating the best time to have him pop in today to talk about the aftermath
[01:12.380 --> 01:17.700]  of what went on earlier today in Denmark.
[01:17.700 --> 01:23.620]  Climate Denier calls U.S. activist Hitler youth as Americans for prosperity protest.
[01:23.620 --> 01:28.780]  So you've got a George Soros backed group, and this is being reported on in the George
[01:28.780 --> 01:36.740]  Soros funded Huffington Post, this is a guy that funds fake revolutions all over the world.
[01:36.740 --> 01:41.180]  Showing up and taking over Lord Christopher Monkton's speech.
[01:41.180 --> 01:48.060]  Now notice we are change will politely go up during book signings or during press conferences
[01:48.060 --> 01:53.740]  and we'll ask questions and the media demonizes them, calls them ruffians, security guards
[01:53.740 --> 01:59.260]  in many cases, rough them up, beat them up, police arrest them for politely asking questions.
[01:59.260 --> 02:04.580]  And then as they're being drug out, they loudly say that climate gate is a complete
[02:04.580 --> 02:11.160]  fraud that man made climate changes in real and it's a giant tax and spend global bureaucracy.
[02:11.160 --> 02:15.900]  But these guys just come in, take over the stage, goes on for 20 minutes screaming and
[02:15.900 --> 02:21.420]  everyone doing whatever they want, and it's the same old little yuppies in their thousand
[02:21.420 --> 02:27.540]  dollar suits flown in on private jets to carry out their George Soros operations.
[02:27.540 --> 02:31.420]  And these people you see protesting Lord Monkton, they'll all be running cities.
[02:31.420 --> 02:35.980]  They're going to be all literally in your house, in your farm, in your ranch, all over
[02:35.980 --> 02:36.980]  the country.
[02:36.980 --> 02:40.900]  These types have been caught moving into property they take.
[02:40.900 --> 02:46.500]  And so when Lord Monkton calls them Nazis, when he calls them Hitler youth, that is
[02:46.500 --> 02:51.300]  exactly what the Hitler youth would do is they would come shut down the speeches of
[02:51.300 --> 02:54.980]  minority groups standing up against Hitler.
[02:54.980 --> 03:00.060]  And of course in Copenhagen, it is the minority group in their little tiny hotel down the
[03:00.060 --> 03:03.580]  street from the billions of dollars being spent on the globalists and their private
[03:03.580 --> 03:12.340]  jets and half the police force of the country of Denmark, they're protecting them.
[03:12.340 --> 03:18.580]  Meanwhile, it's come out that Bilderberg founder Prince Bernhard tried to overthrow Indonesia
[03:18.580 --> 03:21.400]  and set himself up as viceroy.
[03:21.400 --> 03:26.580]  This is the founder of the World Wildlife Fund and one of the real Nazis that want to use
[03:26.580 --> 03:30.500]  environmentalism as a pretext to reduce the world's population.
[03:30.500 --> 03:32.940]  What do you think Hitler spoke about?
[03:32.940 --> 03:41.980]  And so you do have these brown shirts in there shutting down the event.
[03:41.980 --> 03:44.980]  And they're very, very proud of themselves.
[03:44.980 --> 03:50.860]  But that's good news that they're attacking Monkton because Monkton is effective and is
[03:50.860 --> 03:57.500]  hurting them because he's traveling all over the world going on radio and TV and doing
[03:57.500 --> 04:02.940]  print interviews pointing out the fraud that the Algorites told us the ocean was going
[04:02.940 --> 04:07.940]  to turn into acid, acid rain, told us the earth was going to be an ice age, then heating,
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.940]  global warming.
[04:08.940 --> 04:13.300]  Now it's just climate change, any change is the end of the world.
[04:13.300 --> 04:19.540]  Sea levels are going to rise by hundreds of feet, just asinine baloney and the entire
[04:19.540 --> 04:26.500]  cover up of Algor running around saying that the man bear pig is going to get us.
[04:26.500 --> 04:34.780]  Half man, half bear, half pig, man bear pig and only I can save you.
[04:34.780 --> 04:43.820]  Only I, Algor, pay me taxes and I will save you.
[04:43.820 --> 04:52.100]  Yes, let me micromanage and run your life and I will save you.
[04:52.100 --> 04:56.300]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break to break
[04:56.300 --> 04:59.980]  down the latest on climate gain.
[04:59.980 --> 05:04.620]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[05:04.620 --> 05:05.620]  you to eat.
[05:05.620 --> 05:09.140]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[05:09.140 --> 05:12.100]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[05:12.100 --> 05:15.220]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[05:15.220 --> 05:18.620]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[05:18.620 --> 05:23.420]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[05:36.060 --> 05:37.060]  ranger.

[05:41.780 --> 05:42.980]  immune system.

[06:59.780 --> 07:04.420]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[07:04.420 --> 07:08.780]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[07:08.780 --> 07:13.100]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[07:13.100 --> 07:14.380]  allows you to have.
[07:14.380 --> 07:15.380]  It's true.
[07:15.380 --> 07:20.100]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[07:20.100 --> 07:24.420]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[07:24.420 --> 07:28.420]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[07:28.420 --> 07:31.940]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[07:31.940 --> 07:35.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[07:35.620 --> 07:40.420]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[07:40.420 --> 07:44.140]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[07:44.140 --> 07:45.540]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[07:45.540 --> 07:49.780]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[07:49.780 --> 07:51.380]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[07:51.380 --> 08:01.980]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[08:01.980 --> 08:08.540]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.540 --> 08:14.140]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:14.140 --> 08:18.540]  It looks like Lord Moncton can probably only come on in the middle of G.E.E.B.
[08:18.540 --> 08:20.220]  We're Griffin, but that's fine.
[08:20.220 --> 08:21.780]  We'll just have him on together.
[08:21.780 --> 08:28.980]  I'm working on getting Lord Moncton on earlier than that, not in the last hour or so.
[08:28.980 --> 08:33.620]  Dealing with brown shirt youth corps invade Moncton's speech.
[08:33.620 --> 08:39.260]  So George Soros is sending in his pirates, not to ask real questions in a press conference.
[08:39.260 --> 08:43.340]  See, we are changed, trying to go to press conferences and ask questions, and the press
[08:43.340 --> 08:49.140]  can ask questions as long as they don't question Climate Gate or Al Gore being caught lying
[08:49.140 --> 08:52.700]  about carbon dioxide levels going up and then temperature going up.
[08:52.700 --> 08:57.660]  When on record, he now has been forced to admit carbon dioxide goes up after temperatures
[08:57.660 --> 08:59.260]  go up.
[08:59.260 --> 09:04.860]  When we are changed, tries to ask nice questions like, sir, what do you think of Climate Gate?
[09:04.860 --> 09:09.220]  They literally have their security guards or police physically grab you and start dragging
[09:09.220 --> 09:10.220]  you out.
[09:10.220 --> 09:13.660]  Then we are changed begins to yell.
[09:13.660 --> 09:14.660]  This is a fraud.
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.660]  This is a lie.
[09:15.660 --> 09:19.820]  Same thing with the Tea Parties and other great groups.
[09:19.820 --> 09:22.900]  Brown shirt youth corps invade Moncton's speech.
[09:22.900 --> 09:24.860]  They tried to shut it down.
[09:24.860 --> 09:32.380]  Hitler youth attempt to crush freedom of speech while chanting cult like environmental mantras.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.380]  You know what?
[09:33.380 --> 09:35.220]  These are Hitler youth.
[09:35.220 --> 09:38.980]  They are real live Hitler youth.
[09:38.980 --> 09:41.060]  I have actually studied Hitler.
[09:41.060 --> 09:42.620]  I have actually read his speeches.
[09:42.620 --> 09:45.340]  I have actually read Mein Kampf or my struggle.
[09:45.340 --> 09:49.100]  I have actually studied the mindset of the Nazis.
[09:49.100 --> 09:56.380]  They were radical vegetarian environmentalists that wanted to set up a planetary government
[09:56.380 --> 10:06.620]  and then carry out the orderly extermination of the population.
[10:06.620 --> 10:15.620]  And on record, Brazil, the United States and just a few other major grain producers going
[10:15.620 --> 10:22.540]  to ethanol, Brazil more than a third, the U.S. a third of its fields used for ethanol
[10:22.540 --> 10:28.180]  production, directed by the federal government, told to do it, said told by the U.N. it was
[10:28.180 --> 10:33.900]  great and it turns out it's doubled world food prices and it's caused millions and
[10:33.900 --> 10:37.900]  millions of people conservatively to starve to death.
[10:37.900 --> 10:39.860]  Regularly 15 million starve to death a year.
[10:39.860 --> 10:43.260]  They are now reported that 20 million starve to death last year is going to be even worse
[10:43.260 --> 10:44.260]  this year.
[10:44.260 --> 10:48.100]  So, hey, I call starving a couple million people to death or five million people to
[10:48.100 --> 10:49.100]  death.
[10:49.100 --> 10:51.340]  I call that pretty Hitlerian.
[10:51.340 --> 10:57.500]  It's almost more Stalinesque, though, or Maoist Maoist Mao would just shut your food off.
[10:57.500 --> 11:01.460]  Now didn't let people grow crops and took them into centralized factories.
[11:01.460 --> 11:06.580]  And the Chinese government says 86 million died.
[11:06.580 --> 11:10.980]  The U.S. textbooks say 64 million.
[11:10.980 --> 11:12.180]  It's over 60 mil.
[11:12.180 --> 11:20.020]  The Chinese government admits, oh, yes, we killed 80 plus mil, 80 plus mil, okay?
[11:20.020 --> 11:21.900]  And they don't care how many millions they kill.
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.900]  In fact, they want to kill them.
[11:23.900 --> 11:28.300]  And there's all these new books and documents finally hitting mainstream news where Paul
[11:28.300 --> 11:33.660]  Ehrlich and John P. Holdren and all these top Obama people wrote books and white papers
[11:33.660 --> 11:38.300]  about how they wanted to exterminate the majority of the population and forcibly sterilize everybody
[11:38.300 --> 11:43.920]  and drug everyone and do all of this.
[11:43.920 --> 11:46.620]  It is unbelievable.
[11:46.620 --> 11:51.380]  And so, yes, these are Hitler youth.
[11:51.380 --> 11:55.340]  Hitler youth attempt to crush freedom of speech while chanting cult-like environmental slogans,
[11:55.340 --> 12:01.020]  groups of adjutant green youth cores invaded the stage during word-moncted speech at an
[12:01.020 --> 12:04.020]  American for Prosperity event in Copenhagen yesterday.
[12:04.020 --> 12:06.260]  Now, again, they just took over the whole event.
[12:06.260 --> 12:08.260]  They just shut it down.
[12:08.260 --> 12:12.680]  All we are changing, all I want is for people to be able to ask questions of this liar and
[12:12.680 --> 12:14.900]  confront him and take over media coverage.
[12:14.900 --> 12:15.900]  Not these guys.
[12:15.900 --> 12:17.620]  They wanted to shut down the speech.
[12:17.620 --> 12:22.460]  And remember, the London Guardian government officials, Lord Moncton's named him by name,
[12:22.460 --> 12:26.140]  they have called, it's in the article, for his arrest and execution.
[12:26.140 --> 12:29.780]  They want to kill Lord Moncton.
[12:29.780 --> 12:34.140]  They want to kill climatologist Dr. Timothy Ball.
[12:34.140 --> 12:38.340]  They openly say, execute us for treason.
[12:38.340 --> 12:43.380]  Now, we are changed, doesn't want to kill Al Gore.
[12:43.380 --> 12:44.780]  We want him to go to prison for fraud.
[12:44.780 --> 12:49.180]  He's been caught in fraud and swindles.
[12:49.180 --> 12:53.420]  I'm going to cover this, but I want to play some of the audio from the intro.
[12:53.420 --> 13:02.420]  I want to play it from the intro as the group putting it on, introduce Lord Moncton.
[13:02.420 --> 13:08.020]  And then they come in and take over the event.
[13:08.020 --> 13:14.620]  So here it is that I'm going to come back and comment on these modern day Nazis jackbooting
[13:14.620 --> 13:20.300]  free speech by the little minority group there in Copenhagen trying to counter all the slick
[13:20.300 --> 13:26.060]  globalist power and money and glitz openly setting up world government, doubling the amount
[13:26.060 --> 13:29.940]  of taxes on the third world through carbon tax that the first world's going to be under.
[13:29.940 --> 13:32.460]  I always told you that bait and switch was going to happen.
[13:32.460 --> 13:33.460]  Here it is.
[13:33.460 --> 13:34.460]  Good afternoon, Philadelphia.
[13:34.460 --> 13:35.460]  Good evening here in Copenhagen.
[13:35.460 --> 13:43.780]  We have a great crowd of folks here in Copenhagen, an intrepid band of free market activists
[13:43.780 --> 13:44.780]  who are joining us.
[13:44.780 --> 13:48.060]  Copenhagen has been an eye-opener for me.
[13:48.060 --> 13:53.420]  I have to tell you, having never attended a United Nations sponsored conference, I kind
[13:53.420 --> 13:58.020]  of hope this is my last one, I believe, but it's been an eye-opener for us.
[13:58.020 --> 14:05.020]  We could have watched these men across the country really, and I'll tell you this, it's
[14:05.020 --> 14:08.020]  interesting that we're there.
[14:08.020 --> 14:35.020]  We are the United States top, we are the United States top, we are the United States top,
[14:35.020 --> 14:51.020]  we are the United States top, we are the United States top, we are the United States top,
[14:51.020 --> 14:54.780]  we are the United States a revolution.
[14:54.780 --> 14:55.880]  This is the end of the revolution.
[14:55.880 --> 14:56.880]  We are the United States a revolution.
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.880]  This is what the United States top is.
[14:57.880 --> 14:58.880]  2很長長的確來了.
[14:58.880 --> 15:04.400]  youth, they know no climate science, they know nothing. You are listening now to the
[15:04.400 --> 15:12.400]  shouts in the background of the Hitler youth who have sprayed those Copenhagen with green
[15:12.400 --> 15:18.280]  slogans of our childishness and pacific.
[15:18.280 --> 15:29.600]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.640]  There you have it, shutting down free speech, completely dominating it, mainstream media
[15:34.640 --> 15:39.480]  there, giggling and laughing, all part of the staged event.
[15:39.480 --> 15:44.080]  Brown shirt, youth cores, invade, monk and speech.
[15:44.080 --> 15:50.400]  Now George Soros is copying our tactics, but taking it up about 10 notches. If we are change
[15:50.400 --> 15:55.560]  ever tried or the tea parties ever tried to take over the stage, police would probably
[15:55.560 --> 15:56.560]  gun them down.
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.800]  I mean, they would call it a terror attack on the news, but these little scallywags, these
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.840]  little gutter snipes, these collectivists that literally want to move into your house
[16:06.840 --> 16:11.840]  and kick their feet up on your desk. They want you out under machine gun point, laboring
[16:11.840 --> 16:14.200]  for them in the fields. I'm not kidding.
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.440]  These people are parasites. They know what they're doing. You know, you heard a real
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.960]  environmentalist who was on with us yesterday who was part of all this and then found out
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.520]  it was all a scam, found out it was all about making money.
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.360]  I have been to smart growth conferences and they just laugh and go, of course they were
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.520]  taking over the land and the money. I mean, literally in press conferences, they just
[16:38.520 --> 16:43.320]  laugh about it because this was back in the late 1990s when they were really on top of
[16:43.320 --> 16:49.040]  things before anybody was standing up to him. And it was all bankers, all business people,
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.320]  just laughing, just absolutely laughing.
[16:53.320 --> 17:03.360]  Somewhere we've got the video of my interview with Michael Dell. He gave a press conference
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.040]  and I went up and talked to him about the globalization, new water plan, land grabbing.
[17:08.040 --> 17:11.800]  He just laughed at me. I said, I've got reports. You're planning to move your factories to
[17:11.800 --> 17:16.840]  China and he said, Oh, another conspiracy theory, Alex, I aired that on TV. The Austin
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.160]  Chronicle wrote about it. So it's on record that I have that interview, but in the past
[17:21.160 --> 17:26.600]  that was no, no real cataloging of anything was just thrown in giant piles. Somebody should
[17:26.600 --> 17:33.900]  dig out all that stuff and get it on the web, but I'm already digressing here at Huffington
[17:33.900 --> 17:38.240]  Post write up the incident attempts to characterize Moncton as the villain of the story because
[17:38.240 --> 17:43.200]  he called the teenage brown certs out for what they were crazed Hitler, Eugen, the youth
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.120]  activists representing a number of youth action groups, including sustain us, the Sierra
[17:48.120 --> 17:53.800]  Student Coalition. I mean, that's all Rockefeller Soros, the Cascade climate network, Rockefeller
[17:53.800 --> 18:01.520]  Soros and other American youth NGOs. That means kept creatures of the UN kicked off the protest
[18:01.520 --> 18:06.520]  by holding banners in front of the camera reading climate disaster ahead and clean energy. Now
[18:06.520 --> 18:12.280]  would that be the ice age or the acid rain or would that be the ocean turning into acid
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.720]  or would that be the global warming? Now it's just climate change. They teach the kids the
[18:16.720 --> 18:22.600]  seasons are abnormal. The activists who are invited delegates to the UN's Copenhagen summit,
[18:22.600 --> 18:26.400]  they get to go in. Nobody else does, but trade the dictatorial agenda of the United Nations
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.680]  and the climate change movement as a whole by having zero tolerance for any dissenting
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.520]  opinion, crashing and shouting down a small conference of people who had merely gathered
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.620]  to present the other side of the debate, who by the way were locked out of the big UN event.
[18:39.620 --> 18:44.680]  They then proceeded to wave plastic American flags made in China before chanting environmental
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.960]  mantras that have no basis whatsoever in reality. We're representing the majority of Americans
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.080]  on this, particularly young Americans, common in one of the brown shirts. No, you don't.
[18:53.080 --> 18:57.200]  In reality is the most recent poll show Americans who think global warming is caused by human
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.280]  activity, including vehicle and industrial emissions are now a minority. We have direct
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.840]  links to the mainstream polls. You are listening now to brown shirts in the background of Hitler
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.520]  youth, said Monkton, as the green thugs interrupted his speech. Monkton mentioned the fact that
[19:10.520 --> 19:16.200]  the same youth corps had green spray painted Copenhagen with our Wellean messages and a
[19:16.200 --> 19:20.200]  frightening throwback to the red, white and black swastikas that littered the city during
[19:20.200 --> 19:26.960]  the time when it was occupied by the Nazis. Another brown shirt, Laura Comert claimed,
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.120]  we're representing the majority of Americans on this, particularly young Americans. The
[19:31.120 --> 19:38.200]  real America wants clean energy, not more fossil fuel funded lies about science. When
[19:38.200 --> 19:42.540]  it's actually the oil companies funding them, in actual fact, the climate gain emails clearly
[19:42.540 --> 19:47.200]  illustrate how the vast majority of big oil money is behind the climate change alarmist,
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.600]  not the skeptics. Indeed, the entire Copenhagen event is sponsored by a consortium of giant
[19:51.600 --> 19:56.600]  corporations that includes British patrolling him and Dutch Royal Shell run and founded
[19:56.600 --> 19:59.240]  by the real Nazi Prince Bernhard.
[20:56.600 --> 21:00.680]  51 eat free to share in the secret.

[21:02.920 --> 21:03.920]  Spy on me?

[22:00.920 --> 22:04.880]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure
[22:04.880 --> 22:10.680]  purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[22:10.680 --> 22:15.600]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system. Wisdom being
[22:15.600 --> 22:20.680]  lost with time. The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[22:20.680 --> 22:26.360]  private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[22:26.360 --> 22:30.320]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[22:30.320 --> 22:34.640]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[22:34.640 --> 22:39.000]  value. Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.520]  reserve currency. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the

[24:22.400 --> 24:31.040]  But they were still moving forward in a ragged fashion, hemorrhaging out as news of the premeditated
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.760]  fraud spreads. And as people go, wait a minute, these are the same folks that got caught lying
[24:35.760 --> 24:43.000]  with the hockey stick graph, faking an increase in temperature that was disproven two years
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.720]  ago. This is the same Al Gore that lied about carbon dioxide going up and then temperature
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.680]  going up when it's the reverse. This is the same Al Gore that says polar bears can't swim.
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.360]  One of the greatest land swimmer. These are the same people that said in the 70s and 80s
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.400]  on the cover of Newsweek and Time, all the stuff's getting dredged back up and put on
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.600]  the internet for everybody to see, saying we would be in an ice age by 2000 if we didn't
[25:06.600 --> 25:13.240]  have taxes to build giant carbon dioxide factories. Guess who said that? White House
[25:13.240 --> 25:19.400]  Science czar, John P. Holdren. He's always wanted to play God and build giant, they
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.960]  call it geoengineering because this planet's already livable. But if we did it on Mars,
[25:22.960 --> 25:29.320]  it's called terraforming. Yes, they wanted a global tax to spray particles into the air
[25:29.320 --> 25:36.040]  to heat the atmosphere on record. And then it started heating in the 90s because it's
[25:36.040 --> 25:42.200]  natural to go up and down. There's all sorts of different cycles that the geological record
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.920]  shows that the ice court record shows that the, uh, they get a lot of evidence from ancient
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.720]  lakes from the mud. It's like tree rings going down through time. They've gone down
[25:54.720 --> 26:03.600]  over 500,000 years in some of the Scottish lakes in the great lakes, lakes that have
[26:03.600 --> 26:09.920]  been there for millions of years. And they, in all the lakes, they can go down in the
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.200]  great lakes. They can go down in Scotland. They can go down in Russia. They can go down
[26:15.200 --> 26:22.880]  into ancient lakes in Africa. They can go down 200, 300, 400, 500,000 years and find
[26:22.880 --> 26:31.880]  carbon dioxide at five, 10, 15, 20 times the level. This is a fact. Humans had nothing
[26:31.880 --> 26:42.880]  to do with this, but they're talking about a one less than a one 2,000th increase. Oh
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.200]  my gosh, we're all dead. Ladies and gentlemen, what are we going to do? It's all over. Oh
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.680]  my gosh, we better pay Al Gore and the UN and the IMF and World Bank a bunch of money.
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.880]  So all their other frauds are coming out and they know it's fraud. They just make up new
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.380]  disasters. But finally, they've put out what six months ago, the New York Times reported
[27:02.380 --> 27:08.240]  a new big think tank policy report that the White House reissued quietly to its staff
[27:08.240 --> 27:13.080]  in the energy department and in the EPA saying, look, we're not going to say warming. We're
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.640]  not going to say cooling anymore. We're going to say climate change and our deteriorating
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.440]  atmosphere. And now suddenly that's all you hear our deteriorating atmosphere, our climate
[27:24.440 --> 27:34.760]  change, climate change on a planetoid hurdling through deep space, orbiting a sun. We're
[27:34.760 --> 27:44.440]  on a giant spacecraft, a giant rock with a molten center. Mountains are thrust up. Giant
[27:44.440 --> 27:52.220]  asteroids hit the planet. We are bathed in high powered radiation. Yes, we are creatures
[27:52.220 --> 27:59.800]  on a planet that developed in a high radiation atmosphere. If aliens from a far away star
[27:59.800 --> 28:04.880]  system came here who hadn't developed right up next to a sun, I mean, we're right up next
[28:04.880 --> 28:12.400]  to a sun, right up next to one in the measurements of space. We are creatures that walk outside
[28:12.400 --> 28:21.040]  and our sun cooks in the radiation. We bathe in radiation. Life formed on this earth in
[28:21.040 --> 28:37.120]  giant volcanoes spewing boiling magma out everywhere. Our atmospheres were methane.
[28:37.120 --> 28:44.280]  The truth is you'd have to blow the planet into bits to kill life on this planet. The
[28:44.280 --> 28:51.400]  truth is this planet has taken thousands of giant impacts of half a mile, mile long,
[28:51.400 --> 28:59.200]  three mile wide giant asteroids rocketing in at 40,000 miles an hour, blowing holes
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.760]  the size of the Gulf of Mexico. That's what the Gulf of Mexico is. It's a meteor impact
[29:03.760 --> 29:12.880]  point where I sit in Austin, Texas when that mega meteor hit the entire of Texas, New Mexico,
[29:12.880 --> 29:23.840]  Guatemala, Honduras has the same ocean rock thrown up as magma. The same rock is everywhere.
[29:23.840 --> 29:30.720]  Boiling magma is everywhere. Now cooled, of course, for millions of years. Where I sit
[29:30.720 --> 29:37.840]  was in thousands of feet of boiling magma from a giant three mile long, huge iron ore
[29:37.840 --> 29:51.040]  meteorite hitting at 40,000 miles an hour. Where Yucatan now stands. Where Cozumel.
[29:51.040 --> 30:01.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Hello

[32:01.400 --> 32:05.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[32:05.920 --> 32:11.440]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug
[32:11.440 --> 32:17.480]  from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[32:17.480 --> 32:22.880]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[32:22.880 --> 32:28.040]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[32:28.040 --> 32:34.160]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[32:34.160 --> 32:39.120]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.480]  is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[32:43.480 --> 32:49.760]  now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of
[32:49.760 --> 32:56.560]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality
[32:56.560 --> 33:24.560]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[33:27.560 --> 33:46.520]  Yeah I'm taking fights. Stand tall. I'm on top as long as I'm facing down tyranny. And
[33:46.520 --> 34:03.400]  I love it. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central we're here live. Wide open
[34:03.400 --> 34:17.960]  phones ladies and gentlemen at 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. And we will get you up and
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.080]  on air. Lord Moncton coming up to talk about the brown shirts taking over his event today.
[34:23.080 --> 34:29.800]  The latest on Copenhagen in studio, G. Edward Griffin. We've got another live report with
[34:29.800 --> 34:38.360]  a live reporter joining us via video Skype from Copenhagen, part two of his report. Also
[34:38.360 --> 34:44.520]  ABC Nightly News last night covered We Are Change, simply confronting Al Gore. They peacefully
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.720]  walked up during the book signing, bought the $30 book and said, hey, what about climate
[34:48.720 --> 34:55.880]  gig? Can you comment on that? They grabbed him, threw him out. But meanwhile, look at
[34:55.880 --> 35:02.800]  this headline up on prisonplanet.com right now. Paul Watson's writing about it. The financial
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.120]  post of Canada, one of the biggest papers in Canada, the real inconvenient truth. The
[35:09.120 --> 35:15.480]  whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy. And I've seen no exaggeration, hundreds
[35:15.480 --> 35:22.160]  of articles in England, Germany, Australia, Canada, calling for cutting the British population
[35:22.160 --> 35:30.440]  by 50% times of London. The head environment official in England, the United Nations calling
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.240]  for a one-child policy. They're going to raise your taxes. And that's what they say
[35:34.240 --> 35:40.040]  this is for so that you can't afford to have more than one child. And if you try to, they're
[35:40.040 --> 35:46.240]  going to come and take your child. That's the Chinese policy. That's how they operate.
[35:46.240 --> 35:53.360]  This is unbelievable. A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.560]  to reverse the disastrous global birth rate currently, which is one million births every
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.800]  four days. Yes, but all the trends show it will play out at eight and a half billion
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.600]  in 2022. And then we'll start dropping down to below six billion because once your country
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.360]  industrializes, they then stop having two children for every two parents. It drops to
[36:15.360 --> 36:24.720]  1.3 as the global average from Japan to Germany to England. Every nation, the average is 1.3.
[36:24.720 --> 36:32.120]  Summer 1.5, 1.1, 1.2. The average is 1.3. Yes, they're having 4.1 children on average
[36:32.120 --> 36:43.840]  in the third world. And under the Copenhagen climate tax agreement that states that they
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.280]  will cut industrial capacity in the third world and double, right at double, their taxes.
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.160]  So that will actually keep them in a poor level where they continue to have more children.
[36:53.160 --> 37:02.280]  So actually the globalist greenie-weenie policies are actually causing a larger population.
[37:02.280 --> 37:08.520]  This is an absolute hitlerian system. That's why we say brown shirt youth cores invade
[37:08.520 --> 37:13.560]  Moncton's speech. Whether these young fools know it or not, working for George Soros and
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.960]  the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, whether they know it or not, they are working for
[37:17.960 --> 37:27.280]  a hitlerian system. Unbelievable. The world's other species, vegetation, resources, oceans,
[37:27.280 --> 37:31.640]  arable land, water supplies, and atmosphere are being destroyed. See now, the atmosphere
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.760]  is being destroyed. No longer global warming. The atmosphere is being destroyed. Are pushed
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.440]  out of existence as a result of humanity's soaring reproductive rate. Ironically, China,
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.960]  despite its dirty coal plants, its world leader in terms of fashioning policy to combat environmental
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.840]  degradation, thanks to its one child only edict. What does Dr. Eric Pionka, UT, call
[37:52.840 --> 37:59.720]  for? A planetary, quote, police state to enforce this. What does Gorvidal call for? A planetary
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.160]  regime to enforce this. What does John P. Holdren call for? A planetary government
[38:04.160 --> 38:07.920]  to enforce this. What does Murray Strong call for? A planetary government to enforce
[38:07.920 --> 38:14.440]  this. What does my film in game? The Obama deception and fall the Republic state that
[38:14.440 --> 38:20.680]  they will introduce a worldwide one child policy under the planetary regime. Congress
[38:20.680 --> 38:30.640]  says they may not ratify the treaty. Obama says that I will do it by command and control.
[38:30.640 --> 38:40.200]  Early dictatorial. And they go on. The fix is simple. It's dramatic. And yet the world's
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.480]  leaders don't even have this on their agenda in Copenhagen. Yes, they do. Instead, there
[38:45.480 --> 38:51.920]  will be photo ops posturing behavior, blah, blah, blah about climate science and climate
[38:51.920 --> 38:58.160]  fraud announcements of giant wind farms, then cap and trade subsidies. None will work unless
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.520]  China one shall policies impose. Unfortunately, there are powerful opponents leaders of the
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.680]  world's big fundamentalist religions preach in favor of procreation and fiercely opposed
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.760]  birth control and most political leaders and emerging economies perpetuated disastrous
[39:12.760 --> 39:21.640]  catch 22. And they go on to how they care about the children. Many children, i.e. sons
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.880]  Dave off hardship and the absence of social safety net or economic development, which
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.080]  in turn prevents protection or development when the global climate tax is meant to shut
[39:31.080 --> 39:38.360]  down development. That stated, China has proven that birth restrictions is simple policy smart
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.400]  policy in middle class grows and its citizens have housing, health care, education, food
[39:43.400 --> 39:49.000]  and the one out of five human beings who live there are not overpopulating the planet. For
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.400]  those who balk at the notion that government should control family size, just wait until
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.160]  the growing human population turns twice as much pasture land into desert as it now is
[39:58.160 --> 40:04.960]  the case. Or when the Amazon is gone, which is another lie, the elephants disappear. For
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.120]  good and wars erupt over water, scarce resources and spatial needs. Oh, really? In the State
[40:10.120 --> 40:14.800]  Department, random 200 by Kissinger states, they want to cause wars and cause food shortages
[40:14.800 --> 40:19.920]  to cause wars. The point in Copenhagen's talking points are beside the point. The only fixes
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.760]  of all countries dramatically reduce their populations, clean up their mess and impose
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.480]  mandatory conservation measures. The National Post wanted to send one of their chief writers
[40:28.480 --> 40:35.680]  here who's writing a book to interview me and I told him no. And I'm, you know what,
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.320]  I'm just going to start telling all the media no, I don't want to talk to the newspapers
[40:41.320 --> 40:48.000]  and the magazines so they can try to spin and distort what we say. I had a reporter here
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.400]  three days ago and he, it was all the cliches. It was, don't you just need to think there's
[40:54.400 --> 40:58.040]  a global government. So subconsciously you think there's order to the universe that you
[40:58.040 --> 41:03.720]  can't handle disorder. And I said, world government's being announced everywhere. One child policy
[41:03.720 --> 41:07.240]  is being announced everywhere. World leaders are calling for global government. He was
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.800]  like, you really believe that? And I'm like, no, it's a fact. And he goes, isn't this
[41:11.800 --> 41:19.720]  just really all about you making money? And I said, I said, this is all the cliches. I
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.840]  said, what does it matter if I make money putting out my political view and my idea
[41:23.840 --> 41:29.920]  so I can fund my own operation? I'm not funded by George Soros. And I went on to say, I spend
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.400]  all my time and energy trying to make sure that the money that comes in here actually
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.200]  gets spent on fighting the new world order. I see there's that guilt trip. Oh, you're
[41:37.200 --> 41:46.680]  not allowed to fund your own media operation. They try to cow us into being poppers into
[41:46.680 --> 41:50.880]  into not trying to take control of the system legally and lawfully, not trying to build
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.480]  our own media systems to counter them. It doesn't matter. All the mainstream newspapers
[41:55.480 --> 42:00.880]  are in the process or have already gone bankrupt, not just because people are web based news,
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.280]  but because you are universally mistrusted. And the people are now starting a long process
[42:06.280 --> 42:14.720]  of awakening. Paul Watson, who's our hardest working writer and I saluting was writing
[42:14.720 --> 42:19.560]  three, four articles a day. He can't even keep track of the evil. Paul, you need to
[42:19.560 --> 42:28.220]  do a blurb about this national post article. You need to do a blurb about this national
[42:28.220 --> 42:35.560]  post article and just take the last 50 articles where they had of the government, the environment
[42:35.560 --> 42:40.400]  program in England called for a 50% population force reduction, where the prime minister
[42:40.400 --> 42:47.280]  of Australia called for 50% reductions. It's all globally organized and all the articles
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.240]  where they're calling for a one child policy and a tax on children. And that's what this
[42:51.240 --> 42:59.340]  carbon tax is. Do you understand how diabolical this is? It isn't a bunch of idiot tree huggers
[42:59.340 --> 43:05.080]  that just mean well and got their science wrong. These are vicious Nazis. It's the
[43:05.080 --> 43:09.760]  only way to describe them, but in truth, they're worse than the Nazis because they are the
[43:09.760 --> 43:17.440]  progenitors of the Nazis. It is the liberal, fake, limp, rested, control freak, power
[43:17.440 --> 43:29.080]  cult groups in England 150 years ago, really 200 plus with certain Malthus who came up
[43:29.080 --> 43:37.880]  with this idea. They came up with this idea to exterminate and reduce births because
[43:37.880 --> 43:42.600]  England didn't know what to do with its exploding population, so they shipped them as slaves
[43:42.600 --> 43:48.040]  and dentured servants to Australia and the United States and Canada. And of course, they're
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.920]  the best, heartiest people to ever come out of England. And they built the West that we
[43:54.920 --> 44:05.960]  now marvel at, that these parasites perch on top of and suck off of. The truth is, is
[44:05.960 --> 44:11.960]  the commoner, whether they be black or white, Hispanic, Asian, that is the salt of the earth,
[44:11.960 --> 44:17.080]  not the arrogant control freak degenerate elites of the planet that want to get everybody
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.760]  out of their way so they can enjoy the fruits of the earth and so they can enjoy all the
[44:20.760 --> 44:26.000]  life extension technologies. Do you understand how vital it is that I broke down the eugenics
[44:26.000 --> 44:36.240]  program at the end of my night, of my 2002 film, 911 the road to tyranny? How vital my
[44:36.240 --> 44:42.000]  film on eugenics and the UN takeover America destroyed by design is? Do you realize how
[44:42.000 --> 44:49.440]  vital in game is? Do you realize how life and death it is that everyone see this? It
[44:49.440 --> 44:56.320]  is life and death. These people are taken over right now. And we are turning the corner.
[44:56.320 --> 44:59.520]  Finally people are getting it because the globalist are coming out of the closet. They're
[44:59.520 --> 45:08.000]  coming out in the open, out of the shadows, showing us who they are. They've taught all
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.680]  you foolish trendies on the right wing that war and tyranny and police state is cool.
[45:13.680 --> 45:17.960]  They've taught all the trendy leftists that big government and socialism and one child
[45:17.960 --> 45:24.800]  policies are avant-garde. You are fools. Even if you hate poor people when you see them
[45:24.800 --> 45:31.640]  in the grocery store, even if you hate commoners, most of you fools, even if you make $10 million
[45:31.640 --> 45:37.200]  a year are not members of the elite. Did you get the memo not to drink the water? Did you
[45:37.200 --> 45:40.960]  get the memo not to take the inoculations like that they got the memo in Germany? Their
[45:40.960 --> 45:45.160]  military and their government does not take it. They tell them do not take it. This is
[45:45.160 --> 45:53.680]  a sterile. And it's a soft kill. It only sterilizes around 30% of people that take it. But it
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.920]  reduces the fertility of everyone else. Why do you think the sperm count in Europe, the
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.880]  U.S. and England is down by over 85% and nowhere else? There's sperm counts not down in the
[46:04.880 --> 46:13.280]  village in Africa. They've done major studies of Anglo-Saxon westerners living in South
[46:13.280 --> 46:24.720]  Pacific islands. Their sperm counts are right up there at 100%, baby. You like being sterilized?
[46:24.720 --> 46:31.320]  You like being killed? You better grow up, ladies and gentlemen. You better realize that
[46:31.320 --> 46:36.760]  we're facing a threat far more dangerous than Mao Zedong and Adolf A. Lewis Hitler and
[46:36.760 --> 46:48.960]  Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin. I'm going to go to your phone calls and I'm going to
[46:48.960 --> 46:53.160]  get all into the latest climate, latest police state gate. The globalists are taking over
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.640]  healthcare, industry, banking. Now they want to continue the banker bailout. I mean, it's
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.360]  just all happening right now. And it's only the beginning. This is the new world order
[47:03.360 --> 47:09.640]  crashing the gates. They are spilling over the wall. If this was the Alamo, those of
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.240]  us fighting the globalists are like Davey Crockett. We're out of ammo. We're swinging
[47:13.240 --> 47:17.120]  our muskets. And let me tell you something. A lot of us are going to get killed. We're
[47:17.120 --> 47:21.360]  going to get imprisoned. This is only going to get worse and worse in the years to come.
[47:21.360 --> 47:29.280]  But you take my life, but I take yours too. You fire musket, but I run you through. And
[47:29.280 --> 47:33.520]  when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand because there's no turning back.
[47:33.520 --> 47:41.440]  The bugle sounds, the charge begins. But on this battlefield, no one wins. Screams of
[47:41.440 --> 47:49.080]  pain, the smell of the horse's breath, the rush of the foreign troops as we all hurdle
[47:49.080 --> 47:58.320]  into certain death. That's what's so sad. On this battlefield, no one wins. All the
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.760]  stupid globalist followers and their minions and their zealots and the new religion, they're
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.040]  openly announcing in hundreds of newspapers in the last week, a new global earth religion
[48:07.040 --> 48:14.560]  run by the UN. Again, we told you that over a decade here with the UN documents. All of
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.920]  us fighting with each other, we all lose. I'm not the enemy of some thug cop. They're
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.560]  just brainwashed. I want to wake them up. I want them to be a free man, a free woman.
[48:22.560 --> 48:27.520]  I want them to stand with us in honor and truth. None of us win fighting with each other as
[48:27.520 --> 48:33.360]  the globalists sit back in their technological ivory towers as technocrats manipulating us,
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.400]  understanding our human psychology, understanding our weaknesses, playing us off against each
[48:37.400 --> 48:43.240]  other. The fight is out there with the New World Order, FBI, police, military, bureaucrats,
[48:43.240 --> 48:48.080]  stupid greenie weenies, all of you people, fake right wingers. The fight's out there
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.760]  with the New World Order. There's no more time to screw around people that are in the
[48:53.760 --> 49:01.240]  system and people that exercise power, judges and legislatures and congressmen and women.
[49:01.240 --> 49:05.520]  We've been right about everything. Our testament has proven to be absolutely right. Do you
[49:05.520 --> 49:10.520]  want to wait around and see the rest of what we've warned you about come true? Is it going
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.920]  to take your 25 year old son coming down with leukemia from the inoculations for you to
[49:15.920 --> 49:24.600]  wake your butt up? Is it going to take your 40 year old wife getting Alzheimer's, all
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.600]  these young people getting it now, from the aluminum being sprayed on us and the aluminum
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.520]  being put in the water supplies? Oh yes, that's what they add to the water supply. I mean,
[49:36.520 --> 49:45.480]  what is it going to take for you to get it through your head that on this battlefield
[49:45.480 --> 49:52.320]  no one wins? It's a fake war with each other. It's a divide and conquer. Wake up to the
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.240]  New World Order. Wake up to the social engineering. Wake up to the technocracy. Wake up to the
[49:58.240 --> 50:03.640]  globalist controllers. Read their documents. Don't roll your eyes at me when I tell you
[50:03.640 --> 50:13.080]  they're putting over 150 chemicals on the lowest level. Some areas over 300 in the water.
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.880]  You better wake up. You better find out what's in the vaccines. You better go to a Walgreens
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.680]  and say, can I have the flu shot insert, please? Not their little fake fact sheet that they
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.960]  give the public. Ask for that and they'll say, no mercury cannot hurt you and then read
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.000]  the insert. This may cause cancer. This may sterilize you or hurt fertility. This has
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.800]  mercury in it. This may cause cancer and then ask them, well, why does this fact sheet
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.640]  say none of this is in it? But then the actual insert says it and then from there you can
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.760]  wake up. From there you can understand. From there you can save yourself and your family.
[50:47.760 --> 50:52.040]  I don't want to fight you. I don't want you to be my enemy. I don't want the globalists
[50:52.040 --> 51:22.000]  to play us off against each other.
[51:22.000 --> 51:51.440]  I'm going to be your enemy. I'm going to be your enemy. I'm going to be your enemy.
[51:51.440 --> 52:20.400]  I'm going to be your enemy. I'm going to be your enemy. I'm going to be your enemy.
[52:20.400 --> 52:49.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:49.560 --> 53:12.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans.
[53:12.760 --> 53:41.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans.
[53:41.160 --> 54:06.960]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as Americans.
[54:06.960 --> 54:11.140]  We began tonight's broadcast with the powerful blast of bitter cold and snow that's blanket
[54:11.140 --> 54:15.440]  getting much of the country. And it's powerful to be sure. But its effects will be short
[54:15.440 --> 54:21.000]  lived. In contrast, in Copenhagen right now, world leaders are focused on the long-term
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.440]  and potentially devastating effects of climate change, global warming. And for all the scientific
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.480]  ammunition being presented at the UN conference, some stolen emails are giving encouragement
[54:32.480 --> 54:37.840]  to global warming skeptics. David Wright has our closer look.
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.320]  Just as the world seems finally poised to do something about global warming, an inconvenient
[54:43.320 --> 54:48.920]  scandal. Let's start with the science that has been so settled for all these years. Skeptics
[54:48.920 --> 54:52.880]  of climate change suddenly have plenty of new fodder. There's increasing evidence of
[54:52.880 --> 54:58.440]  scientific fascism that's going on. A thousand emails dating back more than a dozen years
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.760]  stolen from a top climate research center in Britain. For the taxpayers' sake, let's
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.800]  look at this controversy from top to bottom. As the controversy heats up, the consensus
[55:07.800 --> 55:15.040]  about making the tough choices to curb carbon emissions threatens to crumble. Poor Al Gore.
[55:15.040 --> 55:22.080]  Global warming completely debunked via the very Internet you invented. In the emails,
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.520]  the scientists are downright dismissive of naysayers. In one message, a researcher at
[55:26.520 --> 55:31.200]  Lawrence Livermore Labs offers to beat the crap out of a leading skeptic. In another
[55:31.200 --> 55:35.720]  Penn State's Michael Mann suggests hiding data from dissenters, writing, this is the
[55:35.720 --> 55:39.720]  sort of dirty laundry one doesn't want to fall into the wrong hands. Imagine somebody
[55:39.720 --> 55:44.600]  going through all of the emails you ever sent looking for a single word or phrase that could
[55:44.600 --> 55:47.640]  be twisted. One of the most damning email exchanges credits
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.480]  man with a trick to hide the decline in temperatures. In another, the head of the National Center
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.160]  for Atmospheric Research writes a colleague, the fact is we can't account for the lack
[55:57.160 --> 56:04.360]  of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't. It shows human nature at work,
[56:04.360 --> 56:09.080]  but I don't think it throws any, casts any aspersions on the science. Global warming
[56:09.080 --> 56:13.240]  may be a scientific issue, but it's also a hot button political debate. So right now
[56:13.240 --> 56:19.120]  the scientists aren't the only ones on the defensive. Politicians are too. There's nothing
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.560]  in the hacked emails that undermines the science. That may be true, but the emails threatened
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.680]  to undermine the political effort underway in Copenhagen. This is going to get worse.
[56:29.680 --> 56:35.960]  They are going to use this and blow it up way beyond anything that the evidence supports.
[56:35.960 --> 56:41.640]  At a recent book signing in Chicago, Al Gore was a soft target. Research, climate, gaze,
[56:41.640 --> 56:46.560]  the sky's afoot, it's a scam. The protesters wasted little time posting
[56:46.560 --> 56:52.760]  their antics online, but their message now has a worldwide megaphone. David Wright, ABC
[56:52.760 --> 57:02.480]  News, Washington. So there is the propaganda, a soft target. See, they use the term associated
[57:02.480 --> 57:11.320]  with terrorism. Oh, the we are change. People found a soft target, an unguarded target.
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.120]  Of course they didn't show that they peacefully kept asking when they got up to be able to
[57:15.120 --> 57:18.080]  talk to Al Gore at the book signing. Hey, what do you think of climate game? Then they
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.720]  would be grabbed and drug out. They won't use terrorism analogies about the brown shirts
[57:24.720 --> 57:33.640]  that literally took over and shut down Lord Monkton's little speech today. By the way,
[57:33.640 --> 57:44.760]  we have another top scientist joining us in the last 30 minutes of the radio show today
[57:44.760 --> 57:53.480]  that you definitely don't want to miss, who is also in Copenhagen confronting these people.
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.240]  Lord Monkton is set to be popping in. We're setting that up. He's confirmed he can come
[57:57.240 --> 58:04.360]  on. We just need to set up the time. G. Edward Griffin in studio, Patrick Henningson, who
[58:04.360 --> 58:09.960]  popped in with us yesterday via video Skype. He'll be joining us again with a short report
[58:09.960 --> 58:15.720]  in day four of the global government meetings that are going on. I'm going to come back
[58:15.720 --> 58:20.480]  and go to Mike, Sean, Arnold, Ben, Bruce and others. I want to encourage everyone to get
[58:20.480 --> 58:26.720]  on DVD in game, to make copies of it, to explain to people the environmental movement
[58:26.720 --> 58:31.680]  or a group of eugenicists already poisoning your water supply and sterilizing you through
[58:31.680 --> 58:38.360]  vaccines, calling for global one child policies. Order in game today at info wars.com. Get
[58:38.360 --> 58:54.320]  it out to everyone. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.200]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[58:59.200 --> 59:04.800]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[59:04.800 --> 59:09.320]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after
[59:09.320 --> 59:13.800]  the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[59:13.800 --> 59:17.840]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and
[59:17.840 --> 59:22.200]  you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe
[59:22.200 --> 59:27.160]  out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight
[59:27.160 --> 59:32.520]  for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want?
[59:32.520 --> 59:37.560]  All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[59:37.560 --> 59:45.680]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number
[59:45.680 --> 1:00:06.440]  1-800-409-5633. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network. Big brother,
[1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:13.920]  mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:22.000]  Jones on the GCM Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:30.640]  All right. Let's go to your phone calls right now that I'm going to go through all the latest
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:36.680]  financial news, the global government establishment in Copenhagen, Denmark. Huge developments there.
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.800]  More research, eco science, written by the White House Science czar, blames Judeo-Christian
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:45.640]  religions for overpopulation, environmental destruction. That's the same thing in the
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:50.440]  national post out of Canada, calling for a global one-child policy enforced by the United
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:55.280]  Nations. Your children will be taken if you have more than one child. CPS will visit all
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:59.920]  homes and decide if you can even keep the one child. These people are the hell force,
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:05.160]  the spawn of hell. Mike in Georgia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:10.880]  Yes, sir. How you doing today, Mr. Jones? Just overwhelmed by everything. I mean, it's
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:15.000]  one thing to know they were going to set up world government, but to see it openly happening
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.720]  and the public still going about their business, sucking their thumbs is just too much to handle.
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.160]  I was hoping to kind of get you to compare a couple of things, which I see as very similar.
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:32.280]  The way they're using this climate gate, CRU data, and it's been compromised in the same
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:37.960]  way that they use the Niger document and they disperse the Niger document through SISME
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:45.640]  and method and British intelligence and the OSP sent it out and also received it. Every
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:51.440]  time they would present it as though it was a collaborating report, but it was all coming
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:59.440]  from the same source. The CRU data, when they try to show that it's not good data, then
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:04.280]  they start making references to other sources that are collaborating the data, but it all
[1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:11.160]  goes back to the same initial information. Yes, the point you're making is the CRU for
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:18.320]  the IPCC, that this East Anglia University was the main clearinghouse that made sure
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:23.680]  that all the data coming in from other major institutions was in line with the fraud and
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.960]  the emails show that. Yes, and now there's scandals in Australia, Canada, the US, Germany
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:35.960]  as they're finding that their data was cooked in line with this.
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:42.360]  I just see it as very comparable with the Niger document because I remember seeing over
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.360]  and over again.
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:50.160]  Fake WMDs, yellow cake uranium out of Niger, Africa, absolutely, unified fraud. And then
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.520]  we got the White House memo, we got the Downing Street memo where there were Bush and Blair
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:59.400]  in two meetings admitting there were no weapons, saying how do we lie to the public, how do
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:06.040]  we stage shoot-downs of our aircraft to blame it on Saddam? Yes, it's a total fraud.
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:11.920]  We know the Italian data is good because we also have information from Assad and we have
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.720]  information from British intelligence that says the same thing. Well, yes it does, came
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:22.520]  from the same place. There's climate gate data, it's bad data, but they point to you
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:25.720]  that first they'll quote one source and then another.
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:31.200]  Yes, climate gate comes from the fount or the source, like a spring pouring out of the
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:36.440]  side of a mountain. It is the beginning of the stream, it is the mouth, it is the progenitor,
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:44.160]  it is the goose that laid the lying, fraudulent egg. And it's a great point you make, so the
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.000]  Al Gore, the UN, they all keep saying, but we have all these other peer-reviewed journals
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.680]  citing the same baloney from the same source. Anything else?
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:04:00.040]  The poem word, peer-reviewed journals, but it's all from the same place. Thank you for
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:05.160]  letting me get this in. I find it extremely insulting that, you know, I know that they're
[1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:08.840]  lying to us, but some lives are just more insulting than others.
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:14.320]  Well, sir, frankly, I mean, saying the earth's warming as a human's is somewhat insulting,
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:19.040]  but saying polar bears can't swim and showing photos of them hunting on ice floes, saying
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.840]  oh look, it's gonna die and telling kids that in public school everywhere. I mean, that
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:30.240]  is insulting, sir. That is the most asinine, ridiculous propaganda ever seen when polar
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  bears hunt on the ice and have been recorded to swim 300 miles. Absolutely, I appreciate
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:42.360]  your call. I mean, it's just, I've seen national television, I hardly watch TV saying the penguins
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:47.960]  are drowning. Penguins don't fly, they can hardly walk, they're a swimming bird that
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:56.200]  hunts fish. I mean, it's unbelievable. How stupid do they, penguins can swim, they're
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:05:00.360]  not drowning. Come on.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:04.280]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator

[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:16.000]  ranting for a few minutes before I get into more of this news. We have four guests coming
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:27.200]  up today, G. Edward Griffin, Lord Moncton, Patrick Henningson, and of course, Tom Harris,
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:31.640]  who's an engineer director, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition,
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:36.260]  a massive scientific group set up to counter the IPCC and the UN lies. They're currently
[1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:41.040]  in Copenhagen. He's coming on as well. We're also working on a Nobel Prize-winning climate
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:47.040]  ontologist to come on and expose the fraud. Of course, I don't know what that means now.
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:53.680]  Obama just got his today and defended how war is part of peace. War is peace. I think
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:59.560]  I've heard that before. I think it was a novel called 1984. Sean in Tennessee, you're on
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:01.560]  the air. Sean, go ahead.
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:08.440]  Well, Alex, I can't thank you enough for being out there for all of us. You're really
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:15.040]  the voice that we have been needing to be out there for us for a long time. I've been
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:21.080]  screaming some of the same things that you're talking about since the early 1980s, and it
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:23.680]  eventually cost me my career in the Navy.
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:24.680]  Wow.
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:31.400]  But that's not the main reason I called my wife and I to transfer to the United States
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:37.640]  coming through your territory. There's a two-fold reason for my call. Number one, I need to
[1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:43.960]  know any updates on the checkpoints going through your territory or anywhere across
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:51.160]  the central part of the U.S. if you've got. Number two, is it all possible within the
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:56.320]  next two or three days, she and I would like to stop into Austin area there and shake your
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:57.320]  hand.
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:04.840]  Sean, I would love to meet you, but I am literally, literally working 12 hours a day, and that's
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:10.800]  a cut back from 16, 18 hours a day. A few days ago, I did coast to coast AM and looked
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:16.960]  at the clock. I did a total of 17 hours of work. It is just all nose to the grindstone
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:20.880]  fighting these people and I just don't have an open house. I can't meet with people, but
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:27.040]  God bless you and I appreciate your call, Sean. Let me say this. Yes. In the last year, it
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:33.680]  has been mainly in Tennessee papers, but also in Arkansas and Oklahoma papers, California
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:39.760]  papers, it just goes on and on of army checkpoints, Marine Corps checkpoints, National Guard
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:45.120]  checkpoints in the mainstream newspaper, searching people's cars randomly. They had
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:50.040]  a four state drill was it eight months ago than another one, three months ago, centered
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:56.160]  around Tennessee and it said FEMA, Homeland Security, FBI, BATF, state police, local police,
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:11:04.320]  Army, Sheriff's departments, Army, Marine Corps, National Guard, Air Force military police.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.640]  And the governor came out and said, I didn't say you could have these checkpoints and the
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:12.920]  military said we're doing it anyways. And it was in the newspapers, the army running
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:16.800]  checkpoints. So yes, state police everywhere under federal grants are doing warrantless
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:21.960]  checkpoints in Texas under federal grants. They passed a law where without warrants,
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:27.160]  they take your blood and they just announced on the news no longer needed warrants in America.
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:32.360]  So it is just hellish. And then the cops come up, it's happened to me and they say, I want
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:35.800]  to search your car and you say, well, this is America. What's your due, what's your due
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.040]  process? What's your probable cause? And they flip out because they've been given training
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:45.120]  manuals that say that's a sign of terrorism. And it's just they are totally destroying
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:50.040]  our Bill of Rights and Constitution. And the average cop isn't a bad person. They're just
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:55.480]  brainwashed. And I just so sick. We're just totally going into police state. North commas
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.040]  announced in the last year and a half. First they were going to deploy 4,000, then 40,000,
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:06.160]  then 100,000. Now 379,000 army times reported regular army Marine Corps to be deployed the
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:12.320]  next three years in brigade homeland operations. I mean, it's just off the charts. Insane.
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:16.840]  My film fall, the Republic has all their press releases, videos, statements. They're training
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:21.200]  school kids to title on their parents. Videos are coming in everywhere of kids training
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:25.760]  with police to set up checkpoints and help do gun confiscations. New York Times reports
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:29.880]  on it and says, oh, look, the explorer scouts are trained to go into buildings and take
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:35.000]  on veterans that won't turn their guns in. And then it shows the mock dead veterans that
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.280]  the kids kill. People go, I don't care about 14 year olds training. I'll take them on.
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:46.560]  They'll be 18 years old in a few years. Bubba. The point is it's happening and it is just
[1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:52.360]  hellish what's going on. Yes, I do need to set up some public events in the future so
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:58.840]  people can come and meet and hang out. And I just, what's the point of having a hotel
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:03.840]  event unless you get one where two, three, four thousand can be there and that costs
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:08.680]  like 50,000 bucks to rent that for one day in a cheap hotel. You have no idea how expensive
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.120]  it is and people complain. You know, if you got to charge 25 bucks to be, I just don't
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:19.040]  have the events. I mean, I can sit here and just talk to everybody free on the radio.
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:24.680]  Everybody can tune in AM FM, short waves, satellite, podcast, and we can have the news, cover
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:31.760]  the issues. I can make films and fire and forget. I make a film, drop it on prisonplanet.tv
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.960]  for members to download and burn the disc. They hit the streets everywhere. It goes for
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:41.680]  free up on YouTube, Google, everywhere else, tens of millions see it, or I can spend tons
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:48.840]  of energy having a public event that doesn't have one one thousandth the firepower. I build
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:58.520]  hydrogen bombs in the info war. I build weapons of truth that devastate enemy operations.
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:06.240]  And you know, I'm in here building info weapons right now and it's hard to do. A lot of people
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:15.880]  are long on talk, short on action, not us. And so there there's my philosophy on really
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:20.200]  not ever doing public events anymore. Hell, I don't know why we're even doing another
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:30.200]  one. I mean, I I like meeting people and at a primitive level, it satisfies. But this
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:40.400]  is the 21st century. And so I sit here in my info wars command center, doing the best
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:47.600]  job I can. Let's talk to Arnold in California. Arnold, you're on the air, Alex. Thank you
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:51.240]  so much for taking my call. I do appreciate your show and appreciate everything you do
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:56.960]  for us. And just as a plug, Governor Ventura's show yesterday was was awesome. He did a great
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:01.440]  job. I was actually surprised by the things that they allowed him to say. But the reason
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.840]  I'm calling this is two things. First of all, I was in the military in the early nineties.
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:13.120]  And during during that time, we worked I was in the Marines. We did some work allegedly
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:19.680]  with the DEA to go look for marijuana plants in the Cleveland National Forest. Yeah, that's
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:25.080]  how they broke the ice. That's how they broke the ice 25 years ago or more. Because it started
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:32.600]  in about 1981. And from there, it's just total control. Go ahead. Correct. And they I remember
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:36.400]  them talking about posicom and taught us. But if I remember correctly, this is that
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:41.320]  that did not pertain to us because we were working with another federal agency. Yeah,
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:48.520]  it's totalize. I've had top jag lawyers, judges on and they are just blown away by the way
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:53.960]  posicom and taught us has been rendered a useless vehicle. Correct. But the main reason
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:58.800]  why I'm calling my brother came over to my house yesterday, and he was sharing the story
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:02.960]  with me. It kind of it kind of set me back a little bit. He was he was sharing with me
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:07.080]  that he went to a friend's house to share one of your DVDs. I think it was a 9 11 road
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:12.960]  to tyranny. That friend had a friend that was in the military active active duty army.
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:16.760]  And when my brother put was was he's also an evangelist when he was evangelizing, and
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:25.800]  he put the DVD in this active duty army person was got up in arms and threatened my brother
[1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:32.680]  told him that he was in a college superior and and get my brother for terrorist threats.
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:37.920]  This this are this army individual was on the phone three to four times calling a superior.
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:42.520]  And from that point and forward, my brother was uneasy with with the way everything. The
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:48.640]  military is being taught that free speech is illegal in road to tyranny from 2000 and
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:55.600]  one was well, it came out in 2002, but the videos from 2000. We show you the training
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:01.560]  manuals that they show state police, military and others. And it says if you talk about
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:05.280]  the Constitution, you're a terrorist actually says that then we have FEMA training police
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:08.840]  that that's the case, the actual video sent to us by a firefighter who was at the meeting
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:14.440]  in Kansas City. Then we show from a squad car video, a woman Navy veteran, Abby Newman,
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:19.800]  no criminal record pulled over. They find a police state 2000 in the back of her car
[1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:24.080]  in the trunk searching her without a warrant. She drives up to a warrantless checkpoint says,
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:28.760]  No, you can't search my car. This is America. They jerk around, open her trunk and they
[1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:37.800]  start heavy breathing like they have found a a a a box of of nerve gas. And they go,
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:41.680]  I can't believe we found one of the extremists. We found one of the terrorists. She's got
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:46.680]  a pocket Constitution. Is this illegal? And they start heavy breathing. And then the commander
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:50.800]  comes over and goes, I may think she's allowed to have that. I think she may be allowed to
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:55.680]  still have that in America. It's a Constitution, what they've sworn an oath to. So you see
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.760]  the total brainwashing. So yes, of course. So so is your brother in the military or
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:05.360]  was this guy calling the military on him? This guy was calling the military on him.
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.080]  You know, there was it was off base. Everything was was in this all took place in the city
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.000]  of Sacramento. But is your brother in the military? No, he's not. He is. So so so so
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:20.480]  the military guy is calling the military thinking that a U. S citizen isn't allowed to have
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:26.120]  a video. Well, basically, that's what took place. And to me, when so, so I mean, how
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:31.280]  did this end? How did this end? Well, the way it ended was this this this guy in the
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:35.440]  army was was looking out the back window like if he was expecting somebody to to break through
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:40.680]  the window at any time to come to arrest my brother, basically.
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:44.720]  And see how they're completely insane. You know, the Nazis seem insane, but they were
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:48.440]  told by their government to take children and line them up and shoot them in the back
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:53.080]  of the head. And so they did it. And so they're the bad guys, you know, a lot of the military
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:59.160]  is away, but this guy's obviously a lunatic of tyranny. And look, Kelly rushing no criminal
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:04.880]  record, upstanding old family, Lyon County, Kentucky in the newspaper gave a state police
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:12.720]  officer a Ron Paul video and road to tyranny on one, one, one, um, one VHS slow play. And
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:16.600]  the guy pulled him over two days later, arrested him, called on his cell phone, laughed at
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:22.760]  him to his wife said, I got the VHS bandit and it was in the newspaper. I even called
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:26.680]  the judge and the judge said, yeah, that case is going before our court and they took it
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:32.680]  before the jury, two charges of terrorist threats for Ron Paul's congressional 45 minute
[1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:38.560]  neocon speech. And for road to tyranny, they wanted him to spend six years in jail consecutively
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:44.000]  for two counts of quote, anti law enforcement material. And the jury found him not guilty,
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:51.080]  but that judge and the Kentucky state police want to put Americans in prison for Ron Paul
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:57.400]  video. They charged him for the Ron Paul video. Now that's what America has turned into ladies
[1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:00.560]  and gentlemen.
[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:04.840]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt. Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[1:20:04.840 --> 1:20:09.120]  No more mortgage can change your life. We paid off all of our bills, all your debt, including

[1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:24.120]  monthly payments by a little over $500. No more mortgage. Where have they been all of
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:27.360]  our life? If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody. Whenever
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:31.320]  I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number. I'm Larry

[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:05.360]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:10.040]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:14.080]  that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.400]  of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's not
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:23.920]  what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:28.000]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.160]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:37.760]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:43.560]  has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:47.720]  to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:22:02.240]  you 10 reasons why gold will do very well. Free 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:06.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:12.000]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, there'll be pulling the
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.080]  rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:22.320]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:27.960]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the enemies of
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:33.520]  our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:38.000]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:42.160]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:47.520]  Today, it seems like nobody does care. And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:54.280]  a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:07.840]  This is an emergency alert. Do not take risky vaccinations this fall. I repeat, do not take
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:13.440]  risky vaccinations this fall. I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:18.720]  and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:25.600]  flu season. Rely instead on oxysilver. Oxysilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:31.380]  and antibiotics unnecessary. Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer
[1:23:31.380 --> 1:23:37.000]  than colloidal silvers. It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you

[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:25.800]  The public is being trained that there's no free speech in America. First free speech
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:30.520]  zones, it spreads out from there. We knew more than 10 years ago the police were being
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:34.600]  trained that talking about the Constitution is illegal. We have the training manuals.
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:39.920]  Now you see it in the MIAC report and the Homeland Security reports. Yes, it's insane
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.080]  for anyone that understands what America is all about or any free country is supposed
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:49.160]  to be about, but it's really happening, Arnold. And there's just a lot of mentally ill people
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:56.560]  that work for the system and they think that criticizing the government is illegal. We
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:01.600]  better watch out because the government goes through the police and military and finds
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.440]  these mentally ill, weak-minded people and promotes them. Let's talk to Ben in Virginia.
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.280]  Ben, you're on the air. Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:15.800]  Total world government's coming in like a flood right now. We're defending as best
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.920]  we can. Awful. Yeah, well, I just had a couple of things to say. First off, I was thinking
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:27.920]  that maybe you could do a infomercial. I think that'd be a great info bomb. You know, I've
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:31.920]  thought about trying to produce an infomercial. It's just the time and energy and the money
[1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:40.920]  it takes. You know, we're not as big as some people imagine, but it is a good idea. I
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:45.160]  had another thing. If you want to make a little bit of money off of these global warming
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:51.560]  nuts, all you got to do is make it bet. You fill up a glass of water halfway with water,
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:55.160]  and then you put it in the microwave for about a minute just to get the water warm. And then
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:59.480]  you add ice cubes until there's ice up over the top of the glass. And you say, when the
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:04.400]  water melts, will it flood? And this is the exact same thing that will happen with the
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.680]  ice caps. Of course, it won't flood because, as you know, those ice caps are displacing
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.280]  their own amount of water in the sea that they're in right now.
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.360]  Actually, as you know, when water freezes, it displaces a lot more space. So the test
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.720]  has been done. You can pile it all the way up with ice, and then it'll melt and be lower
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.920]  than the top of the glass.
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:29.920]  Just make the bet, and they'll fall for it. You make five, ten bucks every time.
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:36.480]  No, it's incredible. You can go up to these people and say, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:41.440]  And because it sounds scary, they'll say ban it. And you can also go up and say, hey,
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:45.160]  you know, polar bears can't swim, I hear. Let's make a bet that there are more polar
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:49.040]  bears and that they can swim. And they'll say, okay. And then you can show them, you
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:54.160]  know, nature films of them swimming and hunting and that their numbers are higher. And they'll
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:59.240]  go, what? Make them a bet that penguins can swim. And they'll go, no, they can't. They're
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:00.240]  all drowning.
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:05.400]  I mean, these people, these people believe anything. They just love being morons and
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:10.440]  being fooled by everything. I appreciate your call, Ben. Bruce in Michigan. Bruce, go ahead.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:19.040]  Hey, how are you doing? Hey, I just want to let you know you're doing a great job. And
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:23.800]  I up here, we meet on a Thursday night. There's a bunch of us. We watch your videos. David
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:29.160]  Ike, Mike Rupert, Catherine Austin Fitz. We are starting to get through to people up
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:34.560]  here because we're in one of the worst states in the union and everybody's starting to realize
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:39.640]  they're screwed. So whatever you're doing, man, just keep it up. I was going to ask you
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:43.520]  if you ever come up here and consider making a speech, but since I've heard the last recalls,
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:49.000]  I won't ask you. But that's basically all I wanted to just say, man, as you're doing
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.720]  a great job and please keep it up.
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:59.800]  Thank you. I mean, the analogy is this, I'm sitting here at an anti aircraft gun. There
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:04.520]  are so many targets coming in, bombing our liberties. I am blasting and blowing them
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:14.680]  to bits and I don't have time to jump in a car and drive a thousand miles to maybe, maybe
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:21.440]  be able to take on some enemy, enemy forces in the info war. I have got so many targets.
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:25.600]  Everything we do turns the solid gold in the fight against the new world order. If it ain't
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:32.400]  broke, don't try to fix it. And we are just here absolutely waking people up because of
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:35.760]  you, the listener spreading the word.
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:41.680]  And so again, making the films, doing the radio show, making the YouTube videos, the
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:48.240]  people are ready to hear the truth. The people are waking up in mass everywhere. And I have
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:53.960]  a wanderlust. I would love to travel around the country. I would love to be able to go
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  and speak to crowds. I really get fired up in front of crowds. I give good speeches.
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:08.800]  So I've been told. And I'm a decent orator, especially in front of crowds. But again,
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:12.920]  ladies and gentlemen, I am here hour after hour every day just studying what's going
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:16.960]  on so that I understand what's happening so I can go out and present to people what's
[1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:24.760]  really going on. I mean, I went to Hardin. And the good news is about half the people
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:31.440]  that drove by or were in shops or stores or gas stations were listeners. Half the people
[1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:37.000]  in the middle of Montana. And it's the same thing everywhere I go. And that's a gauge
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:42.280]  of just how many people we're reaching, ladies and gentlemen. It is incredible. So more people
[1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:48.320]  are awake than you or I even know it is so good what's happening. But people need to
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:51.520]  be waking up. I mean, world governments openly been announced.
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:30:00.520]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This
[1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:05.440]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number
[1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:10.200]  one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:14.280]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:19.760]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:24.200]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[1:30:24.200 --> 1:30:30.160]  overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:34.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:39.000]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:43.160]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:47.480]  offered by solutions from science. One of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information

[1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:05.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:10.120]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:15.040]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:20.520]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:25.120]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:29.160]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:33.440]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:38.480]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:43.440]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:51.840]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:59.840]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:04.480]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.560]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:13.600]  that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
[1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:17.960]  There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have
[1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:22.160]  been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to

[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:34.120]  the new world order, it cannot stand. These con artist criminals will fall. They're in
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:40.840]  danger of toppling right now at the key moment at the birth of their world government. Meanwhile,
[1:33:40.840 --> 1:33:46.400]  scores of mainstream newspapers are calling for one-child policies worldwide in the last
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:53.400]  week, including the financial post of Canada. The real inconvenient truth, a planetary law
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:58.520]  such as China's one-child policy, is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:07.440]  rate currently. We're going to continue with your phone calls, Clay, Danny, Michael, Kyle,
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:14.320]  and others, and I'm going to run through the news before Patrick Henningson joins us from
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:20.840]  Copenhagen. A reporter there, G. Edward Griffin in studio, Lord Monkton popping in to talk
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:27.640]  about how the George Soros crowd took over one of his events today. And we also have
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.000]  joining us from Copenhagen, Tom Harris, engineer, executive director of the International Climate
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:40.520]  Studies Coalition, a massive scientific group set to counter the IPCC, UN fraud, and climate
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:47.080]  gain. That is all coming up today. But for the next five minutes, I am honored with
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:54.160]  our once a month visit with Akola Blue, Jill Lawrence, regional director of sales. You
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:57.840]  can go to AkolaBlue.com and find out more. They do this promotion for a few days once
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:07.520]  a month. It starts today, Thursday and runs till Monday, December 14th of next week. You
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:18.360]  get a huge discount on the AkolaBlue 28. I guess that comes out to a 20% discount. This
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:22.800]  atmospheric water generator where you can trust the government and drink the tap water.
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:24.920]  Going to Jill Lawrence. Jill, good to have you on with us.
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:30.760]  Hi, Alex. Thanks so much. My pleasure. Truly. Yeah, that isn't that the truth or you can
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:38.280]  any level of government and the municipal water supply systems are really under scrutiny
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:46.560]  because of good reason. They are failing. This is a way the AkolaBlue, we have a brand
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.560]  new product launching today which we are so excited about because it took something that
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:59.680]  was already extraordinary now to a remarkable level of engineering. It really gives you
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:06.320]  and your family the gift of peace of mind because you don't have to worry about being
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:11.520]  part of the municipal water supply system, how many pharmaceuticals are in the water,
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:16.120]  how many pollutants are in the water, did a terrorist get to the water, all that kind
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:21.520]  of thing because this generates water. As you well know, Alex, right out of the air
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:27.600]  in your very own home. It's an amazing, amazing thing. We're just dancing in the streets
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:31.760]  with this new unit, this AkolaBlue. Yeah, describe to folks the line of products,
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:36.000]  how AkolaBlue works, and the new line you're launching today here on air, Jill.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:43.880]  Okay. Well, the basic premise is an atmospheric water generator, which is something that extracts
[1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:48.480]  the moisture or the humidity out of the air. If you think about a cloud, that's a good
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:55.320]  example. A cloud is an accumulation of water vapor before it drops the rain to the ground
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:37:01.360]  kind of thing. And so we beat that kind of natural cycle. We take it out of the air with
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:08.640]  this atmospheric water generator, high tech, the most advanced in the whole industry. Extract
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:14.000]  the moisture from the air in your own home. Then we run it with our new system, our new
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:20.720]  AkolaBlue 30, through 12 filter and purification systems, which gives you, you remember Ivory
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:27.680]  Snow, Alex, where they were highly touting that it was 99.9% pure. That was the zenith
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:34.520]  of purity. Well, that's our purity level. You can't get better. And it just eliminates
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:39.560]  anything that could cause a problem for you. So it runs it through all this filtering system.
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:47.320]  And then it delivers eight gallons of crystalline pure water for your family every single day.
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:54.160]  That's amazing. You need no water source. None. Just the air. And we do have air, thank
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:38:01.160]  God. So the new system, the new AkolaBlue system, we have a 28, which is still wonderful.
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:07.240]  And you're right. We are discounting it from the original price of $13.50 to $9.99. So
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:14.880]  you save $351. You can order that. And or you can order the AkolaBlue 30, which is our
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:21.400]  brand new unit launching today for the very first time, for $13.99 and get free shipping.
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:31.800]  So if you go to ekoloblu.com, you can take advantage of it by entering the coupon code.
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:38.720]  Guess what? Alex Jones. And just put that all together, A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S. And you'll
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:47.000]  get your shipping for free with the AkolaBlue unit, or you'll get this huge 26% reduction
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:54.840]  in the AkolaBlue 28. So that runs through until midnight on Monday, December 14. You
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:00.960]  can also call. People are there to answer all your questions, anything you want to talk
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:11.920]  about relative to the units. And that's an 800 toll-free number, 800-691-6043. 800-691-6043.
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:16.040]  So you'll find everybody in a very festive mood today, because we're celebrating this
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:23.880]  incredible, incredible breakthrough. This new unit has an LCD touchscreen, and it is
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:30.640]  really sexy. It is very user-friendly. You can control the temperature of your hot water,
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.520]  the cold water, just at the touch of a screen. And you can also determine when you want the
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:40.200]  machine to generate water for you. You can have it processed at night only if you want
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:49.760]  to. It really has a beautiful new sleek design, and it also has a much lower energy usage.
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.760]  We've done something pretty amazing. It's a remarkable reduction in what already was
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:40:01.440]  pretty low energy usage, but now we've got a machine that operates efficiently at about
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:08.080]  300 watts only compared to about, oh, 450 for the 28. They're both excellent.
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:12.800]  Well, Jill, I use one in my home, and it's the best atmospheric water-generating line
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:17.400]  out there. You've got a bunch of other systems, gigantic ones, medium-sized ones, little
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:23.200]  bitty ones. The two units you're talking about look like a high-tech water cooler,
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:27.480]  a Robbie the Robot water cooler without the water bottle on top, and it just grabs the
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:32.800]  humidity out of the air, then sends it through all the great filtration systems. AcollaBlue.com
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:39.360]  or 800-691-6043. Those are huge discounts on both these units, but you rarely see some
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:43.080]  new item discounted out of the gates, but I know you guys are excited about it. So the
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:47.000]  AcollaBlue 30, folks, you have until next Monday evening to take advantage of this,
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:51.320]  but don't wait. Go check out the great line of products at AcollaBlue.com or check out
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:56.400]  the banners on InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com. Have a great weekend coming up, Jill, and
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:00.960]  thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Alex. Don't forget the coupon code, Alex Jones.
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:05.200]  Alex Jones. I've heard of that guy before. I thought that would ring a bell. Thanks so
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:12.080]  much. Thank you, Jill. Thank you. God bless you. Good to have you here with us. Okay.
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:15.240]  I want to go to your phone calls right now. I mean, what's been happening with Climate
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:25.680]  Gate and the global government being established and the Danish text leak of the official treaty
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:31.120]  is that I'm really shocked into amazement, even though I knew this was all coming, even
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:38.280]  though I knew our enemy's operating plans. I am grieving for the world and my nation
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:42.360]  and for my family. I mean, I really know that these people are murdering killers who want
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:46.280]  to have a global one-child policy and who are spiking the water supply and the vaccines
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:51.240]  with steroids and chemicals. I mean, I have hundreds. We've bought hundreds of textbooks,
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:56.480]  they wrote, hundreds of white papers. I'm knee-deep in new John P. Holdren and Erlich
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:02.920]  and Pianca and Gore Vidal and Al Gore talk of forced population reduction articles the
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:09.400]  last two days. We're there openly saying it in Playboy Magazine. You name it. And to
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:13.920]  have the new treaty that openly states it's a world government, that it's meant to shut
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:19.200]  down the third world and the first world, that the third world was suckered and told
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:24.240]  that they were not going to have to make cuts. Turns out they've got to make right at double
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:30.400]  the cuts the West does. The IMF and World Bank will take all this private tax money
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:35.160]  and then loan it back to the countries. I mean, this is total global feudalism and
[1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:41.400]  slavery. And I can't believe that we are still called the kooks by the mainstream media.
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:48.960]  I mean, I know that's their job, but it's just so illegitimate. It's so criminal. It's
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:58.320]  so obviously ridiculous. And it goes on and on and on. And I read article after article
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:02.760]  in national and international papers calling for forced one child policies and calling
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:06.320]  for taking people's children. And I read all the government textbooks, how they're going
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:11.440]  to raise all the children in dormitories and how after they've bankrupted almost everyone,
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:14.640]  they're going to take your children and raise them in government facilities. And those that
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.360]  have enough money to be able to still take care of their families, you're going to have
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:23.560]  home inspections and the universities are just disgorging millions of new bureaucrats
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:31.280]  and control freaks to run our lives. And it's just so horrible. I just don't want it
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:45.520]  to happen. I want justice and goodness and honor. I want to be free. But no, in the government
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:50.840]  documents, in the government reports, Ron Paul's the bad man. I'm the bad man. Dr. Tim
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:44:02.520]  Ball's the bad man. You have these criminals running around demonizing good people. You
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:08.200]  have them openly deploying military on the streets, openly setting up checkpoints everywhere,
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:17.120]  openly introducing draconian gun grabbing bills. The elite are in the middle of a revolution.
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:21.320]  They are the revolutionaries. They are taking over our society. They are lawless criminals.
[1:44:21.320 --> 1:44:28.400]  They are illegitimate criminals. The big global corporations get 50 billion plus in U.S. auto
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:34.080]  bailouts to pay to move General Motors and others to Brazil, China and Eastern Europe
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:44.120]  publicly. Worst of all, third world under attack from genocidal climate change policy.
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:48.160]  That's an article that everyone, we can get every person in the world to read that, or
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:52.800]  even 20% to see that article and to read the quotes and the documents and the statements
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.440]  of how the elite want to shut off the energy sources to kill the third world. And they
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:03.800]  know that if moderate carbon cuts are made, a billion people will die in the next decade.
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:14.280]  That is a billion dead people killed by a Nazi-like eugenics system. Little children
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:20.440]  with their ribs sticking out, collapsing and dying, little children being forcibly given
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:28.520]  smallpox and polio shots that are live smallpox and polio, associated press killing them,
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:34.760]  you in doing it on purpose. The AP reports it like it's a good thing. Oh, well, yeah,
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:39.640]  the shots were filled with live virus, killed them, but so what? Oh, a weaponized strain
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:47.760]  was in there. I mean, it's just so incredible. And they're going to pass it. Even if we beat
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:50.840]  it in the U.S., they're implementing it at the state level, and they're going to kill
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:55.480]  all these people. They're going to kill them. And you can go to any major university and
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:46:01.000]  see the people with their Rasta fake hair that want to be white Rastafarians and their
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.880]  sandals and patchouli going, it's what we've got to do for the earth. And I just want to
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:10.560]  knock their Nazi teeth out. Don't you understand the real Nazis have fake Rasta hair and limp
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:14.840]  wrist and, you know, they're walking around at coffee shops acting real cool. And I just
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:19.400]  want to knock their teeth out. I want to take them to Africa and Latin America and
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:23.360]  let them see a kid with their ribs sticking out with diarrhea pouring out of them dying.
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:33.360]  I want to crush your skull because I'm just a normal mammal. I'm, I'm a normal, normal
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:38.720]  creature that when I see innocence being torn apart, my instinct is as a warrior to stand
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:42.720]  up and fight. I'm not worried about being killed. I'm not worried about being set up.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:46.520]  I'm not worried about being tortured. I'm not worried about demonized being demonized
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:51.080]  in the mainstream media. I'm only worried about you, the listeners, buying into Co and
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:55.560]  tell pros, spinning your wheels in fighting when the fight is out there with the new world
[1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:00.200]  order, the fight is with the North American union, the fight is with the UN, the fight
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:04.400]  is with the IMF and World Bank and their private owners, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:15.760]  of London, Bank of England, based in London, the fight is out there.
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:19.800]  I want all of you to redouble your efforts against the new world order. I want you to
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:23.960]  get serious. I want you to get focused. I don't want the globalist divide and conquer
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:28.720]  programs they run to keep you from getting involved and realizing that you can warn people
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:34.160]  about the tap water and about vaccines and about the chem trails and about real issues.
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.760]  And you can go into your counties and cities and rural areas and teach people they don't
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:41.760]  have to sign the animal ID, premises ID that waives your rights to your property to the
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:49.040]  feds and makes you a surf. I want to warn people about the slavery we're going into.
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:56.120]  That's all I want to do. I have zero fear of being killed, zero fear of being demonized,
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:00.680]  zero fear of them putting me on a rack and torturing me for 10 years and turning me into
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:05.840]  a drugged out zombie. They can trot out on television like they're doing with their
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:10.600]  patsies with this new line 11 trial. I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about these
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:15.360]  people winning. And if you get the spirit of freedom and the spirit of action in your
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:24.640]  gut, nothing on earth can stop you from beating these people. And I want them defeated. These
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:37.400]  are sniveling, sicko, control freak murderers. And I've had it with them. I've had it with
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:42.200]  fake liberals. They're a bunch of eugenicist cult members. I've had it with fake conservatives,
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:47.800]  a bunch of imperial war mongering scum. I've had it with all your injustice and all your
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:59.880]  foolishness. I've had it. I've had it. These people are waging war on you. And so many
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:04.280]  of you fools think you're part of the system. You're not. You've got that. You've got me.
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:11.840]  This is real. Mal was real. Hitler was real. Stalin was real. And Al Gore is real. Barack
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:16.320]  Obama telling Congress, Hey, I don't care if you don't shut down the carbon and shut
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:20.560]  down industry in America, I'm going to do it without you. That criminal should be impeached
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:30.280]  right now. Clay in Alabama, you're on the air. Go ahead. Can you hear me okay? Yes, sir.
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:36.320]  I'm a air commissioner contract in Alabama. And something that's always griped me and
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:47.680]  this is a way to vent it. Oh, you pints patent on free on run out in 2003. So if there's
[1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:53.720]  a change in 2003, anybody could have manufactured free on for air conditioners. And that had
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:59.800]  to pay G. Pond licensing fee. So no, no, they're on a whole job or so you can talk, but their
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:05.920]  own lobbying documents from the seventies said we've got a launch a lie saying Freon's
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:11.120]  eating the ozone layer in truth during different times of the year. It always gets then because
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:15.960]  our patents up and we've got to make them take our new product. And yeah, no, look,
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:21.240]  it's it's the big industry. It's the big banks. It's big oil. It's big chemical that is running
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:27.200]  all of this. Go ahead. Okay. Well, the price of a failure that goes on home architecture
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.600]  is more than quadrupled because of punitive taxes to get people to not use any more than
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:39.200]  half to after the first of the end of this month, a few days from now, there will be
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:48.800]  against a lot to sell any you are 22 air conditioners. It will be just 410 pure art. And it's and
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:53.400]  already the price of the 22 that we're putting in those systems is more than quadrupled.
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:58.680]  And after stay there, stay there, they set the precedent, what light bulbs you can have,
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:06.680]  the toilet you want. And now how many kids you can have. Healthy Hearts Club presents

[1:53:54.840 --> 1:54:06.840]  an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food. I just want to say live on air that I swear
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:13.200]  eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds and bodies of men. As Thomas
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:20.480]  Jefferson said, you need to get angry and focused with steel will to commit yourself
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:25.440]  to fight these people. I found out about the global of 16, 17 years ago, took me two, three
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:30.520]  years to figure out a battle plan. I didn't intend to beat them myself, and I never will
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:37.760]  beat them by myself, but I have had devastating effects on their agenda. One man. Now, what
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:45.840]  can you do? Just start fighting them. Start exposing them. Start resisting them. And they
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:52.960]  will fall. Period. And I look at these little African children and Asian children, and I
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:56.560]  see the reports where the U.N. goes and shoots them up in Indonesia and all the women have
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:03.080]  miscarriages. It is pure evil. These people are vampire devils. You better get that through
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:10.120]  your head. You better realize this is life and death with these people. Every day, scores
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:13.560]  of articles where they say they're going to only let you have one child and tax you until
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:19.680]  you bankrupt. They're going to take over every industry. They're doing it now. America, you're
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  going to end up like the Ukrainians in Russia. I'm telling you, this is, you better learn
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:29.680]  what happened to them or the Chinese peasants under Mal. Now back to the air conditioning.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:34.480]  Yes, this is how they set the precedent to run and control everything and federal standard
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:38.480]  on your houses. This is just the beginning and they're going to incrementally put it
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:44.800]  all into place. Finish up your point, Clay. Well, the largest selling refrigerant in the
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:50.320]  world right now is R134. I hope I'm not getting too technical for everybody. Okay, but guess
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:57.400]  who makes the license? Depart. Depart. And the reason that's this that way is because
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:03.560]  of government action, not because of marketplace forces. Government action.
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:11.440]  Sir, sir, as you know, in the 20s, they began to legalize a lot of drugs weren't illegal
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:18.880]  and the monopoly over opium brought into the US by one company based out of New York was
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:23.160]  over so their prices were dropping. And so they just made opium illegal and then they
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:29.280]  ship it in illegally. And it's the same thing. Everything is about monopolies. Go ahead.
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:35.800]  Say this. The price of my fridge was that I have to buy the cause of government action,
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:40.600]  not because the government forces has more than quadrupled in about the last six years.
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:45.200]  And I felt awful. Some of the bills will have to give some of these elderly people for this
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:50.000]  repair work. I think the cause of it and it's going to culminate to some people are just
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:54.640]  not going to be able to afford air conditioning. I know it's going to come to that. I know
[1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:59.200]  for all. And they lied and said it was eating the atmosphere. Also, they could get a new
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:05.960]  patent on the other products they came out with. And that is nothing compared to what
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:10.800]  the third. Do you understand, sir, that official numbers are a billion people will starve to
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:16.040]  death a billion extra in the next 10 years under this climate deal? I mean, the people
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:21.680]  supporting this are murderers. And I want everyone to know these are murdering scum.
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:25.760]  We have to more than hate them. We have to defeat them. I mean, how much do you dislike
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.080]  this scum, Clay, that is going to cut off the food and energy to the entire third world?
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:37.160]  Well, to me, it just seems like people's apathy is the problem. Apathy and just and the media
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:42.480]  just keeping people so dumb. For more, I see if that's the way it appears.
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:46.800]  I agree. I mean, I was looking at Americans last night when I was picking up some food,
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:51.200]  some Mexican food, bringing it home to my family, and they were all like children. They all
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:56.120]  talk like children. They just think the world's a fun, sweet, little, lovey land, and the
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:58:02.680]  government loves them. They have no idea, no idea just what type of evil we are faced
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:11.520]  with. Well, thank you for taking my call. Well, God bless you, Clay. I appreciate your
[1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:14.200]  call. We're going to come back and talk to Danny Michael and a few others. And then I'm
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:25.080]  going to get our first guest up from Copenhagen today via video skypeforprisonplanet.tv viewers.
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:29.080]  I just pray every night that God help me be strong and fight these people as best I can
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:34.440]  and that we all be given discernment and that we all be made to be vessels against tyranny.
[1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:38.360]  Please God, just help us beat these people. Please don't let them murder more people.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:45.240]  Just help us defeat them. America's number one source for independent talk radio for

[1:59:57.800 --> 2:00:11.880]  Radio Network. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well
[2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:21.000]  so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:27.660]  Jones. We are live. Coming up in T-minus 40 minutes, Lord Christopher Monkton will be
[2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:34.680]  joining us to deal with the story in the video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:39.620]  Brown shirt, youth cores invade Monkton's speech. They didn't come up and ask questions
[2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:45.040]  like we are changed and the Tea Parties do of Al Gore and then are drug off. They took
[2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:49.640]  over and tried to shut the event down. This is openly funded by George Soros and the Rockefeller
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:59.120]  Foundation. Absolutely amazing. That is coming up. From Copenhagen, Patrick Henningson will
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:05.360]  be popping in with us in the next segment, also reporting on what's happening there.
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:09.840]  And here is the financial post, one of the biggest papers in Canada. I see these articles
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:16.880]  every day in mainstream newspapers in the U.S., England, Europe, Canada, Australia, New
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:23.000]  Zealand. Headline, the real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.320]  policy. A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:35.080]  global birth rate currently. Now, that is what's behind all the phony environmentalism.
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:39.880]  That's why they listed carbon dioxide that humans exhale as a toxic waste. That's why
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:46.760]  the EPA is telling Congress, we're your boss, which is upside down, but backwards. And we
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:52.960]  are going to, quote, have a command and control system over you. That reprint me that article
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:59.280]  about command and control. Please, thank you. This will result in the deaths of more than
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:06.040]  a billion people in the first decade of these climate cuts. Now we have the secret text,
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:10.280]  which the Guardian has reported Israel, the UN is very upset that they plan to double the
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:16.640]  taxes on the third world, not the first world. That will result in more than a billion deaths.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:22.200]  The tiny cuts that were set up would result in a billion. Fifteen million people starved
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:27.920]  to death a year conservatively, conservatively. This will bring that up to numbers that dwarf
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:33.920]  it. I mean, this is murder, murderers. You are murderers. You put truly wearing fake,
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:38.840]  liberal brainwashed cult members who follow the religion of eugenics and go around preaching
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:48.360]  that humans are evil and parasites. You are murderers, murderers. And they sold the mindless
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:52.600]  left, the low level idiots that, oh, we're doing this to help the third world. We'll
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:58.640]  give them our tax money from the West. It's the opposite of that. It is private banks
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:03.480]  taking all of our money and going in and saying, you've got to do this and that, or we won't
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  give your government's money and the governments keep the money. Let's talk to Danny in Pennsylvania.
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:11.480]  Danny, you're on the air.
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:16.840]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call. I know time is short. I just want to say you're
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:21.680]  an inspiration to us all and hopefully people will awake. I have a quick question that I
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:27.520]  always wanted to ask you. Is there footage, video footage of the plane being shot down
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:33.920]  over Shanksville, Pennsylvania? No, the state police reported F-16s and explosions and the
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:40.120]  debris field was eight and a half miles long and all the local eyewitnesses said explosions
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:47.040]  in the air and the tiny debris field at Shanksville was just one engine in the ground. Okay.
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:53.880]  My other question, currently who's more powerful? Henry Kissinger or Zabrinsky? Now I know Zabrinsky
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:59.400]  will put Obama in the office if not Prime Minister. Henry Kissinger. Okay, that's interesting
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:05.000]  because doing research on him, he's actually wanted for war crimes, I believe, in other
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:11.840]  countries. Is that correct? Yes. And at this event, Maury Strong is also wanted for oil
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:18.880]  for food, robbing the money that was supposed to go to the Iraqi people for himself. These
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:26.720]  are ultimate criminals. Everywhere they go is starvation and death and murder. And they
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:31.160]  all just liberal around going, I'm liberal, I'm liberal. I'm the thinking man's thinking
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:38.560]  man. I'm your eco profit. I'm so smart. I invented the internet. I invented the automobile.
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:46.360]  I invented the wheel. I'm Al Fraud Gore. Appreciate your call, Danny. Michael, Chris, Rick, Daniel
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:51.880]  and others. Your calls are coming up and our first guest from Copenhagen today as we track
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:05:01.000]  the criminal activities of the globalist trying to contain my anger right now. This is Alex
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.960]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:10.240]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:14.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:19.800]  have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:24.280]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:30.240]  overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[2:05:30.240 --> 2:05:34.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:39.080]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:43.240]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:47.560]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:08.440]  tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:13.400]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:18.200]  through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:24.160]  and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:31.080]  nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:35.400]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:41.120]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:46.520]  to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple. Go to

[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:22.840]  We're Griffin in studio coming up. Board Moncton coming up for a brief report on this Thursday
[2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:29.680]  edition. Other guests as well. Jam packed. We are simulcasting the radio show right now
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:37.960]  at prisonplanet.tv. I wanted to get Patrick Henningson, who was a mainline environmental
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:43.400]  activist involved trying to save the rainforest. And then he would try to go talk to these
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:47.840]  globalist organizations about, well, if we sell carbon credits, can we, you know, use
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:51.920]  this to buy up rainforest, which he was able to do. And they said, no, this isn't about
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:09:00.360]  that. It's about money. And now in the Copenhagen Treaty, we learned two days ago that they
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:05.440]  plan on cutting double the emissions in the third world and in the first world, which
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:10.360]  will admittedly kill more than a billion people. Billions and billions of people are on the
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:16.560]  edge of starvation. 15 plus million starve to death every year. The globalist state in
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:21.720]  their own textbooks. They want to use starvation and war. State Department memorandum 200 to
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:27.560]  do this. All of you hippies and fake liberals and trendies. Don't you notice all the oil
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:32.880]  companies are on the news financing the hope and hog and garbage. Don't you notice that
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:37.840]  the NFL's behind it and all the media is behind it. The IMF and World Bank. Now it turns out
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:43.520]  we'll control all the money. The big central banks that have raped the third world. They've
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:48.680]  got all these fake spray painted hope and hog and signs up everywhere that are meant
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:54.200]  to look like grass roots all over Copenhagen to make it look like it's grass roots and
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:10:01.200]  from the people. This is a global revolution against the people. And there's no more time
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:06.840]  for denial in all the UN documents and all the plans. They state that once this grid's
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:13.440]  in place they want to bankrupt industrialized society to force you to only have one child.
[2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:18.760]  Then they say they're going to phase that out next and put taxes on even one child. Financial
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:26.200]  post of Canada today. We see these every day. Ladies and gentlemen, I am knee deep in the
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:33.160]  documentation. These people are Nazis. The real inconvenient truth. The planetary law
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.320]  such as China's one child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:44.520]  rate. Then there's the whole fraud of that. The UN's own numbers show that by 2022 that
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:50.880]  the Earth's population will plane off at 8.2 to 8.7 billion. Then it will start drastically
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:54.920]  falling. If they ever allowed the third world to industrialize, even the British Royal Commission
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:59.200]  of 1949 said this, that would have caused a massive population reduction, even if you
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:04.240]  believe we're overpopulated. Because in industrialized countries on average have a 1.3 population
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:10.120]  replacement. Two parents, two baby boomers have on average 1.3 children. That number's
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:18.280]  even dropping faster in Italy and Japan. Approaching one, not 1.3. Many cities in Germany are half
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:23.360]  empty. The West is collapsing. Russia's lost 40 million of its people just through lack
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:32.960]  of replacement. This is all happening. This is all going on. This is eugenics. It's not
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:41.120]  about whales and buffaloes. Please wake up. All right. I want to go to Patrick Henningson
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:46.040]  and we had on yesterday, but we had to cut him short. I wanted him to recap the story
[2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:49.400]  of how he's a real environmental activist that found out the truth, what he's seen the
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:55.560]  last 24 hours in Copenhagen. Lord Monkton's talk being taken over by Brownshirts and also
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:57.800]  plugged some of his websites. Good to have you here, Patrick.
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:02.920]  It's good to be with you, Alex. How are you doing?
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:07.360]  Knowing that the cuts, look, it was going to kill a billion people with the moderate
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:12.480]  cuts in the third world. Now those cuts are many times what they were. This death sentence,
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:17.440]  and we're not just saying that. This is a guaranteed death sentence for tens of millions
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:23.320]  of people a year. And I just want to make all the fake hippies that are supporting this
[2:12:23.320 --> 2:12:30.240]  go look at the death. I want them to go see the dead skeletons of those little children.
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:31.560]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:39.760]  No. Well, firstly, I know that the UN spent tens and tens of thousands of dollars branding
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.920]  the Copenhagen Summit as hope in Hagen, but I won't take credit for this, but Christopher
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:50.760]  Monkton recoined the conference the other day, and it's in our film, which is online. And
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:55.120]  I think we should call it dope in Hagen from here on out, because that's exactly what you're
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:56.120]  looking at.
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:03.520]  Scanning Hagen. Death of Hagen. Murder Hagen. Slavery Hagen.
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:08.680]  We spent the last couple of days speaking to people from the developing world. Scientists,
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:13.520]  we're going to be speaking to the parliamentary members of Mozambique tomorrow to talk about
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:19.280]  how this is the whole Copenhagen Summit is really kind of a ruse. They're using the developing
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:24.080]  world to get people to and left, you know, the left wingers and the environmentalists
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:27.800]  of the activists that, you know, really feel sorry about the plight of people in Africa,
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:32.200]  but really the developing world is the one who's going to get the short end of this stick.
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:36.960]  Look, you've got to go to the African delegation and go, you know, the IMF and World Bank of
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:42.720]  Rapejuu by design. Their documents have been published since 2002, how they do it by design.
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:46.920]  They are going to get all this tax money and use it to further deindustrialize you. That
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:48.600]  is in the treaty.
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:55.920]  Now, we spoke to, we went down to the pit of the beast, which was the outside of the
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:14:00.240]  summit. They have something called the climate forum, which is really where all this sort
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:04.960]  of anarchists and traditional left wing activists that get imported into the internet.
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:10.800]  Let's call them Nazi murderers. People that want to slaughter the third world, degenerate
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:17.480]  foundation, banker-funded, fake, left-cover opposition, the absolute most dangerous people
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:18.480]  on earth.
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:19.480]  Go ahead.
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:24.520]  No, granted, you're right, Alex. You know, some of these are, there are provocateurs woven
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:30.360]  into this, but the overwhelming majority of these sort of people are, you know, middle-class
[2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:37.080]  dropouts. They're sort of the, if you will, the hired Hessians of the left that come in
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:42.480]  for any event. We saw them at the G20 in London wearing ballet collavas, not really knowing
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:45.920]  why they're there, but they're there, you know, just because they want to bring capitalism
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:47.480]  down or something like this.
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:52.840]  Now, it's very dangerous because we asked about a couple of dozen people, a simple question,
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:56.600]  which is going to be in our film, which we're going to post online in the next couple days.
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:01.080]  If you had the choice, if you had $500 billion in your hand today, and you had the choice
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:06.400]  to either eliminate poverty in Africa and provide clean water for third world countries
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:12.920]  or to combat climate change, which might happen in 100 or 50 or 200 years, 10 out of 10 of
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:19.080]  the people who were from Europe or America, they said, well, I think climate change is
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:22.400]  more important than, you know, saving lives today in Africa.
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:27.640]  Because it's their religion. It's, I mean, that is in eco science that, well, we're
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:32.120]  atheists, but people have got to have a religion. We're going to make climate change a new religion.
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:39.480]  Sure. And people were espousing this idea of a utopia where, well, you know, people,
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:44.000]  200,000 people, you're dying because of climate change in Africa. I don't know where these
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:47.480]  figures come from or how they, you know, sea levels are not rising.
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:49.840]  Those numbers are as real as Man Bear Pig.
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:55.760]  Yeah. The earth is not getting warmer. I don't see how climate change is killing people
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:01.680]  in Africa. Now, we spoke to Africans and almost every single African we spoke to said, no,
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:06.520]  I will take that $500 billion and I will eliminate poverty and provide clean water and lower
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:12.640]  infant mortality, eliminate malaria. These are the priorities for us. So, you know, this
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:18.000]  just pretty much tells the tale of the sort of divide we have. It's a divide of reality
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  out.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.760]  Well, notice that's the master stroke of the globalist. It's always the opposite of what
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:26.480]  they say. They go, oh, this is to free the third world, help the poor by cutting off
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:31.880]  all their energy. But see, they only announced that, well, it came out from the secret document
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:35.720]  two days ago. They were going to spring that at the last minute. Are any of these fools
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:41.440]  understanding that cutting off the energy to the third world is not going to help them?
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:46.240]  You know, it's really, it comes down to, and it was really frustrating. You know, we're
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:50.640]  trying to interview people. I think a nauseous feeling in my stomach, like, I can't really
[2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:55.280]  do this anymore. There's nothing that we can really say to get people to really listen
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:00.560]  to the sort of the wider picture. And, you know, it comes down to this. It's mass psychology,
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:05.560]  Alex. You know, the, to any of these people one-on-one for any length of time, I show
[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:11.120]  them climate gate. I talk about the IPC shortcomings. I talk about the fact that there is a global
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:15.520]  decline in temperature. You can actually get them to open their mind, and they will come
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:20.000]  around. But when you're talking to people, briefly talking to groups of people, groups
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.440]  of people, the Nazis understood mass psychology really well.
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:30.160]  I think some of these same principles, you know, hope, change, save the planet, these
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:35.120]  sort of mass concepts really work on well on a mass scale. And so this battle that we're
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:39.760]  going to have to fight is going to be one, one mind at a time. It's going to be one one
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:44.160]  person at a time. And if everybody goes out and does a little bit, gets proactive, talks
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:48.560]  to their neighbors, talks to their family, talks to their coworkers, and wins this battle,
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:53.280]  one person at a time, eventually, when you turn a mind, when a mind is woken up, it will
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:54.680]  never go to sleep again.
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:18:00.760]  Well, Patrick, let me ask you this question. It's been reported that the third world countries,
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:05.360]  the developing countries are freaking out over the text of the treaty that states they
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:09.920]  have to make most the cuts and that it's an IMF World Bank private system that's going
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:15.000]  to run it. Do they understand that the previous smaller cuts, we're going to kill a billion
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:20.080]  people over the next decade? Do they understand this is even more monstrous? I mean, do these
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:27.680]  feel good, lazy, trust-fund punks realize that they're having a hand in mass murder?
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:34.680]  It's difficult. You know, a lot of the people who are activists and who come to these events
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:39.400]  or who are sort of green warriors as it were, they're really like holdouts from the beat
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:45.360]  generation, just a sort of updated version of it. And, you know, what you're talking
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:50.160]  about, Alex, are facts. You're talking about real documents. You're reading the U.N. Agenda
[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:56.280]  21. These are things that are publicly available that everybody can go and see. And the types
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:01.160]  of people who are kind of going along with what I would term as a collectivist movement
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:05.360]  is really what it is. It's wanting to get rid of, we need to get rid of intellectual
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:10.800]  property, no more patents. Everything needs to be free and open source and we need a green
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:11.800]  revolution.
[2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:17.960]  But again, that's the candy-coding of the fake left. At the core, it's all one powerful
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:20.800]  private central bank that will own everything.
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:26.520]  Absolutely. And I think that came out with the Danish text leaks is pretty much, they
[2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:27.760]  showed their true colors.
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:32.240]  So is that hurting the conference? I mean, is it in disarray? I'm reading a lot of countries
[2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:33.920]  are saying they're not going to sign on now.
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:39.240]  It is. It is. We saw the early part of this morning when people, all the different countries
[2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:45.600]  are making their comments. And all these small countries like Equatorial New Guinea and Mozambique
[2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:50.160]  and they don't have nearly the political clout that the United States or the European countries
[2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:54.600]  have, but they already see through what is probably...
[2:19:54.600 --> 2:20:01.360]  Good. Stay there. I want to come back, talk about what else is happening.
[2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:06.320]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:12.680]  company? Don't. Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands. Why pay? When you can get
[2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:18.440]  their solution, absolutely free. With New York Times' best-selling author, Herb Kaye's
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:24.320]  number one debt secret. The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:28.760]  Yes. Free for a very limited time. Here's Herb Kaye.

[2:20:32.760 --> 2:20:34.920]  to do it yourself for free.
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:39.120]  Herb Kaye was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:44.440]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money. Get

[2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:07.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:09.240]  chance to not relive history.
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:13.840]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:21:13.840 --> 2:21:14.840]  at home.
[2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:19.880]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:20.880]  the shots.
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:25.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:31.320]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:36.040]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:40.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:42.400]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:48.400]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:49.400]  of the Republic.
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:55.600]  Yet you're copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online

[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:30.200]  It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig.
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:38.200]  Well, I'm here to tell you now that man bear pig is very real and he will certainly exist.
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:53.200]  Boys, there's no such thing as a man bear pig. I'm talking, of course, about man bear pig.
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:25:21.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen. Play a little more of that clip than I wanted to. For some
[2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:25.800]  of the older audience that don't know what South Park is, they had an old episode making
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:32.240]  fun of Al Gore and his fair mongering about the man bear pig. Half man, half bear, half
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:40.280]  pig. And it's as real as man made global warning. But it's not funny how many third world people
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:43.760]  they're going to kill and how many middle class people and poor people they're going
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:49.080]  to ruin here in the United States. In closing with Patrick Henningson, filmmaker, you've
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:52.680]  already released some YouTube clips of interviews you've done. Give us some of the names of
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:57.040]  those clips for folks that want to go find them. You're making a short film about Copenhagen
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:00.920]  that's going to be out in the next few days. Tell us about that, Patrick. And I would guess
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:06.240]  you haven't been able to videotape the man bear pig, the mythical mermaid type creature
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:11.160]  that Al Gore's been warning us about. We've been looking for him all over Copenhagen and
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:14.960]  we've spent most of our time trying to track down the man bear pig, but we haven't had
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:22.160]  any luck. What we have discovered, though, is Al Gore is basically captain of a ship.
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:27.880]  And what I can say to real green activists and real environmentalists is that you are
[2:26:27.880 --> 2:26:34.000]  on a Titanic, which is captained by Al Gore. And I advise people to get off that ship before
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.140]  you hit the iceberg of truth. Because if you do, everybody's going to go down who's
[2:26:39.140 --> 2:26:44.840]  on that ship. And it's bad for the science, the whole practice of science is under threat
[2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:51.400]  and real environment is under threat, along with all the other things that you mentioned.
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:54.840]  We're going to have that in our film. We've got a three-part film that's very educational,
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:27:01.200]  which we'll have up on YouTube tonight. It'll be at 21st Century Wire TV on YouTube and
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:06.680]  we'll also hopefully have a link at 21stCenturyWire.com. And then we're doing a more intensive
[2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:10.640]  film over the next week, which we need to spend time to hunker down.
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:16.840]  Give that website out again slowly for people because you're doing groundbreaking work.
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:27.560]  It's at www.21stCenturyWire.com. And on YouTube, just go to 21stCenturyWireTV and you'll see
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:32.520]  some of the videos and there'll be some coming out, a few more coming out over the next few
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:39.840]  days. But the big news in Copenhagen yesterday was Lisa Jackson from the EPA gave a speech
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:47.760]  to a rouse of applause, basically saying that the EPA under the Clean Air Act of 2007 will
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:54.200]  be able to regulate the poisonous gas of carbon dioxide without the approval or without the
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:59.920]  associate of Congress. So it's basically a runaround, the democratic process, saying
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:06.040]  that it doesn't matter if Congress and Senate pass the cap and trade bill. We're going to
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:10.160]  regulate greenhouse gases anyway. When they say greenhouse gases, they're not talking
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:15.000]  about really dangerous gases. They're talking about carbon dioxide, which we all know.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.640]  If they were calling for an international agreement that wasn't a global taxation system
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:26.240]  to private banks that would demand study before they open air plant or release cross species
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:31.680]  animals and plants, that's what's already causing rogue viruses. And I mean, that's
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:38.560]  what's really dangerous. That's what can really mess up our planet. Nanotech getting
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:43.920]  loose. I mean, that's what the real evidence shows is serious. The superconducting super
[2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:50.640]  collider, the mega cyclotron, the Hadron collider, their own scientists admit that that makes
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:57.040]  hydrogen bombs look like tinker toys and could destroy the planet. But no control over anything
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:01.680]  real. No control over overfishing. I mean, there are some real environmental things.
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:05.400]  The global government could care less about that. You know, I found out Prince Bernhard,
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:11.920]  founder of the big environmental group, World Wildlife Fund, the Nazi and founder of Bilderberg.
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:18.480]  He openly used his environmental front for elephant hunting and making money off tusk.
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:22.360]  He was caught doing that. He would try to overthrow third world countries. These guys
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:29.040]  are hardcore criminals. We went down to the WWF World Wildlife Fund. They've got a little
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:33.160]  camp down in the center of Copenhagen. And who's sponsoring the World Wildlife Fund?
[2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:39.320]  None other than Coca-Cola. And Coca-Cola has done more to destroy environments and third
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:43.600]  worlds in India. Now it's incredible. Look, look, look, the big polluting corporations
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:48.560]  run this whole deal so they can tax us for air and then ignore all the real environmental
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:53.880]  crises. Great job, Patrick Henningson. God bless you. We're on the march. The empire's
[2:29:53.880 --> 2:30:03.760]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to
[2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:09.360]  tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:13.680]  we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:19.160]  at home. They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress. And they really
[2:30:19.160 --> 2:30:24.920]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:30.160]  attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short
[2:30:30.160 --> 2:30:35.800]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:40.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:44.520]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:50.800]  now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Full of
[2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:57.600]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality

[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:09.600]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:31:09.600 --> 2:31:15.200]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[2:31:15.200 --> 2:31:19.760]  food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after
[2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:24.200]  the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:28.280]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and
[2:31:28.280 --> 2:31:32.640]  you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe
[2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:37.560]  out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight
[2:31:37.560 --> 2:31:42.840]  for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want?
[2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:47.880]  All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[2:33:25.560 --> 2:33:30.800]  Well, in studio with us for the next hour is the one and only, G. Edward Griffin, author
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:35.560]  of The Creature from Jekyll Island, filmmaker fighting the globalists for more than 40 years.
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:40.560]  He's here in Austin to give several speeches. We'll tell you about that before he leaves
[2:33:40.560 --> 2:33:45.480]  us. We apologize if we forget Lord Moncton on with him for about 5-10 minutes. It was
[2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:48.600]  the only time Lord Moncton can do it. He was on with us for a full hour or more than an
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:56.840]  hour, just the other day. But there has been a new event where Brownshirt Youth Corps from
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:01.020]  the Rockefeller Foundation and, of course, George Soros funded groups, they're admittedly
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:05.400]  with them, came and took over his speech today, completely shut it down. Didn't go like we
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:09.480]  are changing, ask questions in the press conference, and then drug out. No, they just came and
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:13.640]  took over and no one could stop them because Lord Moncton doesn't have all the big oil
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:18.280]  company security people like Al Gore does, who owns, by the way, Occidental Petroleum
[2:34:18.280 --> 2:34:22.520]  and it's one of the biggest people cutting down the rainfars. But that's how the scam
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:27.160]  works. So that is coming up here in the next 10 minutes. Lord Moncton should be joining
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:32.040]  us. If not, it'll be in the next hour. But G. Ebert Griffin, I feel like I've know you
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:36.640]  so well. I believe the first time that we've met in person, unless my memory fails me,
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:38.840]  it is great to have you sitting here in the flesh.
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:43.560]  Well, thank you. It's good to be here, Alex. We did meet once before. In fact, I was on
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:45.640]  your show when you had the old facility.
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:49.960]  That's right. You were in studio before. I was having this deja vu moment. No, no, I
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:54.800]  just watched so much video. I can't tell anymore. I apologize. We have met.
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:55.800]  It's good to be here.
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:56.800]  Well met, my friend.
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:35:01.720]  Yes, indeed. And I really like your studio. I understand you're doing so well in that.
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:05.080]  It's so encouraging because while the earth seems to be falling apart, you're one of
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:06.520]  the bright hoax out there.
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:13.600]  Well, we're small, but we're a fly on the end of the New World Order's behind, but
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:14.600]  we're irritating them.
[2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:17.840]  It's more like a, like a mosquito.
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:21.800]  Yeah, but we're injecting cyanide into their lies.
[2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  Yes.
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:26.120]  Hey, would you like to bow down to Al Gore Newsweek, the earth's profit, the thinking
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:27.120]  man's thinking man?
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:31.320]  Oh, how did they spell that? I would have spelled it differently.
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:35.680]  Well, how would you spell it with an S and a T?
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:43.400]  It's amazing how the media can mytholize things like that. I think Al Gore has lost
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:49.320]  his charm. I think he's lost a lot of the aura of being infallible. Of course, he has
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:53.400]  a loyal following. You can't beat that. They'll follow him right over the edge of the earth,
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:54.400]  if necessary.
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:58.800]  But I think most of the people were sort of in that great middle zone where they weren't
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:04.000]  sure whether there was global warming or not. But since Al Gore was saying there was,
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  they went with it.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.280]  Now they know that this whole climb a gate thing is blowing all of that apart. So I think
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:10.280]  progress is being made.
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:11.280]  That's the bottom line.
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:15.400]  Absolutely. G. Edward Griffin with us in studio Lord Moncton coming up to pop in a little
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:21.880]  while with us. The climate gate and now the leaked Danish text, the actual treaty that
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:26.480]  the U.S. and others wanted to sign, doubles or right at doubles the amount of taxes on
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:30.520]  the third world and it's meant to destroy their development. All these major newspapers
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:35.760]  like the financial post calling for, quote, Chinese style global authority to enforce
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:40.520]  one child policy. Isn't that from your research and give us your take on it? The heart of
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:42.320]  what this is really all about.
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:46.520]  I think it's very close to the heart. Yes, not only the control of the population and
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:52.040]  reproductive rates, but it's the control of all aspects of human endeavor. And you know,
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:36:56.720]  it's the old story. Your listeners know it so well, Alex, that in order to convince the
[2:36:56.720 --> 2:37:00.720]  people of the world that they should give up their freedom and they should accept these
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:05.520]  draconian measures over their lives, you have to scare them. You have to convince them
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:10.440]  that there's something very terrible going to happen, either terrorism or crime or drugs
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:17.360]  or overpopulation or whatever it is, a destruction of the of the planet so that people will be
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:23.240]  so grateful when these politicians come along and propose various types of legislation that's
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:26.000]  going to take away their freedom. But they don't worry about your freedom. We're going
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:30.400]  to save your life. We're going to save the planet. You know, it's the old game has been
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:35.560]  going on and on for almost a hundred years.
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:38.720]  You know, reading the treaty, which I have here in front of me, the state global government,
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:43.800]  Von Roompi, the head of the EU, says his world government, Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, Secretary
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:48.960]  of General Rights editorial saying it's world government. They're announcing that the Copenhagen
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:56.040]  Global Treaty, a tax on all financial transactions, a 2 percent tax on the GDP off the top, taxes
[2:37:56.040 --> 2:38:00.360]  on all fuel, they admit this will devastate the third world and they actually want to
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:05.120]  shut down their development, which will actually make them continue to have all these children.
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:09.600]  All the studies show once you're industrialized, you start having less children than you did
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:15.040]  before and the replacement rate drops to 1.3 children instead of more than two children
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:16.680]  per group of adults.
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:23.480]  Well, I think the mistake is made when the public gives credence to the motives of what
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:28.120]  these people are doing. They're always saying they're going to control the birth rate in
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:33.480]  order to decrease the population explosion. And supposedly, you know, this is for the
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:37.600]  benefit of mankind. They're going to control us in this way or that way and it's always
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:43.000]  for the benefit of mankind. It's for our own good, supposedly. But in reality, we shouldn't
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:47.080]  give them credence for that because that's never been their motive. Their motive is really
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:53.440]  just raw control over human beings. So I don't think it makes much sense to listen to what
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:59.800]  these people are saying. They're always distorting the truth. So what more can I say on that?
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:04.720]  This is sort of like preaching to the choir here. I think that your listeners certainly
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:11.760]  know that very well. But what can I say in addition to that, that we have to really think
[2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:15.760]  about the master plan behind all of this. And the master plan really has nothing to
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:22.560]  do with controlling the temperature or climate control or preventing overpopulation or none
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:26.480]  of that. That's just smoke screen. That's just propaganda to make us think that they're
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:29.080]  good guys and they're really looking out for us.
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:33.120]  Well, the colonial neo-colonial system of the IMF and World Bank coming in that you talk
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:38.640]  about so much, loaning our tax money at loan sharking rates where Nigeria gets a billion
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:44.840]  dollar loan and today they've paid over 60 billion back on that 1 billion. The IMF and
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:48.800]  World Bank don't want to help the third world and they've sold this. Oh, global taxes on
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:53.880]  all carbon to save the third world. And they've told the liberals it's to help the Africans
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:57.800]  and the Latin Americans when in truth it will admittedly starve even more people.
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:02.440]  Of course, that's what I'm saying. You can't listen to what these people are saying their
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:07.520]  motives are. They really want control. That's what it's all about. When will the American
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:12.400]  people wake up to the fact that these leaders, both national and international, have one
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.040]  thing in mind and only one thing and that's control over human beings? That's the bottom
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:21.080]  line and all this other talk is nonsense.
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:25.840]  Tell us about what you're doing in Austin and then I want to get into the treating more
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:29.760]  of the establishment of world government, how long they've been working at this and
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:33.080]  where you think they are in this plan because it seems that they're trying to accelerate
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:37.000]  their program because so many people are waking up to them. But I want to get your take on
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:40.440]  that. But tell us about some of the events you're going to be holding here in Austin.
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.000]  Well I'm here, Alex, and thanks for asking me on that. I'm here to do a seminar. We call
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:49.880]  it a crash course on money. And just as the name suggests, it has two meetings for the
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:55.640]  word crash. It's a crash course in the sense that it's condensed. We do it all in one day
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:01.680]  from 9 a.m. till 8 p.m. It's all done. So it's a crash course. But also it's based
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:06.720]  on the recognition that we're in a crash economy and people particularly want to know not just
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:11.640]  about money but how to protect the money they already have from being confiscated through
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:17.400]  inflation, what kind of investments to make, if any, our good investments, and how to get
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.640]  out of debt and all the various aspects of how to protect yourselves. And also we're
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:26.920]  taking a look at the long-term strategies of how to protect your children and your grandchildren.
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:31.760]  So we're not just focused on the money side of it but the system side of it. We believe
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:35.920]  very firmly that if you don't preserve the system, it won't make any difference because
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:39.960]  you won't have any money anyway. So that's what we're doing. It's a crash course on money.
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:44.600]  And I hope that if anybody's interested in hearing my views on that, they'll come out.
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:51.560]  It's being held on Saturday right here in Austin. Let's see. It's at the Marriott. Maybe
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:55.920]  during the break, I can get my assistant to give me the address and all that, but the
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:42:01.840]  folks can also just go to your website. Oh, that's the better way. Yes. Go right to realityzone.com.
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:05.120]  And when they get to the landing page, there will be a big banner talking about the crash
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:08.200]  course. Right. And we're going to talk about your event you've got coming up tonight in
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:15.520]  just a moment. But we now turn in just a moment to Lord Christopher Monkton. And while he's
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:20.960]  speaking, we're going to show you some video without the audio of the disruptors. Now,
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:25.000]  the difference is with the Tea Parties and We Are Change, they go to Al Gore events, buy
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:29.640]  a book, go up and say, sir, what about climate gain? What about you lying about carbon dioxide
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:34.160]  rising and then temperatures rising when it's actually opposite? Sir, what about you making
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:38.880]  all this money off of this? And then they get drug out at this event in Copenhagen. Lord
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:44.000]  Christopher Monkton, one of the chief people exposing the manmade climate fraud had one
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.860]  of their little events. This is David having an event against the Goliath groups funded
[2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:52.800]  by George Soros. We have an article about this at prisonplanet.com Brown shirt youth
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:43:00.520]  corps invade Monkton speech. And we have the article here with the groups that are funded
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:06.360]  by Soros and the Rockefellers and others and by the UN there taking over, not letting him
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:10.400]  have a speech. And of course, Monkton is it funded by the powers that be so he didn't
[2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:15.120]  have thugs there to beat everyone up and drag them off. So they just took it over showing
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:20.760]  how they're a group of jackboots. And now we have the national post calling for a planetary
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:26.000]  regime for one child policy. They admit cutting off the food will reduce population. That
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:30.600]  is the goal. So hence these are Nazis joining us is Lord Christopher Monkton. Thank you
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:35.960]  for coming on today, sir. Very good to be with you, Alex. Well, this is outrageous. Please
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:43.040]  tell us what these green, these green shirts slash brown shirts did. Well, we were having
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:47.920]  a meeting with Americans for prosperity. I've been asked to come and give a speech about
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:52.480]  what was in the Copenhagen agreement. It's no longer a treaty now they've downgraded
[2:43:52.480 --> 2:43:55.400]  it to an agreement because they know they can't get a treaty through the Senate. That's
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:44:00.240]  become very clear. So the whole thing is being driven by your constitution, which still has
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:04.000]  enough force in it to stop them getting away with everything they're after. But anyway,
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.960]  I was briefing them on what how this was going to be pushed through by Obama. He was going
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:12.160]  to sign it in Copenhagen. He was then going to put it before both houses of Congress,
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:17.880]  sign it through by a simple majority. He might even fail that now. But as I was beginning
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:24.400]  to speak, in walked or rather up jumped people who'd crept in and sat down quietly initially,
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:30.480]  and they began a kind of robotic Nazi chant. It was just like the Hitler Youth. And indeed
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:37.200]  the whole air of this Copenhagen conference has the stink of a Nuremberg rally about it
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:43.440]  just at the time when we had hoped that in Europe in the world that kind of sort of centralist
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:49.560]  propaganda and only one system of thought being committed had been swept away forever.
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:54.760]  Here it is reemerging no longer red, white and black, but now green is the color that
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:45:01.680]  you find on every banner trailing from a public building. Green is the color of the elaborate
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:06.920]  displays that the Nazis last used to have in all the main squares in Copenhagen. And
[2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:12.560]  now we have exactly the same kind of Nazi displays, but this time advertising climate
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:18.040]  change as the big enemy, just as in the old days it was Jews that were the big enemy.
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:22.840]  Well, frankly, this has begun to upset many people. We had a German person who was in
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:29.000]  our meeting. He was almost in tears by the end. He said, I never thought that I would
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:33.560]  see this. He said, I thought we were behind all that. I thought we would never again
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:40.400]  see the Hitler Jugend on the march indoctrinated by the party and only putting one point of
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:46.800]  view. He was really, really, really upset. And of course, that's how terrifying it is
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:54.040]  for all of us who are here to see the robotic drill with which these people simply talk
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:58.120]  slogans. None of them know any climate science. None of them know any economics. None of
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:04.080]  them understand policymaking. All of them have been told that the harmless trace gas
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:09.280]  without which every piece of life with a plant or animal on this planet would be dead is
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:13.840]  somehow a dangerous pollutant, which is going to set the planet on fire. It doesn't get
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:17.800]  more ludicrous or more frequently dangerous than that.
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:24.040]  But Lord Moncton, there is a sense of desperation by these people as more universities come
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:30.360]  out and are proven to be engaged in fraud via UN collusion, directing this. And I would
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:35.360]  like to use in the last few minutes we have with you to speak directly to the useful idiots,
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:42.000]  the same type that supported Lenin and Hitler and Mao to understand that the climate cuts
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  now in the treaty, the Danish text, will closely double more cuts in third world than
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:57.680]  the West has to make, and that this will devastate the third world. Many of the useful liberals
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:02.080]  believe this was actually a tax on the West to help the third world. Clearly the IMF and
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:07.120]  World Bank that have been caught engaged in predator activity against the third world
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:12.440]  have now been caught that this is all just a giant money-making scam. Can you speak directly
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:17.600]  to not just the same slogans as Nazis, but that this will result in the deaths of more
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:21.640]  people than the Nazis killed, if implemented?
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:26.400]  Let me quote from the UN itself, just for one. There's a man called Herr Siegler who
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:32.920]  is the right to food, rapporteur for the UN. His job is to make sure that people are aware
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:39.360]  that there are folk starving around the world. And he said two years ago that the biofuel
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:46.720]  scam was an outrage. He said that to grow biofuels instead of growing food on agricultural
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:51.160]  land for people who needed to grow biofuels instead for clunkers that stand in the name
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:57.480]  of saving the planet. What you're doing is causing mass starvation, food riots in a dozen
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:03.520]  countries of the world, millions dying not because of climate change happening, but because
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:08.320]  of the sloganizing and the policies of these rich people who are manipulating this for their
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:13.720]  own profit. People dying now. And Herr Siegler said this. He said, at a time when so many
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:20.320]  are starving around the world, to divert agricultural land from growing food to growing biofuels
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:27.240]  is, and this is his word, a crime against humanity.
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:32.600]  Well said. I'm going to skip this break. We've only got a few minutes left with Lord Christopher
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:40.800]  Monkton. I mean, how did this end with them taking over your event vitriolically waving
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:46.480]  American flags when this treaty will destroy U.S. sovereignty, even mainstream news is
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:52.480]  saying the EPA coup of telling Congress, if you don't ratify this, we will quote, and
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:59.840]  this is ABC News and Reuters, we will quote, have a command and control system over you.
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:05.840]  How dare them flap American flags? That is an outrage. I agree. What happened
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:10.680]  was I simply went for the microphones which were directional so that I could still be heard
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:14.440]  in Pennsylvania and the other parts of the United States, all over the states, thousands
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:19.120]  of people linked in, and the chances could only be heard very distantly by them in the
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:22.880]  background. And eventually the chance has realized we were just carrying on with the
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:27.120]  meeting anyway, and they weren't getting anywhere. So in dribs and drabs, they filed
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:32.840]  out and quickly, rapidly disappeared, no doubt to report on what they thought was their triumph.
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:39.440]  But I saw them again this morning at their stand inside the conference center in the
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:44.200]  area where people could set up stands to say whatever they wanted to say, and they came
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:48.760]  rushing up to me and they said, how dare you call us Hitler youth, because German television
[2:49:48.760 --> 2:49:53.440]  had been there, they had interviewed me, and I had said, almost with tears in my eye, these
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:57.880]  people have behaved like the Hitler youth. How dare you call us Hitler youth, they said.
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:03.000]  Some of them said, I'm a Jew, how dare you call me Hitler youth. I said, if you ever
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  again, come in chanting moronic robotic slogan, and interrupt the right of free speech of
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:13.680]  others who happened to differ with you on a matter of public policy, then I will once
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:19.120]  again call you Hitler youth, for that is what you are. Never has such behavior been seen
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:24.280]  in Copenhagen since Hitler was in control of it. And if you behave in that way, I will
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:32.320]  call it like I see it. But aren't they Hitler youth, sir, because these policies will result
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:38.520]  in mass starvation and death, and have already resulted in that? That is the truth of the
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:42.320]  matter. I think it's probably fair to say, of course, it's very difficult to measure
[2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:46.920]  this, it's probably fair to say that more people have been killed by the green movement
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:51.120]  with this climate scam and the biofuels taking land out of agricultural production, doubling
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:56.920]  the price of food, pricing food out of the poor people's pockets. They simply can't afford
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:02.080]  to buy the food. They're living on mud pies made with real mud in Haiti, for Kevin's sake,
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:06.520]  and even they can't now afford the mud pies either because they've doubled in price thanks
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:13.120]  to the biofuels scam. And so, yes, we are now probably seeing more deaths arising from
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:18.160]  the behavior of the Hitler youth and more sinisterly, the people who are behind them
[2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:22.280]  and paying for them and indoctrinating them. Those are the ones we really need to track
[2:51:22.280 --> 2:51:27.160]  down and root out and shove in jail for the rest of their nasty little lives. Because
[2:51:27.160 --> 2:51:31.400]  we are killing people probably in larger numbers now than Hitler did when he killed
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:38.360]  the Jews by killing them of starvation because the West doesn't care about anything except
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:44.520]  some putative icicle dribbling somewhere in Greenland, all of which is entirely within
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:49.160]  the natural variability of the climate. As we now know from the Climate Gate emails,
[2:51:49.160 --> 2:51:53.920]  which expose the fraud that's been perpetrated by these scientists on the one hand, they're
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:58.360]  telling us only this week that this decade has been the warmest since records began
[2:51:58.360 --> 2:52:02.800]  150 years ago, which admittedly is not particularly a surprising conclusion because we've had
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:09.360]  300 years of global warming starting in 1695. However, what they are saying privately, whatever
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:13.160]  they're saying publicly, privately they're saying, there has indeed been, as I've been
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:17.320]  saying on your program and elsewhere for many years, we've had global cooling for many
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:23.040]  years. We've now had global cooling for nine full years. They're admitting this privately
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:28.640]  in these emails, a very recent one saying that to this, and they're saying it's a travesty
[2:52:28.640 --> 2:52:34.360]  that we can't explain it. I can explain it. It's very simple. CO2 doesn't have the warming
[2:52:34.360 --> 2:52:39.720]  effect. You've been pretending it does. You've been fooled by your own propaganda. Time to
[2:52:39.720 --> 2:52:45.360]  go back, get out the abacus and the counting stones, and do your sums again, and throw
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:51.520]  away those big fancy X-pop 360 models because they have been leading you astray, and get
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:57.200]  back to real science and real measurement. You will find that the outgoing radiation
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:01.720]  from the Earth's surface is escaping to space. We've admitted this just recently. Just as
[2:53:01.720 --> 2:53:05.720]  much as it always was, which means that the greenhouse gases we're putting in the atmosphere
[2:53:05.720 --> 2:53:10.480]  are having hardly any effect on that outgoing radiation at all, therefore it isn't staying
[2:53:10.480 --> 2:53:15.800]  down here to cause warming. QED, whatever is causing the warming, it certainly isn't
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:20.200]  CO2 except to a very, very tiny extent.
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:23.760]  Lord Mock, you gave us an hour earlier this week. I know you're very busy. I'm going to
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:27.920]  let you go. We also have G. Edward Griffin here in studio with us. In closing, I'd like
[2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:34.600]  you to give us your website. Then also, you sounded a bit pessimistic a few days ago.
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:40.040]  Now you sound buoyed saying that it looks like they're going to have to go the dictatorial
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:46.520]  bureaucratic way around the Constitution because even mainstream media is saying their fraud
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:51.680]  is imploding, especially with the Danish text of the treaty, saying the third world has
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:57.000]  to make right at double the cuts the West did, a bait and switch at the last minute.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:04.680]  So give us your website, please sir, and then in closing, please give us your report, brief
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:10.360]  synopsis, on things brightening a bit or was I wrong in inferring that from what you said?
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:16.920]  No, that's very good because the website first of all is scienceandpublicpolicy.org and I'm
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:23.680]  doing a more or less daily blog from the conference on scienceandpublicpolicy.org so you can get
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.600]  all the details of what's in this treaty, all the small print. It's all in there because
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:33.920]  I'm giving quite detailed results on that. The reason why I think I remain hopeful, apart
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:39.560]  from my religion which teaches us that we should always hope even in the darkest hour,
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:46.280]  but also I think it is very clear from the shrill hysteria of the propaganda here that
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:51.000]  these people know, the ones who are peddling this here in Copenhagen, they know this is
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:56.160]  the last chance for Lune, not for that planet, which was saved 2000 years ago and doesn't
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:02.320]  need to be saved again. But for them, they know that if they can't get what they want
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:07.320]  at Copenhagen, they will never get it again because the investigations into the climate
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:12.280]  gate emails are going to lead to criminal prosecutions, not only for destroying data
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:17.120]  which have been validly requested by other scientists to check all these bogus results,
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:24.640]  but also because these results, in fact, several of them, amount to scientific and financial
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:32.200]  fraud. And I've had two professors on to me, one from America, one from Canada, just in
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:36.840]  the last few days, saying they want me to put them in touch with the right policemen
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:42.280]  in the United Kingdom, and in fact, he's a police superintendent in East Anglia, in
[2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:47.560]  February, so that they can report how they were maneuvered, manipulated, had their papers
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:52.280]  tampered with, delayed publication, prevented publication, so they couldn't put alternative
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:57.040]  views. They had papers that should have been in the IPCC's reports suppressed, so they
[2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:01.400]  weren't considered. All of these games were going on, and all of these, in furtherance
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:07.200]  of what is now, quite clearly, the largest and worst financial fraud the world has ever
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:12.280]  seen. So if they don't get what they want at Copenhagen, they know they'll never get
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:16.480]  it later, because the fraud prosecutions and investigations will have started. If they do
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:21.680]  get what they want at Copenhagen, they won't be able to make it stick. Too many people
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:26.120]  now have cottoned onto the fraud, too many people, ordinary people, that is, people who
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:30.280]  are not in the governing class, the little guy rather than the big guy, the little guy
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.800]  has now woken up. And if a little guy stands together with the other little guy and just
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:38.480]  says, boo, the big guys will run a mile.
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:42.520]  Lord Christopher Monkton, then it's safe to say, with your astute political analysis
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.840]  of this, you know, but the heart of fighting this for more than two decades, that the heart
[2:56:46.840 --> 2:56:52.000]  of world government as Ban Ki-moon and Von Rumpi and all of them has said their global
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:58.280]  carbon tax dictatorship is hemorrhaging to death. And are you saying all the king's horses,
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:02.800]  all the king's men, if we the patriots for liberty continue to expose them, that all
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:08.520]  the king's horses, all the king's men can't put the lying fraud Al Gore back together
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:09.520]  again.
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:15.320]  That's right. I think Humphedum T'gore is now in pieces on the floor dribbling untidily.
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:20.920]  The fact that he has had to lie even about the date of the climate-kate emails where
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:25.400]  he's trying to say that they were all at least 10 years old when most of them weren't even
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:30.960]  once. I say some of them weren't even 10 days old. Clearly there is desperation there now.
[2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:36.680]  The fact that this serial liar is lying yet again, and this time about the climate-kate
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:42.880]  emails shows how utterly incredible and useless a figure he has now become. It's time for
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:48.960]  him to send back his Nobel Peace Prize. It's time for Obama to send back his Nobel Peace
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:54.880]  Prize, because the people who should have won it, let's take Irene Sandler, who was nominated
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:59.600]  for it the same year as Al Gore. You know what she did? When she was a kid, she taught
[2:57:59.600 --> 2:58:05.360]  herself plumbing so that she could go into the German ghetto with her huge toolbox of
[2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:10.720]  plumbing tools and into the Warsaw ghetto where the Jews were. She would then take one
[2:58:10.720 --> 2:58:17.400]  Jewish child every day in the bottom, in the hidden falls bottom, in her bag, and she got
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:22.480]  them out. She saved hundreds of little Jewish children's lives. That's what the Peace Prize
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:23.480]  should have been given.
[2:58:23.480 --> 2:58:27.040]  Well, we're trying to save the millions of Africans. They want to starve to death. Lord
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:30.520]  Monkton, thank you so much for the time. You've been gracious enough to say that before the
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:35.920]  conference ends, you'll pop back in again with us sometime next week. Be safe out there.
[2:58:35.920 --> 2:58:37.920]  These vipers are dangerous. God bless you.
[2:58:37.920 --> 2:58:42.920]  And God bless America.

[3:00:08.280 --> 3:00:13.400]  Well, we just did 15 minutes with Lord Christopher Mugton, and I appreciate J. Ebert Griffin happily
[3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:19.400]  letting him cut into his time. J. Ebert Griffin will be with us another 40 minutes. Then we
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:23.800]  have another guest from Copenhagen, Denmark joining us, Tom Harris, engineer, executive
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:28.520]  director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:34.160]  up to counter the lies of the UN and the IPCC. But T-minus 40 minutes with J. Ebert Griffin.
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:37.960]  Very exciting to hear from Lord Mugton about the victories we're having against the globalist.
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:42.160]  And now, new world order is admitted everywhere. Global government's admitted. It's admitted
[3:00:42.160 --> 3:00:47.040]  the IMF, Private Secretive World Bank, or to keep the money. I mean, this is a route
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:48.040]  of these criminals.
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:54.280]  Yeah, this message from Lord Mugton is most inspiring to me. It isn't often that you can
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:59.400]  look at the daily news and come up with something that makes you feel good. And I really enjoyed
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:05.880]  that. And I feel like doubling the effort today. He's quite a warrior, isn't he? And I don't
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:10.760]  know why I've never heard of him until recently. I guess he's been doing that job over on the
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:11.960]  other side for quite a while.
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:16.560]  He's always been traveling around. It's just that it finally hit the internet ages here.
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:22.880]  And plus, he was excusing from being frauds 10 years ago. But quickly before we get into
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:26.240]  a meat and potatoes, you also have an event at Bright New Books tonight, right?
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:31.160]  Yes. And that's just kind of a preview to the seminar on Saturday. Also, I'll be answering
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:34.960]  a lot of questions. Hope I'll be answering the questions anyway. I'll be getting a lot
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:36.360]  of them, I know.
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:40.080]  My intent is to do an update on the creature from Jackal Island, which is the title of
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:45.080]  the book on the Federal Reserve System, and put it into focus in terms of what's happening
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:51.400]  today in the economy. People want to know, you know, how did the Federal Reserve do this?
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:54.800]  What are they still doing? What are the plans for the future? I'll be talking about that
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:55.960]  tonight.
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:01:57.600]  And that's at 7 o'clock?
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:01:58.600]  7 o'clock.
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:04.120]  And that's down on Guadalupe Street at www.bravenewbooks.com. Or people can find out all the details
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:06.040]  at one of your great websites.
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:08.640]  It'll be realityzone.com.
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.120]  And find out about the hotel event and how to get tickets to that for Saturday.
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:13.360]  Yeah, that would be great.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:15.640]  It is not too late, folks, to get into that.
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:20.280]  Right. We expect a good crowd. So the earlier the reservation is made, the better off it
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:21.280]  will be.
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:23.960]  Yeah. And you're powerful on the stage. I mean, you're powerful in person, too, on
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:27.520]  my second time at Avonium Studio, but you're really powerful up there giving a speech.
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:32.840]  Well, thank you. I enjoy doing it and I have a message that I feel very passionate about.
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:37.120]  So I guess I just worry about the message and forget about the speech.
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:40.840]  You know, every time you're on, I get all these emails from women who just love your
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:41.840]  voice.
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:44.240]  Oh, really? Why don't they send me the emails?
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:48.040]  That's the way it works.
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:59.400]  Oh, my goodness. But getting into banking, 311 co-sponsors, it's passed the House Committee.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:02.600]  It looks like it's going to pass the House. The Senate may block it, but that's putting
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:03.920]  off the inevitable.
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:07.320]  People have finally gone past the left and right, the two parties, to the real power
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:10.360]  structure, the bankers that you've been fighting for 40 years.
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:14.280]  Right. You're talking about the proposed bill to audit the Fed.
[3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:15.280]  Yes.
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:21.000]  I'd like to comment on that. I support that, of course, but I have some misgivings which
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:25.520]  I'll mention for a moment and then come back to my support statement. When I wrote the
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:31.000]  book, it was published in 1994, I had a little paragraph or two about the audit the Fed bill,
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.400]  which in those days was routinely sponsored by Congressman Gonzalez.
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:39.000]  And I commented, then I said, you know, we don't need to audit the Fed. What we need
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.240]  to do is abolish the Fed.
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:46.360]  And I complained then, I predicted then, that if we ever had a serious move to audit the
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:52.080]  Fed, that it probably would be an instrument by which politicians would make a big grandstand.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:55.120]  They would say, we're going to do something about this Federal Reserve. We're going to
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  audit the Fed.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:00.320]  But in fact, if they did an audit, I think they'll find that for the most part the Fed
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:01.760]  is not doing anything illegal.
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:02.760]  It's a holding company.
[3:04:02.760 --> 3:04:06.640]  It's a holding company. It's a cartel. It's doing what it's supposed to do. And it would
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:10.680]  drag on for a couple of years while people had the false impression that something was
[3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:11.680]  being done.
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:13.800]  Your attack is on the institution and the system itself.
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:20.080]  The system itself. And so I said, you know, do we need to audit the mafia? No. We need
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:24.400]  to get, you know, get rid of the mafia if we could. And I feel the same thing is true
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:25.400]  with the Federal Reserve.
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:28.760]  But it has been audits that brought down Al Capone. And that's Ron Paul's view, is
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:32.720]  it will put it out there. His fight against them is identifying them as the enemy. Some
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:35.520]  polls show 81% of Americans want to abolish it.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:37.320]  Yeah. Well, now I come back to my opening.
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:39.960]  Stay there. We got a break. Come back with your positive point.
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:40.960]  Yes.
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:43.960]  And then let's get more into Man Bear Pig.
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:44.960]  Yeah.
[3:04:44.960 --> 3:04:45.960]  Do you know about the Man Bear Pig?
[3:04:45.960 --> 3:04:46.960]  No.
[3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:47.960]  Tell me.
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:52.240]  I'll tell you about Al Gore and the Man Bear Pig when we get back. G. Edward Griffin is
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:59.120]  our guest in studio. This is the one, the only GCN radio network. I'm Alex Jones. Infowars.com,
[3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:00.960]  baby.
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:05.600]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:09.640]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[3:05:09.640 --> 3:05:14.720]  that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:19.080]  There is a solution. Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:23.280]  been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to

[3:06:00.880 --> 3:06:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:06:05.240 --> 3:06:09.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:14.160]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:19.200]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[3:06:19.200 --> 3:06:23.880]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:29.520]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:06:29.520 --> 3:06:33.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:38.520]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:42.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:46.800]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[3:07:01.160 --> 3:07:05.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:10.280]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[3:07:10.280 --> 3:07:15.440]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:20.920]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts.
[3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:25.520]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:29.520]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:33.840]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:07:33.840 --> 3:07:38.920]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[3:07:38.920 --> 3:07:43.840]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[3:07:43.840 --> 3:07:52.240]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633

[3:07:59.240 --> 3:08:18.240]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.400]  I know G. Edward the Man Bear Pig is a South Park episode where they make fun of Al Gore
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:25.240]  for fear mongering. He says there's a mythical creature in the woods that's going to kill
[3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:30.360]  the town if they don't give him a bunch of money. It's a half-man, half-bear, half-pig,
[3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:37.240]  which of course is 150%. It's just totally ridiculous. Later we'll play a clip of that
[3:08:37.240 --> 3:08:43.600]  and we can find it on YouTube or elsewhere. Getting into the positive part about auditing
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:44.600]  the Fed.
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:48.960]  I think it's a very positive thing because for the first time people are hearing about
[3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:52.720]  the Federal Reserve and they're hearing about it in a way that causes them to think that
[3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:57.680]  maybe something's wrong. Most people have never given a thought to this institution
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:01.920]  and then when they do think about it, they think it's a great government agency of some
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:06.080]  kind. So now they're hearing audit the Fed. What does that mean? Why does someone want
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:11.040]  to audit the Fed? So the reason I support it is because it's causing millions of Americans
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:14.920]  to realize that there is something fishy with the Federal Reserve system and that's a big
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:15.920]  step forward.
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:19.640]  I want to get back into the Federal Reserve but obviously the big issue is the public
[3:09:19.640 --> 3:09:24.400]  announcement of world government, the public announcement that it is to be funded by taxes
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:31.120]  on everything, a UN directorate over energy taxation, 2% tax off the top of all countries
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:38.680]  GDP, a police grid over all air traffic, taxes on that, taxes on food, taxes on fuel. Why
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:46.520]  do you think they're moving, throwing everything at us at once? A. And B. Are they accelerating
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:50.000]  their program because they're behind?
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:55.120]  Well two questions. I think that the reason they're throwing everything at us at once
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:58.960]  now is because we're coming very close to the finish line. I mean there's much more
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:03.320]  to do and they're just trying to tie it all up as quickly as possible certainly within
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:08.560]  the next 10 years I would say. So it's come time to button everything down and you can't
[3:10:08.560 --> 3:10:13.400]  kid about it anymore when you're trying to tie everything down. You have to call it exactly
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:18.680]  what it is. I don't know if they're accelerating their program or whether it's just like a
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:24.720]  natural phenomenon when a candle burns brightly it means it's about ready to burn out. So
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:29.360]  I think it's accelerated but whether they've planned it to be that way or not I wouldn't
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:33.040]  have any way of knowing.
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:40.040]  But why would they go from admitting that they're doing, I mean denying what they were
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:43.320]  doing to admitting what they're doing. I mean doesn't that hurt them to say there's no
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:47.680]  world government? There's no carbon tax plan just two, three years ago to yeah there's
[3:10:47.680 --> 3:10:51.600]  a world government. It's going to save Africans by cutting off their power.
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:56.160]  Well I think the answer to that Alex is that if they had said yes we're building world
[3:10:56.160 --> 3:11:00.840]  government they'd said that three, four, five years ago people would have been shocked,
[3:11:00.840 --> 3:11:04.120]  they would have been outraged, they would have said who wants world government. But
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:08.960]  now there's enough crisis going on in the world. People are frightened of so many things
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:14.160]  that now they can say yeah there's world government and it's the solution to all of your problems
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:19.800]  everybody so see how fortunate you are that we've got this masterful plan to save you.
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:24.320]  So I think now they're talking about world government because finally they can present
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:29.600]  it as a so-called solution to all of the problems that are infecting the planet.
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:35.920]  And in the Copenhagen climate summit in disarray after Danish techs leak of the official treaty
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:39.240]  that they want to get people to sign they didn't mean to bring this out until the last
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:43.160]  few days. Get the third world all thinking they were going to get to loot the west because
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:47.140]  they're playing groups off against each other and now they find out oh the IMF and World
[3:11:47.140 --> 3:11:52.800]  Bank will have all the power not the UN and this tax money will be doled out to you if
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:59.240]  you reduce your population and set up a global one child policy so everything is coming out
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:04.960]  in the open. People would laugh at in game three years ago they're not laughing now and
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:10.520]  so the IMF World Bank these are arms of the same private central banking system that we
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:15.040]  live under. That's right that has always been the source of the ultimate power. Certainly
[3:12:15.040 --> 3:12:19.200]  here in the United States people are beginning to finally to understand that the power is
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:23.520]  with the banks not with the government that the government supposedly was to control the
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:28.120]  banks but we can see in the recent events in Washington when all of this money is created
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:33.280]  out of nothing and it goes to the banks and the congressmen dutifully vote for it without
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.480]  even understanding what the bills are they never ask any questions they never even read
[3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:41.560]  the bills they just dutifully vote for it. I think anybody can see now that it's the
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:45.720]  banks that are running the show and not the government. So there'll be no difference at
[3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:49.600]  the international level it is coming out in the open that the IMF and the World Bank will
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:54.560]  be the center of authority and power. But the banks want to create a new global government
[3:12:54.560 --> 3:12:59.000]  structure because there's no bill of rights there's no constitution there's no declaration
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:04.240]  of independence it's just pure even the Guardian admits secret world government run by private
[3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:09.560]  corporate interests. It actually says that in the text and now the London Guardian is
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:13.000]  talking like G. Edward Griffin this is this is incredible.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:17.960]  Yes it is. Well the fact of the matter is they do have documents that appear like they're
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:22.320]  the bill of rights. I mean they do have the covenant on human rights that's published
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:26.040]  there at the United Nations they have conferences on the United Nations unanimous declaration
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:31.640]  of human rights 30 points but in 29 and 30 all the rights given are our privileges that
[3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:35.760]  you and can revoke. Yes and not you don't have to wait till you get to the 29th and
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:40.600]  the 30th one every one of them along the way says for example everyone has the right to
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:47.520]  freedom of speech except as may be provided for by law everyone has the right to employment
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:52.800]  or the right to travel everyone has the right to freedom of religion everyone has you know
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:58.960]  all these rights but in every condition and every provision they say except as may be
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:03.240]  provided for by law which means you've got these rights until they pass a law and take
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:07.920]  them away from you which means you never had them in the first place.
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:13.160]  Well said on the subject of the private Federal Reserve the holding company the private banks
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:21.480]  that own and control it they have stolen trillions of dollars they won't say where it's gone
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:28.840]  how do you see this unfolding. That's a tough question I'm taking a moment to think about
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:34.320]  it because I don't think the mechanisms are in place right now for the will of the people
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:41.120]  to have much effect. The government of the United States is firmly in the hands of collectivists
[3:14:41.120 --> 3:14:47.840]  who are beholden to this financial global power and they care what the American voters
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:53.520]  think but not as much as you might suspect that they do they don't care so much about
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:59.560]  people who write them letters as they do about people who write them checks and so I think
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:05.400]  when the public becomes upset by this and starts to demand change as they're now doing
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:09.080]  the politicians are maneuvering and thinking not in terms of how we're going to bring
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:14.040]  about the change but how we continue doing exactly what we have been doing and to shut
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:20.340]  the public out of the debate and to just proceed in spite of the public opposition and concern.
[3:15:20.340 --> 3:15:28.040]  So to answer your question I see an increasing pressure for genuine rebellion in this country
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:31.840]  which scares the dickens out of me because I don't think that would be a good thing.
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:36.840]  And we've seen the elite preparing for that. Preparing for it and I think hoping for it
[3:15:36.840 --> 3:15:42.420]  because they know that if there is widespread civil violence that will be the excuse they
[3:15:42.420 --> 3:15:45.800]  really want in order to clamp down with martial law.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:49.720]  That's why they've got North Commonplace. Exactly yeah so I worry a lot about that
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:54.040]  but you asked me the question where do I think it's going. I think that's probably where
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:16:00.840]  it's going to go and I hope we can reach enough people soon enough to prevent that from happening.
[3:16:00.840 --> 3:16:04.680]  Obviously educating people is a big part of the solution and we're doing that but at the
[3:16:04.680 --> 3:16:09.560]  same time as you said running for city council county commissioner school board we need to
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:14.200]  start getting into the power structure at the grassroots and start moving into the federal
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:18.600]  government as well. The globalists have the long view that's why they've been successful.
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:22.240]  We need to have the long view speak to that and freedom force international.
[3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:27.640]  Oh thanks for that. That is the mantra that I have been preaching for so many years. Most
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:33.280]  Americans are have a very short attention span and they have a very short view of the
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:39.240]  future and even those who are greatly concerned about what's happening in America today want
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:45.720]  a solution that they think will happen within the next election. Can we do it by the next
[3:16:45.720 --> 3:16:49.720]  election and if we can't do it the next election they're not interested. Well I'm here to say
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:53.320]  it's not going to happen in the next election or probably not even the one after that.
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:16:57.800]  Because they give us a bush they give us an Obama same policies different rhetoric and
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:03.800]  just the rope of dope continues. As long as we're committed to this scam between the Republican
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:08.360]  and the Democrat party which appears to be offering people a choice when in fact it's
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:13.920]  not it's a it's a rigged wrestling match. As long as people buy into that Republican
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:19.920]  Democrat nonsense there is no hope of changing the system. So that's where education comes
[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:24.320]  in and it's also where the freedom force strategy comes in where we want people who are aware
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:30.280]  of this to be to go into government to try and become influential in their own government
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:34.800]  instead of just standing on the outside of the halls of power looking in and writing
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:39.880]  letters of complaint and petition. We want them to organize and to run for office and
[3:17:39.880 --> 3:17:44.000]  then even if they're in low positions they will gather support by the grassroots be propelled
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:48.960]  into higher positions. They can leak documents they can whistle blow they can bully pulpit
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:53.360]  they can sabotage globalist operations. You have to be on the inside. I think it's the
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:57.960]  only solution. It's how our collectivist enemies took over this country. They didn't
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:02.320]  attack from the outside. They didn't send soldiers in wearing uniforms of a different
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:06.240]  color and different insignia. They didn't use bombs and bayonets. They took over the
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:11.360]  power centers of society one by one from right inside the country and that's the only way
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:17.200]  we can reverse. Cicero one of the Roman historians talked about the enemy at the gates with their
[3:18:17.200 --> 3:18:22.320]  flag openly is not the threat. It's the enemy for within. Yes so true. But we are the cure
[3:18:22.320 --> 3:18:27.400]  from within. The cure is from within too. So that's what freedom force is all about.
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:32.080]  We have the long view of history. We think that this can be turned around but not by
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:37.880]  the next election. So it's a kind of a pessimistic view and an optimistic view at the same time.
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:42.360]  It's pessimistic in the sense that we'd all like to see a return to normalcy and prosperity
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:47.080]  and safety and all of that. We'd like to see that happen real fast but it's not going
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:52.640]  to happen real fast. But the optimistic point is that if we lay the foundation today, if
[3:18:52.640 --> 3:18:57.200]  we get people to understand the basic principles of freedom and if we get them organized and
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:02.480]  networked together so they can go into the power centers of society including the political
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:06.840]  parties but also the church organizations, the schools. That's what FEMA's doing. They're
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:12.000]  doing what we should be doing. Quietly taking over. The UN document came out last week where
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:17.360]  over a decade ago they took over the public schools locally, brainwashing the kids. But
[3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:22.680]  it's not pessimistic. It's honest. What's pessimistic is people wanting an instant solution. That
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:28.920]  is. A silver bullet. It's got to happen today. No. Resistance is victory. The truth is victory.
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:32.960]  Taking action. I've been doing this 14 years. You've been doing this 40 plus years. And
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:38.440]  just the process of like a woodpecker. Always attacking, always educating, always resisting.
[3:19:38.440 --> 3:19:42.840]  Over time it builds an exponential force that is unstoppable. But people like, well, I
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:46.840]  went out and protested once or I went to city council once or I tried to run and didn't
[3:19:46.840 --> 3:19:52.280]  win once. Well, so did Ron Paul. It's all a process and we have to realize that they're
[3:19:52.280 --> 3:19:56.720]  trying to bend our will. We've got to push and bend right back because it's when you
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:00.720]  don't give up and keep pushing that you're an unstoppable force. G. Ebert Griffin, stay
[3:20:00.720 --> 3:20:04.880]  with us. We'll be right back. Say no to government vaccinations. Say no to toxic overloads. Say

[3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:14.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:21:14.240 --> 3:21:19.880]  at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:25.520]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:30.640]  attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore
[3:21:30.640 --> 3:21:36.360]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.360 --> 3:21:40.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:21:40.720 --> 3:21:45.080]  is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[3:21:45.080 --> 3:21:51.360]  now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:58.160]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality

[3:22:04.280 --> 3:22:09.800]  of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coin citizens
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:16.040]  would use for commerce. This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[3:22:16.040 --> 3:22:20.400]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[3:22:20.400 --> 3:22:24.920]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:29.800]  country ever experienced. This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[3:22:29.800 --> 3:22:33.800]  is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more
[3:22:33.800 --> 3:22:38.480]  than 90 cents of its original value. Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:43.280]  from this once world reserve currency. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book

[3:24:13.480 --> 3:24:32.800]  We've got this segment and part of the next. And then we've got a guest joining us from
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:39.520]  Copenhagen in the last 20 minutes of this transmission. G. Edward Griffin is in studio
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:44.880]  with us. He's going to be speaking at Brave New Books tonight in Austin, Texas at 7 p.m.
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:50.360]  and then at the Courtyard Austin Downtown Convention Center 300 East 4th Street, Austin,
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:59.720]  Texas 787-01, 512-236-8008, Saturday, December 12th. The registration begins at 8.30 a.m.
[3:24:59.720 --> 3:25:04.080]  because you don't need to go through the registration. You can come at 8.30 for coffee and pastries
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:09.800]  or get there at 9.30 as Mr. Griffin starts his presentation at 9.45. Don't want to miss
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:14.080]  that Saturday in Austin, Texas. Okay, we're getting a long view of history. I think these
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:17.480]  victories against the Federal Reserve, though, exposing them, their polling numbers going
[3:25:17.480 --> 3:25:24.000]  down to less than 20%, the environmentalist being unmasked, his private corporate takeover
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.520]  artist. All of this is showing the people, though, that we can have victory. I mean,
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:34.360]  I'm seeing the morale go up. Being a public figure, I get off airplanes in Latin America,
[3:25:34.360 --> 3:25:38.960]  Canada, towns all over the U.S. and literally, cars stop as I walk down the street, people
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:43.640]  everywhere. And I'm just one guy. And it's getting insane. I mean, it's like I've got
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:47.760]  a major sitcom on television or something. I mean, I'll be out with Charlie Sheen on
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:51.360]  the streets of Los Angeles and people running up to him, they're running up to me. I mean,
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:56.760]  it just, it's happening. I mean, really, that's a sonar ping that it's bigger than
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:00.800]  we think, G. Edward. Yeah. Well, I'm glad to hear that. And of course, the theme that
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:08.640]  I focus on is that the long view of history is very, very comforting, at least to someone
[3:26:08.640 --> 3:26:12.160]  at my age. I don't know a younger person. I remember when I was a lot younger, I was
[3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:19.120]  in a bigger hurry or a bigger hurry than I am now. But it's comforting to know that
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:25.080]  you and I are putting in place principles and organizational structures and strategies
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:30.560]  that cannot be stamped out. I don't care how strong the engines of tyranny are. They cannot
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:36.200]  overpower the force of the knowledge and the principles that we're building right now.
[3:26:36.200 --> 3:26:40.840]  And that is going to, it's going to build through the next generation. And I think the
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:46.200]  following generation after that, it sounds like a far distance down the road, but it's
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:50.520]  not that far. I think we're going to see this whole thing turn around within that length
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:54.640]  of period. And that's very comforting. I can go to bed at night and really sleep well thinking
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:26:55.640]  that I have a part.
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:26:59.920]  But they are racing to put the technocracy in place, but that we told the truth, had
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:05.880]  a testament of who the bad guys were and what, and what liberty could be those seeds, billions
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:10.720]  of them have been planted, millions of sprouted. But tyranny is almost like water and sunlight
[3:27:10.720 --> 3:27:15.800]  to liberty. It, when it comes in for every action, there's an equal reaction.
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:22.920]  I agree with that. And that, I guess we could say it's fortunate that we live in these tumultuous
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:29.280]  times, even though it may be rather hectic for us. Still, if we didn't have all the problems
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:35.720]  we have today, people would still be asleep. They wouldn't be thinking about the ingredients
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:36.720]  of freedom.
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:40.040]  They wouldn't be thinking about what it takes to be free. They wouldn't be thinking about
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:43.640]  our heritage. They wouldn't be thinking about economic issues.
[3:27:43.640 --> 3:27:45.880]  But there was a choice, another option.
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:52.240]  Yeah. Because everything was comfortable. Everything was easy, you know? So if we want
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:56.360]  to put in place something that's going to have this long view, we need a lot of help,
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:00.640]  a lot of support. That means we need to wake up a lot of people. So in that sense, this
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:05.960]  growing tyranny is our ally. But we still have to stamp it out. We're not going to
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:07.560]  let it grow. That's for sure.
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:11.600]  And we have to make sure the enemy doesn't plant counterfeits out there to misdirect
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:16.960]  people. The globalists are masters of creating infighting with people that don't like the
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:20.320]  system. We need to really not spend time on that.
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:25.960]  That's right. Yeah, we know that they're doing that. That's a favorite strategy. And we've
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:31.040]  seen it all throughout history. I know a little bit about the Federal Reserve System. And
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:35.960]  the first time I came across that strategy in the economic field was in the evolution
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:40.640]  and the origin of the Federal Reserve. The very people that conceived the Federal Reserve,
[3:28:40.640 --> 3:28:46.320]  then having got it proposed and an actual bill going before Congress, then they started
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:51.760]  to lead the opposition against it in such a way that it was bound to fail. You see what
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:56.560]  I'm saying? If you lead your own opposition, then you can make sure that it will fail.
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:00.560]  Well, there was more to the trick. And I know you know this, but why don't you elaborate?
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:05.640]  They came out and acted like they were the bankers and said, we don't want this. Please
[3:29:05.640 --> 3:29:07.240]  don't throw me in the briar patch.
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:11.500]  Right. Yeah, they said this Federal Reserve bill is not good for businesses, not good
[3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:16.920]  for America, but they did this as bankers. And they knew that when that story got into
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:21.440]  the news, people would say, Hey, Maude, look at this. These big bankers don't like this
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:25.920]  Federal Reserve system very much. Must be a good bill. You know, they knew that that
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:29.680]  would be the reaction of the average person. So they're clever. They're smart. They didn't
[3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:34.360]  get to be in the positions of power that they are by being stupid. But we on the other
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:40.360]  hand can't be stupid either. We must understand that people do that. They do provide false
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:49.240]  leadership. They do present false images out there just deliberately to trick the the mind
[3:29:49.240 --> 3:29:55.520]  of the absolutely stay there. Final segments. We're on the March. The Empire's on the run.

[3:32:03.400 --> 3:32:08.140]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[3:32:08.140 --> 3:32:12.840]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[3:32:12.840 --> 3:32:17.200]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control
[3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:22.040]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some
[3:32:22.040 --> 3:32:27.560]  areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation
[3:32:27.560 --> 3:32:32.000]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[3:32:32.000 --> 3:32:36.640]  grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number
[3:32:36.640 --> 3:32:41.640]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[3:32:41.640 --> 3:32:45.240]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[3:32:45.240 --> 3:32:52.240]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:33:19.240 --> 3:33:28.240]  Tom Harris joining us in about eight minutes. He's there at the Copenhagen World Government
[3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:32.680]  Summit. I tell all this mainstream media that's still trying to say there's no world government.
[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:36.600]  They look really stupid. As the UN and others openly announced that they haven't quite gotten
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:42.000]  their propaganda together, I think it's great. But, gee, Edward, in the last six, seven minutes
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:45.520]  we have with you, I want to give you the floor. We were talking here in the break. You said
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:49.320]  it is really coming to a head. And I agree with a long view of history. They're not going
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:55.400]  to give up overnight. But I've given the analogy of Climate Gate being the Death Star plans
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:59.920]  getting out. And now, with their whole program in disarray, the Death Star is blown up. But
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:04.360]  they're still Imperial Star destroyers. The Empire is still occupying all our systems.
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:09.160]  They're still in all our nations. But it's shown the rebellion that if we can blow up
[3:34:09.160 --> 3:34:13.560]  one of their biggest operations in the Info War, we can destroy these people. We can defeat
[3:34:13.560 --> 3:34:20.040]  them with the truth. That's so true. And what can I add to that, except that the thought
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:27.840]  that's always on my mind is it's relatively easy for people to know what they don't want.
[3:34:27.840 --> 3:34:32.640]  We can see this growing tyranny. We can see the lies. We can see the deceit. We can see
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:37.680]  the increasing taxes. We can see the devastation of our purchasing power of our monetary unit.
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:42.000]  We can see the dumbing down of the kids in school. We can see all of these things. And
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:48.760]  we know we don't want that. And so it's easy, relatively easy to get people networked together
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:34:53.200]  and organized together. We're going to fight this. We're going to bring these people down.
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:58.240]  I long to hear people talk about what are we going to replace it with? I want to hear
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:02.920]  more Congress controlling our currency, cutting down the size of government, getting state
[3:35:02.920 --> 3:35:07.960]  sovereignty, getting rid of the government run public schools, getting not making the
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:13.240]  superheroes the sports people or actors, but being inventors again, getting back to
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:18.000]  a renaissance society. Exactly. And also even deeper than that, we could go and talk about
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:23.200]  political principles. What is the proper function of the state? What is the ideal system? Where
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:27.640]  did our system go wrong or did it go wrong? These are the things that I want to hear more
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:32.320]  in the debate. And I recognize you have to mobilize people on the flashpoint, the anger
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:36.760]  point. You know, this is what they don't like. But I am the reason I created Freedom
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:42.360]  Force, as you so well know, is because I wanted people to think about the political and ideological
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:47.880]  principles, the things that we should be building into the system after we recapture control
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:52.560]  of it and we have a chance to create a better system. What will it be? What would it look
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:58.240]  like, you see? And I always want people to learn and think about the differences between
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:02.520]  collectivism and individualism. I want to hear those words used more often.
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:07.520]  And we've got to educate people the horrors of collectivism. We know this animal kills
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:12.560]  people, enslaves people, misery and pain is its children.
[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:18.320]  Yes. And what I want to see is for people to recognize that this is the same animal,
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:25.320]  whether it is in Nazi Germany or Red China, even today or in Cuba, or in if it's growing
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:31.440]  in the United States, it's just the same animal. So that's what I want to have people think
[3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:37.280]  about. What is collectivism? And because once you understand the principles of collectivism,
[3:36:37.280 --> 3:36:43.440]  you will not tolerate its growth even in your own country. So, yes, I'm very optimistic
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:49.480]  about this rising tide of resistance to the growing tyranny. But now I think it's time
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:54.720]  for us to really focus on having people recognize on the positive things we want to replace
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:36:55.720]  it with.
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:58.640]  And Freedom Force International does that. Give us your family of websites.
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:03.400]  Yeah, it is a family of websites. The Freedom Force website is where we call it the think
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:10.880]  tank of our little world. And that's FreedomForceInternational.org. A lot of material are to read and study.
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:15.800]  The commercial site is Reality Zone. That's where people can buy our audios and our videos
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:21.400]  and our books. And that's RealityZone.com. Of course, we invite everybody to take our
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:27.520]  free weekly newsletter. And that's called the Unfiltered News. And they can get that simply
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:33.800]  by going to RealityZone on the landing page. And there's a lot of great material. You've
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:37.520]  been fighting this collectivist takeover for more than 40 years. You're speaking tonight
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:41.640]  at Brave New Books in Austin and Saturday at the Courtyard, Austin, downtown, 9.45 in
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:45.160]  the morning. People should get there earlier than that, though. G. Edward Griffin, thank
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:47.280]  you for coming into studio with us.
[3:37:47.280 --> 3:37:50.320]  Thank you, Alex. It's always a pleasure to be here. Keep it up.
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:54.320]  I'll try. You keep it up, too. You're a real tiger in the fight for liberty. Had Lord Monkton
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:58.360]  on the day. You've been in studio. This has been amazing. Thank you, G. Edward Griffin.
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:37:59.360]  Thank you.
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:06.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely honored here today to have engineer Tom Harris,
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:13.360]  Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:18.960]  set up to counter the IPCC science fraud that's been proven to be a premeditated fraud. We
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:22.200]  don't just have the climate gate documents. We have the UN documents last week where they
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:26.520]  have been organizing the fraud together. And he is in Copenhagen right now, putting on
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  their own conference. The website is CopenhagenClimateChange.org or ClimateScienceInternational.org.
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:42.200]  And for the last 22 minutes of this radio transmission from Copenhagen, Tom Harris joins
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:44.520]  us. Tom, thank you for spending time today.
[3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:47.080]  Yeah, that's great, Alan.
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:52.880]  So much is going on. In a nutshell, tell us about your group, your take on climate gate,
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:57.120]  the text of the Danish text of the treaty, where the Third World will actually have to
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:01.000]  make more cuts than the West, devastating them. Lord Monkton talked about the millions
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:05.600]  that will kill a year. Just look what the ethanol scam has done. And where you think
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:12.800]  this conference is going in light of all this evidence of fraud coming out?
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:17.400]  Yeah, well, to start out with the International Climate Science Coalition is the non-profit
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:22.760]  group of scientists who were not able to get into most of the UN activities. Some of them
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:28.640]  actually were, but they disagreed with the UN. We have with us about 60 scientists who
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:33.640]  are our advisors. And it was decided that we should actually ask the UN for some basic
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:38.320]  data. Because, you know, one of the main concerns after climate gate was if the temperature
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:42.880]  data is corrupted, how much else is? And, you know, we hear about extreme weather events,
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:46.200]  increasing and all that sort of thing. But many of these scientists are actually experts
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:50.760]  in that field, and they know that the extreme weather records were set in the 1800s and
[3:39:50.760 --> 3:39:55.640]  early 1900s when it comes to typhoons and hurricanes and things like that. So instead
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:40:00.480]  of actually making the point to the UN that they're wrong, we thought, well, look, if
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:04.760]  they're not sharing data on temperature, why can't we get them to share data on everything
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:09.600]  else? So we sent an open letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations. And it's interesting
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:15.000]  that the project actually started about a month ago before the CRU scandal, you know,
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:19.120]  the climate gate. And at that time, you know, we were getting signature a day or something
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:24.560]  like that. But after the scandal in England, we've been swamped with signatures. We've
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.560]  been getting hundreds of signatures of leading scientists from around the world who are now
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:33.360]  saying, well, if that data was wrong and manipulated, we want to see all the data.
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:37.920]  So I went through the list. And, you know, some of them are leading experts, but they're
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:44.000]  not necessarily climate experts. So I pulled out 150 of them who actually are climate experts
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:48.880]  from 17 different countries who are now demanding that the data be released in a whole range
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:53.560]  of fields. And it's going to be very interesting to see what the UN do, because in some cases,
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:57.880]  like their polar bear scare, the data shows that the population has more than doubled
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:03.200]  since 1960, and that they've been around for about 70,000 years, during which time it
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:07.400]  was hotter than they're forecasting for the 21st century. So it's going to be tough for
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:09.800]  the UN to answer our challenge.
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:15.600]  Well, absolutely. I'm sure you've been following that in New Zealand, in Australia, in Canada,
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:22.840]  NOAA, NASA, other universities are being caught fixing the data along with the IPCC, that
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:28.480]  the UN had this strategy, that people were already trying to get the climate research
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:33.640]  center data because they were already being caught in fraud by the research. But now we
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:39.120]  know that it's premeditated. And so this is just the tip of the iceberg is more whistleblowers
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:44.640]  come out, more scientists that were persecuted. I mean, I think it's safe to say that the
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:49.920]  beginning of the end of the charlatans has begun. Do you agree that they're starting
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:51.560]  to really bleed out?
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:57.000]  Oh, yeah, exactly. And I think that if they do start to respond to our challenge, you
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:00.840]  know, in a way, it would be good because, for our point of view, it would be good because
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:05.600]  then we can find more of these flaws. But the fact that the UN probably won't respond
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:10.000]  to our challenge is actually an admission of guilt because if you think about it, this
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:15.240]  data was collected with public money. It shouldn't have been 17 years of trying to get the data
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:23.040]  before a whistleblower, who's probably the cause of this, not a hacker. It shouldn't
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:28.840]  have taken 17 years to get the basic data that was being used to generate public policy.
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:33.400]  And so I think that Climate Gate has been a great Christmas Christmas gift to us because
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:37.920]  it's shown an example of what they've suspected for years. And that is that when you look at
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:42.320]  the real data, much of the climate scare is just simply not there.
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:48.160]  Well, I mean, you talk about polar bears, I have seen on television, they're teaching
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.000]  children that penguins are drowning when it's an aquatic bird that can barely walk and can't
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  fly because it's meant to swim. Polar bears, the greatest land swimming animal, routinely
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:04.400]  swim over 100 miles, have been recorded to swim over 300. They hunt on ice packs. But
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:09.560]  just two weeks ago, Austin News said the polar bears are all dying. They're drowning. They
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:15.120]  showed video of them floating on ice packs where they're out killing seals in Beluga.
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:19.960]  The fraud of the hockey stick, the fraud of carbon dioxide, simultaneously with temperature
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:24.200]  rise when it comes, as you know, hundreds of years after. I mean, everything these people
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:29.240]  say, the oceans will turn into acid, acid rain. In the 70s, Holdren said we had to
[3:43:29.240 --> 3:43:36.400]  put out giant terraforming factories to double CO2 or we'd be in an ice age by 2000. I mean,
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:42.520]  the level of fraudulent quackery is just, this is clearly the greatest scientific fraud
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:46.920]  in history. Can you comment on that and then what you're witnessing in Copenhagen?
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:51.520]  Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, obviously, there were big scientific frauds in history
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:55.880]  like thinking the earth was flat and the sixth, seventh of the earth was covered with land.
[3:43:55.880 --> 3:43:59.560]  There were lots of frauds, but I don't think any of them have cost the world as much as
[3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:03.480]  this one. I mean, this one, they're talking about literally trillions of dollars. You
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:08.800]  know, if OECD countries followed Kyoto, the cost that's estimated would be about a trillion
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:14.160]  dollars a year. And that would mean that for one years of Kyoto expenditure, they could
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:19.440]  actually fix the freshwater drinking problem in Africa virtually forever. And right now,
[3:44:19.440 --> 3:44:23.960]  there's about five million people a year, mostly children who die in Africa due to bad
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:28.840]  drinking water. And that problem could be solved with one year's expenditure on Kyoto.
[3:44:28.840 --> 3:44:33.240]  So independent of your politics, one of the points we're trying to make is that this is
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:38.360]  just a bad use of money. So we're trying to expand the tent, not just for right wing
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:42.880]  or center, but we're also trying to attract left wingers, which we're slowly doing because
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:46.600]  you know, left, right or center, nobody wants to throw a trillion dollars a year down the
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:52.240]  drain. Although sometimes I wonder, but regardless, we're finding that one of the reasons we haven't
[3:44:52.240 --> 3:44:57.600]  been winning up to this point is because we only are attracting our traditional allies,
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:01.000]  you know, people like yourself and others who think about the issues, but also people
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:05.520]  who generally tend to be a bit right of center. But if we're going to win this debate, we
[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:10.080]  have to get a lot more people on our side. We have to make allies with people ordinarily.
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:14.080]  I agree. But I mean, the way to reach out to the left, and I'm past the left right
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:19.760]  period. I'm more of a libertarian. And just a realist is conservatively, we're talking
[3:45:19.760 --> 3:45:25.200]  about millions and millions of people dying a year of a fraction of these carbon cuts
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:31.400]  are made. And now we learn in the draft treaty that third world has to make close to double
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:36.000]  the cuts of the first world. I mean, even if the left, you just believe this would be
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:41.640]  a big money grab to help the third world. It has nothing to do with that. It's a insider
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:49.160]  trading carbon derivative system developed by Ken Lay. I mean, this is just a giant
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:50.160]  carnival scam.
[3:45:50.160 --> 3:45:54.480]  One of the things that people forget is that there's a lot of investment firms who have
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:58.560]  invested billions of dollars. I won't mention the names because I don't want to get sued.
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:02.680]  But the bottom line is I said to one of the carbon brokers the other day, I said, such
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:07.360]  and such a company has bought a billion dollars worth of carbon credits. Now they don't need
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:12.080]  them. They're just doing it on speculation. So they want to see the climate scare continue.
[3:46:12.080 --> 3:46:15.880]  And he said to me, oh, a billion dollars, that's nothing. A lot of companies have invested
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:21.400]  a lot more than that. And so what you're finding is that some organizations are actually helping
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:26.760]  fund scare movies. For example, The Eleventh Hour by Leonardo DiCaprio, which is like a
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:31.800]  super outdoor film. It's even more exaggerated. That's actually being funded in part by Swiss
[3:46:31.800 --> 3:46:35.960]  REIT, which are one of the world's largest insurance companies. And you have to say,
[3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:39.960]  well, why would they fund the climate scare video? Well, of course, the answer is obvious
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:43.520]  that people think that there's massive climate problems coming. They're going to buy more
[3:46:43.520 --> 3:46:47.600]  insurance. They can raise the premiums. And so what you're seeing is an enormous vested
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:53.080]  interest in actually keeping the scare alive. And that's a scary thing because how long
[3:46:53.080 --> 3:46:57.760]  can the scare continue if the data is wrong? Well, it might continue for quite a long time
[3:46:57.760 --> 3:47:01.760]  if there's enough people funding it. And that's basically what it comes down to, I think.
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:07.360]  Is that there is billions to be made, even, you know, as some people say hundreds of billions,
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:11.320]  if in fact the scare continues. So if scientists laugh, you know, at the conference that we
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:16.160]  organized or helped organize, they said, how long does it have to cool before politicians
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:21.160]  stop calling it global warming? Well, actually, it might cool for a long time. And that's
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:25.280]  what many of the scientists are saying. But the scare may continue anyways, because there's
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:26.680]  so much money behind it.
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:31.680]  That's a good question. You're talking to a lot of top real non-political climatologists
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:36.360]  and, you know, the sun, they say, is the main driver, but also this nuclei coming out of
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:41.880]  space. There's a lot of other things going on. It does appear that most of the climatologists,
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:46.080]  we read, say, no, actually, it's a normal cooling trend. What is the majority view with
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:47.720]  the scientists you're talking to?
[3:47:47.720 --> 3:47:52.600]  Well, the majority view is that they don't know. They have various theories. It's kind
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:57.200]  of like a bell curve. There's very few on the side that say we are definitely not causing
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.480]  any climate change. There's very few on the side that say that we're causing all of it.
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:05.480]  There's more of a distribution in the middle where the vast majority of them say, well,
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:10.960]  we don't know. The science is so immature. Take clouds, for example. Clouds are 100 times
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:15.600]  more influential on climate than humans, all like human activity combined. And yet it was
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:20.760]  only 10 years ago that we thought the net impact of clouds was to contribute to global
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:25.440]  warming because, of course, it's water vapor and that's a greenhouse gas. But recently,
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:29.320]  they found that, in fact, clouds are a net cooling agent because they reflect more of
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:33.440]  the sunlight into space than they actually trap in the atmosphere. So not only have they
[3:48:33.440 --> 3:48:38.400]  changed the magnitude of the cloud impact, which, as I say, is far more than human, but
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:44.120]  they've even changed the sign. So the whole concept of the science is settled as to what
[3:48:44.120 --> 3:48:49.160]  the other cause might be. It's probably not CO2, whether it's the sun, whether it's ocean
[3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:53.200]  currents, whether it's land use change, or whether, as you say, it's cosmic rays from
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:58.000]  space. I mean, the bottom line is we're in an era of negative discovery where the more
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:00.880]  we learn, the more we realize that we just don't understand.
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:05.760]  Yeah, this is incredibly complex. We're a giant planet, hurtling through deep space,
[3:49:05.760 --> 3:49:10.760]  orbiting a gigantic sun. I mean, and they're saying that humans exhaling five and a half
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:16.440]  pounds or flatulence from bovine that have always been on the planet are deadly. Oh,
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:18.120]  but attacks will save us.
[3:49:18.120 --> 3:49:22.920]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a lot of this stuff is absurd. And the sad thing is that many conservatives
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:28.000]  who actually know it's wrong are saying the wrong things. You know, the Conservative Party
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:31.840]  in Canada, for example, before they came into power, they said they were going to get to
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:36.720]  the bottom of the climate change Kyoto scare. Once they got into power, their spin doctors
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:40.760]  clearly told them they could get more votes if they just changed their tune and said the
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:44.280]  same thing as Al Gore. And so that's what they've done. And I'm really ashamed as a
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:49.880]  Canadian to have our government saying things they know very well are completely wrong.
[3:49:49.880 --> 3:49:54.100]  We find that it's strange, but with the Liberal government before our current Conservative
[3:49:54.100 --> 3:49:58.800]  government, they would allow the occasional climate skeptic to come into committee hearings
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:03.520]  to testify. But ever since this supposedly Conservative government has come in, they've
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:05.280]  actually closed the door totally.
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.840]  Oh, yeah. Look at Newt Ginnrich. Look at Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is not a partisan issue.
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:15.680]  It's an issue of people that want to regulate and control our economy and vertically integrate
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:16.680]  it.
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:21.360]  Yeah, yeah. And it's also an issue of a lack of courage on the part of many politicians
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:26.840]  who know that people like Senator Inhofe are right. A lot of politicians know that. I've
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:31.840]  talked to many of the MPs in Canada behind closed doors, and they know it's a scam, but
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:38.640]  they're afraid to say it. And we need a lot more courage and leadership in our government.
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:43.040]  Well, I agree with you, sir. We're going to go to break and come back with a final segment
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.160]  on the other side. So please stay with us. Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:55.440]  Climate Science Coalition, is our guest. We'll talk about what he's witnessing in Copenhagen
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:51:03.720]  and if the climate gain information is disturbing this globalist event. We'll be right back.
[3:51:03.720 --> 3:51:08.280]  Remain in your houses. The President of the United States has declared martial law under
[3:51:08.280 --> 3:51:15.680]  Executive Order 11,004. Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray
[3:51:15.680 --> 3:51:21.720]  they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[3:51:21.720 --> 3:51:29.040]  Think it can happen here? Executive Order 10,990 locks down all highways. Executive Order
[3:51:29.040 --> 3:51:36.280]  10,995 ceases control of all media outlets. Executive Order 10,998 controls all farms and
[3:51:36.280 --> 3:51:41.680]  food supplies. All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:47.000]  right crisis. So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:54.560]  or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com. That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[3:51:54.560 --> 3:51:59.880]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now. You must remain in your houses until your bracelets
[3:51:59.880 --> 3:52:07.240]  are scanned. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:12.800]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll
[3:52:12.800 --> 3:52:17.760]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our
[3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:23.160]  President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[3:52:23.160 --> 3:52:29.120]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[3:52:29.120 --> 3:52:34.680]  of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:39.320]  its ashes, constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're
[3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:43.440]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:43.440 --> 3:52:49.320]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:52:49.320 --> 3:52:55.560]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're
[3:52:55.560 --> 3:53:00.320]  watching online right now in Super High Quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:53:25.560 --> 3:53:30.960]  I take a simple but proven approach to solving your tax debt problem. First, I stabilize collections
[3:53:30.960 --> 3:53:34.880]  so you don't have to worry about wage and bank levies. Next, I build a detailed plan
[3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:39.880]  to get your debt reduced to the fullest extent possible, sometimes even eliminated. Finally,
[3:53:39.880 --> 3:53:43.600]  I work with you every step of the way to get your problem solved once and for all, so call
[3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:51.720]  now for a free consultation. Call 1-800-346-6829. Dan Pilla will solve your tax problem, guaranteed.
[3:53:51.720 --> 3:53:58.520]  He's helped thousands of people, and he can help you too. Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[3:53:58.520 --> 3:54:25.000]  It may still have time, but might still get by. Every time I think about it, I won't
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:36.960]  cry. Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition,
[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:41.560]  a massive scientific group set up to counter the IPCC. We've only got about five minutes
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:46.160]  left right now, sir, and so I'd like to talk about what you're witnessing, what the mood
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:52.960]  is there, how Climate Gate is affecting the different 191 countries there, how the Danish
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:55:00.040]  text doubling the cuts for the third world, resulting in just genocidal starvation. What
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:04.680]  the mood is there right now? Well, I think you have to realize, first of all, that both
[3:55:04.680 --> 3:55:09.040]  India and China have stated often on throughout the whole year that they have no intention
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:14.440]  of restricting their economic growth to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases. So I think the
[3:55:14.440 --> 3:55:18.440]  chances that they would have agreed to even a more benign treaty on their part were pretty
[3:55:18.440 --> 3:55:22.880]  slim to begin with. And also in India, we're starting to see the growth of a lot of climate
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:28.120]  skepticism. Many of the Indian glaciologists, for example, are completely rebutting the
[3:55:28.120 --> 3:55:34.240]  UN on Himalayan glaciers. So in India, I have interviewed today actually with an Indian journalist,
[3:55:34.240 --> 3:55:38.480]  we're seeing the rise of climate skepticism like you've never seen it before. And I think
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:43.320]  that what's going to happen is that with these increased demands on the third world, they're
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:47.720]  just going to turn the whole thing down flatly. And it's interesting because in the United
[3:55:47.720 --> 3:55:52.680]  States, I understand that even the Democrats are saying that without agreement from China
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:56.760]  and India, they're just simply not going to go ahead. But that's the problem. We have
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:03.760]  the AP headline, White House Threatens Command and Control says EPA will override Congress.
[3:56:03.760 --> 3:56:09.480]  That is putting the cart before the horse. That is tyranny. Yeah, exactly. But you know,
[3:56:09.480 --> 3:56:15.240]  I think that's pressure or pressure tactics to try to get them to pass Kerry Boxer. And
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:19.600]  it might succeed. The trouble is, of course, what do you do with all those chief imports
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:24.000]  that are coming from countries is fed to heck with greenhouse gas controls? I mean, it's
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:29.520]  just a death offense for the American economy. Exactly. As an engineer, let's say carbon
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:34.720]  dioxide is a deadly nerve gas. It kills all plants and animals. Polar bears can't swim.
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:38.960]  Everyone's dying. Pay all your money to Al Gore. He will save you. He's the eco profit.
[3:56:38.960 --> 3:56:44.960]  Let's say that's all true. You only put carbon controls on the West. It moves to China, India,
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:51.280]  Mexico, where they have no controls. Overall, the devil gas, the man bear pig gas, that's
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:56.480]  a South Park episode if you don't know, sir, increases, increases, then we're all dead.
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:01.000]  I mean, it will kill us. Well, one of the craziest things is China passed the United
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:07.520]  States and net carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. And even without these kinds of international
[3:57:07.520 --> 3:57:11.080]  agreements, you know, even if they just allowed them to continue to grow, they're going to
[3:57:11.080 --> 3:57:15.600]  already double the United States within about 20 years. So, in fact, if you don't get them
[3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:20.480]  on side, the CO2 emissions for the world are going to virtually stay unchanged. I mean,
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:23.840]  they're going to continue to rise, I should say. But, you know, one of the important things
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:29.080]  to realize is that throughout the world, there's countries who are now starting behind closed
[3:57:29.080 --> 3:57:33.040]  doors. Saudi Arabia did it actually in the UN meeting. They're starting to look at the
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:39.080]  climate data. And they're starting to say, this is actually a social engineering project
[3:57:39.080 --> 3:57:42.880]  more than it is environmental. And we've heard within the Canadian government people
[3:57:42.880 --> 3:57:47.000]  telling me, look, it has nothing to do with environment anymore. It's all politics and
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:50.640]  money. Sir, you're a very influential man. Let me just, I want to, I want to mail you
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:56.640]  a copy of my film Endgame. Sir, they admit at the UN, this is eugenics. They want to
[3:57:56.640 --> 3:58:02.560]  cut, worry strong. The head guy says it's to destroy industrial society. And we need
[3:58:02.560 --> 3:58:07.320]  to, I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, Kyoto is the flagship of the World
[3:58:07.320 --> 3:58:12.880]  Governance Program. I mean, you can see that very clearly. If you control the world, CO2,
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:16.000]  you're controlling most of the world's energy. And if you're controlling the world's energy,
[3:58:16.000 --> 3:58:20.640]  just as Rush has demonstrated when they turned off the past on the natural gas supply to
[3:58:20.640 --> 3:58:24.400]  Europe, you basically control whoever is at the other end of the path.
[3:58:24.400 --> 3:58:29.680]  All right, reporting to us from Copenhagen, Tom Harris, climatescienceinternational.org.
[3:58:29.680 --> 3:58:32.680]  Thank you, sir. I look forward to having you back on again.
