[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:44.320]  Texas Alex Jones just to illustrate how incredibly controlled our society is
[00:44.320 --> 00:52.520]  ladies and gentlemen as we start this live worldwide Tuesday edition the hit
[00:52.520 --> 00:58.080]  show the Bible that had 15 million viewers on average per show that's about
[00:58.080 --> 01:04.160]  four or five times record cable viewers for other top shows and I've been in top
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.640]  shows on channels that have two million viewers per show like Ventura's
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.280]  conspiracy theory and I've been on Discovery Channel shows that three million
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.680]  that they called hit shows this show had 15 million on average sometimes many as
[01:17.680 --> 01:24.480]  18 million they're now removing the devil figure that I'd say looks 80% like
[01:24.480 --> 01:30.400]  Obama think about that all because in casting the devil looked a little bit
[01:30.400 --> 01:40.080]  like Obama and you can't have a dark-skinned devil and so it's it's
[01:40.080 --> 01:43.360]  been removed from the next set of the series that's coming out
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.040]  meanwhile world net daily got noticed from Google they're not gonna let them
[01:47.040 --> 01:54.400]  carry their ads anymore because they ran the headline black mobs continuing to
[01:54.400 --> 01:58.520]  attack whites which is what's happening all over the country it's just a fact
[01:58.520 --> 02:03.560]  Google accuses world that daily of hate speech got Google banned us on a Google
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.520]  store we tried to open four years ago from selling the Obama deception and
[02:08.520 --> 02:15.920]  iTunes also refused the Obama deception twice saying that it was culturally
[02:15.920 --> 02:24.480]  inappropriate inappropriate this is the tyranny that we're dealing with but if
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.320]  you want to build abortion clinics on the corner of every black neighborhood
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.160]  and openly in their own documents say it's to exterminate blacks that that's
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.680]  fine you know just wiping out the blacks period is a good thing but if you
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.080]  report on the racial animus being pushed with Democratic Party creating a
[02:42.080 --> 02:48.240]  climate where attacking white people is is fashionable not just by blacks but by
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.480]  Hispanics you name it I mean it is epidemic in Austin epidemic and the
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.040]  police see nothing hear nothing it's like the monkeys that cover their eyes
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.880]  cover their mouth cover their ears because of political correctness but
[03:01.880 --> 03:08.680]  simply amazing meanwhile it's a top story up on drudge report Jersey City
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.640]  tackle snow removal as New Jersey deals with salt shortage and then buried in
[03:13.640 --> 03:20.880]  the article Homeland Security is involved with their bureaucracy blocking
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.200]  the salt getting removed the New Jersey Department Transportation Commissioner
[03:25.200 --> 03:31.400]  says the salt shortage could force him to close major highways roadways during
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.880]  storms Simpson says the U.S. Department Transportation told him he was found two
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.760]  barges that could carry a total of 15,000 tons of New Jersey in about three
[03:41.760 --> 03:51.280]  weeks but again it's its Homeland Security bureaucracy I'm convinced that a
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.120]  waiver a couple of days ago would have had the salt here already 1920 federal
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.840]  maritime act requires all ships flight American flag the government has yet to
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.720]  issue a waiver to allow the ships to make the delivery of the salt without it
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.360]  that's just an example of the total bureaucracy meant to shut down this
[04:10.360 --> 04:14.080]  economy in the society one of these heavy legal aliens drive the boat they'll
[04:14.080 --> 04:18.560]  give them free tuition free gas they can even drunk drive the barges if they
[04:18.560 --> 04:23.600]  want and that's just what this all comes down to and we've got Phyllis
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.360]  Laughley coming on to the Eagle Forum we an icon in the constitutional
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.440]  conservative libertarian movement they've commissioned big major studies to deal
[04:32.440 --> 04:39.000]  with the real demographic moves to open the borders up completely and what
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.320]  that's going to mean and but that'll be the end of the country that's the
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.840]  globalist plan no other nation has borders as open as us no other nation
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.760]  brings in immigrants and puts them on welfare like the U.S. does that's
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.680]  simply amazing and it's a political move that's all coming up I haven't even
[04:53.680 --> 04:57.520]  scratched the tip of the iceberg there's huge gun news coming up straight ahead

[07:10.600 --> 07:14.840]  else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in
[07:14.840 --> 07:20.320]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[07:20.320 --> 07:25.840]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.280]  record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously

[09:07.200 --> 09:16.200]  you gotta fight the good fight that will turn back to evil
[09:16.200 --> 09:20.760]  we got Phyllis Laughley coming on to break down major studies that they
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.400]  funded but they're also looking at other big studies on what getting rid of
[09:26.400 --> 09:34.440]  national sovereignty and totally opening the borders will do with this so-called
[09:34.440 --> 09:43.280]  immigration reform bill well where where to begin today let me just give you
[09:43.280 --> 09:50.120]  some of the some of the main stacks here obviously there is a video up on
[09:50.120 --> 09:57.240]  info wars.com and this info came out last year actually but is only now
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.400]  getting attention and a former top admiral retired admiral says Obama
[10:03.400 --> 10:07.480]  conspired with America's enemies to kidnap Chris Stevens and that was a
[10:07.480 --> 10:14.480]  very early on idea of actually people like Dr. Steve Pacinac on the air was
[10:14.480 --> 10:18.200]  that it was meant to be a fake kidnapping but there's also a lot of
[10:18.200 --> 10:21.520]  evidence that it was a cover-up for arms transfers and that there was a double
[10:21.520 --> 10:27.640]  cross within that operation but we're gonna play that clip coming up also I
[10:27.640 --> 10:31.280]  told you this a long time ago because it's actually well known in
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.720]  intelligent circles and I have connections to those report Japan
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.160]  secretly developing nuclear weapons Tokyo begins arms buildup in response to
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.400]  east coast China sea tension let me give everybody a news flash Japan's had
[10:45.400 --> 10:55.440]  nuclear weapons for at least 20 years and so has South Africa South Africa's
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.680]  had them since the 70s bio weapons since the 70s Israel's had nukes since the
[10:59.680 --> 11:05.400]  60s and I just can't believe how naive the public is not knowing this in fact
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.840]  the nuclear club states are probably double what they officially say both
[11:09.840 --> 11:17.600]  Korea's got them I was told by a high-level special forces commander that
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.880]  they had scans and facts and plans to go into Iran and have to go into mountain
[11:23.880 --> 11:33.120]  the doubts and fight multi-thousand level troops to be able to get in and be
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.080]  able to take out hidden nukes in mountains in Iran and he wouldn't tell
[11:38.080 --> 11:45.000]  me everything but he basically said it was the plan is to nerve gas the hills
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.280]  and the Iranians know this I could say it on air nerve gas them and then with
[11:50.280 --> 11:56.640]  high-tech full-body suits they've got and still they leak send in US special
[11:56.640 --> 11:59.680]  forces to try to blow up the nukes because they don't even have bunker
[11:59.680 --> 12:03.440]  busters that will go into these hills and knock these out you imagine they had
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.120]  some missions like that in World War two where they have guys land 50 miles away
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.480]  and and go in by ski I forget the name of that mission and they snuck into the
[12:11.480 --> 12:17.840]  underground bases and blew up the v1 base that's a famous case I forget I
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.760]  forget the actual name of that operation the point is that's the believe me the
[12:22.760 --> 12:26.000]  NSA is gonna be listen to that if they weren't listening live they're gonna be
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.120]  listen to it later but that's the kind of issues that are going on ladies and
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.680]  gentlemen so I've covered two articles now I said I'd mention headlines and
[12:34.680 --> 12:41.640]  then get back into it the feds I don't remember it was Operation Crossbow we
[12:41.640 --> 12:46.800]  can look it up it was a British special forces in one case it was American
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.040]  British in another than they would look at Allied programs to sabotage v1
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.360]  World War two there was another one where they blew up the heavy water they
[12:57.360 --> 13:00.600]  blew up they blew up the heavy water reactors underground but then also a
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.120]  shipment already left so they had to time the bomb in the in the ferry in the
[13:05.120 --> 13:07.800]  bottom where it blew up right in the middle of the lake they did a great
[13:07.800 --> 13:13.040]  job on that as well in Norwegian heavy water sabotage yeah that's one of the
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.480]  reports I forget the name of that operation it was a German nuclear energy
[13:17.480 --> 13:22.920]  project that was Operation Grouse I forget the one underneath the mountain
[13:22.920 --> 13:29.480]  blowing up the v1 missiles so anyways with verna von Braun really made out of
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.000]  that explosion come over here and run NASA along with Goddard and the rest of
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.680]  them but anyways continuing with the news ladies and gentlemen Jersey City
[13:40.680 --> 13:51.120]  tackles snow removal as New Jersey deals with salt shortage and they've got
[13:51.120 --> 13:54.840]  plenty of salt but the feds won't let them have it just like they did with
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.280]  Katrina not letting the thousands of fire departments and police departments
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.360]  from Texas and Louisiana Arkansas you name it ready to come in and restore
[14:02.360 --> 14:07.120]  order instantly unlike the lawless New Orleans police and told to stand down
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.920]  and then when the county police tried to restore power and stuff the feds cut
[14:10.920 --> 14:14.800]  the power lines and we've played the clip of the sheriff's talking about it
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.640]  well while he waited and followed orders the feds for four days while his
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.440]  mother's cell phone still worked and she would call him and he'd say I'm coming
[14:22.440 --> 14:25.520]  to today I'm coming tomorrow mom and finally he got there and his mother was
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.280]  dead imagine you're the sheriff and your mother's dying with three feet of water
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.640]  up to her bed in a hospital in downtown New Orleans and you follow the feds
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.440]  orders and don't go get her out when they were high and dry highways right to
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.200]  the hospital they just would let people walk out on those as well that is what
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.000]  you get from this federal government that is what should let me just give
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.480]  everybody a little newsflash here and I'm no hero and my mother is in a hospital
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.240]  and they're blocking the police and others from going in on the Coast Car
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.680]  from delivering diesel fuel for generators and everything so FEMA can run
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.920]  everything and have a bigger disaster instead any more funds later I'm going
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.400]  to get my mother and you better not get in my way and of course in the past no
[15:05.400 --> 15:07.440]  one would act like this because everybody would go in and get their
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.840]  mother nowadays police chiefs and people will sit there while their mother dies
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.560]  to follow orders of a criminal rogue government don't ever forget that folks
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.320]  that lets you know what we're dealing with in the society here's a really big
[15:21.320 --> 15:24.920]  stack of news that we're gonna get to after our first cover of the new Benghazi
[15:24.920 --> 15:32.120]  developments Rockefeller brothers Pepsi behind gun grab agenda now I already knew
[15:32.120 --> 15:35.720]  this and you already knew this but this is the kind of articles we need to see
[15:35.720 --> 15:42.520]  and I appreciate Kurt Demo doing this if you go look who funds anti-private
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.960]  property movements for the general public if you try to look at who finances
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.680]  higher taxes on the middle class and poor if you look at who finances victim
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.680]  disarmament anti-gun movements if you look at who finances globalism in the
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.560]  end of sovereignty if you look at who finances derivatives and the promotion
[15:58.560 --> 16:06.720]  of them it is always literally fortune 20 or so and always at the top is Carnegie
[16:06.720 --> 16:12.720]  endowment Rockefeller brothers Bill and Melinda Gates Warren Buffett of course
[16:12.720 --> 16:21.400]  the usual suspect George Soros and and Exxon and mobile and in Google and the
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.200]  Carnegie endowment I think I already mentioned them and here it is Rockefeller
[16:25.200 --> 16:30.040]  Brothers Foundation that's their biggest one Pepsi behind gun grab agenda and
[16:30.040 --> 16:34.480]  it's got the Aspen Institute top globalist think tank with all them up
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.760]  there pushing the disarmament of the American people I mean this is foreign

[16:45.080 --> 16:48.440]  are people with arm guards helicopters minimum machine guns guarding them they
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.600]  all own guns on record in fact in one of the articles it actually shows the
[16:53.600 --> 16:59.000]  lady who's anti-gun you know firing an AK-47 a lot of times they're obsessed
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.880]  with guns they just don't want you to have them that's the instinct of a crook
[17:02.880 --> 17:07.760]  an instinct of a disgusting control freak and then confirming what the mayor
[17:07.760 --> 17:12.960]  already set up in upstate New York and now over 50 mayors have quit the mayors
[17:12.960 --> 17:16.360]  for enslaving the American people I mean mayors against illegal guns

[17:21.480 --> 17:25.000]  organization that's what it is trying to violate my civil rights on record and
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.960]  organized deceptive manner the plan is to ban our guns well now a New York
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.360]  Assemblyman in the State House has been in the meetings and said safe act
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.000]  Democrats wanted to confiscate guns yeah I mean they've already said that I
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.920]  mean Bloomberg's been honest about that before but they go on the news they go
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.120]  nobody wants your guns everywhere we get control we take them all but just let
[17:47.120 --> 17:51.760]  us register them and we'll just shut down any private sales just just like

[25:10.600 --> 25:16.280]  just put it to you this way the big guys are headed for the exits and I was
[25:16.280 --> 25:24.760]  talking to a I'll just say at a pretty good size oil company had this few days
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.760]  ago I ran into and I recognized him when he's talking to me and I was like oh
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.600]  I've seen you on the news and he's like oh I'll watch your show I'm here in town
[25:32.600 --> 25:35.760]  and he's like oh no they're getting ready to bring the stock market down at
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.520]  least 20% he said probably more this bubble's gonna be in deflating I don't
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.400]  know if he has all the answers the point is is that I can walk down the street
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.200]  and run into people that I recognize from CNBC and they're they're telling me
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.080]  what they really think but I mean it's all over the news you see the signs all
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.200]  these big top people like Faber and Rogers and the list goes on and on the
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.920]  von Mises Institute I mean I don't know how long they can pump these bubbles up
[26:01.920 --> 26:05.840]  and quite frankly I don't want the bubbles to go down because it's the
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.080]  bubbles are official the globalists get to use it to take over they get the
[26:09.080 --> 26:12.640]  first use of the money it creates a consolidated economy but still we're
[26:12.640 --> 26:16.240]  riding on the back of it when it implodes it's gonna be even worse and
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.880]  they'll just get more power out of that so so that's coming up but what I wanted
[26:19.880 --> 26:27.480]  to get to right now is an article we posted from GOP thedailydose.com this
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.920]  is from Lou Dobbs Admiral Obama conspired with America's enemies to
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.880]  kidnap Chris Stevens and man I got this from Colonel Schaefer that this was
[26:37.880 --> 26:40.320]  something that was bouncing around the Pentagon he couldn't confirm it but he
[26:40.320 --> 26:42.960]  said that was one of the main things they knew it was there was a cover up and
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.880]  it was staged they just didn't know exactly what it was so you can in any
[26:46.880 --> 26:49.520]  criminal investigation you could tell when you're not being told the truth and
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.880]  that something stinks you just don't know till you get deeper or someone
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.920]  confesses or Joe you have prima facie evidence you know caught red-handed of
[26:57.920 --> 27:02.960]  exactly what went on but we know that there was a cover up and they got a
[27:02.960 --> 27:05.680]  bunch of weapons and it was al-qaeda and there was a stand-down order for almost
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.720]  eight hours so this is a big bombshell talk about info bombs this is it it's
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.960]  even worse than we previously thought a retired four-star admiral is reporting
[27:14.960 --> 27:18.920]  that Barack Obama intentionally conspired with America's enemies to stage a
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.760]  bogus attack and the kidnapping of an American ambassador so he could be
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.120]  negotiate the release of the hostages and bolster his mediocre approval ratings
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.240]  just prior the election why does that make sense most of the security was
[27:32.240 --> 27:35.760]  ordered off they were driving out but there was a double cross some of them
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.000]  were killed at highway checkpoints it was the al-qaeda forces put in years
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.640]  before to take over Libya in Benghazi that Western area on the border with
[27:45.640 --> 27:49.720]  Egypt that's one reason the bark had to be taken out he was like I'm not gonna
[27:49.720 --> 27:55.280]  help al-qaeda get arms in Egypt and then overthrow Libya and so they had to
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.160]  remove him that all came out so we know that went on but it fits into this story
[28:00.160 --> 28:05.520]  because because a lot of people were told to get out that's come out so they
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.360]  wanted to have just kind of a stage firefight have them give up and hand
[28:09.360 --> 28:13.760]  Stevens over but the two sheep dipped Navy Seals and by sheep dipped above
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.080]  Navy Seals in the CIA there's many levels above Navy Seals and Delta Force
[28:19.080 --> 28:22.760]  folks they came running down and didn't and didn't follow the order to stand
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.960]  down and so they started shooting them from behind killing scores of them some
[28:26.960 --> 28:33.080]  reports are over a hundred and so the Arabs went completely wild and the rest
[28:33.080 --> 28:37.280]  is a history you know what happened they were gonna use the kidnapping also as a
[28:37.280 --> 28:40.320]  cover to get into the three warehouses with all the missiles and then claim oh
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.200]  that's how they got them so they have plausible deniability here's the
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.680]  admiral talking about that and I really think this theory is probably what
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.840]  happened here this this is a peculiar response on the part of the CIA well it
[28:52.840 --> 28:58.920]  is that that it is also peculiar why we never have tried to secure our consulate
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.880]  that could have been done immediately and much information could have been
[29:03.880 --> 29:11.920]  protected possibly even more lives saved what's questionable is CIA's role and
[29:11.920 --> 29:18.880]  the director of naval intelligence role in the bogus cover-up story of that this
[29:18.880 --> 29:26.880]  was a reaction to us as spontaneous mob in a reaction to a video which nobody
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.640]  had seen and again that sounds like it was recorded on an electric razor but
[29:31.640 --> 29:38.560]  pretty bombshell info the full transcript is up on info wars.com false flag

[34:26.400 --> 34:30.560]  hyperinflation the American way of life will be destroyed I want to get into that
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.400]  article public schools are preparing American children for a life in a police
[34:34.400 --> 34:39.600]  state excellent article US and EU are paying Ukrainian rioters and protesters
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.880]  there's evidence of that I wouldn't say US and EU that is criminal bankers that
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.200]  have hijacked the EU and US have us in the exploitation phase using our money
[34:48.200 --> 34:52.160]  and treasure and Intel to try to bring down the rest of the world there there's
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.400]  the proper translation and another one radio station faked viral homophobic
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.400]  birthday invite we're attempting to spur healthy discourse on a highly
[35:04.400 --> 35:10.000]  passionate topic yeah the so-called left the so-called liberals are always
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  false flagging everything like most these cross burnings in yards most these
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.960]  church burnings most the swastikas on the dorm wall effect I don't think I've
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.240]  seen a case with the dorm stuff you see every few weeks it always turns out that
[35:24.240 --> 35:29.880]  it was staged false flag because that's the new religion at the university's is
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.640]  you don't go learn how to get a job or learn how to be good in business or learn
[35:34.640 --> 35:37.640]  how to be an entrepreneur or learn anything that's useful you just learn
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.160]  how to obsess over whatever protected group you are and you learn how white
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.520]  people are the devil and everything else is wonderful and we did a report on it
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.760]  of gay false flag attacks where we mark dice actually the video on that I guess
[35:53.760 --> 36:00.920]  we covered it but there it is up on info wars info wars dot com but I do want to
[36:00.920 --> 36:05.280]  open the phones up specifically on topics like what's happening in the
[36:05.280 --> 36:08.040]  economy I'd like to hear from you on that what do you think of this admiral
[36:08.040 --> 36:14.400]  former top admiral four-star admiral that's as high as it gets coming out on
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.160]  Lou Dobbs admiral James Lyons saying the attack on the American consulate in
[36:19.160 --> 36:24.240]  Benghazi was the result of a bungled abduction attempt the first stage of an
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.840]  international prisoner exchange it would have ensured the release of Omar
[36:30.840 --> 36:35.600]  Abdel Rahman the blind chic but something went horribly wrong with the
[36:35.600 --> 36:38.880]  October surprise although the Obama administration intentionally cut it
[36:38.880 --> 36:44.600]  secretly at the consulate prior to the stage kidnapping former Navy seals Tyrone
[36:44.600 --> 36:49.720]  Woods and Glenn Doherty disobeyed direct orders to stand down saved American
[36:49.720 --> 36:54.240]  lives single-handedly killed scores of attackers the attackers believing that
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.960]  the Obama administration had betrayed them tortured Ambassador Stevens and
[36:57.960 --> 37:02.440]  dragged his body through the streets it's clear Benghazi gate is only a small
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.280]  piece of a much larger operation an attempt to conceal what the American
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.960]  calls the Obama administration's full role in helping violent jihadish and
[37:11.960 --> 37:19.280]  self-styled al-Qaeda terrorist and it just goes on it just goes on from there
[37:19.280 --> 37:24.480]  so that there he is saying it was a staged prisoner exchange and and really
[37:24.480 --> 37:28.400]  you look at it in hindsight and all of our sources that's basically what it was
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.000]  getting most the staff out then trying to shut them down so they wouldn't talk
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.120]  and see that's what's good about this story it's a very sad story but the good
[37:37.120 --> 37:46.560]  news is that the most the government's not evil most the government's not
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.520]  corrupt in fact they're really hard-working upstanding people especially
[37:50.520 --> 37:54.920]  in the military I mean they they they're not trying to hire idiots for some of
[37:54.920 --> 38:01.040]  those more specialized positions and it's small criminal networks operating
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.240]  from the top this happens throughout history or rogue groups throughout the
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.280]  structure but as you get higher up it gets easier who are doing this and
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.520]  they're always getting their operations blown because other people who aren't
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.200]  criminals come out and speak out about it they had destroyer captains come back
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.480]  and tell the San Diego Herald Tribune in 1964 when their rotation ended when the
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.480]  ships came back six months later it was in the paper I've got a copy of it I've
[38:28.480 --> 38:31.800]  shown it on air before you can look it up it was never a rumor that the Gulf of
[38:31.800 --> 38:35.400]  Tonkin no there's a conspiracy theory the Gulf of Tonkin was staged to get us
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.880]  into the Vietnam War with the Gulf of Tonkin resolution well it became a
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.920]  conspiracy theory in a rumor when those two captains and others went public
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.000]  saying our ships were not attacked this appeared to be a provocation to get us
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.200]  into the war well as you know on the 40th anniversary in 2004 they released
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.600]  hundreds well they released thousands of hours but there were hundreds of hours
[38:57.600 --> 39:05.000]  just on the start of the the official start of the Vietnam War in 1964 with
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.160]  LBJ and Robert McNamara and they're showing you some transcripts of that
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.920]  on screen right now if you're a TV viewer but boom we were right again well
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.360]  we weren't right again we didn't look into a crystal ball and say the Gulf of
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.960]  Tonkin was staged I remember being on Discovery Channel shows and others
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.480]  where they would go Jones thinks everything's staged from the May in
[39:27.480 --> 39:34.240]  1898 to the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 to blah blah blah I don't think they were
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.520]  staged it's come out they were staged it's kind of like Jones thinks we orbit
[39:39.520 --> 39:49.840]  the Sun no I don't think that Jones thinks water is H2O I'm just I'm not
[39:49.840 --> 39:56.640]  smart ladies and gentlemen I'm just informed on things that matter what I
[39:56.640 --> 40:02.200]  am is instinctive I instinctively don't like to be a slave I instinctively take
[40:02.200 --> 40:08.800]  it personally I instinctively get aggressive I instinctively have defense
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.400]  mechanisms that activated me when I see total tyranny taking over I was a
[40:13.400 --> 40:20.400]  mainline libertarian Republican in 95 or so and I got on air and I was given so
[40:20.400 --> 40:25.120]  much info by people that were more awake than me and military people and folks
[40:25.120 --> 40:29.640]  that worked at the NSA and telecoms and because nobody else was covering this
[40:29.640 --> 40:34.560]  stuff then it didn't matter if I was a stuttering kid on the radio and because
[40:34.560 --> 40:38.520]  of that because I was a conduit and I came off unprofessional at times the
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.000]  system thought I'll just ignore him just everything worked perfectly by the grace
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  of God that I was able to get to this point but I know their program I've been
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.480]  doing this 19 years folks and I know their program and I know I'm right and
[40:51.480 --> 40:57.320]  I know that by the grace of God and your prayers and your action all the good
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.080]  people in government out of government you name it we have held this back for
[41:01.080 --> 41:07.520]  so long and what I was getting at that last rant is Benghazi people always say
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.480]  oh if they staged Gulf of Tonkin or if they stage 9-11 or if they stage
[41:11.480 --> 41:16.160]  Benghazi or if they stage Fast and Furious or if they staged all this stuff
[41:16.160 --> 41:21.960]  for the Boston bombing it would come out it has come out it has come out I mean
[41:21.960 --> 41:28.640]  Sy Hirsch has gone public saying 100% of them in Lawton raid is fake and a lie
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.280]  that's a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who I know listens to the show keep
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.920]  saying will come on for years and ever does it and I'm not criticizing you
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.040]  might get being busy and not wanted to do more work but or you know being
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.000]  criticized going on that radical show like come on man those labels don't
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.280]  work anymore yeah he said one big lie was the quote Pulitzer Prize winning
[41:52.280 --> 42:01.640]  journalist slams pathetic US media so so here's the issue ladies and gentlemen
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.960]  the denial is not getting us out of this it's making it worse and I know our
[42:07.960 --> 42:12.080]  listeners are not in denial but it's now time to get the general public out of
[42:12.080 --> 42:17.280]  denial and and the general public is actually ready for that to a certain
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.320]  extent I want to hear from you about Benghazi I want to hear from you about
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.400]  Fast and Furious I want to hear from you about the paradigm shift we see
[42:25.400 --> 42:30.520]  happening and do you think it's safer I'd like to hear from people that are
[42:30.520 --> 42:36.600]  critics out there 80 you think I'm lying about all this stuff or B do you
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.480]  think I'm interpreting it wrong now I'd like to hear your rationale or I'd like
[42:40.480 --> 42:43.280]  to hear from people out there who think they can't be beaten so that's why
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.520]  you're not speaking out I'd like to hear from anybody on on on the subject of
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.880]  Benghazi gate these cover-ups where we are as a society Soros betting against
[42:51.880 --> 42:57.280]  the stock market and the debt I've got some second amendment news I'm gonna
[42:57.280 --> 43:03.000]  cover first and go to your calls the toll-free number to join us on air is
[43:03.000 --> 43:13.800]  800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 but I do want to talk about the state of the
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.000]  world where you think the world's going what do you think the globalists are
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.080]  gonna do to try to keep their agenda going forward because because it is in
[43:20.080 --> 43:27.000]  trouble it is stalling on on many many fronts 800 259 9231 and I'm not saying
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.560]  first-time callers but you know if you want to talk about you know the standard
[43:33.560 --> 43:39.360]  inside baseball kind of cast Sunstein cognitive infiltration in fighting stuff
[43:39.360 --> 43:43.040]  I'll entertain you for 10 seconds but I got to move on just because it just gets
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.960]  really old and I'm in a paradigm of waking up those that aren't awake
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.760]  reaching out realizing we can win realizing we can turn the tide realizing
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.360]  we're selling freedom that's a lot more popular than tyranny like selling
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.360]  snow cones in hell or it's like selling an electric blanket with a battery of
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.240]  solar power system to the Eskimos I mean this is some popular stuff here and
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.700]  and we've got the moral high ground we should stop being so intimidated look I
[44:08.700 --> 44:12.760]  love the militia it's part of the second amendment but I don't like the fact that
[44:12.760 --> 44:18.240]  it's led so many times by weekend warrior types who are in fantasy land and
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.040]  it's like it's like paintball or something and they meet behind the barn
[44:22.040 --> 44:25.600]  and they roll around in the dirt and they imagine everyone's watching them and
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.760]  you know they're all paranoid and and and then I mean a militia should be
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.040]  spending a third of its time cleaning firearms firing them being
[44:35.040 --> 44:38.520]  proficient in the rest of the time in community outreach trying to feed the
[44:38.520 --> 44:41.880]  poor wearing suits and ties going to county commissioners and city council
[44:41.880 --> 44:47.280]  meetings running for office acting like the legitimate leadership not acting
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.880]  like you're part of some secret James Bond organization by the way does James
[44:51.880 --> 44:56.480]  Bond wear Southeast Asia camouflage like all the militia people I know no he
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.640]  wears a suit and tie and I'm telling you folks we that's who we're looking for
[45:01.640 --> 45:09.160]  is 1776 operatives organically businessmen successful people folks that
[45:09.160 --> 45:12.360]  know how to get stuff done you don't need to hear ideas from me you know what
[45:12.360 --> 45:18.200]  to do in your area take over legally lawfully sell freedom undermine the
[45:18.200 --> 45:23.960]  enemy discredit them go go go go we don't have a lot of time we've already
[45:23.960 --> 45:27.680]  had major victories we are in a battle with the globalist we've got a chance
[45:27.680 --> 45:31.400]  here but the enemy knows they're in trouble and they're trying to close the
[45:31.400 --> 45:43.720]  gates on us and so just get aggressive get aggressive go out and and you know

[45:54.600 --> 45:57.800]  never had the paradigm shift of seeing the decompartmentalization of how
[45:57.800 --> 46:00.840]  they're manipulated believe me if they read it they'll wake up if they're not
[46:00.840 --> 46:06.280]  already awake because it's the truth and they'll go wow I never I knew all this
[46:06.280 --> 46:10.400]  was going on I didn't understand the pieces it's not because they're stupid

[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.680]  Wi-Fi network so when you go to connect your device to something like a Wi-Fi
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.480]  network you see all the different names yes they sell these devices called
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.240]  Wi-Fi pineapple so that you broadcast about like a hundred different Wi-Fi
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.240]  names and you can make them anything you want you could have 911 was an inside
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.000]  job you could make a hundred Wi-Fi networks with freedom messages and just
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.120]  carry this thing around with you everywhere you go and people will see
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.880]  it on because you could actually do some really neat things on it that will

[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:32.320]  that there it is I almost got it a fly swatter maybe that is maybe that's a
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.600]  drone I'm being sarcastic MSNBC I didn't actually say that was a drone they've
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.360]  already said I believe wasp live underneath the Capitol building or
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.880]  none of the UN building when everybody knows it's actually giant 18 foot tall
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.000]  turkeys anyways let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas alright I'm gonna stop
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.440]  right there Steve in Texas you're on the air go ahead hi Alex last month you
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.160]  were mentioning Amazon's predictive purchasing ability yes sir and that is
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.760]  that is so pervasive that it's basically changing the way economists are able to
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.360]  predict the market instead of looking at market prediction they're able to
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.680]  predict individual consumers and that's going to change the way advertising and
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.840]  everything is done in the future via your web ID to all your devices TVs you
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.440]  name it smartphones they're going to deploy ads that are tailored to you and
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.480]  then it's just it's the end of your privacy right there and then they can
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.080]  also tailor your behavior by what they feed you falsely exactly the data
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.560]  mining is the future you will not be able to go to the bathroom without
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.200]  someone knowing about it the only way I see to combat it is to create a local
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.760]  economy my economist professor says the exact same thing about Amazon almost a
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:52.400]  week later and he said you know he doesn't want the future to be dictated by
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.640]  mega corporation and it's everywhere exactly while we're being told to fight
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.320]  with each other over what how much pigment we have on our skin that's
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.080]  because they're discriminating us on our info on on our taxes it's all going to
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.680]  these globalist I mean we're all being destroyed right now I don't care what
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.680]  color you are and we're busy fighting with each other over the diminishing
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.680]  artificial resources and so I'm glad you brought that up go ahead yeah and you
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.320]  know I was with you out there last year tactical firearms and the second
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.040]  amendment second amendments under attack first amendments under attack it's bad
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.920]  so you have to begin to network locally and take things back 50 years yeah I'm
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.360]  just glad to Katie police outside of Houston didn't give anybody trouble for
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.840]  all being armed with what you call assault rifles and I saw their bullhorn
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.000]  on the side of the road and nothing bad happened and the police didn't violate
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.920]  the first or second amendment wasn't that great yeah I mean the other day they
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.840]  had a Harris County Sheriff SWAT thing it looked bigger than a tank I mean it
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.960]  was jacked up like an 18-wheeler it's horrible yeah those are called full-power
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.760]  war wagons it's incredible

[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.400]  minutes amnesty equals suicide for Republican Party folks if these were
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.600]  libertarians coming over the border quite frankly I wouldn't care if there were
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.680]  30 million and but if they were white socialists coming across the border I'd
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.680]  be against them as predominantly Latin Americans and they are absolutely on
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:00.560]  average close to 90% voting anti-gun anti-family Democratic Party line and
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.360]  again folks it's not that we're quote for the Republicans either so the
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.880]  Democrats are taking over and the Republican leadership wants amnesty
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.280]  to and the big banks want and they're giving money to try to run all the Tea
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.120]  Party people out and saying it's racist no one let's see legals come to their
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.600]  country and give them all this welfare we're going bankrupt folks we're already
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.600]  bankrupt and you're gonna legalize the legals that's gonna bring in even more
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:32.400]  and we know where this situation goes so I'm gonna repost on info wars.com I've
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.240]  got to get Daniel's doing it right now amnesty equals suicide Republican Party
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.320]  and fellow Schlafly's gonna be joining us we're gonna break all that down I'm
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.280]  gonna retweet Matt Drudge's tweet today plugging the fact that she's coming on
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.520]  because this is a big deal and we need to talk facts I can't go to Mexico and
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:58.800]  have a baby for free I can't go down there and get on welfare and it's just
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.920]  in it's insane Mexico is a failed collapse state and then they sell it
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:08.200]  like it's mean to Hispanics if you don't want totally open borders and then
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.600]  Americans on average are so politically correct they go okay we'll do
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.320]  whatever you say to the point of you can't even the Discovery Channel and
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:26.360]  History Channel you know are getting rid of any characters that are of mixed
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.080]  racial background in a bad light I mean here's one Obama Satan lookalike cut
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.640]  from film version of hit miniseries the Bible the devil is on the cutting room
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.840]  floor this is now a movie about Jesus the devil gets no more screen time to
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.600]  producer the son of God and that's all the political correctness in Google you
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.960]  know won't let you talk about black mobs beating up white people all over the
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.040]  country and they call that hate speech is threatening to shut down basically
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.920]  we're on that daily with Google ads we've got Joseph Farah on tomorrow to break
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:05.160]  all of that down so this is the political weaponization of speech where
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.240]  you're not allowed to have your speech but the establishment the establishment
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:15.680]  is when the Democratic Party operates as a cult now where in almost every case
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:22.920]  you can go out to California especially but also University of Texas in Austin
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:28.840]  where I live kind of a bizarro world compared to the rest of Texas not the
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.360]  Texas is perfect but I mean it's fruit cake land and you go down there and say
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.080]  hey we want to ban water for the earth Al Gore says they may sign the petition and
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.400]  we want to put the gun owners in prison all of them they sign the petition and
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.200]  California mark dice goes out and I mean this is unedited folks then this is
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.600]  what he'll talk to 10 people and nine of them will say yes put gun owners in
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.200]  camps and kill them if you say for a moment we're gonna put gun owners in
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.080]  camps and kill them you've heard that the audio here the videos on info wars.com
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.960]  and they say yes we want to kill gun owners they will do anything they are in
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.280]  a cult they don't know how to tie their shoelaces literally they just don't
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.120]  how to support the Democratic Party and hop around acting trendy all day they
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.040]  don't know about foreign corporations only Democrat and Republican leadership
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.000]  they have no idea about Balkanization they have no idea about real
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.640]  discrimination by the globalist and the rigged economy all they know how to do
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.960]  is run around grandstanding now I want to cover some second amendment news we're
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:32.320]  gonna go to JJ Wayne Kevin Timothy John in fact in the order it's JJ Wayne John
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.840]  and Timothy and then Kevin I'm gonna get to all of you here in just a moment but
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:42.680]  first I want to go ahead and get into this news report that's up on info wars
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:51.600]  calm Rockefeller brothers pepsi behind gun grab agenda and you can go in there
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:58.760]  and watch the video and see their own web page the Aspen Institute is like a
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:07.880]  Bilderberg subcommittee and you can go see the heads of PepsiCo and the and
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.840]  the Rockefeller Foundation Rockefeller Brothers Foundation admit they're
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.800]  funding the mood to disarm the American people I mean let's talk about where
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.560]  this comes from ultra-rich scum who politically hijacked the country and are
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.680]  the biggest recipients of taxpayer bailouts and tax exemptions I mean they
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.200]  are the ultimate discriminatory and find out who funded Hitler the biggest
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.200]  funder of Hitler on record was the Rockefeller Foundation then became
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.520]  Rockefeller Brothers Foundation I think it was like in 1910 or something but so
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.440]  by the time they funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in the 20s and then
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.880]  Hitler it was the Rockefeller Brothers the literal group that that literally
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.360]  created the Nazi party the proto-nazi party and David Rockefeller went over
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.760]  there and spent time in Germany and was a double agent of the Germans and helped
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.560]  set him up when he was like you know 18 years old I mean these are these are
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.000]  amazing people I mean I got to say he set up every UN organization there is I
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.840]  mean you got a handle to them they they really are busy little bumblebees
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.280]  George Soros is kind of a modern example he was a Nazi collaborator on record and
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:22.280]  it's just so crazy to be informed and know that a not a proto-nazi this is the
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.920]  Nazis daddy and mama that laid down on its back and literally sped out the
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.760]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and worldwide eugenics and Adolf Alois Hitler and it's
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.600]  teamed up with Soros and Bloomberg and all these other Jews of all people going
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.720]  after the Second Amendment I mean it is just cuckoo bizarre oh land and and then
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.600]  you've got all these camp followers like Michael Moore and Obama and Nancy
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:59.320]  Pelosi and all of it I mean it is insane it is it is so bizarre when you look at
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.040]  all the players and what's going on but when you get down to it it's just evil
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.160]  it's authoritarians across the board whether they be Chinese whether they be
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.760]  German whether they be Jewish British I don't care they have an instinct in the
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.560]  elite to disarm their quarry so that article is up on infowars.com here's
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.600]  another one I'm going to play the video of this New York Assemblyman say fact
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.880]  Demons Democrats wanted to confiscate guns evidence that the gun control lobbies
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.480]  ultimate goal to disarm law-abiding gun owners surface last year in a short
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.840]  video clip that dovetails with the mayors that went public last week from a
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.560]  New York state assembly session prior to the passage of the highly contentious
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.000]  say fact the video posted a month later by the Sandy Hook school shooting the
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.120]  PIX Assemblyman Stephen F. McLaughlin attempting to address the topic of
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.240]  rejecting Democrat proposals from the bill I have in my hand something here
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.680]  we receive from the Senate which has rejected Democrat proposals in the
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.760]  bill he replies to it and lists it saying that everybody's got their own list of
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:04.160]  Senate rejections so I don't have anything to show you and he goes on to
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.320]  say well it sure does when we talk about confiscation of assault weapons it
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.480]  absolutely has the ability to dampen a compromise and remember the clip actually
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.240]  there's a clip where they talk about gun confiscation about once they get the
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.440]  registration to do the force buyback well we have the mayor proteam Mike
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.440]  Martinez saying once we register we will come take your guns so the point is
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.800]  we I mean people that know what's going on go of course they want the guns well
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.120]  the general public still thinks they just want reasonable restrictions you know
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  not not a lot my cars broke down just just are you home alone lady just let
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.880]  me in the woman's got a bad feeling the guy looks like a convict don't open the
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.880]  door lady only move on on the road you know call 911 for me be absolutely has
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.360]  to have help don't open the door in the middle of the night well same thing is
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.920]  open the door let us see and turn your guns in we're gonna be nice to you open
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.600]  the door let me put you in handcuffs me tie you up and then I'm gonna take good
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.240]  care of you that work well for the women that went with Ted Bundy let's go
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.560]  ahead and go to a part of this clip a proof Democrats want to register and
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.920]  then confiscate and Joe I have my hands here something that we received from the
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:20.800]  Senate which is rejected Democrat proposals in this gun bill and I don't
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.480]  know that you've seen this or if you know that these are there or not no but
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.880]  we don't have our own list of rejected proposals of a Senate rejected so I
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.840]  don't have anything to show you okay all right so I want to dress it in if you
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:40.360]  haven't seen it I'll leave that one alone okay thank you Joe appreciate it
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.600]  and mr. Speaker on the bill and by the way I would recommend not to have that
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:51.280]  list shared because it really has the capacity to dampen the enthusiasm to
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.560]  compromise well I sure does when we talk about confiscation of assault weapons
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:00.400]  and it absolutely has an ability to dampen and compromise mr. Speaker on the
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:06.840]  bill on the there you go don't share that list with anybody I mean look let's
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.200]  stop playing here we all know what you want we all know the goal you have a
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.880]  criminal instinct I don't care if it's Central Africa I don't care if it's
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:24.600]  Mexico I don't care if it's California I don't care if it's New York I don't care
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.800]  of it's Illinois the government's there wherever their criminal wherever their
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:35.120]  mafia wherever they're gouging and taxing and pushing and harassing and it's
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.280]  because they're all exempt folks you go look at all those kleptocratic regimes
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.400]  like France with the socialist they're all exempt from the taxes it comes out
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.960]  in the news they all have Swiss bank accounts but in the case of the EU the
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:53.360]  bureaucrats are exempt from the EU federal tax the our Congress is exempt
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.920]  for most the taxes what now they're trying to pass legislation where their
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:04.400]  exemptions are secret see that's real discrimination that's what you should
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.320]  feel really cheated by that you've got to pay outrageous taxes while they're
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.400]  exempt because if they had to pay them folks they wouldn't be doing it that's
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.360]  why you want justice all men are credit equal as Declaration of Independence
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.040]  said and as Martin Luther King re quoted by created equals you get the
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.680]  same rights you get the same starting line it doesn't mean you're really

[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:39.840]  well now the London Guardian is coming out saying it's time to join the
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.320]  preppers because government can and won't supply aid during all sorts of
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.480]  emergencies Idaho families walk 19 miles after getting stranded in the snow
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:56.400]  blizzard epidemic of potholes third snowiest winter in Philly on record
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.200]  second snowiest February in New York City on record that's in 300 years

[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.960]  wide-out conditions in Chicago and my cousin just came down here from my
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.720]  uncle's memorial is that a funeral but they're also a memorial this weekend as
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.040]  everybody could come and he just said it's just hellish in Chicago just
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.160]  absolutely hellish and I'm looking at drudge report report com articles right
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:28.240]  now but the whole point is is that it's just getting crazier and crazier and
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.400]  crazier and by the way the London Guardian doesn't say start prepping they
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.880]  also say it's climate change apocalypse is upon us no it's the Sun
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.720]  cool down in its cycle and it's the Sun stupid and the earth gets hot and gets
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.240]  cold and we should pray for hot cycles because that's when we can grow more
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.720]  stuff dummy I mean the old-timers knew they went through cycles and you know
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.560]  it too you just want to make the public so ignorant and so superstitious and so
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.600]  dumb down that they think if we don't worship the high priest Al Gore and he
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  doesn't wave his magic wand he's running around in a nightgown or whatever he
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.800]  does that you know chasing a masseuse around that he doesn't you know be
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.240]  engaged in leprechaun activities and give us a pot of gold we're all dead I'm
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.120]  just sick of it JJ in California thanks for holding her on the air hey how you
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.040]  doing Alex I am doing good brother yeah I really want to thank you for inspiring
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.440]  me to first of all I've been a longtime listener first-time caller I actually
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.320]  created a YouTube channel where I post a YouTube about Obama and what's going on
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.840]  usually on an every other week basis it's just when I get really frustrated
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.160]  oh that's good every listener should be on the enemy platform YouTube everyone
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.280]  should have their own blog everyone should be doing something to be heard
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.920]  and together if everybody did that just from this show it'd be over if
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:56.400]  everybody just started getting active it would overturn the system immediately and
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.600]  I appreciate that you really inspired me to do that and I post it on my Facebook
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.800]  and I also post it on my LinkedIn account which I have a little good just plug
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:12.440]  it go ahead and plug it thank you it's called Obama factor 7 to 7 and the
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.600]  email is Obama factor 7 so that's great I'm glad to plug it but what if I let
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.920]  people plug on and on it'll it'll just kind of get repetitive and what you're
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.400]  calling about specifically serve on the topics that you've inspired me to talk
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.200]  about first of all I love it how Obama could wave a magic wand and extend
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:36.520]  Obamacare until 2016 and the only reason why he did that as you and I know is to
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.160]  prevent tens of millions of people from losing their insurance policies and you
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.040]  know honestly voting against the democratic platform this November so
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.120]  it was a very smart political move on his point it's even more deceptive for
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.360]  most people that they're still kicking them off it's false hope that's even
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.840]  a lie do you understand that just like I told you most people signing up who
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.800]  thought they signed up didn't so it isn't three million like they say it's
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.520]  not even a million it's all fraud it's it if you're gonna tell one line get away
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.560]  with it why not tell 85 Gilliam and then and look at the state of Oregon I mean
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.040]  what a fraud there they spent six million dollars on that website and not one
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.480]  person has kind of not one but they do that on purpose as an even mainline
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:26.440]  news now says the websites nationally and at state levels don't work because
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.880]  they want to make it about the broken website not about the fact you go on
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.560]  they double your premium my dad's is more than doubled mine is doubled and most
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.560]  people in Texas were getting it where it's it's oh it went up 30% oh and two
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.000]  months later oh another 30 another 30 and then I see my crew nodding out there
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.240]  that's how it's working they're just doing it like in the shark bite so even
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.000]  small bites though it's shark bites but it's not in one one big piece they're
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.160]  just gobbling us up but you heard him he said it wouldn't raise your premiums
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.440]  it would lower them and you could keep your doctor doesn't matter it's a lie
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:04.880]  are you a racist sir yeah well no I just want to ask how many times does
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.680]  Obama gets a lie before someone stands up and says we're going to impeach it I
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.800]  mean he lied about the video he's lying about the IRS he's lying about the
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.480]  I the ACA and what about those shovel ready jobs that he's got to go after the
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.160]  Republican leadership that is going be nice to ST party be friends while they
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:27.560]  fund money with the Democrats to kill the Tea Party they're like you know
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.520]  stand down stand down while they're firing on us they run up a white flag and
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.520]  then launch an offensive while they have white flags waving everywhere and and
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.800]  and then just like mainline pundits are saying the Republican leadership doesn't
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.360]  want to go up the IRS because they want the Tea Party destroyed we have to
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:48.360]  rally to the Tea Party with moral and financial support right now they're right

[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.760]  full control by having a voting class that is on welfare and on different
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:32.920]  handouts who can then vote to enslave everyone else using the free society to
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.520]  enslave the society well in a republic you're not a pure democracy in a pure
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:44.880]  democracy you could have 51% vote to make the other 49 slaves or you could
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.520]  have you know 51% vote to kill the other 49 if they thought they could get away
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.800]  with it first they want to disarm them and things like that and it's just
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.520]  incredibly obvious to see what's going on she's going to be joining us look

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.200]  go to your phone calls Wayne in Virginia thanks for calling in you're on the
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.160]  air yeah a long-time listener first-time caller okay that's done with I just want
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.520]  to tell everybody how joyful it is to spread the word I bought a pickup truck
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.760]  and five months later I sold it I took the place back to DMV so I could get my
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.240]  refund and I started telling the lady any time I have a captive audience I
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.840]  tell everything but I try to lighten it up you know they go how you doing oh I'm
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.000]  doing better the shrink let me out and that lightens the situation so I start
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.080]  telling her how to gender 21 and to your engineering and she looks at me goes
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.640]  you don't remember me do you and I said no I don't I'm sorry she says I sold you
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.840]  these plates you told me all this before I thought okay well I'm sorry then she
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.400]  said well I went home and me and my husband looked up agenda 21 our house
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.880]  is now on the market we are getting out of here and so it's it's just so you
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.880]  can't imagine how good it feels the success you're sitting there you don't
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.320]  you don't see it but when they look you right in the face and say they listen to
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.480]  you and they paid attention to you it feels great well that's the issue because
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.000]  we've got the truth we've got the light in the dark and we I mean it's true we
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.160]  know what's going on it's not that we're rocket scientists we'll face the facts
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.200]  historically not what the fake controlled state-run media or Hollywood has said
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.800]  and people are hungry for it I mean not the trendies I mean they would jump in a
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.720]  off a cliff if they thought it was cool to do but the general public is starting
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.720]  to wake up go ahead yeah yeah and it is fun I mean if you're you walk into a
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:05.400]  restaurant and they sit down how you doing well I'm in a restaurant I'm
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.720]  hungry you know you see you lighten the situation up and then you can just tell
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.600]  them anything and they're a receptive audience and I can't stop I don't care
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.280]  where I am if I go to the bank I tell them about the Federal Reserve I go to the
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.440]  grocery store I'm telling about GMO foods I'm always on and it is a great
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.080]  feeling when you find somebody that listened to you and is awake and is
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:29.560]  spreading the word now also so I just want to patch on the back and keep up
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:34.200]  to good work and that's about all I have man it's just it's great to wake
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:40.640]  somebody up it is Wayne again it's good to find your fighting spirit again it's
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.240]  good to decide you're not just gonna accept all this the globalist tell you
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.520]  you're powerless there's nothing you can do it's over constantly because they
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.560]  know you have power and they want to intimidate you with political correctness
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.000]  or you're afraid to be a cowboy in Halloween or a Native American or a
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.560]  gay sugar they want to make everybody feel guilty but them the globalists that
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.240]  are really the guilty ones the Democratic Party on record the Ku Klux Klan
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.520]  Party until the mid-1960s they started losing elections against the Republicans
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.520]  that passed the Civil Rights Act under Eisenhower a few years before and they
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.360]  said well we'll do race politics this way now and broke the other direction and
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.600]  it's work great for them and the Republican leadership is bought and
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.120]  paid for by the same interest that's why the Democrats can't be beaten because
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.880]  they're not up against opposition so here comes the Tea Party set up by Ron
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:38.000]  Paul and libertarians the Republicans try to co-opt it it blows up in their
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.240]  face and metastasizes in their view and starts taking over and right now they
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.520]  are in an emergency like chickens with their heads cut off running around at
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.160]  these corporate meetings on record all hands on deck thrilling all the
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.560]  Democrat and Republican money they've got to crush the Tea Party that's on
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:00.640]  record that's even on Fox News now they admit that and the Republican leadership
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.520]  won't do a thing about the Tea Party having the IRS come after him let the
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.080]  crooked IRS come after you let them try to make stuff up go public big deal I
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.080]  thought I'm doing it to me I'm not doing I'm paying their fake fraudulent taxes
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:19.760]  for the fake fraudulent private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and if
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.520]  you're a 501c3 you have every right to promote the Bill of Rights in
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.280]  Constitution their liars when they tell you you can't I'm not a 501c3 but the
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.680]  point is that's what they're going after the Democrats are squealing and yelling
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.360]  in the news this week going I saw it Sunday make it illegal to have a Tea
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.320]  Party 501c3 more IRS these people are beating us well yeah because you're
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.480]  incredibly unpopular saying we didn't build our businesses and our kids don't
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.920]  belong to us you are a bunch of freaks who set up there with a moral high
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.680]  ground up against loyal opposition with Boehner who plays golf with Obama
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:02.480]  constantly I mean what a joke remove Boehner remove all of the leadership out
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.040]  of leadership positions they could do that right now put Tea Party people in
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.800]  there and start explaining what's going on and then people would come to the
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.880]  leadership and you'd have the Tea Party take the Senate and the House we could
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.080]  save this country we just kind of decide we want to do it we've just got to
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.440]  decide we're not losers everybody's like oh we'll never defeat the new order oh we
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.080]  can never be so Alex there's no way you snuck in Bohemian Grove there's no way
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:30.000]  people got footage of skull and bones there's no way that guy got on the NFL
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.720]  post the press conference and took over there's no way that's real there's no
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:39.400]  way you you actually built your media system by yourself there's no way that
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.440]  the big that guy arm wrestling that guy's bigger than you there's no way you
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.440]  could there's no way you you know there's no way you grew those watermelons
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  those are just too big there's no way there's no way you built that house on
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.960]  your own there's no way you know there's there's no way your son just wrote this
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:58.720]  wrote this paper for school we just don't believe it it's too advanced so we
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.600]  just well you're an adult and you're a moron my son's smarter than you I put my
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.520]  son in a private school before and they're like you wrote this paper your
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:13.000]  wife didn't like no my nine-year-old son did because he reads at that time he's
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.920]  11 now he was reading adult literature and because it's a rest of development
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.480]  my father was reading me when he was four he was reading adult literature when
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:30.200]  he was six or seven my dad would be sent away on summers as training folks he
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.800]  didn't get sent to pick cotton one one one month in in September or whatever
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.400]  because the family it's not like my dad was in cotton fields they sent him to
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.240]  teach him hard work and they sent him for two months to work in a machine shop
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.960]  in Houston when he was 10 and then they'd send him to work in a bank for
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.320]  three months and this you know he my dad was that's what you did in the old days
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:58.720]  you sent your sons especially your daughters as well to apprentice so that
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.960]  they knew how to do everything that's what a man knew how to do now he didn't
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:11.360]  do any of that but you know they've taught us just to be incredibly weak like
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.160]  people tune in and watch like steer wrestling and they see some guy jump
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.160]  off a horse and grab a huge cow and throw it down like that can't be real
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.680]  because people don't believe in what a human can do they have no well of course
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.320]  if you're telling us we're all a bunch of scum that walk off the edge of you know
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.800]  streets or into fountains or off bridges with our iPhones that's what the
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.400]  globalists want to contend with a bunch of jellyfish ladies and gentlemen God
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:40.160]  didn't build a bunch of crap a new old order builds crud I'm sorry I said I take
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:44.760]  a lot of calls John in Texas you're on the air go ahead Alex it was great to see
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.840]  you at the 2nd Amendment rally in San Antonio and I wanted to speak quickly
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:54.200]  about a microcosm of politics that's happening in Texas right now with Greg
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:59.840]  Abbott bringing a Nugent on to go to a few of his governor campaign stops and
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:06.560]  then he's in turn attacked by Greg he knows all right Gilberto he knows the
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:14.520]  Wendy Davis band of tube by saying well Nugent is talking bad about our first
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.040]  African-American president and the finer points of politics don't even come up
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.920]  never mind that he's supporting 2nd Amendment never mind that anything is
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.760]  being said or wants to be talked about take those straight to the race card
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:33.200]  straight again he hates women and then end of discussion shamed into the corner
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.760]  and that's all I mean let's face it Ted Nugent is a red-blooded caveman who
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:44.360]  loves women and and who's never has done anything racist to anybody and he grew
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.120]  up in Detroit and a bunch of his band are black so it's just it's that's all
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.840]  they've got I mean you can't send a meme making fun of Obama now or they make it
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.360]  take take it off your Facebook if you go to public school saying it's racist we've
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.560]  played the teachers on air the clips students have recorded going you don't
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:08.200]  criticize Obama you can be arrested these are authoritarians and yeah I know I
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:15.120]  think Abbott is probably one of the better candidates for governor there that
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:19.600]  or Jerry Patterson who do you like for governor I like Patterson I enjoyed
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.160]  meeting him there at the Alamo at the time and as far as people waking up I
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.480]  have to say at work in a pharmaceutical business and I work with about 40 to 50
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:35.400]  people who all on an individual basis would love to discuss the finer points
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:42.480]  of 9-11 fiat current the media brainwashing all of that it's just
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.800]  about taking that second step over the line and doing something about it in
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.760]  your community as the last color spoke to beautifully said thank you for the
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:58.040]  call by the way again I'm not against pharmaceuticals there are some great
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:05.400]  drugs out there there's some great doctors and nurses it's that 50 years
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:11.320]  ago they knew about side effects they would pull a drug pretty quick it was
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.360]  causing deformities brain damage now they just go conspiracy theory none of
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.760]  this is possible when the drug insert says it can do it
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.640]  it's like antibiotics they're a miracle drug the problem is they're not
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.320]  they're starting to not work what happens when they don't work anymore we're
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.960]  left with super bugs I'm just pointing out the problems and then you get
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:35.160]  something like a Gardasil that doesn't protect you from papilloma on record go
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.760]  read the trials kills people and is obviously a sterile it I'm not saying
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.200]  your local doctor or a nurse is a bad person I'm saying the people at the top
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.360]  of the pyramid are movie L Diablo let's talk to Timothy in Virginia you're on

[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:10.480]  failings but very very exciting to promote Liberty and the way it's meant
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:17.440]  to be anything else yeah just one more thing the Dorado of California don't
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  think that maybe that has something to do with over that geoengineering all
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:26.160]  those chemtrails and maybe a corporate land a power grab of all the farms out
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.200]  there the people are experiencing all the droughts I mean those farmers have to
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.040]  sell their land I mean you watch the the video what's it called the why in the
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.520]  world are they spraying you watch that and that totally convinced me that maybe
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.080]  what's going on out in California right now is just total just geoengineering a
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.120]  drought they're just doing that take all the land well I mean here's the bottom
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:58.040]  line there is massive geoengineering going on and that's just a fact but it's
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:02.600]  so secret they admit they're doing the giant global program North America is
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:07.520]  their main battleground but they won't give us the details of what it is so
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.120]  people say man there's weird weather yeah how do the there is weird weather how
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:16.920]  do we know they're not false flagging us to then sell all this but I totally
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:23.560]  agree with you yeah organic farming is huge out in California and it's supposed
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.320]  to be on the rise this year but with all this drought it's I mean food prices are
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:31.720]  going to skyrocket and organic farms are probably going to happen to sell out
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.760]  to Monsanto and people like George Soros be able to get out of there they may
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.840]  even be forced to leave you know they don't have water to well they've caught
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.320]  the IMF World Bank they've met a James Bond movie not the last one with the one
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.800]  before last where the big bank shuts off the water from the mountains so they
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:53.640]  can buy up the country that was actually a true story yeah yeah that was where
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.120]  quantum of solace yes that's actually based on true story but the whole point
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:02.800]  is is that yes no no they're messing with everything they're playing God and
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:07.320]  until we admit that's going on we have no chance in facing it we have to admit
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.400]  we're in a manipulated paradigm a matrix like paradigm to be able to change it
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.360]  thank you Timothy Kevin in West Virginia thanks for calling in you're on the
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:19.280]  year worldwide are you Mr. Jones in Bizarro world today I'm doing pretty good
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:25.320]  brother talking to you cool well I have a couple I wanted to say that I totally
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:30.720]  agree with Obama being a dictator and the whole Obama administration needs to
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.840]  come down and the Tea Party needs to be put in there and we need to have people
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.680]  like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson you know back in place you
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.080]  know we need our country back I feel I'm 29 years old and I want to have the same
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.800]  rights you know and to grow up and to have the same things that our forefathers
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:50:00.920]  had and there's another issue I have too with with welfare I don't know if you
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.880]  be able to answer this or not I'm one welfare I'm blind and I don't have any
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.400]  problem with you being on welfare it should be locally covered by the state
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.400]  the city or the churches and again people that actually disabled that's
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.880]  that's what it's for and in quite frankly if somebody was on welfare and
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.480]  didn't vote take my guns and they couldn't get a job I'd be fine it's it's
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:27.520]  you're gonna be on welfare come here be made legal and then vote to make me your
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:34.280]  slave no no no no that's the issue they've shut the jobs down they've
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.640]  shipped them overseas they're disabling people with all the soft kill we've got
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:42.760]  the highest cancer rate in the world I don't I don't bemoan people that are on
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:48.840]  welfare by hazard but by being thrown on to it I don't like JPMorgan Chase
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:53.160]  publicly running the welfare system nationwide and trying to get people on
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.480]  to it to bankrupt things while they try to get rid of the economy to make
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:59.720]  everybody poor so they can domesticate everyone I'm gonna come back to you stay

[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:12.680]  back to Kevin in West Virginia you're on the air Kevin welcome hello again mr.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:18.960]  Alex as I was talking I'm blind and they give me $700 a month the web one
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:25.520]  which is total bull crap and what I like is how other people you know they do
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.960]  don't need it you know suck off the system and and and then they they vote
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:35.120]  to take your guns and to enslave us I think it's wrong and I have this
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.560]  fighting spirit and with the only $700 that I have I can't I want to fund the
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:43.800]  operation no people that don't have money of no responsibility spread the word
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.760]  about the show listen to this for a minute
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.680]  50 years ago a hundred years ago you'd have a more diverse larger family and
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:56.200]  they would take care of you and you'd have jobs you could do like watching the
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.000]  house when they were going and and raising the alarm if there was any
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.360]  issue and if you didn't have family a local church would have you live in the
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.360]  church and you would basically just be somebody that kept no pun intended an eye
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.320]  on things and you would just be there somebody to you know kind of you know
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.720]  help out with stuff that's how society works instead the government comes in
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:25.440]  with charity and so now there's no reason for anybody else to be involved in it
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.800]  and I know it's very frustrating have you ever gone to a school for the blind
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:33.680]  or because they have a lot of industries for you have tried but I keep
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:39.920]  screwing up myself I keep I keep you know wanting to I'm my own worst enemy I
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:45.320]  you know the zero drug tolerance not smoke pot and I feel sorry for myself and
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.640]  so I smoke because I went down well I mean I mean listen here's the deal it's
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:54.760]  coming out that people are smoking pot and it's not as bad as alcohol I don't
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  smoke it and I just think it's discriminatory and I and I do think that
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.280]  that you know that's really prohibitive first they ship the drugs in to begin
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.480]  with but I get some places not want to be around potheds because some people
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:11.200]  really abuse it but I know it must be hard live on 700 bucks a month you know
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.240]  I would I would try to kick it go through the system and I would try to
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:24.080]  become more entrepreneurial and you know I would use the fact that you're
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.600]  visually impaired as they say to do you know try to learn how to do it and
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:34.120]  develop it and you know get a food cart or something and you know make it make
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:39.200]  a not a joke out of it but make make that the issue of hey you know come
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.800]  over thanks for your you know what these are really good hot dogs I know they
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.680]  taste good I get the best ingredients but make sure I'm making this right is
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.120]  that good everybody would come to you instinctively just like in the old
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:53.440]  ancient village if somebody was blind they would take you with them fishing
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:57.360]  and then you would help them out with stuff and then you would be impaired in
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.200]  that one area but the instinctively ancient cultures knew that someone
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:05.080]  impaired in one area would generally be more advanced than another like in an
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.280]  ancient culture someone who was blind would end up developing other senses and
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.120]  then you would end up being like a shaman or a witch doctor but we just don't
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.520]  have things figured out nowadays is the larger problem but listen I really
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:21.080]  appreciate your call brother but nobody's judging you for being on quote
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:28.680]  welfare $700 a month in this inflationary situation you imagine plus they
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:32.520]  got us all focused on people like that on welfare as we go bankrupt instead of
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.520]  the big mega banks they're getting a majority of the money who lobby to get
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:39.920]  more people on welfare out of the system dependent

[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:34.000]  fellow swath was coming up in the next segment to break down the facts on our
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.880]  opinion about the national suicide it's already suicide anyways if we take on
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:44.240]  another 30 million illegal aliens give them all welfare and then that just
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.800]  lets the next group come in who then almost you universally vote for the
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.320]  Democratic Party and all of their kleptocratic activities I mean it's
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.360]  just just unbelievable we are not a democracy we are a republic you 51% can't
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:04.080]  vote to make me a slave but they're operating like that now I saw a time
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:10.720]  magazine cover the other day that had the capital on it and it said majority rule
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.680]  and was x'd out and was saying the majority in a fake poll want to ban
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:19.360]  guns but we can't do it the majority when Obamacare was an old magazine but we
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.720]  can't do it the majority when I had their heads chopped off we can't do it
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.000]  there's a new article out at info wars.com polls 71% wish they'd not voted
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.720]  for Obama even 55% of Democrats say they regret re-electing the president too
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:40.520]  late suckers and it doesn't mean Romney would have been even better the fix was
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.880]  in that's the point Matt Drudge tweets report warning about suicide of the GOP
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:57.320]  and then that's got Shaftley's report reposted in it so be sure and get that
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:05.520]  out to everybody you know right now let's go to another phone call Andrea in
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:10.480]  Michigan you're on the air thank you for calling hey Alex how you doing I'm
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:16.440]  doing great talking to you hey I'm calling about something that I heard
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:20.760]  another caller say earlier so woke up this morning and I was just really
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.400]  thinking you know how for the last few months you've been feeling in your gut
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:30.000]  that there's a false flag and coming up and I just was thinking I thought a
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:37.120]  really cool on YouTube a geoengineering scientist has got a video out and I
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.760]  really think that that might be what they're up to in California because it
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.600]  just there's not enough evidence and they're getting smarter because too many
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.280]  people out there are kind of pointing out their false flags and it just seems
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:55.040]  like that's something that maybe you can blow the lid off of you know well sure
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:58.000]  here's the problem and I'm not criticizing anybody everybody uses the
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.280]  layman provincial term chemtrails we started hearing about in the early 90s
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:08.600]  and there's a patent and the guy wanting 92 when I forget the scientist name a UN
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.840]  science prize for developing quote sunscreen for the earth kids textbooks
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.400]  teach that they're already spraying it to save us from global warming but the
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:20.760]  tales are all classified it's added to jet fuel under four patents so the pilots
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.920]  don't even know what's going on it's aerosolized barium salts limit oxide
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.760]  others there's a five billion dollar a year energy department of energy program
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:33.120]  and they do seem to be concentrating out on the west coast with all that
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.000]  moisture coming in manipulating and stopping it and they've got aircraft out
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.760]  there spraying and we know what's going on and they've had even people from the
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:46.480]  California Department of Environment you know go out there and go yeah we're
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:50.240]  getting like 20 times the aluminum we're getting them barium salts the trees are
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.080]  dying so I don't know what's going on because the program's secret but it's
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:01.880]  bad and it's weather modification you name it and I mean the globalist will
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:07.320]  pay to ship General Motors to China will pay to ship Jeep to Italy they'll
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:13.800]  they'll they'll they'll pay to shut down your local power plant I mean they are
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:19.880]  shutting America down except for select globalist who were exempt and it's
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.200]  just a serious situation I hear you so we do need to look at the California
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:27.880]  drought is it a chem drill operation and look at the geoengineering program and
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:33.360]  admit it's going on and show that it manipulates weather and and do a report
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.880]  for the nightly news or something on that I agree with you I appreciate your

[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:35.920]  probably six or seven times we appreciate her coming back on today with
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.880]  one of the most serious issues for this republic and quite frankly the future of
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:45.120]  the world itself and she of course is a best-selling author and she became the
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.880]  leader of the conservative movement with a publication of her best-selling book
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.360]  in 64 a choice not an echo and I'm not going to go over all the things she's
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.760]  done in her 47 year this is an old bio battle it's more than that now and she
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:02.240]  has testified before more than 50 congressional state legislative
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:08.040]  committees she was appointed by president Reagan for member of the
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:14.120]  bicentennial Commission and she promotes all things Americana and they've gone
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.480]  out and index the poll numbers and showed what I what I and many of you
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.760]  already knew but it's good to document it but the vast majority between 75 and
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:28.240]  90% depending on the poll of illegals and even immigrants period tend to vote
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:33.040]  democratic anti-gun anti-family you name it and even though it's not in their
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.120]  interest they they they want to be playing and they just vote straight
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.080]  ticket and I've got big criticisms of the republican leadership they've been
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:46.640]  supporting this amnesty with the republican the big donors because
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.360]  they're part of this globalist agenda but all over the world they've gotten rid
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:54.040]  of borders partially and they've just Europe's going bankrupt they use the
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:58.080]  immigrant populations to become the new bureaucratic enforcement arm I've had
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:01.960]  members of the EU parliament on members of the UK parliament even liberal
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.640]  members on talking about this situation and if you can get a group to come in
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:13.400]  who can then vote to get welfare in exchange for voting for parties that
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:17.520]  will take guns and it will take liberty and take sovereignty you have been
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:22.680]  conquered you have been conquered demographically I'll be honest if we
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:27.720]  had 30 no any legals here and they were green-skinned not predominantly in a
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.560]  light brown skin from Latin America and they were voting for the Second
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.200]  Amendment national sovereignty freedom worn on welfare it's a lot of people
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.320]  but we've aborted 50 plus million Americans maybe we need them since Roe v.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.600]  Wade the problem is the ideology is pure poison and if you haven't traveled
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:48.960]  Latin America I suggest you go travel it it's a nightmare I'd love to export
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.200]  freedom down there instead we're exporting the poverty the crime up here in
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.560]  Mexico's a fell state and this idea that we're somehow hateful and criminal we
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.320]  already have the most open policies in the world if we don't just throw our
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.760]  doors up and say have your babies here free all the welfare we won't wear
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.400]  American flags at school we'll take down American flags we won't dress as cowboys
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:18.000]  or natives at you know college parties on Halloween it's a joke oh you
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.600]  criticize Obama it's cuz you're racist no it's cuz Obama cares a scam so I
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.040]  want to give fellow Shafley the the the floor here I've said my piece to break
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:30.000]  down her tip of the spear coverage that's been on drugs report calm on the
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.960]  fellas Shafley report at Eagle forum dot org you can also go to fellas
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.000]  shafley dot com and she joins us right now to break this down because Obama is
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.840]  already I want to cover what's going to happen if they do this but then Obama's
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.560]  already legalizing mostly illegals by fiat so the Republican leadership a is
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.000]  being beaten on getting amnesty because it is suicide for the country but B they
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.440]  have to be beaten on letting Obama act as an executive dictator doesn't mean
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  he's a dictator fully the office is becoming a tutorial so Mrs. fellow
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.880]  Shafley thank you so much for coming on you've got the floor give us this
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:13.000]  report worldwide that people are tuning into here right now well hi Alex I'm
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:18.520]  happy to join you and you laid it out very well these people who want to bring
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.880]  in millions of people they're going to vote Democratic and that we know this
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:29.080]  not because it's my opinion or because I've talked to them it's because all of
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.840]  these recognized pollsters have reached a consensus on this and there's no
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.520]  dispute in it these these pollsters all say that the ones coming in the big
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.720]  majority of them are people who believe in big government offering more
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:50.640]  services than limited government balance budgets and that sort of thing and you
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.320]  know the conservative movement and the Republican Party are built on restraint
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:02.160]  in government limited government and the millions of new people are bringing in
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.000]  are not bad at all they have no experience with it they don't think they
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.200]  like it they're glad to come here and accept the welfare of goodies that
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:16.280]  government hands out and you've got seven plus billion people that would like
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:20.720]  to come here and under globalism there's no sovereignty no borders that
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.840]  sounds like they want to make us the new Calcutta well I think it was around
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:30.960]  Reagan who said country without without borders is not a country you've got to
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:36.000]  have borders and we expect people to respect them and if people want to come
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.760]  to this country they ought to obey our laws and these pollsters for example they
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:46.680]  they've taken a poll on whether you whether you want the children the
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:51.760]  public schools to be taught that America is a great country and of course the
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:57.960]  big majority of Americans don't think that but the the recent immigrants even
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:04.280]  if they're naturalized not even the majority believe that and they ask
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:11.680]  them are you for Obamacare well yes they are majority for Obamacare and it's no
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.760]  wonder why is anybody surprised that they vote for the Democrats that that's
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:22.200]  the way it is you know I know a lot of Democrats and finally some of them are
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.760]  waking up that Obamacare was a premeditated fraud in a scam to select
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:32.280]  interest a literal looting but so many Democrats should say I don't care we're
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.720]  gonna wreck the whole system and then I'm gonna get something free I mean I
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:38.960]  mean if they don't even care if they're getting screwed over as long as they
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:42.280]  feel like they're part of some winning team I mean I've got to say it
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.320]  Democrats on MSNBC live talk about how smart they are all day I don't know if
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.960]  you've seen Mark Dyson's videos where he goes out and talks to Democrats in
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.040]  California and they say the most authoritarian things they don't know
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:57.920]  that the earth orbits the Sun the average Democrat has got to be the
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:03.600]  stupidest person on the planet well maybe they think they're smart because
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:11.960]  they've learned how to get free money and the these polls are really very very
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:19.120]  revealing and they these people who are coming in our people have no experience
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.360]  with our type of government you've heard people say that we are a exceptional
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:29.040]  country that word isn't even strong enough America is unique there's no
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:33.840]  other country that is built on the idea of limited government as Thomas
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:37.000]  Jefferson said buying them down from mischief with the chains of the
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:41.920]  Constitution and we think they ought to keep their spending down and keep taxes
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:46.520]  low and so forth and other countries don't don't even understand that they
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:51.960]  they depend on the government for practically to walk across the street
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:56.640]  whether they can or not and they don't know what we're talking about but we
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:02.600]  say we want a smaller government doing less and so we can bring in the people
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:07.480]  who want the government running thing you said what the government doing hand
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:13.360]  out you're going to get more democratic votes why are you surprised well you're
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:19.800]  certainly right and America was hyper unique hyper exceptional by every
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.720]  metric of inventions trailblazing military activity just on every front
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:31.000]  literature art we have been the flower of the Renaissance in the last 230 plus
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.680]  years and now we see all the prosperity going out the window as we follow the
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:42.840]  globalist collectivist program that always creates rack and ruin well all
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.240]  of these trade agreements which are presented in the name of globalism and
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:52.400]  getting along in the world and free trade and all those slogans they create
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:57.280]  jobs and investment in other countries they don't treat them in this country
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:03.920]  we lose jobs and and it's a it's a real betrayal this is why the middle class
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:13.080]  has been shrinking every year under the Obama administration and so it is just
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:18.240]  this new report that I have out it's a 48 a 40-page report is available on my
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:24.120]  website you know Eagle form dot org and just to give you another example one
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:30.200]  poll found that 81% of native-born Americans believe our schools should
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:36.880]  teach that students should be proud to be America but only 50% only half of the
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.360]  immigrants even after their naturalized believe that and you know these
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:48.560]  these amnesty advocates like to compare our current immigration with what we were
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:54.040]  bringing in around 1920 and the people who came in from Western Europe in 1920
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:18:00.920]  all wanted to be real Americans I have any number of friends who told me when
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:05.720]  they came as a teenager and landed at Ellis Island in New York their mother
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:10.040]  or father would say now we're in America and we're gonna be Americans and we're
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.280]  gonna speak English and this is our country now and that's not the way they
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.080]  feel about it today the ones who are coming in seem to maintain their
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:24.440]  allegiance to their own their own their own country and when you take the oath
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:28.760]  of citizenship you're supposed to renounce all allegiance to any king
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:32.880]  potentate foreign government of any kind and I don't know whether they
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.080]  recite all that but it's obvious they don't believe it because the polls all
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:44.680]  show that they're not proud to be an American and they really don't believe
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:50.760]  in the type of government of limited government that made our country the
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.200]  most prosperous and the freest country on the face of the earth that's right you
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:00.960]  can't argue with the cold hard scientific sociological geopolitical facts I

[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:22.120]  mother who had I think it's six children and she's had a whole bunch of best
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:25.760]  selling books we're gonna talk about her newest bestseller where Obama is
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.840]  waging war on the First Amendment and not just the others our religious freedom
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:32.480]  is within the First Amendment we're gonna talk to her about that in the next
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:36.240]  segment in the short one though fellas please because you're pausing and
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:39.680]  letting me jump in I want you to roll here because you've got all the deep
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.280]  data and the research break down what it means if they get this next crop of
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:48.240]  illegals legalized obviously then the next group the next we're in total
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:53.000]  checkmate politically because because these folks are voting in a
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:57.680]  collectivist manner and I've tried to reach out to the quote immigrant
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.720]  population with some success but we just can't reach enough of them a is there
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:04.640]  any way to turn this around be how do we beat it and what's going on in
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.600]  Washington
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:24.600]  we're going to talk radio because the mainstream media is concealing the whole thing and they're two powerful lobbying groups that are pushing for more more illegal and legal immigration and they are the big business crowd who want cheap labor and then of course the
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:35.440]  Democrats who want to vote and my report which is now available on evil form dot org it's 40 pages is a lot of statistical stuff if you want
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:41.080]  the abbreviated every man's version you can ask for my fellow Shlafly report
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:46.160]  called does the Republican Party have a future but at any event what these polls
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:52.600]  consistently show is a three-fourth of the Hispanics coming in want a bigger
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:57.840]  government providing more services I'm talking about services like healthcare
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:04.000]  Obamacare and only a tiny percentage even understand or want a smaller
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  government and you know that if the if we want to leave a country of freedom and
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.320]  prosperity to our children and grandchildren we've got to cut down the
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.600]  size of government stop these executive actions that Obama is taking on his own
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.080]  which he is you doing unilaterally and says he can do whatever he wants with
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:31.080]  his pen and you have to realize that these people coming in the overwhelming
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.880]  majority of them want the government providing big services and which is
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:43.160]  course very costly in every way expanding on that look at what a
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:49.120]  monumental fraud and a deception Obamacare is everything that's being pushed
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.880]  is really bad for the overall population bad for common sense bad for
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:27:00.120]  fairness but still people that are part of the Democratic Party cult just don't
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.360]  care that they just think they've won and then you've got the people like
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.720]  Boehner and others that are bought off by the same interest I mean what do we do
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:13.520]  about this well the facts are so overwhelming for example the congressional
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.440]  budget office which certainly is not a right-wing source said that Obamacare is
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:26.640]  gonna cost us over two million jobs and mostly by the companies reducing the
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:31.240]  number of hours that their employees can work and the Obama administration
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:35.840]  tried to put a happy face on this by saying oh that's great people have more
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.120]  free time they'll be able to do more fun things that they want to do when
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.120]  they're not working well that's not the way you get ahead and that's not the way
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:50.040]  you support your family well we believe in in work and full-time work and we
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.800]  hope guys will have a good job full-time it's gonna be able to support his
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:59.520]  family but that isn't what Obama wants he wants to cut the amount of work people
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:03.920]  are doing so they're working less hours getting less money and then they're have
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:11.800]  their insurance paid for by the taxpayer it's also rotten Alex I and
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:18.240]  in the high-handed dictatorial way that Obama is doing it is amazing but these
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:24.480]  polls are very compelling in showing what the people think about this and
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.080]  they're not voting for amnesty they're voting for handouts by the government
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:36.240]  and they get that by voting democratic and then they'll support literally
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:41.520]  making those of us that produce their slaves and then George Soros and Warren
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:47.240]  Buffett big and constituents of the Democrats and big
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:52.920]  recipients of corporate welfare and they and then they write the laws to be
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.920]  exempt from the taxes their lobbying to raise taxes on the middle class this
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.760]  takes us back to a democracy where two wolves can vote to eat the sheet for
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:13.160]  dinner yeah yeah it's a joke but we're so really tragic the way they the way
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.400]  are manipulating the people and making them think that the government is the
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:23.640]  source of goodness and money and the number of people who are now on food
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:29.960]  stamps the number of people who get housing supplements the EITC the earned

[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:02.000]  wars life dot com
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:20.120]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:24.320]  oh they doled up obama care they said there weren't any death panels that
[02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:29.000]  didn't ration care didn't kick pre-existing condition folks off you
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.880]  could keep your doctor firm pledge it would lower your premium to the cost of
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:40.000]  a phone bill or cable bill I don't know maybe for a whole hotel and mine has
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.760]  doubled in the last since it went in six months ago her owner of era was on the
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:48.080]  show a few months ago his has tripled and for that of all of his six employees
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:56.080]  tripled and my dad's is more than doubled and everyone I know it's at least
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:03.320]  double because some some it's only gone up 45 50 60% but most people it's more
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:07.320]  than double so if you average it it's about a doubling to be technical and
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:10.800]  that's just year one I mean this is just gonna get better and better and the
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.360]  reason I raised that is they said hey if you don't like Obamacare you're
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:20.760]  racist on MSNBC and CNN and there are no death panels and none of this is true
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:27.080]  we we had the bill and now Obama acts as a dictator implementing what he wants
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:31.960]  where he wants all unions you're exempt but not families that's the ultimate
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:36.080]  form of discrimination while they're talking about discrimination we don't
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:39.800]  like it because he's black let me tell you I'd vote for a black man about half
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:46.120]  a second if he was like Ron Paul I could care without love it it'd be even
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.360]  better because then they couldn't attack him as much but that but they would
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:52.920]  though they it wouldn't work if they were libertarian or conservative it is so
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:58.040]  disgusting when Obama said two weeks ago in a time magazine interview and was
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.360]  living in the New Yorker similar things that well my poll numbers are down
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:08.040]  because of racism what what and I'm ranting we got full of shaffley with us
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:12.800]  of Eagle forum dot org and a miss a shaffley is like one of the icons of
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:16.520]  true conservatism in this country best-selling author constitutional
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.800]  lawyer getting into amnesty how do we beat it where is it but then we go to
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:25.480]  the next problem as you know you're best-selling books out about it doesn't
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:29.240]  matter Obama is just legalizing a bunch of the illegals ordering the courts to
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:34.240]  let people go and in the amnesty courts he's just doing it by executive fiat to
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:39.200]  begin with so where's the republican leadership beginning impeachment of the
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.440]  president turning the office into a dictatorship well I hope you saw him on
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.080]  your dear television screen what he said he had a pan has a pen and he can do
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:55.960]  whatever he wants to do and a telephone and it is and it was so arrogant it was
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.320]  so condescending to americans it was embarrassing if we think we're self
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:05.920]  governing people and he has changed his own law obonacare I think personally
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:12.560]  unilaterally about 30 times and it and he just wants to do whatever he wants to
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.880]  get the democrats reelected and I think the only way we can save our country is
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:25.080]  to elect a majority of conservatives to the US Senate in November and get the
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:31.680]  right guys dominated in the primary and it it is so important because for
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:35.960]  example if Obama gets another appointment to the Supreme Court he would
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:41.440]  rule the country with his bloody ideas for the next 50 years and we cannot
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.640]  afford that we need to have enough senators to stand up and say we're not
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:49.360]  going to give you many more judges because some of these I call them
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:58.120]  supremacist judges are as bad as Obama in trying to remake the law and dictate
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.960]  to the American people you you've been fighting this journey for 60 plus years
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.880]  as a constitutional lawyer but I've studied political elites I've studied
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:12.600]  history even if you were a corrupt elite America and prosperity is
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:18.600]  incredibly profitable you would rather skim off the top of that big large yes
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:23.640]  then destroy it and debase it all so you can run it but tyrants always
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:28.200]  debilitate everything because they hate individual freedom and they
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:32.200]  jealously want to shut it down thus destroying the engine of their own
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:37.520]  success but I want to warn the political elite including the democrats you are
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:41.960]  literally burning down your own house you guys run the country now and you have
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:48.800]  such a long-term hatred of men and of families and of women and of prosperity
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:53.720]  and of just uprightness and I've really studied these people and now I've come
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:58.480]  around with understanding that they really do want to screw stuff up they
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:02.680]  really are like Michael Savage said I think mentally ill if you disagree with
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:05.760]  that tell me fellas but I mean you've been fighting these people for a long
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:12.240]  time what is wrong with them well they want power and they think the way they
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:18.480]  would get power is to make the America American workforce be in competition
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.960]  with the people in the rest of the world you know a lot of our products are
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:28.560]  starting to come from Vietnam where they work for 28 cents an hour and I do not
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:32.440]  think Americans should have to be in competition with people like that we have
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:38.400]  clearly a better system a unique system a prosperous system a successful system
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.680]  that's why everybody wants to come here and we should let in only people who
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.760]  like our country obey our laws like Switzerland I mean I mean you could have
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.120]  ten million dollars they won't let you in unless you have a skill you're
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.040]  bringing Switzerland their money only goes up in value their crime only goes
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.440]  down they get better and better and better why don't we do what Switzerland
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:05.240]  did that's right and they just voted down this increased immigration and that's
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:09.600]  why they've been able to keep me a free and prosperous country and we should do
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:15.960]  the same but the trouble is the the media is so so much in favor of Obama no
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:22.160]  matter what he did they they try to ruin anybody who criticizes him but
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:27.520]  Americans have got to speak up we have a great country we need to not let
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.880]  anybody in except somebody who wants to honor our country our flag our
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:37.120]  Constitution and we don't and you know the polls are showing now like that the
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:40.960]  majority of these people coming in think international law should top our
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:46.200]  Constitution you gotta be kidding we're not you and I are not going to let
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.320]  international law trump our Constitution that's right and you have all the
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:57.400]  polls listed there from the Pew Research you name it there's a whole yes
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.240]  all the ones that everybody else quotes only they don't seem to quote the part
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:07.360]  about what they believe on amnesty but all the polls are consistent in saying
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:12.560]  that the overwhelming majority of people coming in want bigger government
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.840]  handing out more services it's basically like a beautiful ship that's not
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:21.040]  perfect but it's the best out there and you've always envied it and you finally
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.720]  get on board and the Democrats hand you a dynamite to put in the bottom of the
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:29.440]  ship to sink it and then you dynamite the ship and you're sinking you're like
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.760]  I won I brought down America instead of just joining with America there is a
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.200]  real hatred of this country and I'm sick of it there is a hatred of this country
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:48.120]  and there's a hatred of the institution of marriage to which I hope I have a
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:51.840]  new book out on yeah let's segue into that let's segue to the attack on
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:58.200]  religion the attack on marriage no higher power
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.960]  Obama's war on religious freedom and you can see that everywhere the people who
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.280]  want to be politically correct even the military has done some things like
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:12.600]  clamping down on on players and the oath to serve God and country so help me God
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:19.000]  and the superintendents of the of the public schools are going after little
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.560]  kids won't let them mention Jesus there sing a Christmas carol or bring a
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:26.120]  Christmas card even though everybody else is allowed to do whatever they want
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:32.920]  yeah and it's a real war on the First Amendment Obama's idea about the First
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.360]  Amendment is you should have the right to go into your church and lock the door
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:42.280]  and say a prayer where nobody can hear you and that'll be okay if I'm gonna take
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:47.080]  that away from by the way for those that don't know the First Amendment says
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.760]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:54.280]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof it means you don't have a state-run
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:59.120]  religion but you could absolutely come to school and you can hand out
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.560]  Christmas cards you can hand out Muslim material during the lunch break you
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:08.440]  can hand out atheist material as a valid Victorian you can give whatever
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:12.400]  speech you want and thank God as a football player you can and they know
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.440]  that and they are persecuting people where they find Bibles in people's bags in
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:23.320]  in public school in Texas and quote throw them in the trash and suspend them
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.800]  this is outrageous authoritarianism and of course the founding fathers and all
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:34.840]  presidents prior to Obama were quoting their faith and their belief in God all
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:40.320]  the time honoring the National Day of Prayer for example when Obama gives a
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:43.880]  Thanksgiving Day address he makes a whole long list of people to thank but
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:49.800]  God didn't make the cut and he's just trying to eliminate any public mention
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:55.680]  of God and our country is built on people believing in God and being religious
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:00.160]  people and people of faith why is it that the collectivist and Soviet types
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.000]  hate God is it because they obviously the state is God and they don't want any
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.520]  higher power above them yeah that's right they want the state to be in control
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:17.080]  of everything and we don't and that we've got a proven best country and that's
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:22.840]  why people want to come here and and it's it's the most freedom it's the most
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.080]  prosperity and Obama has this nutty idea that it really isn't fair that the
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:35.760]  United States has so much good things of life and and more prosperity than any
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:39.360]  other country and more power than other countries and he wants to make everybody
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:43.720]  equal and we don't want to be equal to all the poor countries and we don't want
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:49.120]  our guys to have to compete with people making the products in Vietnam who work
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.920]  for 28 cents an hour well it's not fair trade when we have all the regulations
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:56.240]  in bureaucracy and shutting down our power plants and they go to Vietnam with
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:00.440]  no regulations dubbing the toxic waste right in the river and this is all about
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.840]  clout and pivot making us dependent in closing spend a few minutes on the
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:09.720]  attack on the family it's so naked now the attack on women the attack on
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:14.840]  manhood I mean the MSNBC I'm sure you've seen their promo where they say your
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:19.640]  kids now belong to the state I mean these people are really being naked about
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:26.120]  them their takeover why do you think that is well they're feeling that they won and
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:32.160]  they want to want to do socket to it and the only way we can remain a free
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:37.760]  country is if parents are controlled their children not the government and if
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:44.880]  we were able to elect a congressman and representative who believes in limited
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.160]  government lower taxes and letting people spend their own money and so the
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:54.600]  government spending it and these are the issues that are so important in the
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:00.040]  upcoming elections this year and I urge everybody to go into the
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:05.880]  primary where you know I hear people say in November well I don't like to have a
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:09.600]  guy on either party well that's your fault that you weren't in there in the
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:13.400]  primary is getting the right guy on the ballot because he's not going to get
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:16.840]  elected unless he's on the ballot well it's definitely a lesser two evils and
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:20.360]  I've never even been of that view but the Democrats are going for total broke
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:23.320]  the Republican leadership is trying to kill the Tea Party we've got to get
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.400]  behind the Tea Party which you're a proto founder of across the board but I
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:32.320]  think about my grandmothers and how they interact with my grandfathers three of
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:36.200]  my grandparents are gone one of them still here that they weren't subservient
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:41.240]  women but they were on a team in that family and that family came first and
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:46.000]  they were powerful effective smart women that you know would read to me for
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.840]  hours in the summer when I was visiting them and who were super smart and had
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:54.320]  you know multiple degrees yeah yeah they could read and and they and they
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:46:00.160]  wanted a strong family and I remember my grandmother my you know reading me the
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.840]  the you know when Ulysses comes home and everything and his house has been
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:08.000]  taken over kind of an example of what's happened to America they were just such
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.320]  strong powerful women compared to what women are today and they call this
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:17.520]  modern thing a feminist and it's the complete opposite of an empowered woman
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:20.960]  you know notice the feminists they don't don't let women own guns I mean it's
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:24.920]  just so insane to see how they are destroying men they're destroying women
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.800]  all the things they're getting away with it it's so disgusting to see women
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:35.680]  becoming married to the state basically that's right that's what you you don't
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:40.320]  set up the family a traditional man and woman where the man is a provider and
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:45.680]  protector and then all these babies appear if you look to big brother
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.040]  government to support you and that's not the kind of country we want well you're
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:53.680]  supposed to put the load on the men so they compete and make a stronger society
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:58.480]  not not say men or nobodies they're idiots women you're in charge with the
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:01.880]  state and of course everything falls apart I mean look at illegitimacy in the
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:07.360]  black community less than 10% before the great society in the 60s these are
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:12.880]  mainline numbers now upwards of 90% and that same systems being deployed it is a
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:17.400]  system wrecking program we're gonna plug the website one more time but I want to
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:22.560]  play you the clip since you mentioned it here is Obama saying I've got a phone
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:27.720]  I've got a pen we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:33.400]  make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of health that they need I've
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:39.400]  got a pen and I've got a phone and I can use that pen to sign executive orders
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:43.520]  and take executive actions and make creative actions that move the ball
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.240]  forward and then since we were mentioning MSNBC and promo saying your kids
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:54.360]  belong to him here's Melissa Harris Perry going from memory on her name on
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:57.280]  there saying you know we need to get over this idea that your kids belong to you
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.800]  they belong to the collective a bunch of control freaks and again at the level
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:07.720]  of MSNBC hosts they are known technocrats with a scientific sociological
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.000]  takedown program I've read their textbooks these are cold-blooded culture
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.040]  killers let's play that clip and then get Phyllis Shafley's take on it so part
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:19.480]  of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:22.720]  their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:26.640]  to whole communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:30.160]  households then we start making better investments and once they get you into
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:33.520]  government health care they're going to run your life because well we're all
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:38.320]  having to pay for health care Phyllis you let Obama appoint any more judges you
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.040]  know the Ninth Circuit said that parents' rights to control their own
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:47.440]  children stops at the threshold of the school door and the schools take over
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:53.240]  and we cannot allow that to happen it's unbelievable every nightmare visited
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:58.680]  upon the Soviet Union and other collectivist hellholes is now manifesting
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:03.960]  in closing and I appreciate you coming on what is your gut level about this
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:07.840]  battle how bad's it going to get I mean I know we're going to win in the end but
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.440]  how hellish is this going to get well I think the elections this year are
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:16.840]  absolutely crucial they may be the most important elections of our time and I
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:22.040]  urge everybody to go into especially the Republican primaries and make sure you
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:26.280]  get good guys on the ballot so that's when they we come to November you've
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:29.960]  got a good guy to vote for you're not standing around saying I don't like either

[03:00:33.880 --> 03:00:38.640]  Deliver actually out on a military installation I find it funny we've got
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:42.520]  all these crazy things going on in the world all the time but all that takes
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:46.440]  to get in without your proper identification the military base is a
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:51.560]  pizza bag they don't do as much security as they should considering all the
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:56.600]  things they say we got to worry about. Yeah most of it staged. Oh absolutely we
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:01:02.600]  are out here I've felt driven actually up in North upstate New York they pull
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:06.520]  you I got pulled over once going through the gate they open your vehicle up for
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:11.400]  their unconstitutional inspections and all they saw is a pizza bag okay you're
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:15.240]  good to go so if they don't want to do anything all the takes of the pizza bag
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:18.120]  you don't need big weapons you don't you don't need much to get on and do what
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:24.600]  you got to do. Well again I don't even say it's unconstitutional when they
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:28.200]  search you going on a base that's a military reservation but they're now
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:34.520]  exporting that onto the streets which is unconstitutional and it is all total
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:38.920]  theater even if terrorism was real honeybees kill more people every year in
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:44.000]  North America than terrorism does and so why are you fear mongering you know
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.800]  school shootings deer kill more people we have TSA on the highway to stop deer
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.040]  jumping out in front it's it's a power grab period anyway slice at great
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:59.240]  points Andrew Nico in Illinois you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how you doing
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:04.080]  good I see the topic you called in go ahead and ask your question. Yes sir
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:08.120]  Mr. John B. Wells got kicked off the coast to coast and I did a little bit of
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.960]  research not much and that's why I hope you guys can do some research I want to
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.440]  be really fast here you know I think you got kicked off because premier radio
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:20.360]  network is a big supporter of the Bush family or whatever and because he was
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:23.560]  too popular and too truthful so just looking at that and I appreciate that
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:27.840]  so much and the other thing is I called in a month ago doing a hang kill
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:31.480]  impersonation and you were like oh that sort of sound like hang kill and let me
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:35.200]  tell you sir I do voice impersonations and if you could give me like 10 seconds
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:39.040]  here I want to do an impersonation of you from the best sound bite this century
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:45.040]  that I've heard on TV and I don't watch TV. Go ahead go ahead and do it. All right here we go.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:50.240]  1776 will come up again if you try to take our firearms. Doesn't matter how many
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:53.800]  linings you got they're better than falling out of guns taken we will not
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:58.480]  like we'll send you a family. I bet I can do a better one because it's me but hey
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:01.200]  listen great job I appreciate your call listen I'm not getting in the middle of
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:06.160]  this John B. Wells George Norring coast-to-coast AM deal I really like John
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:08.960]  B. Wells I think he's a very smart talented guy and I consider him a friend
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:14.480]  I've hung out with him a few times and I really consider George Norring all
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:18.040]  them friends and I know George likes him. George had nothing to do with it the
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.640]  coast-to-coast people didn't have anything to do with it. He started his own
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:26.180]  private show separate from theirs and there wasn't even a discussion and I
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:29.200]  might get in the middle of it but it's not for what he said from when I know I
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:32.680]  haven't called John I've been sick and had family stuff going on I need to call
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:35.440]  John about that and we tend to keep having him on the show give me having
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:38.680]  George on the show so it's just fine with us you know it's not my business I
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:43.800]  just stay out of the infighting stuff completely and coast-to-coast has never
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:48.280]  since heard anything I've said or done so there you go that's what's happening
[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:53.760]  with that last call I'm sorry to Scott and Fred William in North Carolina go
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:04:01.360]  ahead hi Alex how you doing good brother I'm calling about the solution that
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:06.160]  you've been begging for somebody to call in and tell you tell me now the last
[03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:16.440]  several years it's a due process mandate of the grand juries the grand
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:23.200]  juries have had the ability to neutralize democracy with respect to
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:29.680]  constitutional acts we don't have a conversation going on in this country on
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:34.480]  that subject no I agree juries are supposed to nullify democracy activity
[03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:40.840]  yes juries are supposed to decide guilt or innocent no I know but I mean juries
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:46.360]  can also vote on unconstitutional laws absolutely you mean a grand jury a
[03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:51.760]  people's grand jury can can manage government where we haven't had managed
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:55.760]  and I'm saying jury nullification works in juries as well I hear you call me
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:58.240]  back again another day we'll talk more about it that is a big part of the
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:01.480]  solution I agree with it
