[00:00.000 --> 00:27.120]  of the new world order. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27.120 --> 00:40.400]  We really are approaching total information overload. Last night, at about 9.30, I was
[00:40.400 --> 00:46.720]  crawling into bed with my wife early. My children had gone to sleep. All four of them
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.400]  tucked into their beds. And I get an Amber Alert, but it's an awesome Police Department
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.280]  Alert. Never gotten one of those. And it's stay indoors. Police personnel are in your
[00:58.280 --> 01:06.240]  area. Very dangerous situation. Stay indoors. So I go and I look out the front window. Streets
[01:06.240 --> 01:12.880]  are dark. Nothing's going on. No cars are going by. So I go to the computer, punch it
[01:12.880 --> 01:19.200]  up. Twenty minutes ago, bomb explodes or bombs because it reported from two different streets.
[01:19.200 --> 01:25.600]  It was one bomb. Now they're saying a tripwire. That's four bombs in the last three weeks.
[01:25.600 --> 01:34.160]  One by our warehouse. One pretty close where I live in Southwest Austin. Then I learned
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.880]  Daniels lives more in North Austin. He got the same alert saying stay indoors. But I
[01:38.880 --> 01:48.960]  mean, I figured I got this alert because I was two miles from the bombing. And I've
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.240]  talked to some friends that lived near there. I mean, they heard it a half mile away. It's
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.960]  not like a transformer blowing up. Owen Schreuer and Millie Weaver, two of our great reporters,
[01:56.960 --> 02:05.200]  were on the ground before media, mainstream media. Incredible. And they are going to be
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.320]  joining us today. I'm going to have a nice take on this as well. I did call one of my law enforcement
[02:10.320 --> 02:16.160]  sources. He gave me the best thinking on this as of yesterday before the latest bombing because
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.560]  I hadn't contacted the source in about four days. He was about to call me. He said as soon as he knows
[02:22.560 --> 02:35.120]  more, giving away part of it, that he will call me. But he said some very interesting things. And so,
[02:35.120 --> 02:41.440]  let me just get that out of the way right now. The serial bomber may be playing games with
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.160]  super primitive bombs that are very dangerous for the person that even constructs them.
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.760]  And then upping the level of sophistication of tripwire to play some type of Zodiac killer mind
[02:51.760 --> 02:58.960]  game. Or it could be a very, very mentally disturbed individual. They're obviously disturbed
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.920]  doing this for their kicks, but completely psychotic, completely delusional out of their minds,
[03:03.920 --> 03:12.560]  not just criminal. But they believe that he's using probably a he, obviously 99% of stuff like
[03:12.560 --> 03:20.160]  this is a male. Oh, that's profiling. Well, yeah, because profiles are real. 99% of the stuff is men
[03:20.160 --> 03:27.280]  that do these type of things. And he's using the trails. There are trails in East Austin that led
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.520]  up to these houses in the neighborhood. There are trails where this attack happened. There were trails
[03:31.520 --> 03:39.440]  near the other one. That way he can park or she can park their vehicle, get in the woods, construct
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.840]  the bomb and then bring it to the front doorstep or the pathway. But I mean, any shaking, it blows
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.040]  up. And that's exclusive. We've given you is that it's a pressure bomb that's activated by the movement.
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.520]  At least the last three bombs were, I don't, I haven't got any word on what this bomb is.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.560]  And that's real information. We're not just saying that that's important information. You know, we
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.240]  broke the fact that it was very, very primitive bombs and very dangerous to construct that came
[04:04.240 --> 04:12.800]  out days later on Fox News. So we have this directly. I mean, I'll just let you know because
[04:12.800 --> 04:15.760]  this is all going to come out anyway. So I'm going to give up our source, but they're not even really
[04:15.760 --> 04:20.720]  worried if it comes out about them because the people really want this information out. But
[04:20.720 --> 04:26.080]  we're getting this from federal and local. So there you go. We don't just have one source and
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.200]  they're pretty sure he's using the trails. There's a lot of trails.
[04:31.200 --> 04:36.880]  That way again, he can get a car parked one place infiltrate when other people are on the
[04:36.880 --> 04:40.720]  hiking bike trails. He can't tell who it is. Have a backpack, go set up the bombing
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.840]  and then get back to their car. Okay, that said, we knew it was coming. We first broke it four years
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.280]  ago. Communist China is announcing a global credit score. You will not be able to travel,
[04:55.280 --> 04:59.440]  work, sell or eat. You will be killed basically if they lower your credit score.
[04:59.440 --> 05:04.400]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.880]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.440]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.760]  discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[05:17.760 --> 05:22.240]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[05:22.240 --> 05:27.680]  those naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:27.680 --> 05:32.480]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.960]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal
[05:36.960 --> 05:42.240]  helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:42.960 --> 05:48.080]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can
[05:48.080 --> 05:53.600]  fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[06:24.080 --> 06:30.080]  fully automatic weapons. Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis,
[06:30.080 --> 06:35.760]  Tennessee. J.F.K. was shot from the back and the front. He was almost a distiller of planned
[06:35.760 --> 06:43.600]  infusion. It just panked. He took the babies out of the incubators, left the children to die on the cold spots.
[06:43.600 --> 06:48.640]  I think this is a national security imperative. We have clear things that we do not understand how
[06:48.640 --> 06:55.840]  they were operating in areas that we can't control. U.S.A. Is this global governance that
[06:55.840 --> 07:01.040]  lasts? Is it one world? The Central Bank has been charged. Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[07:01.040 --> 07:06.400]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose. They describe today's action as part of a
[07:06.400 --> 07:13.360]  continuing cover-up. Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[07:13.360 --> 07:19.360]  Russian stuff. Denied everything. He called it all fake news. And he accused CNN of being
[07:19.360 --> 07:25.680]  fake news. This is a national emergency. If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive
[07:25.680 --> 07:33.440]  civil war in this country. This is a female high-level emergency. Yard war with Russia.
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.200]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.160]  with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks? The White House and the president are citing InfoWars.
[07:42.160 --> 07:48.960]  They can shut us down. You're next. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[07:49.760 --> 08:00.080]  It's Alex Jones. I can honestly say that the news that I have in front of me
[08:02.240 --> 08:08.800]  is the most insane, the most crazy, the most confirming information about the nature of
[08:08.800 --> 08:14.240]  the New World War that I've ever seen. It is total information overload. There was another
[08:14.240 --> 08:19.520]  bomb went off just miles from where I was laying down to go to sleep last night in my home with
[08:19.520 --> 08:26.640]  my children. An emergency alert saying, stay indoors. And we've got the intel on how the
[08:26.640 --> 08:31.200]  bomber the police believe is deploying the weapons. We're going to give you that exclusive.
[08:31.200 --> 08:40.000]  InfoWars.com. Stephen Paddock motivated by anti-Trump politics. True Pundit has their
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.920]  intelligence sources, which by the way, dovetail with what I have, but I had to sign a non-disclosure
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.840]  that I was shown video. And as a journalist, I wear a journalist hat, a pundit hat, an analyst
[08:53.840 --> 09:00.960]  hat, a rabble-raser hat, a father's hat, a patriot's hat, a fighter's hat. But I'm shown
[09:00.960 --> 09:09.040]  information that's not criminal and it's off record. Then people decide I'm not allowed to
[09:09.040 --> 09:14.880]  use it. I can't tell you, but I can tell you right now, this is a very accurate report.
[09:19.760 --> 09:26.800]  Hushed FBI intel report reveals Vegas shooting suspect triggered by paddocks
[09:26.800 --> 09:30.240]  anti-Trump politics.
[09:34.160 --> 09:38.000]  And then it just goes on from there. And we got it directly from the
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.840]  ISIS rescue team about how he'd gone to the Middle East, how he had all this paraphernalia,
[09:41.840 --> 09:48.640]  anti-fun, Islamic. I was told look into connections to the Kurds and communist training with anti-fuck.
[09:48.640 --> 09:53.440]  That came out months later in the news and they've been connected to bombings in Europe and the
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.120]  UK and botched attacks here in the US. I mean, we were given spot on info. But they weren't
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.920]  telling us the specifics because that would be violating their orders. You could claim
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.520]  national security. You know, the national security is getting this information out,
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.920]  obviously. The left one to blame gun owners. How are you going to stop an Islamic
[10:11.920 --> 10:19.680]  whack job on a bunch of drugs? Bound up. You expose it. You don't blame the guns. Just like,
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.920]  are you going to blame homemade explosives for whoever's detonated four bombs,
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.240]  injuring now what, five people killing one? What are you going to do about the wildfires?
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.040]  Because everybody knows and the media has been told not to hype this up and they've wisely not.
[10:37.040 --> 10:43.360]  But at a certain point you've got to talk about it. Every time the winds get up, there are anarchists
[10:43.360 --> 10:48.080]  and there are nihilists that go out and people that are socially envious and they go out and
[10:48.080 --> 10:56.800]  they set fires because they're voyeurs because they're pyromaniacs. We've always had them,
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.360]  but mental illness is up. People are on all sorts of whacked out drugs and so it gives
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.000]  you the feeling of empowerment, of being somebody. How are you going to stop fire?
[11:06.800 --> 11:09.120]  Going to put a five day waiting period on that?
[11:09.120 --> 11:19.840]  Baseball bats, knives, trucks. Society is degenerating. Mental illness is exploding everywhere.
[11:21.600 --> 11:24.720]  People don't have any God. They don't have anything they stand for. They don't,
[11:24.720 --> 11:32.400]  decadence doesn't satisfy them. And so they get more and more mentally ill. Some just become lazy
[11:32.400 --> 11:40.720]  and stupid. Others become very, very deviant and they fall into a type of mass mob criminal psychology.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.080]  The movie The Kingsman is basically an allegory of that and they do have waves they can send over
[11:50.080 --> 11:54.960]  flickerade on television, smartphones that have been declassified for 50 years. They can
[11:54.960 --> 11:59.280]  cause you to be more aggressive. They can also soothe you, but in that movie they just dumb it
[11:59.280 --> 12:04.960]  down. And that's what's being done to us. But the globalists believe they have to let us know what
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.840]  they're doing as a metaphysical rule so that we have a chance to escape. And then they believe
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.800]  they karmically don't get destroyed by what they did to us because if they tell us, well then it was
[12:14.800 --> 12:18.880]  free will and we went along with it. That's why I've been allowed to be on the air.
[12:18.880 --> 12:30.640]  And that's why I'm not even really mad at the government connected people suing us and the
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.000]  stupid folks over at CNN and poor little narcissist raging maniacs like Brian Stelter and all of them
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.600]  is they're just trying to be somebody and they don't even understand what pawns they are because
[12:41.600 --> 12:50.080]  anybody understands this. You understand you don't join this and win. You join this to really
[12:50.800 --> 13:00.320]  try to skydive or swan dive right into hell. So it's a it's a it's a resonance issue
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.320]  and the wheat from the chaff is going to get separated.
[13:05.920 --> 13:09.440]  What do you think wars are? It's overpopulation. People always start killing each other.
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.200]  Well we've developed all these technologies so our populations have exploded but we have the same
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.640]  race consciousness that we've had before to start killing each other and it's now being
[13:20.640 --> 13:27.040]  inwardly directed and it's being directed at any pillars of success that would stand
[13:27.040 --> 13:32.720]  during the great cleansing as the globalists call it so that they don't run into any opposition
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.880]  during the collapse. They're going to use that collapse to clean everything off and then bring
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.880]  in their whole new system but then that's an AI merged system and is totally dehumanizing in
[13:42.880 --> 13:51.760]  the end of free will and is even worse than the satanic byproduct that we see taking place here
[13:51.760 --> 13:59.280]  in the west because of our decadence. That's kind of a satanic free-for-all that's bad enough but not
[13:59.280 --> 14:09.040]  purely directed human exterminism. Now that said uh let me move on to the next subject.
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.640]  You got paddock the leftist, popped up nihilists, you got the bombing stuff going on I'd say the
[14:16.640 --> 14:26.000]  same profile as I said day one and then you got this big enchilada. Coming to America China
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.840]  introduces credit score for obedient citizens. Paul Joseph Watson 2015 drudge linked to it the
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.080]  media made fun of it. Ranking the peasants China reduces our well-earned citizen scores
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.680]  using and by the way this all came out before the black mirror episode that everybody references
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.160]  that's where they got it from the Chinese didn't get it from black mirror black mirror two years
[14:46.160 --> 14:55.680]  ago got it from that popular television program so but but seeing black mirror you but you can't
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.520]  travel you can't have a job you can't have a good house if you don't have a good credit score
[14:59.520 --> 15:05.200]  that's the ultimate class system here's USA Today you will get chipped eventually so that's the
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.000]  that's the whole pitch remember we were cooks for saying that was coming now it's just in your
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.800]  face now this is what broke today when we come back from break now now this is true gulags this
[15:16.800 --> 15:24.880]  is true ghettos China demands citizens with bad social credit rating from taking flights or using
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.080]  trains for up to a year so you think you just get a facebook strike for a week or a twitter
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.840]  ban for a week if you you know it's tell a joke they don't like no no no no that's all the model

[15:41.920 --> 15:47.600]  along with everything exactly like they want they start lowering it and then you comply but then

[20:17.760 --> 20:29.200]  wage war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.840]  well ladies and gentlemen the new testament particularly revelations
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.800]  is real it's true and it's happening now there's two ways to look at that it's either
[20:44.800 --> 20:52.240]  been taken as a model of control like a science fiction book and is being deployed but nevertheless
[20:52.240 --> 20:59.920]  it's being manifest or it he really did envision all this and and now it's coming true john the
[20:59.920 --> 21:05.920]  revelator on the isle of patmos people keep asking who actually pay attention to the broadcast
[21:05.920 --> 21:10.720]  how have you accurately predicted so much of what's happened you must have insider knowledge
[21:10.720 --> 21:19.200]  info wars is the insider but by that people that actually research things and look at what all the
[21:19.200 --> 21:24.800]  other whistleblowers and insiders and historians and futurists and others have said but also what
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.240]  the globalists have said and the fact that they conceptualized everything we're living under
[21:30.240 --> 21:37.680]  really about a hundred years ago in a lot of cases before that and that this is a managed
[21:37.680 --> 21:45.440]  civilization and that we have been domesticated and made weak and our families broken up and men
[21:45.440 --> 21:53.440]  made very shallow and women made very shallow and just basically directionless ahead of the big
[21:54.720 --> 21:56.960]  wiping the big cleansing as it's called
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.320]  there's a lots of little cullings and cleansings and things but those are just little beta tests
[22:04.320 --> 22:09.600]  just to manage hey can we give kids by the millions vaccines that we don't give them lower IQs and
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.680]  convulsions and give them cancer but let some kids die and then manage other people and see if we
[22:15.680 --> 22:21.520]  can you know just what the public will take get them to adapt titrating the dose of death
[22:22.720 --> 22:28.720]  where you adapt to people being brain damaged or lower IQs or dying around you to where there's
[22:28.720 --> 22:31.920]  multiple people working this building lost their children from vaccines killed them
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.400]  so that I got family uh everybody I know has had horrible reactions to it I mean we're all
[22:38.400 --> 22:45.200]  victims but we just muscle on because they know those of us that aren't the victim mentality
[22:45.200 --> 22:53.200]  we adapt but if it's an artificial stimuli from above it can corral us into destruction
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.240]  not into overcoming that's why you have to be conscious of it and realize what's going on and
[22:58.240 --> 23:07.520]  what's happened and then then you can evolve not in the Darwinian way but the way automobiles do
[23:07.520 --> 23:12.720]  are weapons or literature or culture you can evolve out of that you can adapt and overcome
[23:13.520 --> 23:21.760]  as the Marines say and and this is it this is the big test I've been told that I passed the test
[23:21.760 --> 23:26.160]  because I understand it and I should join them that you're a bunch of dumb animals that you're
[23:26.160 --> 23:30.160]  soulless dumb animals well I've seen the people hurting the public and they got
[23:33.200 --> 23:39.040]  less than a soul they got something very negative and very bad and I don't want to be associated
[23:39.040 --> 23:45.840]  with it at a spiritual level it stinks like hell it stinks like failure and I know one thing and
[23:45.840 --> 23:53.440]  plus it manifests very badly as well so no thanks no thanks no thanks it's like a con game where oh
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.480]  be part of our contest uh oh look you're the winner in our system oh I want to be in the
[23:58.480 --> 24:04.400]  globalist pageant with Henry Kissinger and Michael Moore and Lord Rothschild and David
[24:04.400 --> 24:10.400]  Rockefeller no thanks and George Soros and Brian Stelter you know what I don't want to walk that
[24:10.400 --> 24:18.080]  red carpet you couldn't pay me a trillion dollars to go hang around with those mummies in New York
[24:18.080 --> 24:24.400]  and all the ridiculous evening gowns all just walking around glaring at each other like demons
[24:24.400 --> 24:29.920]  I mean it's it's it's it's it's it's the place I want to be the furthest away from see you're
[24:29.920 --> 24:36.000]  what I don't want to be got that good I know you understand that to the globalist now I'm
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.440]  going to cover this more Owen's going to pop in about the bombing in Austin he and Millie
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.760]  went and covered live last night did a great job sorry for the folks that got really injured really
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.280]  bad from the trip wire bomb we had all the tales of that I haven't gotten into just the overwhelming
[24:49.280 --> 24:54.160]  incredible news of the impending indictments of McCabe and others and we're now here telling you
[24:54.160 --> 24:58.640]  from our sources that they've got the evidence it's open and shut and that they're just being
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.680]  very judicious about it and that they intend to indict the whole lot and people have been hoping
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.200]  for this they've been praying for it because washington is just for this corrupt system where
[25:07.200 --> 25:10.880]  both parties protect each other they're crapping their branches because they know trump is really
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.600]  trying to drain the swamp so this is a critical time right now obviously we have a dim congressman
[25:16.800 --> 25:19.360]  one congressman came out and said remove him now get rid of him
[25:20.240 --> 25:27.280]  but another congressman came out last night uh tom susie sozie and made the bizarre comments
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.280]  about it's time to use the second amendment against trump so that's a call for insurrection
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.800]  and that's what I said last week I said I couldn't see they're about to go into real
[25:36.800 --> 25:41.840]  violence mode the attack on the congressman and stuff was a test run at the baseball park
[25:42.800 --> 25:48.000]  and I'm just telling you I'm sure I know Trump's already doing this but when they're organizing
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.320]  violence and moving and I can see they're moving with it behind the scenes it's time for covert
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.360]  action and it just has to happen so if people kind of see enforcers as a bellwether or where the
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.880]  people said I'm just saying I think the president and the military has to do it has to do at this
[26:02.880 --> 26:08.480]  point I mean it would be negligent to sit here at this point all these organized criminals are
[26:08.480 --> 26:11.840]  saying they're going to overthrow the government and kill everybody and get rid of the bill of
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.880]  rights and they're siding with the communist chinese for heaven's sake I mean we need to be
[26:16.880 --> 26:22.240]  judicious about this but this is extra judicial it's out of control these these are enemy combatants
[26:22.240 --> 26:30.720]  by the very definition okay continuing um China to ban citizens with bad social credit rating from
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.920]  taking flights or using trains for up to a year and that's how it begins and in China if you can't
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.320]  travel you starve to death people starve to death there's dead bodies all over the place look it up
[26:41.040 --> 26:46.240]  totally barbarous they're replacing humans with robots suicide nets mobile execution vans
[26:46.800 --> 26:55.200]  harvesting christians and buddhist organs and now as we told you once this is in place
[26:55.200 --> 27:01.040]  they would then use it for total social control the mark of the beast I was just talking about so
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.560]  if you've got a digital score and a digital ID and it's tied to buying and selling and it's tied
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.920]  in the real world what you do goes into that score the internet of things
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.080]  that is the ultimate class system well they got us fighting over being black or white or whatever
[27:18.080 --> 27:26.720]  the whole ai's coming in they destabilize culture they bring down the civilization in an ai-directed
[27:26.720 --> 27:33.040]  takeover print and this is it and the globalists believe they're culling the earth of a human
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.760]  infestation they see themselves as super sapiens that are going to save the earth and move into
[27:37.760 --> 27:45.040]  the future but first they must contend with a battle for earth that's it and this is the science
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.800]  fiction movie it's not a drill uh what they hate is free market what they hate is free association
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.800]  they're now removing the word god and jesus and easter from everything I talked to high-level
[27:56.800 --> 28:01.680]  facebook folks just did test where they put the word god in in articles they wrote and they were
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.600]  blocked or they talked about god in a video and it gets blocked it's all in live time all of its
[28:07.600 --> 28:18.080]  algorithm ai watching it's here and apple's moving to china they've they're all making
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.480]  their decision the decision is they're going with the brain chip population they're going to market
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.880]  the beast and china is going to be the leverage with their slaves to make it ubiquitous and
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.520]  debate attested to roll it out and it's here and the keys of the internet are now being handed from
[28:31.520 --> 28:38.480]  the leftist at the cia to the communist chinese as they promised to do in davos to honcho the
[28:38.480 --> 28:44.160]  entire operation the desperate double crosses here and trump is desperately at the helm trying to
[28:44.160 --> 28:50.080]  right the ship under massive moron attack if he fails there will be weeping and wailing of
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.760]  gnashing of teeth particularly by the fools that lower the drawbridge and help bring down the republic

[33:08.160 --> 33:28.080]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[33:39.120 --> 33:46.560]  well at least twice this weekend members of congress went on television and said
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.160]  it's time to overthrow the president and let's use the second amendment to do it now if i got on
[33:52.160 --> 33:59.680]  here and i said let's use the second amendment to offensively go overthrow obama uh even though
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.680]  he was a globalist and a trader he'll be up to the public to judge whether or not that was a
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.960]  constitutional action but but on the books it'd be criminal remember the hatari militia they're
[34:08.960 --> 34:14.240]  being asked by an informant eight nine years ago uh going to the knob creek machine gun shoot out
[34:15.840 --> 34:19.360]  well one of the un invades and society collapses they're trying to take our guns
[34:19.360 --> 34:23.280]  well they said we're gonna have to fight we'll have to work with local law enforcement to fight
[34:23.280 --> 34:27.760]  which we've had governors and mayors others come out and make the same point when obama was talking
[34:27.760 --> 34:36.720]  about the un coming in and taking over and uh strong cities and all that but now it's congressman
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.640]  we're going to play this clip on television here's one of them democratic congressman has
[34:42.640 --> 34:46.880]  caused controversy by suggesting americans use the second amendment to resist president trump
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.440]  representative tom suozzi suzi made the bizarre comments during a town hall event last week
[34:53.440 --> 34:59.680]  we're gonna play that clip i got another congressman um john garamendi saying basically the same
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.560]  thing and that's because their criminal network is being removed we're going to cover this now
[35:04.560 --> 35:11.200]  briefly and then get into the fourth bombing and then this time in southwest austin they just took
[35:11.200 --> 35:16.800]  place and we've got inside intel to provide directly from federal and local law enforcement
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.920]  directly on the site but right now let's go ahead and go to the congressman calling for open
[35:23.920 --> 35:28.640]  physical insurrection and the death of the president that's what he's calling for here it is
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.040]  it's you know it's really it's really a matter of uh putting public pressure on the president
[35:35.040 --> 35:38.320]  and making a public which is hard to break through the news cycle and all the different things
[35:38.960 --> 35:45.920]  and it's probably about going to the courts as well uh and then you know i mean this is where the
[35:45.920 --> 35:51.280]  second second amendment comes in quite frankly because you know what if the president was to
[35:51.280 --> 36:00.800]  ignore the courts what would you do what would we do in paper so first second amendment is right
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.880]  so he's in there to that soft follower brainwash crowd would look like they couldn't fight their
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.840]  way out of a wet paper bag saying under his breath you know that's what we've got it for
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.760]  it was what we need to go ahead and start doing and that's what they're doing that's why cnn when
[36:23.760 --> 36:31.840]  that dirt bag um looked like dentists asher's brother from illinois that bernie sanders supporter
[36:31.840 --> 36:36.640]  that hillary supporter went and tried to kill all those congressmen but the security took him out
[36:36.640 --> 36:42.160]  in seconds and almost killed his colleagues so what blitzer had a guest on stage he wasn't a bad
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.320]  guy he was a good guy stand up can see my what's her not on his head so they're saying they're not
[36:46.320 --> 36:52.560]  willing to the killing themselves these cowards are telling mentally ill people and others hey you
[36:52.560 --> 36:58.160]  go out and you get rid of him it's spinning out of control he's a security threat he's got to go
[36:58.160 --> 37:06.400]  and mud's on tv saying we're going to kill this guy these people have had this country in a coma
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.480]  for so long oh and that they think they're invincible and course is coming out that paddock was a
[37:12.480 --> 37:16.880]  leftist we had that from our sources whether it's guns or whether it's bombs or whether it's the
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.000]  leftist they keep catching setting fires fires everywhere these are nihilistic mental patients
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.840]  who love misery because they're miserable little cowards mud is a miserable little chicken neck
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.920]  coward and let me tell the real people in the cia they got their eyes on him because he's just
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.160]  that you one of these guys that gave the orders as a little blue blood chicken neck you know because
[37:38.160 --> 37:42.960]  his family lineage i guess you know goes back to the original dr. mud the only other person
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.960]  convicted of killing lincoln so it's funny he's got this he's got this bloody blood lust for for
[37:48.960 --> 37:55.280]  republican presidential blood and i mean bat might over there things he's really a little powerful
[37:55.280 --> 38:04.880]  vampire but see if you were a little sack of cowardly ugly anti-male just chicken neck anti-american
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.280]  filth like him and brennan who says america will prevail and crush you trump america will prevail
[38:11.280 --> 38:15.120]  when you're a globalist and you're the tyrant illegally spying on everybody you're the people
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.240]  trying to suppress the nation it's incredible and they're and then the very outfit he's with
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.960]  seeing and wants to shut down they run fake news reports against us they run reports saying that
[38:24.960 --> 38:30.320]  we say that the guy that's suing us that does work for hillary and you know of the government and
[38:30.320 --> 38:35.520]  all the rest of it that we said he killed the girl at charlottesville total lie they never
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.080]  show where we said it because it doesn't hurt us it hurts them but oh and they're going for a
[38:40.080 --> 38:43.600]  broke we'll get to the bombing next segment but in the time we have left here they're going
[38:44.640 --> 38:51.680]  for a broke and they're trying to get their average constituents i had my daughters for a week and
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.280]  they went for a week on spring break with their mom our school had two weeks of spring break and
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.600]  they went up to um canada kit to the middle of the blizzard to go snowskiing and my older daughter
[39:03.600 --> 39:12.880]  told me that they were up there and in my middle daughter that when when a father learned who they
[39:12.880 --> 39:20.560]  were began cussing at a 10 year old and blowing up now imagine these lepers are so weird anti-foul
[39:20.560 --> 39:26.800]  attack women they'll do all this stuff oh and and now they'll yell at 10 year old girls that's
[39:26.800 --> 39:33.360]  how weak and pathetic and unshillerous they are but at the same time they have no morals or no
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.600]  connections to reality just like the left supports islam and slaving women and killing gays they
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.080]  don't care as long as they're allied with it and it's a virtue signal to try to bully us
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.080]  and all it did was make my kids love my message that much more and understand the truth that their
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.960]  daddy's a good guy and didn't say the things that guy was saying and my daughter told the guy he was
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.120]  a liar and he didn't know what to do with an adult trying to bully him when they were up on the
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.640]  mountain skiing and i guess mom was back at the hotel uh so so so that's the type of stuff that's
[40:00.640 --> 40:06.000]  going on oh and well the jones lineage standing up to bullies i sure i'm shocked about that alex i'm
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.720]  shocked but it's crazy to remember when i was on this show probably a few months back maybe almost
[40:12.720 --> 40:18.080]  a year now where i was the bad guy after i got cursed at by a 10 year old remember that so so
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.080]  they're okay as long as you're cursing and shouting and being you know ugly and violent
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.080]  then they're okay with it but when you were when you were talking there it was just crazy to go down
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.440]  the memory hole and think about all the craziness that has ensued just in the last two years alex
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.440]  you had the democrat party get caught inciting violence at a trump rally in chicago they had
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.640]  to cancel that you had the guy that you mentioned go and shoot up the republican baseball practice
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.920]  how about don jr and his wife get white powder in the mail you've got this but it's waving on that
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.400]  you've got uh you've got rand paul getting attacked he's got rand paul gets attacked
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.920]  look at this have you seen this alex helicopter carrying jared and avanka experiences an engine
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.080]  failure has to return to dc so i mean it's just craziness and then you've got four explosions
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.360]  in austin i've got a interactive bomb map here now in my in my hometown of austin texas i have to
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.320]  look at this it's like what the hell is going on on this planet right now alex i mean this is not
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.760]  this is you can't even you can't even finish covering one story and figure out what's going
[41:15.760 --> 41:20.400]  on with this one story before you have to move on to the next one i mean you had breaking video
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.880]  analyzing the indictments that are about to come down on the democrats and their team
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.200]  and then all of a sudden there's another bombing in austin and you just scratch your head there's
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.800]  no answers nobody knows now he's using a tripwire well i've got the he's you they think he's using
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.920]  the green belts all these places have green belts where you can park them all the way over the
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.320]  backpack come in a symbol very dangerous uh at least the first three haven't got any info on the
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.400]  fourth bomb and then we got a shocking clip an audio clip video clip on the other side to alex
[41:46.400 --> 41:53.200]  that's gonna it's just crazy it's just well the left is up there at town halls and on tv saying
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.200]  it's time to start killing trump it's time to kill congressman it's time to kill everybody
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.480]  and the average leptis is ready to like you know buy clock women in the heads or get in the face
[42:02.480 --> 42:08.160]  of ten-year-old girl because they're so powerful and my daughter said the guy was throwing a fit a
[42:08.160 --> 42:14.000]  full grown man was like screaming and flopping around and this is mental illness so by successive
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.800]  approximation they've taken all these beta males and put them into these things and now they go to
[42:18.800 --> 42:25.520]  town halls and talk about killing people and they tell me at the gun shops they saying the biggest
[42:25.520 --> 42:29.600]  group is the left buying guns and for a while they were buying it because they were waking up
[42:29.600 --> 42:35.440]  that no now they're buying them for war with us so now they were always against the second
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.680]  amendment but now they want guns well you do like paddock did i'm not saying do it you want to get
[42:39.680 --> 42:43.760]  back at us you know you go shoot up a group of people don't leave a message behind and then
[42:43.760 --> 42:47.200]  no you're gonna blame the second amendment you guys have learned how to false flag that's how
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.880]  bad you are that's how evil you are that's who you are you are the scum of the earth wanting us
[42:52.880 --> 43:00.080]  to be north korea hating america the truth is you have existential envy because you're trash i'm so

[45:09.200 --> 45:15.600]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[45:15.600 --> 45:22.000]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.920]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[45:27.920 --> 45:33.920]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.520]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.640]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.320]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[45:50.320 --> 45:56.640]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com
[45:56.640 --> 46:01.920]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets it's been sold out for months and now

[46:26.800 --> 46:31.440]  are for your gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides but more importantly than
[46:31.440 --> 46:39.280]  bad bacteria the probiotics help this place yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and

[47:27.360 --> 47:32.880]  announced or put a list out because all they need to do is promote them locally then the globalists
[47:32.880 --> 47:37.440]  won't harass them anyway it's just like putting out on air makes them makes them come like piranha
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.280]  but this this this particular radio station owner is a big patriot and doesn't care uh and so we're
[47:45.280 --> 47:52.480]  going to do a big rollout promoting this because there are a potential 10 million listeners in this
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.600]  area they have been trying to keep me off san Antonio for a long long time
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  two stations directly in san Antonio and the juicy part about this is this look at all these big
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.840]  old fm's so uh i'm very excited when we need some patriots to put billboards on some of these cities
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.400]  this is a big deal i don't even want i mean i can't do all this justice right now
[48:16.400 --> 48:22.800]  and i'm gonna do some promos and put the website out like just bring it on into me please uh but

[52:14.160 --> 52:18.880]  map here in austin well yeah we've got a we've got a bomb map now this is an interactive bomb
[52:18.880 --> 52:26.960]  map from the local nbc affiliates website here kxan in austin texas it's just crazy to me and
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.560]  you know i grew up in st lewis and you know we had shootings and stabbings it's one of the most
[52:32.560 --> 52:36.560]  dangerous cities in america you know that's what happens when the democrats got in control and
[52:36.560 --> 52:40.000]  shipped all the manufacturing out and created poverty this like they do in every other inner
[52:40.000 --> 52:45.600]  city but i just can't even believe this it's like it's it's almost surreal alex it's almost surreal
[52:46.320 --> 52:50.960]  that i live in a city that now has an interactive bomb map i don't think that these bombings are
[52:50.960 --> 52:55.120]  going to stop i don't suspect the individual responsible for this to turn themselves into
[52:55.120 --> 53:00.240]  the police i don't think i mean i don't know if they're working with anyone or not but if they are
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.360]  i guess that would increase the odds somebody might go for the 115 thousand dollar award but i don't
[53:05.360 --> 53:09.520]  think that that's going to happen now they're saying they're using you know tripwire so who
[53:09.520 --> 53:13.200]  knows what they could be doing next or what they could be planning next there's all kinds of trails
[53:13.200 --> 53:19.040]  in austin if that's what he's using for the to the that's that's the common denominator is there
[53:19.040 --> 53:26.240]  are green belts and trails everywhere and these are kind of trailhead endings and he and so he
[53:26.240 --> 53:32.000]  can park and he can go in and then he assembles it on site that's the exclusive news that the police
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.400]  wanted us to have federal and local people that have been there dealing with it hands on uh that
[53:38.400 --> 53:44.160]  that it is very primitive but very explosive very dangerous and that they're surprised this guy hasn't
[53:44.160 --> 53:49.600]  blown himself up and so it's either some really sick twisted person who's more sophisticated and
[53:49.600 --> 53:55.440]  throwing him off or it's probably a whacked out seriously mentally ill person you know that might
[53:55.440 --> 53:59.360]  think he's you know blowing up space aliens or something i mean you never know the schizophrenic
[53:59.360 --> 54:05.120]  uh but the the the good money is it's either some kind of crazy warrior who gets off guys that set
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.360]  the fires and they're like this you know the beltway snipers what they're comparing this to
[54:09.360 --> 54:17.200]  or it is a complete and total cuckoo land nutball well i would imagine it has to be someone that has
[54:17.200 --> 54:21.840]  at least some wits about them because i imagine it's not easy to to great and detonate these
[54:21.840 --> 54:25.440]  things successfully as this individual has done i don't know i mean they're saying it could be to
[54:25.440 --> 54:29.760]  throw them off but it's it's really simple and it's a pressure when you remove the weight it blows
[54:29.760 --> 54:36.320]  up okay well i mean again they're surprised he hasn't blown himself up now i want to go to a video
[54:36.320 --> 54:40.720]  alex do we have the video ready guys i want to go to this quick clip of the press conference from
[54:40.720 --> 54:46.400]  this morning now one thing that i noticed in the difference between covering the last bombing or
[54:46.400 --> 54:51.040]  the last two explosions the third bombing that was in southeast austin this is the fourth bombing
[54:51.040 --> 54:55.360]  and then trip water and then the fourth the fourth bombing last night and and you can hear this in
[54:55.360 --> 55:01.040]  other press conferences the fbi the amount of fbi atf and and law enforcement on the scene has 500
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.880]  rubles 500 it's like great i mean they are everywhere it's like it's just seeing that scene was just
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.800]  surreal but i want to go to this clip do we have this clip guys from the press conference we have
[55:10.800 --> 55:15.840]  but here it is all right go to this audio listen to what um what manly said this morning this is very
[55:15.840 --> 55:25.360]  alarming and that's the awesome police chief and that is stunning audio as you can hear ladies and
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.280]  gentlemen we'll probably download that it's always critical to get the next clip lined up what did
[55:31.280 --> 55:38.240]  he what what did he say anyway he basically says if you see anything suspicious a backpack a bag a
[55:38.240 --> 55:44.480]  box a package a wire or anything like that do not touch it don't go near an alert authority so now
[55:44.480 --> 55:48.640]  it's like i mean you know i mean are we really looking around every corner for a trip wire a
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.560]  package there was a backpack last night now they have not addressed this in any press conference
[55:52.560 --> 55:57.040]  that i've heard yet except for last night they they were also investigating a backpack that they found
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.360]  somewhere on the scene too and i think that's why they said stay in your houses until the sun came
[56:01.360 --> 56:07.680]  out but i didn't hear any updates on the backpack well i was about to say this could be a sigh out
[56:07.680 --> 56:11.920]  by some private contractor group or some global organization i'm not saying that but obviously
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.320]  anything's possible it could be martians and i'm not serious when i say that the point is the point
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.600]  is is that it starts getting a little sci-fi when it's don't come out of your home authorities are
[56:21.600 --> 56:26.880]  on the side very dangerous situation well i'm like a mile and a half away so i'm thinking okay
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.400]  kits in north austin 15 miles away he's getting these emergency alerts don't come out of your
[56:32.400 --> 56:37.520]  house yeah they were everywhere yeah so i don't i mean that that that's like just the whole city
[56:37.520 --> 56:42.560]  comes to a standstill somebody's bombing us well and that's why that you guys have the audio ready
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.680]  now that's why when you hear this again and i want to go to this actual audio because i will
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.960]  we'll see you have the third time's the charm here we go packages the belief that we are now
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.160]  dealing with someone who's using tripwires shows a higher level of sophistication a higher level
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.240]  of skill and so now what we are imploring the community to do if you see any suspicious object
[57:04.240 --> 57:10.800]  or item that looks out of place do not even approach it but instead call 911 and report that
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.640]  to the police department so we can send folks out to check that any suspicious object or item now
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.840]  well can you imagine how many false calls this is gonna but i mean they have to say that at the
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.800]  same time it's just crazy i mean it's just like really am i look that's what i'm saying now it's
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.040]  i mean are we really now no i told my wife and everybody i said do not touch any packages that
[57:31.040 --> 57:34.880]  come to the house i'll look at them and then absolutely you would do that absolutely you'd
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.400]  want to protect your family all right we're gonna come back and look at more of this we have another
[57:38.400 --> 57:43.200]  guest joining us incredible time to be alive just so much bizarre stuff going on we're also going
[57:43.200 --> 57:47.360]  to talk about communist china we knew it was coming wait until you hear what the good old
[57:47.360 --> 57:52.480]  chai comms are doing and it's coming here next they use their media to assassinate real news they
[57:52.480 --> 57:57.120]  use their schools to teach children that their president is another hitler they use their
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.960]  movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over
[58:02.960 --> 58:09.280]  again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march
[58:09.280 --> 58:15.600]  make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash
[58:15.600 --> 58:21.520]  windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding
[58:21.520 --> 58:28.320]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that
[58:28.320 --> 58:34.880]  happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the only way
[58:34.880 --> 58:42.400]  we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth
[58:43.040 --> 58:48.320]  i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedoms safest place
[58:48.320 --> 58:55.040]  i want to plow into all of this that i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging

[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.800]  all right i'm sure you're riding shotgun with me we've got michael malis expert on north korea
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.280]  coming up big developments there with trump's upcoming meeting
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160]  if you really study criminology
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:44.560]  law enforcement and others try to not give real terrorism attention because that's what
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.160]  these mental patients want whether they be communists whether it be a schizophrenic whether it
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.320]  be some of nihilists whether it be antifa whether it just be somebody who thinks you know they're
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.640]  blowing martians up because i mean i've had crazy people after me that want to cut into my face
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.520]  thinking you know i'm a reptile and the media makes the joke saying that i'm the guy that says
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.720]  everybody's reptiles you know i didn't say that but what i'm getting at here is we don't know
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.600]  but you look at the increased forest fires and fires in california and texas and other areas
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.640]  they keep catching people doing it because they have social envy they want to see the world
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.640]  burned down that's the term you know i want to see the world burned down like that's a
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.240]  psychological term they use for people that want to you know basically blow everything up nihilism
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.800]  self-destructive as you know satanic behavior whatever you want to call it you can't stop people
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.160]  with a lighter can't stop them with a baseball bat a knife a gun they're always going to have
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:49.280]  bad people in the world and overall crimes down but mental illness and bizarre behavior all over
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.840]  the world's up and then crimes exploding in other areas of the world mexico hundreds of thousands
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.880]  dead oh and fourth bombing an austin trip wire injuring to me we had a death last week other
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.560]  injuries four bombings total you've been seen the three of them i'm just my takeaway here is
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.240]  society is degenerate well let's not forget about the amount of drugs that this country is consuming
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.280]  regularly as well not just you know illegal drugs but pharmaceutical drugs is through the roof as
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.800]  well so i mean and that always has something to do with these mass shootings who knows if that's
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.640]  the case with this bombing but one could draw that conclusion and when you look at what's happening
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.000]  in austin with four bombings okay first you had all of them kind of on the west side of austin
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.960]  two of them in what people would consider a low-income area and they started to form theories
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.840]  first they thought maybe it was a hate crime against people of different backgrounds or
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.680]  ethnicities or maybe it was a de gentrification thing or maybe these were targeted addresses
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.360]  and but there was still a mystery and they could never really get to it and then this last one
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.320]  it just kind of even became more of a mystery because of the trip wire and it was just a random
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.880]  person walking down the street and that's a very yuppie white area yeah so so now they're
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.160]  saying okay and you got the intel they're looking into these trails maybe it this is the maybe this
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.440]  is where the target is find a trail where they can you know put this thing together and get away with
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.880]  placing it wherever they want to place it and then easily be able to get away from the scene of the
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:21.280]  crime and so now police are not only have they raised the reward to 115 thousand and they're
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:27.760]  asking the suspect to to turn himself in essentially they're also now asking for local people that
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.480]  have security video from the last one to help them as well so if there's any security video
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.960]  of anybody walking around the street or anything during that time they're asking local people for
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.560]  that and this guy could be right-winging it'd be left-wing but they always have the same
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.920]  ammo of a loner who's mad at the world that wants to get back at people but wants attention because
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.240]  if they were a loner who was you know really trying to target something they go after who
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.480]  they're supposed enemy is but it isn't they want to be famous they want to strike fear into the
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.360]  general public because they hate everybody they see at the grocery store they hate their neighbors
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.800]  and and they just have a projected hatred of themselves onto the world what type of dirtbag
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.640]  it's a male probably a white male i mean what do you think i i don't know i mean honestly
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.440]  Alex my mind is just spinning with this i don't know is this controlled there's a lot of things
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.440]  that you look at this and you say maybe there's something bigger bigger picture going on
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.280]  and then you say it could be antifa antifa are the people attacking folks and threatening to bomb
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.680]  and attacking cats sanctuaries and the other composers saying the left is you know taking
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.720]  the gloves off gentrification and don't forget you played the clip in the two segments go of
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.400]  tom sweasy the democrat congressman in a tiny little room nobody's there low energy like 10
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.240]  people in the room saying it's time to take the president out with guns it's like okay so now am i
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.080]  supposed to look in that direction and say okay this party is getting violent they've been stirring
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.760]  up violence since trump rallies it can go either and who knows what lunatic that sets off all right

[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:15.920]  there is a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.400]  alex jones the foray conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.400]  alex jones
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.840]  scott russian scott
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.480]  info wars comes to mind
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.800]  reputation is amazing i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.280]  well we are very impressed that was president trump saying he wouldn't let info wars down
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.400]  that he would try to get the gdp up get the stock market up control our borders get north korea in line
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.920]  it's crazy how much he's gotten done i'm not going to spend the time we have the next 20
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.640]  months with our guest michael malis our best-selling author researcher fox news contributor pundit
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:23.840]  you're going over all trump's successes but we knew the strategy of rewarding north korea
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.560]  the strategy of giving them reactors letting them get missile secrets from the clintons and abb and
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:35.760]  uh you know the swiss company laurel hughes we knew doing this this strategy of patience
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:41.520]  had created the monster you know the giant spoiled rotten blood drinking i mean metaphysically
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.880]  baby that is kim jong-un and so now after all that pressure and everything suddenly
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.640]  they're to the table and the word is that meeting three weeks ago we'll see what our expert guest
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.360]  knows he pretty much hammered out a framework of what kim jong-un would already agree to
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.440]  do now the details of what he'll get aren't there but that he would give up the missiles
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.640]  give up the reactors have real inspections and then sign a deal for a 10-year unification phase
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.080]  now that's what i was told by high-level state department sources that
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.720]  because i was asking well is this going to happen is trump going to pull it off well that's why
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.840]  there's quote riders came out a week after i broke that they said no he has to agree to this
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.880]  just to have the meeting and that means that is the agreement and so uh this is hat in hand
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.880]  from what i know the sanctions have finally hit the regime they haven't been real up until then
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.080]  we know the clinton's and obama and all them even back to bush the rest of it would sit there at
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.720]  appease appease and let them have their trade but trump went to russia and others and actually got
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:42.720]  some pressure now that's my intel from my sources and then you see the meeting was saying switzerland
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:50.080]  sweden both countries have been checking out both areas this is a ginormous win a huge win right now
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.400]  but we'll see what michael malice of michael malice dot com uh has to say he's written the
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.440]  dear reader the unauthorized autobiography of kim jong-un he's been there many times covered it
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:05.360]  tracked it now and he joins us uh to give us his take so now you heard my little viewer just
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.440]  stult of this but you're the expert uh is this a big win for everybody oh i mean this is how
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:17.760]  could diplomacy not be a win i mean last summer they were going to new guam in november they
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.840]  sentenced president trump to death in absentia so any kind of deescalation and any kind of talking
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.920]  alex you remember the iraqi war and all these other the military industrial complex loves war
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.160]  i love peace i want to liberate these people without any blood being spilled and without any
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:41.120]  cost i mean that's the ideal uh goal of diplomacy and they said trump could never do i mean i
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.480]  remember we pulled the articles up a year ago they said if trump can even get a meeting or
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.200]  fix anything he'll be incredible president but he can't nothing and then now they've never had a
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.040]  meeting like this they've never had agreements up front did you get any because i know you've got a
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.240]  lot of big contacts you're all in fox news you name it uh that's what i got from high level
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.840]  state department that no no no trump's not going to get embarrassed by this because if he doesn't
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.080]  agree the meeting will never even happen and then he's basically passively agreed now he may try to
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.800]  weasel out of it but a is that accurate from what you know and b what are the concessions that the
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.720]  west is going to give is my source said they couldn't get into that so here is the lowest hanging fruit
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  a good negotiation is something that costs both sides little and gains both sides a lot right
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.000]  that's in any negotiation that's that deal scenario the korean war is still technically at war
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.520]  they only signed an armistice so it'll be very easy for kim jong-un and president trump to just
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.440]  sign a piece of paper to officially end the korean war it would just uh put into official
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.320]  practice what is already the status quo and right away they will be girl regardless winners in the
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.240]  world stage that'll take five minutes so that's something that's very easy but this will be as
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.320]  big as east and west germany well i think we got a ways to go before that because kim jong-un is
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.560]  not ready ready to uh take his hand off the gun he's not ready to liberate 25 million of his slaves
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.960]  he's not ready to close the concentration camps and there's something else we have to watch out for
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:11.280]  this is not a decent honest person negotiating fairly so by north korea publicly remember
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.360]  they told south korea to tell president trump what they're willing to put on the table right
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.920]  well what you say publicly and what you mean privately are very different situations so for
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.040]  them to publicly say oh yeah we want this we want this will give you everything and then if trump
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.280]  says no then they can say look we're the good guys we want peace president trump's an evil
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.280]  warmonger well sure that's what trump does on docket he comes up with a reasonable deal
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.560]  yeah democrats reject that you're saying kim jong-un may do the same thing yep so in a sense they
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.760]  are setting up president trump a little bit that said i don't think they will have any idea of what
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.840]  to make of him frankly they wouldn't even know what to make of president obama i mean they have a very
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:56.560]  poor understanding of of of how we think in many ways so there's a great big opportunity look if if
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.960]  mitch mcconnell and chuck schumer don't know how to negotiate with president trump how the heck is kim
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.440]  jong-un going to be able to do that well uh that's right no looking at this uh they're still talking
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.840]  about different times different places uh i know you've got your ear to ground big time on north korea
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.240]  what what's the other scoop on all this what what what is this meeting gonna happen so currently
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:22.480]  they're they're having high level talks in finland that said it would be unprecedented for a north korean
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.280]  leader uh not since his grandfather the great leader kim olsang went to some communist countries
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.440]  for funerals and things like that it would be unprecedented for a north korean leader to leave
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.120]  north korea and go to europe i mean kim jong-il went to china he went to russia but his whole
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.400]  point is look all these people come to me why do i got to leave the country and for kim jong-un to
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.360]  have to leave his own country you know in hollywood people sit at different tables at the restaurant
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.400]  right and the important person sits at the important table and you got to get up and you go to his
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.400]  table to show him respect kind of like the mafia so for kim jong-un to leave north korea and meet
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.160]  with president trump elsewhere that is a big concession in terms of uh admitting who has the
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:10.800]  power in the relationship well and it would be 50 50 though and obviously trump is gambling there
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.040]  to the meet probably in switzerland and that's where kim jong-un as you know grew up in boarding
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.640]  school so i think the smart money is is it being on switzerland and then him flying in on a swiss
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.480]  government plane so it's a neutral and you know what i'll give you a funny bit of trivia
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.560]  north korea had until recently the world's only one star airline uh it was illegal for the plight
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.440]  in europe not that it was going to be a problem when i went there they had upgraded from 1950
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:43.520]  soviet planes to 1980s planes they had the plastic red tacky glittery vinyl everywhere
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.080]  so they're making improvements soon enough they'll be at the 90s just like hillary clinton
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.160]  wow and it's funny the left is always telling me they want communism and they got their fancy
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.160]  smartphones made in south korea you know they're driving around in their you know a car their parents
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.280]  paid for but they're so pissed wearing their cool communist shirts why don't they go to pilgrimage
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.200]  the homage and go join the force labor camps of north korea i mean why why can't communism produce
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.680]  anything yeah and but this is also one of the big problems about the sanctions because they're
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.280]  going to only work to a point during the 90s uh kim jong-il the father of kim jong-un allowed one
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:23.520]  to two million of his population to starve it was exactly like stalin's genocide of the ukraine in
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.520]  many ways so these are people with a lot of blood on their hands and they will always put the suffering
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.160]  on the people as opposed to themselves at the top and they will always blame us who they referred
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.960]  to as the u.s. imperialists so sanctions work to a point however it's also clear that kim jong-un
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.440]  is trying to be much more of an international leader than his father kim jong-il was you saw
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.080]  his sister went to the olympics uh we could talk about that after the break uh but they clearly
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.120]  want to be world players on the world stage one the big ways they make revenue is their weapons
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.240]  trade so this idea of being a hermit kingdom when they're not interacting with other countries uh
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.600]  that is starting to a bit to fade away and that is a good domino to fall because very quickly it
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.840]  might cause the collapse of the whole wicked system that they have just like in china they really
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:15.360]  why is his hair why is he so handsome why is kim jong-un's hair so incredible because he's trying
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.680]  to mimic the look of his grandfather the great leader kim olsang who found in north korea so
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.760]  everything in north korea is a function of the grandfather who found in the country he's basically
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.840]  there george washington and when kim jong-il the father took over in 94 his campaign slogan actually
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.880]  was do not expect any change for me i'm the same man as my father so they're very much
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.520]  harkening back to the past because those are the good old days as opposed to now where there's no food
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.040]  man i tell you we know where all the food's going he's certainly eating it let's talk about
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.920]  what was the pressure that brought him to the table was it trump mainly or is it kim jong-un
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.320]  like you said i wanted to be on the grand stage we'll be right back with michael malis i'm alex

[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.040]  there in upstate new york and places like tennessee for 18 years but on air 23 years but uh
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:51.760]  been syndicated for about 20 and we've got affiliates that are as old as 18 years a lot of
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.760]  loyal great patriot listeners we've got 12 new stations in texas on the no bull radio network
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.040]  some of them are really big in san antonio and other cities and just another one is is carrying us
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:10.240]  24 hours a day in houston they were just showing me the affiliate agreement and i just signed that
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:18.240]  24 hours a day on fm in houston covering houston uh that they have fought so hard to keep us off the
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:25.040]  radio but all the censorship all the attacks it's it's like what's singing and others have done
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.120]  lying about us saying that i believe there's martian bases notice they don't play the video
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.440]  this is not a ufo show uh okay or i'll go oh look it's a weather blimp they think it's an alien or
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:40.080]  something never forget like it was a abc it was like what is this thing and it was a government
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.160]  surveillance derogable had solar panels on the side and propellers and i went it's a blimp and later
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.000]  it was a secret government blimp that owns us right how do we know that because it's a lot cheaper
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.920]  than satellites folks they got a whole bunch of them up there 60 000 feet let me just stop
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.480]  go back to michael melas we just got all these new affiliates and and and and later
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.440]  the day i'm going to plug the houston one this is really exciting because they're trying to shut us
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.640]  down they followed all these fake lawsuits uh they're claiming just insane things my lawyers
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:12.160]  look at the suits they go it's going to cost money to fight these but most of them are summary
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.760]  judgment thrown out and they go in their slapback statutes and they're desperate let me ask michael
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.720]  melas that he's not just a north korean expert he goes on fox everywhere he's the best selling
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.400]  author and one of the most famous ghost writers out there um very prolific about the left and
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.560]  congressman i don't know if you saw this on info wars dot com democrat congressman says
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.840]  you second amendment to resist trump he actually says like we need to use it you know to take him
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.400]  out because he's not following the courts he's been beating the courts everything he's been
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.640]  doing is constitutional and i got another congressman saying we got to overthrow him this weekend
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.160]  i mean this is true derangement and they're suing everybody they're suing fox news for questioning
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:57.040]  uh seth richan open murder case i mean it's what is going on here i mean alex they lost their
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:03.280]  i mean hillary uh remember how during the 2016 campaign there was that talk well maybe president
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.880]  trump got into some kind of secret deal in order to get hillary elected i think she made some secret
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.760]  deal with trump in order to get him real him reelected these people are losing their minds
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.760]  and it's fascinating to me how if you're a moderate and you don't know much about politics
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.760]  and you're hearing a congressman saying we're going to use guns to take out the president
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.000]  right away you're going to want to be on the other side of that no one i mean that's crazy
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.480]  talk and i it's probably not even legal but it's shocking how insular many of these people are
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.120]  that they're only talking to people who think like them and they basically try to outdo each other
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.360]  in their level of opposition and the level extremists of their uh uh verbiage is it because
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.640]  the left's main ideology used to you know kind of be corrupt blue blood stuff whatever big city
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.520]  machine but now all they have is like communism the insanity of the universities and the no free
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:24:01.120]  speech stuff has spilled out uh and i've got georgetown law clinic suing me trying to shut down
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.600]  the first amendment in the actual actual suit i mean the lawyers have seen it they're like this
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:10.560]  this is the end of the first amendment this will this is insane uh so so so i think the
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.800]  communist ideology that was at the heart even though we know it's broken doesn't work i think
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:21.120]  the radicalness the violentness of that uh is is what's spilling into the mainstream well what
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.440]  happened in you know in the consequence of the 2016 election the question was who is going to
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.600]  be the leader of the democratic party now that hillary clinton all lost and apparently the
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:35.600]  answer is a porn star and some traumatized high school kids i mean they have no leadership
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.600]  and they're desperately asking for someone to lead them out of this wilderness because they
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.640]  don't know how they got themselves into the place that they're in this was not supposed to happen
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.880]  and remember all the talk trump's not going to last the year he's going to resign he isn't
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.400]  going to want to be president well he's never going to get into the congress he's not going to
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.880]  he's going to start world war three none of these things happened so all their predictions came
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.160]  true and rather than try to question their own assumptions they're left scratching their heads
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.880]  and wondering who's going to save them from this mess of their own making that's right i mean
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.720]  i mean trump is basically coming up with royal flushes every hand it's it's it's almost messianic
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:18.560]  it's it's making my head spin and then they're getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.960]  and they don't know about the strisand effect when they try to shut us down and call for us to be
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.920]  killed and stuff like you said all that's doing is ballooning libertarian conservative
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:33.280]  nationalistic media we're we're growing as fast as we were in the election year that never happens
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.240]  and they i i just i think you're right i think they've gone crazy that's what my lawyers think
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.280]  they because i got top lawyers they say these are temper tantrums they're throwing well and
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.560]  look at you know the media who the corporate press who has no problem remember when cnn said they
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.880]  might sue a kid who made a joke gift from a wrestling image with their logo and now the same people
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.200]  the new york times cnn they try to present themselves as victims the idea that they're
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.720]  the ones who are being bullied and persecuted because people don't want to listen to their
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.600]  crap anymore i mean it's mind-boggling the shamelessness from some of these people there's some good
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.240]  ones let's be fair but for a lot of them they've really gone off the deep end and it's kind of
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.000]  like jimacosta from cnn's a great one i'm sure you remember when trump just kicked him out of the
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.840]  awful office rather than engage with us out it's kind yeah out like we're not having conversation
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.240]  you are not playing fair you're not arguing with the straight face there's nothing to discuss
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.800]  yeah i mean the costa and these guys are the ones that say that there's no martin luther king bus
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.440]  and and trump didn't really visit scolese it just it's like they lie lie lie lie lie ball face it's
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.080]  like they're making mistakes what about he wouldn't shake angela merkel's hand and there's the photo
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.520]  him shaking her hand what about he dumped in all the fish food into the uh fish pond in japan and
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:52.320]  then the next photo the the japanese guy jumped in dumped in all the fish food so they're just so
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:58.000]  desperate uh and mike pence is another one they can they're beside themselves to try to kind of
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.880]  demean him and discredit him what is mike pence done at all a vice president doesn't do anything
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.000]  he's just a placeholder so it's really it's because they can't go after trump and they're gonna
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.880]  go after his number two so it's kind of shocking to watch and it's kind of hysterical given their
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.360]  tone it'll be one thing if they were saying everything calmly peacefully president trumps this
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.200]  president trumps that but the apoplexy is something very unprofessional and kind of hilarious so let
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:30.000]  me ask you this because we got off of the north korea thing what are they gonna do is trump continues
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:37.840]  to succeed it looks like uh i i remember at cnn when this meeting came out they had to find a
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.480]  way to spin it as bad they said two months isn't gonna be enough for trump to get ready for this
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.600]  meeting with north korea are you telling me they're having plans in place since clinton
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.440]  for meetings with north korea from the state department they haven't had dozens of plans
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:57.920]  all index and re-indexed and hundreds of experts lined up ready yeah i mean how is that even conceivable
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.440]  that there aren't backup plans for every possible meeting with every world leader that these bureaucrats
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:07.920]  that's the one thing they're good at they're gonna have those files of what to do in these situations
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.040]  so they don't know what to say they were very anti-war during the bush years and now somehow
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.600]  they have to be pro-war which goes in some way against their nature and it's just they would
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.840]  always lie and say trump was never against the wreck war i have the three clips all of them phone
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.480]  interviews on fox and cnn from months before the war saying it's a bad idea we shouldn't go in
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.920]  the only thing that matters to me is that trump and the administration is against war with korea
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:37.200]  and that is what he is against and that is what everyone should hope for a peaceful resolution
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.600]  to this horrible regime yeah i think they're gonna get a deal and i agree kim jen may try to back
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.200]  out of it later but they can just end that war that's better for everybody and try to get some
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.000]  help into those people michael malice thank you so much god bless we'll be back with david knight
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.560]  in studio the latest on the bombing and communist china's big announcement i've got to get to this

[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.800]  joplin missouri is set to get a check for 24 thousand seventy five dollars if dug can do this
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.760]  i've got a hunch that you can too but here's the thing if you want the chance to grab your full
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.400]  fair share of this 34.6 billion dollar payout you must have your ducks in a row by april first so

[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.960]  dollars instead of 39 dollars 50 off because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.880]  micho zx now it's the other side of the equation everybody thinks about probiotics and how great

[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:35.120]  importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help displace yeast mold creates slime walls
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:41.120]  and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there it causes all sorts of
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.040]  psoriasis well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:38.000]  powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency they want
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.880]  to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you

[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.640]  get his take as a fellow austinite on the fourth bombing last night uh that injured two men it was
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:03.680]  in a nicer area by some green belts the police think that the bomber sources is getting to these
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.520]  places without being observed using the green belts so we're going to break that down we're
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.600]  also going to get his take on the mark of the beast and that's what this is you know if the
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.800]  mark of the beast came and nobody made a big deal about it would would would be put into place even
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:22.080]  if you don't believe the devil a worldwide planetary government that can control your political
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.760]  activity your cultural activity your breeding everything your biology according to a score
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.040]  that integrates in every fast of your life through the internet that is called the master
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.640]  plan of control envisioned over 2 000 years ago in the isle of patmos so what's happening we'll
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.120]  talk about that with david night in the next segment it's a big deal china demand citizens
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.400]  with bad social credit rating from taking flights or using trains to up to a year you knew it was
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.920]  coming and this is the model and david's been to china he's an engineer one of his daughter
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.960]  is adopted from china so he can say a lot about what a truly hellish place that is paul watson
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.480]  was married to a chinese woman traveled there many times and he said it is even the nicer areas
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.000]  you'll be you'll see dead bodies people don't help each other it is it is hell on earth in many areas
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.000]  so that's what we're up against ladies and gentlemen that's been chosen as the worldwide model
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.480]  so that's what facebook twitter they're all incrementally bringing us into this
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.760]  right now but before i go any further ladies and gentlemen if you don't buy the products
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:30.080]  we will not be able to fund this operation and it's just that simple and yes we're getting a
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:36.640]  lot of new affiliates uh the houston affiliates tv and radio we're also on cable there for years
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.360]  on phonoscope doing a great job on basic cable so thank god for those folks be sure and support

[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:52.480]  the persecution has caused us to get more amenathem stations and tv stations but all these lawsuits
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:58.000]  fall with the globalists can and will be defeated they are frauds out of hand but it'll take money
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.720]  it'll take time and so you spreading the word you buying the products that is the cure for this so
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:10.160]  we have the new super blue product that is a spray bottle of high quality i9 and a very special

[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.200]  sold out for months now reformulated to be stronger and for a lower price i had to sign
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:05.040]  a year purchase order on this uh matching about what we bought last year but i was able to drive
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:11.360]  down the price about 30 percent and get more of the organic compounds in each capsule and it's
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.800]  it's four or five big regimens for your guts uh this is the other side of the equation for probiotic
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.400]  we sell great probiotics as well the biome defense and others that are the highest quality we can get
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.680]  thousands of reviews uh for the products uh the new myco zx plus already has a bunch of reviews

[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:41.040]  dollars this is 24 73 when you sign up for auto ship in additional 10 percent off regular
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:47.920]  discounted price right now 50 percent off 27 48 and let me tell you it knocks out the candida
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:53.040]  the mold the fungus they create these slime walls and then it creates this takeover in your body
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.840]  bad bacteria then live in symbiosis with it uh well this this is designed to knock that out
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:03.040]  a healthy good way for your body uh and dramatic results go read the reviews uh ladies and gentlemen

[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.240]  but again that's the strizan effect they're trying to smother us trying to block us online
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:23.680]  and everybody else at the same time because we're kind of the lead dog in the fight or the lead ship
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.960]  we're going through some mutations here growing getting pushed back but but overall we're having
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.760]  victory for the average person you're being censored the action then is more talk more
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.640]  talk radio more calling into csp and more action online more tweeting more facebooking
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.200]  more reaching out more physically demonstrating more taking action so thank you all for what
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.480]  you're doing we're in this together and i salute you uh david night you live here in austin we all
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.040]  got these alerts about you know stay in your house very dangerous situation this is a mile and
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:58.000]  a half you know from from where i live uh near the warehouse we had bombings last week bombings
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.360]  before that um i just wanted to get you on to give us your take looking at this and in
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:08.720]  any patterns you see the way it's being handled what your gut thinks is going on here yeah this
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.000]  one that went off last night or early this morning wasn't too far from where we lived when we first
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.160]  moved here and uh you know what we saw alex was the beginning of the month march 2nd we saw bomb
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.960]  go off killed one uh black man 39 years old then uh 10 days later on the 12th we had two bombs go off
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.920]  we had a young black man 17 years old and his mother he was killed his mother was critically
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:37.600]  injured and then that same day we had a 75 year old hispanic lady who was critically injured
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.880]  they said well it looks like they're targeting racial uh neighborhoods and so forth and that
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.040]  those bombings that happened on the 12th they were relatively close to each other the one that
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.560]  was on the 12th was a bit further north uh not too far away now yesterday we had one that was on
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.960]  kind of the western side of austin it was an area that i'd say is a white middle class upper middle
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:05.120]  class and uh so now these two individuals that were hit with this bomb are not black they'd
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:10.560]  the police chief had been saying well i think it's a racial issue now that doesn't look like
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.120]  that's perhaps the case this is a different type of bomb and although the police chief
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:19.760]  said that it was uh the detonation was different he said there were some similarities but then he
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.920]  said it's a different level of skill so is it a copycat yeah is it a copycat i i don't really
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.440]  know i mean i they've got uh 500 or more people that are looking at this not only from the local
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.800]  police department but from the fbi atf and so forth uh all we see is something that doesn't
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.800]  really look like a discernible pattern even what changed today was even the type of bombing that
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:49.360]  is there so it's it's a real tragedy when anybody dies i i know when that uh 17 year old uh young
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.200]  black uh boy was killed he looked like a model student i mean it's a real tragedy when somebody
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:01.040]  that young dies it's a tragedy when somebody and it's so senseless yeah like i'm not going to kill
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.360]  anybody but if i am it's going to be an enemy or to defend myself why would you just randomly
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.400]  and a lot of times we know the criminology i'm not saying that's what it is but a lot of times it's the
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.520]  occult uh like the zodiac killer and others they do these codes you know maybe it's going to be
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.200]  you know the bombing in the shape of a skull or a guy trying to recreate fight club with with
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:24.960]  bombs going off make a smiley face right i mean who knows you know you look at a situation like
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.760]  this so we've got hundreds of people looking at this and and you know not to make light of this
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:37.040]  but i know who did it is putin oh when we look at i mean seriously though every election they
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.200]  don't well putin did putin did do what he did yesterday well yeah that's right he just wanted
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.320]  russia but i was talking earlier today to william f jasper the new american on on the morning show
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.160]  i was watching and uh we were talking about china and i find it interesting that whenever
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.640]  president trump talks about the trade war that has been created against the united states this
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.080]  isn't talking about a new trade war we've had a trade war against us for decades it was launched
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.640]  by the globalist and our media won't talk about it all trumps doing is equalizing well whenever
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.920]  trump talks about trade tariffs to equalize things that we pointed out the tariffs on automobiles are
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:18.400]  four times greater for american cars going into china than they are for chinese cars coming into
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.440]  america and we're talking about europe it's a fourth time differential and they call that free trade
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.680]  them gang raping us that's right i said there's and our own media won't tell the public that
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.840]  there's no such thing as free trade we've said all along when we talk about as libertarians we
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:37.360]  talk about uh socialism we say there's no such thing as free lunch there is no such thing as free
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.760]  trade when you got thousands of pages of this stuff when you got a four to one or a ten to one
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.760]  differential well you know i'm glad you bring this up because those are the facts and you can see
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.040]  trump he's not even retaliating when they keep lowering things like their taxes to zero he just
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.920]  puts a 50 percent tax on a few things in fact he's not even meeting him he's just doing a little bit

[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.560]  our president i look at trade policy i mean i look at the actual numbers and they all these are so
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:04.160]  called libertarian tank tanks we call ourselves libertarians in the general philosophy david
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.120]  i know i don't speak for you because i've heard you say it many times you know you've got the
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.160]  twitter account at libertarian but the kind of the corporate libertarian says oh free trade free
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.600]  trade well that means china's got a zero tax we've got a 40 or that means china you know like you
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.400]  said charges three four five times depending on type of car to let ours in and we let them just dump
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.880]  them on us for nothing same thing for europe it's not free us grabbing our ankles and making it where
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.680]  we can't have any manufacturing and there's not even a close level playing field is not
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.920]  for your fair and so you made the point we're already in a trade war the globalist did it we've
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.120]  been in the damn thing for 50 years and it's deindustrialized doesn't the globalist said
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.520]  to make us more interdependent it wasn't fair that america had half the world's wealth it was we had
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:54.240]  to redistribute it but it wasn't the poor people it was the mega banks to own slave factories in
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:49:00.640]  china and leverage out the middle class this is a war on the middle class it is a conscious move
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.480]  to global feudalism and i've had top elites and congressmen and others on they concur this is by
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.760]  design day to night and you know when i was talking to uh william f jasper today the new american we
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:17.600]  were talking about the recent moves by the uh chinese president to consolidate power to stay in office
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:23.120]  forever and to set up these social credits which is really kind of a testbed for what they're going
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.840]  to do here in america but i found it interesting as we're talking about this i said look you got
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.720]  putin who just rigged an election uh you know that the russians actually did rig the russian
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:39.520]  election folks that that is true but they blame him for everything and anytime trump even or anyone
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:46.000]  talks about easing the cold war that they've restarted everybody erupts but they don't do
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.200]  that when you're talking about china if president trump talks about the trade war that's been going
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.280]  on as you point out for half a century then everybody attacks president trump you can't
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.160]  have a trade war so i find it interesting that we've got these two dictators here and they've
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.560]  got a lot that is in common but one thing that's different is that the globalists love china and
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.680]  they didn't transfer our jobs to russia they transferred our jobs to china and china is setting
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.760]  up the blueprint and the structures for tyranny here in america with the uh gender 21 then uh
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.880]  un 2030 agenda buying buying up hollywood i mean and let's say a march city's agenda this is what
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.720]  they're all behind it i went and saw annihilation every science fiction movie every drama the martian
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:34.800]  arrival the chinese are in charge yeah and because they're paying for that image i mean red flapping
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:41.360]  flags bullet bureaus i mean we you know who owns you and who runs you by the propaganda you see
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:47.920]  yeah and and and this is i'm getting chills and now with apple with facebook but apple's the worst
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:52.480]  they saw china it's totally godless totally murderous one child policy yeah we'll kill 70
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:59.120]  million of our girls you went to save one of them uh on and on and on and they're the model now so
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:04.720]  look at this they have a god in china though it's called president shijing ping oh and i
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:11.920]  love the awesomeness statesman of this weekend um you had on the cover oh his best friend uh elected
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:17.120]  vice president elected by the central committee's bullet bureau of the of the of the permanent
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.520]  communist party by a by a dictatorship of an oligarchy of a bunch of plutocrats and our own
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.480]  paper i read the whole article never said that he's dictator for life now it was like a celebration
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.200]  oh look he's wonderful see and isn't that interesting they won't call that out about china
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.680]  but they will call it out about russia i find it very interesting you know that he was elected
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.320]  the general election yeah i mean certainly they rigged it but it is kind of interesting and when
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.760]  i looked at this reason oh so you think putin rigged the election in russia yeah most likely yeah
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.920]  man he i don't know they've even got foreign groups and they say he is like messianically
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:56.560]  popular yeah oh yeah well he is popular but but look you know that is one election that he could
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.520]  have rigged but they accuse putin of rigging brexit they accuse him of rigging the election
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:06.320]  that the globe was just lost in idly everything well they say he has magical powers that's right
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:11.120]  every time they lose something it's him and when you look at this situation again here in austin
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:16.400]  we've got a series of four attacks within the last three weeks bombings we don't know what's
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:22.880]  going on people are still investigating it but in in the uk immediately teresa may knew that it was
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.720]  vladimir putin even though they have hundreds of people still investigating it you have the
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:32.000]  metropolitan police saying it's going to take us weeks or months to unravel the poisoning yeah
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.640]  the poisoning and so i think we ought to bring teresa may to austin to solve this one exactly
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:39.520]  and maybe nicky hailey too and here's what's crazy about it
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:49.280]  you look at china and what they're doing and you look at us today you will get chipped eventually
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:54.160]  it's just all you will you will and you read this this is the mark of the beast where where
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:59.760]  where you work what you do your bank account what you say and then there's these sub corporations
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.680]  home of the communist party their own media companies they have the power of the upper class
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.640]  above you to rate you and then to lower you to the point where you can't even have a job and
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.400]  you starve to death that's what they do in china or your score drops they just put you in a forced
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:17.440]  labor camp everything's tracked this is the ultimate science fiction tyranny and apple facebook and
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:23.280]  twitter say this is the model they hope to use to stop populist movements in europe
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:27.920]  when the chinese dictator visited a year and two months ago 14 months ago in davos so
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:33.440]  this is not our opinion this is here it's the globalist allied with the biggest mass murders
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:40.480]  in history with a dictator with his buddy as the vice dictator totally walked out of their minds
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.920]  with our elites merged with them and now they're rolling it out they're announcing this is the
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:49.840]  plan it's like facebook you say something about god you're banned for a day now you say something
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:53.520]  bad about hillary you're banned for a day they had and then they have the nerve to claim this whole
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:59.040]  analytical thing uh out of england which i told everybody yesterday that was bull now snowden's
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:03.680]  come out and said listen everybody has these companies and these bots everybody goes and harvest
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:09.920]  off facebook he said facebook does it to billions of people a day not five million like bannon did
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.440]  trying to get a list of conservative voters by going and data mining facebook off of publicly
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.080]  available stuff now they create this whole new controversy act like it's the end of the world
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:25.440]  because some pink haired guy had a computer program and now people only think there's data mining
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.720]  and stuff going on with conservatives when conservatives are the ones way behind they
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:35.840]  didn't want conservatives to ever try or do something like this snowden facebook a surveillance
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:42.240]  company that collects all and sells users data and snowden says exactly what i said last night
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:47.440]  when i ran it about this for 45 minutes and this whole fake controversy yeah you know when we look
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:53.120]  at what's going on here they have the fastest growing subsection of in the intelligence
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.160]  businesses geospatial intelligence they want to look at your activity they call it activity based
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.640]  intelligence they call it human domain analytics they want the metadata that is the essence of what
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.840]  they want where you go what you do how you're profiled that's right by the billions and then oh
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:15.120]  oh bannon invented it in in 2015 that that it's like james clapper it's like saying he invented
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:22.560]  the a peace shooter or a slingshot in 2018 and we already had nuclear weapons for 60 years that's
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:27.520]  what i mean the way they put these stories out is insane yeah yeah and then everybody jumps on it
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.480]  oh did you hear trump did stealing he he he he got the names of conservatives off facebook
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.080]  facebook is a democratic party globalist war machine and they don't want anybody going and trying to
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:42.800]  organize on it that's what this is about that's right it's absolutely about the metadata and
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.680]  they've been collecting that and when you look at collusion you've got to look at the intelligence
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:51.520]  agencies and their collusion with the democrats and that's what i've been saying from the very
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:57.040]  beginning is that it's about the metadata yeah they'll look at an individual that is very interesting
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:02.240]  like president trump i've played many times on the show michael hayden going to washington lee uh
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.160]  university law school and saying we're not interested in bad people we're interested in
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:12.160]  interesting people and they laugh this and that's and that's because they steal your ideas yeah they
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.040]  do it all yeah that's what they're doing but when you look at the difference between china and russia
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:22.720]  china has been used as the blueprint the great firewall of china where they censor people there's
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.200]  that clip and you can even see the the eyeball they're behind him as he's talking and imagine the power
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.160]  trip of this yeah this is the super clash able to spell everything you do illegally using it for
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:38.400]  their own corporate interests and then telling us we've got to sit there and accept it all and then
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.600]  if steve bandon tries to go get five million names of conservatives so he can try to organize them
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.560]  that's the newest fanciest thing ever and no one ever heard of it when it's just standard 20-year-old
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:53.120]  technology you know when when you look at where this is going they start out with the censorship
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.280]  and we're seeing that now rolled out in the united states but the next thing that's coming is economic
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:03.520]  censorship yeah the giving you a trustworthiness rating and one of the quotes that they said was
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.880]  and this is coming from the chinese communists wants untrustworthy always restricted what are
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.880]  they restrict they restrict your movement they restrict your employment abilities and so forth
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.880]  and we've said this is what's coming with agenda 21 the un 20 and this creates this total panopticonic
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.240]  surveillance thing and once you submit yeah they can always raise the bar that's right to cult like
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:31.120]  levels of a new religion worshiping your digital score it's it's 50 trillion light years worse than
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:35.840]  the yellow stars on the jews and the ghettos that's right because this is your kids and everybody
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.120]  you're gonna want to access their friends they're gonna want to get to go to the concert they're
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.080]  gonna want to get on the plane and they're gonna say come on dad take the brain ship man get get
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.760]  the upgrade you can go to Honduras we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:55.520]  together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:00.720]  us through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:07.120]  and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:12.080]  are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war it is a classical
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:17.760]  360 win this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:23.040]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.840]  to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.920]  patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:39.040]  remnant of america to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.040]  as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world now
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:49.120]  it's time to change our bodies with z-field and in full wars life dot com it's been sold out for
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:56.160]  months and now it's back it's michael zx plus lower price more ingredients because we scaled up
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:02.800]  signed to your contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer scalability but now
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:10.000]  we're able to go at 50 off to $27 instead of $39 50 off because there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.240]  of ingredient michael zx now it's the other side of the equation everybody thinks about probiotics
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:18.960]  now great they are for your gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides but more
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:24.880]  importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help us place yeast mold creates slime walls
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:30.880]  and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there it causes all sorts of
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.680]  serious issues well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:40.800]  to destroy that slime wall don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late pick
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:46.320]  up a bottle of the new and improve michael zx plus now from the info wars store
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:53.360 --> 02:00:05.760]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:17.360]  pastor rodney howard brown one of my favorite pastors powerful individual uh was spirited
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:22.800]  is going to be joining us getting into prompt delivering on so many fronts and where we go from
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:28.320]  here and what we can do spiritually really getting our knees for god because let me tell you i'm a
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.880]  christian i've had a personal relationship with christ i've had spiritual experiences both good
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.480]  and bad i've seen the dark side and i wasn't looking for it uh but you got this worldwide
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:42.640]  market the beast china saying you can't buy or sell you can't travel without it you were getting
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.920]  into it david where your own family's going to pressure you wanting access so just like a telephone
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.520]  but now the telephone's going to break in in the middle of what you're doing because the computer
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.840]  is listening to it and not let you talk if you say what it doesn't want to hear that's what is now
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:01.840]  actually happening the power of these tools and it's being deployed in our own western elites that
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:06.400]  invented all this are merging with communist china and again china has announced a mark of the beast
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.680]  system and us today's like great let's accept it let's take brain chips it's going to be utopia
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:17.920]  except for people running things aren't utopians they're monsters that's why china has been given
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:23.440]  a pass why they are not criticized why they are defended even when we talk about the disparity
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:27.600]  on trade they all don't start a trade war but they want to start a cold war at the same time with
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.600]  russia and so we look at these uh these two dictatorships here and we understand that
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.880]  what they're doing in china is they're using it as a test bed they want smart cities here
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.880]  they want to make sure that you have to rely on the government whenever you want to go anywhere
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:44.880]  you're not going to own your own car you won't be allowed to travel in the city nothing's repairable
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.520]  there's no no no fixture everything's designed to take you out of the equation that's right that's
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.360]  right and as i said many times you when we look at the military what do they say you control a
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.760]  population if you control the way they move the way they communicate and the way they shoot well
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.040]  they've already got no guns in china they already control the way they communicate they're ratcheting
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:08.960]  that down with controls social media scores and so forth their communication they have a great
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.400]  firewall of china to prevent any information from coming in and the next thing is to control the
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.960]  way they move and they're gradually moving into that from the communication control they come in
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.960]  and take a look at everything that you're doing they rate you and then they use that to control
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.200]  your movement as well as your employment by the way i hadn't seen this stunning bloomberg headline
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.960]  he's the type of crowd that says he wants to control everything and shut down free speech put
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.680]  that back on screen please and print that that is massive i've never seen such an orwellian
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.800]  headline because it's true but it's in your face but it's written like it's not bad welcome to 2018
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:46.720]  the year of censorship of social media you're like well that's bad no the limitations of
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.560]  selective censorship it's not enough you see yeah and the need for better regulation will soon be
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:59.040]  apparent they are using us as the blueprint to lie about who we are shut us down and everybody else
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:06.800]  and there it all is it the decision has been made this is the fight for the first amendment and you
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:10.720]  know our lawyers have talked to the ACLU and others they go no we totally agree Alex Jones didn't say all
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:16.720]  this it is to overturn the first amendment but they said we're scared we're scared Soros money all
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.800]  this what are we going to do we can't wait this is happening and but there's a fight in the ACLU
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.640]  right now and all these other groups we don't need their help it's good to have amicus briefs
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:30.640]  we're now to the moment where they're like are we going to just in for speech i mean America is now
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.960]  at that point well it's also we we can see this in another way Alex when we look at what's going
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:40.880]  on with cryptocurrency we've had first we had facebook come out and ban ads about cryptocurrency
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  initial coin offerings and so forth then it was followed a couple weeks later by google and just
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.960]  recently we had twitter do the same thing and now it's down over a hundred billion yeah would they
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:54.880]  go always go to these three to enact their controls so whether it's enacting the controls
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:01.520]  against political speech and debate ah they go to twitter youtube facebook whether it comes to
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.640]  trying to shut down cryptocurrencies because they perceive that as a threat as well go to the same
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.520]  three people to enact their control and so the answer is everybody exercise your free speech
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:15.200]  everybody realize it's like exercising you don't do it you're dead that's right everybody's
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:21.520]  got to make a list i call this talk show i call and c span i hand out some flyers uh i start my
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:26.240]  own youtube my own facebook or my own website drive trap we've all got to use the big platforms to
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.880]  drive to our platforms like drudge warned but it's here and and they told drudge a few years ago
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.280]  would already be done we've held them back so at least we're struggling but this is it drudge
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:40.160]  said these different structures the social media structures are ghettos they want to get you into
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  the ghetto and then they're going to surround you just like they did at the war saw ghetto it's a
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.560]  formula in every culture in history first you censor them then you cut off their economics then
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.960]  you compact them then you demonize them then you ship them off to the ditch thank you david night
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:05:01.200]  we'll be right back stay with us introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:07.440]  mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy they are
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.880]  your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:18.160]  supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:25.040]  don't run at 100 efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:31.040]  that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.960]  the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.000]  the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:49.520]  species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:06:15.840]  head to info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:27.920]  i'd like to reserve time one point at this point and only the dumbest morons
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:32.720]  buying your sjw globalist george soros dropping stabilize so george
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:38.320]  emergency reserve illy clinton and the new war and michael more go back to where you came from
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:46.240]  we're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma you got that jack you're done it's over
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:53.280]  no one get him back get him back
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:10.160]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're coming to you from austin texas
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:14.960]  and we've got four bombings that have hit the last two and a half weeks
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:19.280]  one a mile and a half more i live injuring two men we've got two other dead people several others
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:25.440]  wounded um no motive the bombs more sophisticated than the last ones they're saying with a tripwire
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.120]  they're like a jogging trail right off the side of the neighborhood
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:36.720]  we've got democrat congressman two of them calling for violence and for trump to be taken out using
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:41.040]  the second amendment and we're going to play one of those clips here in a moment i couldn't
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.600]  think of a better day to get pastor rodney howard brown on he of course has a very large
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:53.040]  international outreach and also the very successful church in camp of florida and he is one of the
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:58.080]  few preachers i'm sorry to say that's a real preacher and isn't a coward because a lot of the
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:04.160]  pastors is they take easter off of the apple listings and and out of their calendars and
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:07.920]  is all over the u.s and all over europe and all over australia they say you can't say the name
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:15.360]  jesus or you can't say the name jesus is uh alive uh i mean this is the this is crazy you've got the
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:19.520]  pope who's obviously a globalist that took over the catholic church saying china is the greatest
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:24.880]  example of christianity that's a sick joke like saying anton louis is uh you know china is what
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:32.240]  anton louis wishes he was uh and so you've got all this going on in us today you will get chipped
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:37.280]  that's the headline and suddenly abc news every child will soon have a chip and i'm watching this
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:41.920]  i remember hearing preachers say this when i was 10 years old and of course now i learned a lot of
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:45.920]  those guys have been advised by people in the military intelligence that were patriots and
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:50.560]  they all knew what they were talking about and now china we first reported this five years ago
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.360]  has a social score tied to everything you do your bank account your job what you sell the street
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.200]  and all these companies report on you and then if it lowers you can't fly you can't train you
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:08.080]  can't have a job you starve to death that is the mark of the beast and so on how about that with
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:14.480]  the pastor just where we are uh and prophecy being fulfilled china demand citizens with bad social
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:20.080]  credit ranking from taking flights or using trains for up to a year well facebook one of my
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:23.200]  friends runs one of the largest facebook's out there he's not ready to go public yet
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.320]  because he actually he basically worked for facebook must leave it that as a contractor
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:34.720]  and he said this is a test he doesn't put you know religious stuff out he put the word god
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:44.640]  in a post and they blocked his facebook for a day he sent me screenshots and then this is a facebook
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:51.360]  way bigger than ours way bigger than i mean and then these are people that are more i don't
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:55.840]  want to say agnostic but not and they're going wow that's really going on let me do it it's like whoa
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.640]  whoa and these are people you know that have dinner with the facebook guys so it's an algorithm
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:04.320]  and it's in place and i was thinking about all this censorship of easter coming up
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  and the tens of thousands of lawsuits against churches and 501c3s and everybody and just a
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.280]  persecution and if the church would just stand up and say no it would all back off but instead
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.800]  they glitter bug around and try to cover their butts and wonder why the pews aren't full people
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:23.680]  are looking for god they're looking for energy looking for the truth they're looking for christ
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.080]  that's where we are so that's my five minute rant he's with us for the rest of the hour
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.760]  so much to cover it makes my head spin that we are here hearing that apple and google and twitter
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:38.000]  are going to adopt this global social score even the new york time says it's coming here
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.960]  they're like oh great it'll censor conservatives where your plane tickets cost more at first or
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.720]  you can't whatever or you get searched or next you can't fly and people like well we better
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.480]  shut up no we better say something this is all prophecy being fulfilled and whether you believe
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:58.240]  in god or not they're manifesting it folks i mean they're using it as a blueprint and this is a
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:01.760]  spiritual battle because the globals can go out of their way to do evil even if it helped them
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.680]  personally it's a spirit of wanting to dominate us so we're going to break in five minutes you've
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:09.600]  got the floor you've got your new book killing uncle sam book dot com uh is where people find
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.840]  killing uncle sam we're going to get that uh uh tear that in our store if we can we're going to
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:18.080]  talk about it at the bottom of the hour but first just the justalt i've laid out pastor of where we
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:26.560]  are and the church and all of this uh pastor rodney howard brown of re v i v a l dot com
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:32.320]  and killing uncle sam book dot com thank you for joining us hey it's good to be on with you again
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:39.120]  today alex uh as as always you slamming it up the side of the head which um you know we are in the
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:45.360]  final hour uh really as i always say that the final grains of sand are slipping through the hour
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:51.520]  glass and many people are asleep of course this was not something that just happened five or ten
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:56.880]  years ago there's been a whole plan obviously for the destruction of america which we'll talk about
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:01.520]  that we talk about in the book and a lot of what you and david night would talk about just before
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.000]  i came on the air is actually there's a whole area in the book that we actually talk about but
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:12.160]  the the body of christ has to stand up first of we have to pray last night we had a three hour
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:17.520]  prayer meeting at the church praying exactly over these things and really asking god for divine
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:23.120]  intervention and the church has to get radical that people of god have to get radical there are
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:28.400]  many elements even what you are facing in austin right now which they can say that i know the
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:34.000]  motive beyond is terrorism it's basically terrorism and what they're trying to do is create anarchy
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.080]  and it's all about control it's all about bringing everything under control i would say communists
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.600]  and anarchists are the prime suspects this is their mode totally well we see that where i come from
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:48.240]  in south africa that's what they're doing now with total bloodshed and then we stand on the
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.760]  brink of a civil war i just got back from southern africa but so yeah i've been in america now 30
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:58.880]  years and i'm watching the total demise of the country basically because people are afraid to
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:04.000]  speak out when we have a thing i would like to do a trip on fire and trump is desperately trying to
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.040]  write the ship and these globalist gremlins are trying to stop us totally but let me tell you we
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.400]  have to pray for the president he's a wrecking ball to the system and i'm you know somebody said oh
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.240]  you fired this one i said fire all of the bums up there just fire the ball i mean basically this
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:26.640]  thing is so far gone that without divine intervention we're not going to see a recovery so the church
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.840]  has to pray the body of christ have to pray and then everybody has to ask god what do you want me to
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.560]  do as in the case of you alex you're doing everything you can and more and each person every person
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:44.400]  listening or watching right now you have to ask god what can i do you cannot just listen to info
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:47.920]  wars you can't just listen to what's being said you're right we have to call on god because i'm
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.160]  meant to say this i have never seen the enemy's assault and i'm not worried about that the assault
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:58.000]  financial or media but the spiritual assault i can see it like agent smith you know in the
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.960]  matrix jumping into people i mean it's really the evil is really showing its teeth right now
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.960]  it's beyond imagination what's taking place and then the deception is at an all-time higher
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:13.360]  so that people don't even want to believe the truth so no matter what many times you say
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.240]  these things and they're all documented everything's documented they said now we're making it up it's
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:24.080]  you're just making it up they don't understand how our education system was taken over 100 years
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:32.400]  ago and standardized of education even the seminaries alex were taken over by uh the rocker fellers
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:39.680]  used fosdick out of new york to basically uh dumb everybody down question the virgin birth
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:44.560]  question the cross question the blood question the resurrection so you got all these kids coming
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:49.120]  to seminary they're all on fire they want to serve god and in three months they're totally
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:54.160]  neutralized they're totally neutralized they didn't believe in the cross the virgin birth and all this
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.720]  was a plan to destroy the churches so now you've got pastors and the pulpits that are afraid to
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.840]  speak out because of the nonsense they won't even say the name jesus that's the new thing facebook
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:08.960]  twitter google advertisements in newspapers they're telling churches in australia don't say jesus on
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:15.760]  your sign i mean it's here it's here i've already i've already heard people doing like a conference
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.720]  where they were trying to talk to pastors and they said look don't talk about the blood of jesus
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.680]  don't don't use the word blood it's like offensive to this generation it's the it's the most craziest
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.680]  stuff that's going out there but let me just say this on the plus side there is an army out there
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.080]  and here's what the globalists are not planning on stay there i want to hear about this with pastor
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:41.280]  ronnie howard brown is on fire when we come back but folks it's it's true the enemy hates the name
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:47.520]  jesus and they hate god because it's the truth that and it's it's real they want a world government

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:41.360]  man that is a good looking book i can't wait to read it the killing of uncle sam and we're
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:46.640]  going to be talking about it with the author pastor rodney howard brown killing uncle sam
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:54.720]  book.com and i'm kind of hysterical here just because it's all happening world government digital
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:21:01.120]  system that tracks everything you do to buy and sell to use it for total control massive censorship
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:06.880]  bombs going off where i live um just craziness but also as he was saying as we went to break
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:13.360]  a lot of good things are happening there's a huge ovationing and evil doesn't go on forever
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:18.400]  so i can play the new south african president saying we're going to take the whites land
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:22.480]  i can play the defense minister saying we're going to kill all the whites the leader of the
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:27.840]  communist saying the same thing it's just so sad to see this that's another subject and that's what
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:33.840]  i mean there's so much so pastor start wherever you'd like i'm just making the point that we are
[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:41.600]  in a momentous time and thank god praise god promises being fulfilled so we do know that this
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:48.640]  is that that that evil doesn't get away with this forever no and there's an army that that's god
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:53.920]  is raising up and i you know i've traveled 59 countries so you know there are people that
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:58.720]  are totally dumbed down the end the system but there's a group of people that are rising up
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:02.880]  alex that's why what you're doing is important and let me just say this about the book i'm
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:07.520]  going to work a plan and send you a bunch and you can you can sell them i don't want any money for
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:11.680]  it i'm going to show that to you i'm going to bless you with that for you sir for the info wars
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.240]  yeah and and because i don't even get a royalty from this it goes to our school of government
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.800]  but we got to wake people up to what's going on here but the fact is that there's an army of people
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.000]  that that god is actually raising up not just in america but all around the world and i want to
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.520]  say this to facebook and twitter and all these things there's a new system coming i already know
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:36.320]  there's a new system coming that facebook and twitter will go the way of myspace because you
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:41.440]  cannot listen people are innovative people have come up with plans already i already know of
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:46.480]  a plan i'm listen i can't say too much right now but there's a brand new system coming out
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:51.440]  that's going to bypass all of this structure so while they're trying over here there's another
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:55.440]  the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.720]  against him and so here's what the globalists have not taken into consideration they think
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:07.520]  that the holy spirit is not here the holy spirit is the third person of a godhead he's omnipresent
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:13.280]  he's omnipotent and he's omniscient that means he knows everything he's everywhere and he's all
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:19.840]  powerful and he is moving around the earth today and he's touching people whether being china
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:26.720]  russia or southern africa or in america people are not there there's those that are asleep but
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:31.760]  there's people that are awake and there's people that are on fire and there's people that that are
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:37.200]  on the cutting edge which i believe will create the new systems that will set the globalist agenda
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:42.480]  back already elix they should have been at a certain point by the year 2000 you know for a fact
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.120]  so they're 18 years behind their plans that's why they're so frantic that's why they're running
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:50.640]  around like a chicken when they hit up dog that's why they're trying to get us to go to war with
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:57.840]  china in north korea iran syria russia they want war the dogs want war and they and people have no
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:03.280]  clue that's why they're trying to make russia to be the big enemy of everything right now no the enemy
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:09.120]  is not what people think the enemy is this system that's actually manipulating the nations of the
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:13.920]  earth trying to take south africa the way of venezuela right now and actually fact they want
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:19.200]  america to be like venezuela that's why you see these bombs going off in austin texas i mean
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:24.560]  as it is to this day we still have not found out i know personally and i won't say on the air what
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:32.320]  went on with las vegas but people it's all obfuscation it's all lies it's all manipulation and it's
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:38.480]  all to create anarchy and terror and so that people would just say you know hey take take our freedoms
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:43.120]  from us we'll give over our guns like these idiots turning in their guns to the police departments
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.760]  as though that that's going to stop the problem you know if we get rid of the second amendment
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.080]  then nobody will shoot each other well it's the same thing with with with jihadis and trucks or
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:58.080]  people with bombs it's evil the problem is evil and mental illness and craziness just as good as
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.600]  increasing evil is increasing right now we see those two forces rising correct and i mean you
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.640]  look at london the stabbings or through the roof now people are not safe basically anywhere
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:15.520]  in in the city of london so look but on the on the plus side with the church must pray and everyone
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:21.440]  must ask god what do you want me to do and i and i will say this to every listener every viewer
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.560]  if you ask god say what do you want me to do just one thing give me one thing you want me to do with
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:32.640]  my life not just earn a living not just live nicely with your family and go to drink coffee and
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:39.680]  watch a movie in it no what are you gonna do to impact other people around about you for the better
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:46.000]  because yeah here's the fact alex a hundred years from today when we are on the other side in eternity
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.120]  and we look you and i look at each other we want to look at each other and say we did everything
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.880]  that we could we did everything that we could and we left nothing on the table you know i often
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.680]  tell the church this in the story of steven if you know steven yes there was a deacon and the
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:08.480]  book of acts the bible talks about him how he was stoned uh and basically i mean his whole life
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.360]  was really short lived and he's the one that said i see jesus standing at the father's right hand
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.440]  and i tell the church we don't want to get to heaven and then we tap steven on the shoulder we
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:22.640]  say to steven you know you were our hero because you were prepared to die for him and we wouldn't
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:27.840]  even live for him and i'd rather tap him on the shoulder say hey steven listen you could never
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:33.440]  have loved jesus more than me we loved him equally we loved him equally because we were prepared to
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:38.560]  do whatever and and what you're saying about china and the censorship and everything i've got i've got
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.960]  friends in india right now they said india's changed the whole way of operating every indian
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.600]  has one number one number and everything comes through that number they can buy a cell phone
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:53.040]  without that number they can't sell land without that number they can't fly anywhere tickets whatever
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:57.920]  it's already happening across india so they're using china and they're using india as the test
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:05.280]  pattern to roll out this globalist agenda for the control of mankind but again they think the holy
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:10.320]  spirit sleeping number one they think that the church is all sleeping they are not there are
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:15.280]  many people that god is raising up in this hour and people with a holy boldness that will stand
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.480]  and speak even in the face of death because we've already counted the cost alex in the line of the
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:26.560]  56 signers of the declaration independence people that that signed the declaration that lost everything
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.760]  that they had we cannot call ourselves americans and then just sit back here let them oh yeah come
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:38.000]  in take whatever in their dreams they must think that we're smoking some of the bad legalized weed
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.720]  that we're gonna step out of the way and roll over and play it well that's the thing is they think
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:49.200]  like we're like them and only care about temporal current power we we we already know the forces here
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:54.080]  we just don't want to be with that evil force we love god not that we're perfect and you're
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.800]  right as the evil rises my discernment the energy the holy ghost all of it i feel it all the time now
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.440]  i mean so strong i feel like this like you know maybe one minute a year when i was 10 years old
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:10.400]  or something now it's so strong i don't know how i'm supposed to container to control it actually
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.920]  you know that's why when we get to heaven we get a glorified body because really
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:21.600]  it's this physical body can't take too much of the the presence of god but god anoints these
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:27.280]  people to do something and there's no doubt alex that god raised you up as a voice in the south
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:32.000]  there's no doubt and you i know you have critics like i have critics and you know i care nothing
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.720]  about the critics because i only care about what god says and we have to just stand up and speak
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.720]  the truth people are gonna make up lies about everybody and they're gonna say whatever they
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:45.360]  want to say and that's fine but i'm gonna stand up in the face of tyranny we're gonna draw a line
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:50.080]  and we've drawn lines in the sand and we're gonna say absolutely you come this far but you're coming
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:53.520]  no that's right i want to talk about the book specifically when we come back stay with us

[02:31:55.440 --> 02:32:01.520]  worldwide they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:06.880]  that their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:12.960]  and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their x president to
[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:20.080]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:26.480]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:32.880]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs

[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:47.600]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies

[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:55.520]  safest place
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:03.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:05.520]  you
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:22.560]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:30.080]  pastor rodney howard brown is our guest and i've seen him on television to do about his ministry
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:33.920]  well back over a decade ago and of course he's gone to the trump pair meetings i want to
[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:37.520]  get into his book that we're going to carry by the way as i've read the reviews it's actually
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:43.440]  i haven't read it yet but i've read the reviews but but let's just get it out in the open trump
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:50.400]  never ran as mr goodie two shoes he ran on i'm going to bring back the sovereignty bring back
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:55.600]  the job stand up to globalism get the irs off the church's back so you have your religious freedom
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:59.600]  and yeah i'm a man and i've had some wives and all this other stuff and most of us turned out to be
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:05.120]  edited or made up or whatever but he didn't run as somebody like a Pharisee saying i'm perfect
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.360]  and then he's you know devil worshiping behind the scenes the enemy hates him
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.680]  because he's a real deal now king david was the man after god's own heart and because he really
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.960]  repented when he did bad things he had his best friend sent off to a impossible suicide mission
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.480]  because he was lusting after his wife now i'm not here to defend trump on every front if he
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:29.680]  just said he was mr goodie two shoes and then this stuff came down i would have issues uh and you
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:34.560]  know i i'm not involved you know some of them i'm not that wild i'm a you know the point is in a
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.960]  lot of it's not true but the fake church that doesn't care about communist china killing
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:42.720]  christians for their organs and doesn't care about the pedophile rings doesn't care about the
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:47.600]  devil worship doesn't care about radical islam grooming thousands of girls per major town in
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:53.280]  in england and allowed to do it those silent cowards that sit there while the communists run
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:58.800]  around and you know do all the stuff they're doing they then know we have morals it's like the devil
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:03.520]  they come as an accuser and they go you're president they said this they said that hey
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.560]  trump has those issues to deal with between himself whether it's true or not and god
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:13.200]  and his wife and all the rest of it but the way the enemy with all their corruption all
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:17.280]  their evil and wine steam reportedly raping women and all this and then trump and something
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:24.720]  consensual decades ago or or his wife you know in a in a in a nude spread 20 years ago before he
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:29.440]  he was his wife that becomes the issue with these with these really evil people that are
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:34.800]  consciously evil so i'm not running from trump when these type of things that cnn brings out with
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:40.560]  all their lies and all their deception i'm just pointing out that the enemy hates trump he's
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:45.360]  telling the truth on his policies he's doing what he said he would do when we've had decades of the
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:50.640]  opposite and the enemy hates him and my gut says supporting pray for him i don't worship him as a god
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:55.760]  i don't put him up on a pedestal but i can see when the enemy is trying to quote scripture at me
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:00.640]  and tell me to abandon the president for hillary clinton uh and and and epstein and the lolita
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.960]  express and all the crap they're involved in in pedophilia and allister crowley stuff and all of
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.320]  it that's documented so the media won't cover allister crowley and and and and john pedesta and
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:15.040]  spirit cooking and all the confirmed stuff they'll tell me all day about trump and some woman in
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:22.080]  hotel room 12 15 years ago from a lying deceiving media my whole point is how does a christian
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:29.360]  then juxtapose all this pastor oh i mean god uses ordinary people i mean you just have to read the
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:35.280]  bible writes through from genesis through god uses ordinary people and that's where a lot of the
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:40.720]  people in the church world religious sanctimonious individuals they thought they wanted a Sunday
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:45.760]  school teacher in the white house we actually didn't need one we needed a total wrecking ball
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.000]  which we got by the way and he's doing an outstanding job and i pray for him three
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.240]  times a day every time i sit down for a meal i pray for the president we pray for the president
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:37:00.560]  every opportunity we can number one and then uh we actually just did a 30 city tour one nights
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:08.160]  all across america from seattle san diego i mean los angeles i mean all across my from miami up to
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:14.640]  new york uh connecticut massachusetts and one night 30 cities the president has more people
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:19.360]  supporting him now than when he ran and that's what they're afraid about the american people are not
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:26.000]  stupid they don't they're many i say to people in every meeting how many watch nbc how many watch
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.920]  abc how many watch cnn people boo they don't watch any of their stuff and then i i mentioned the
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.800]  president for even connecticut i was talking about the second amendment connecticut i got a
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.760]  standing ovation i agree they're losing control i just wanted to get that out in the open because
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.880]  you have bill marr and all his evil sitting there you know he's always blaspheming god and all this
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.280]  saying oh look at these christian hypocrites you know trump likes women whatever decades ago
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:57.040]  he never denied anything of that the point is he's been true on delivering the policies he said
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:03.920]  that's that that that shows that he's a good man totally well look i understand he's 71 now
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:09.440]  anyway i mean people have a past i deal with people of the church they come out of prison
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.080]  people come out of mental institutions you know and then god changes their life for games of these
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:20.400]  right there at calgary correct so i don't we not we don't hold anything against people and i
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:26.160]  i believe the president is not he doesn't live like that today he's not partaking in any of that
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.720]  and uh you know i backed him before he even was president when he was still running when he took
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:37.840]  out them one by one you know with a crooked crooked lying Ted and you know little marco and all of
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:43.600]  this stuff the way that he does i'm actually getting a big bag of popcorn getting ready for 2020
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:48.880]  because um if flake tries to run or any of these people they finish they finish the president's
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:53.600]  going to demolish anybody in 2020 and that's what they can't understand he really is a powerful
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:57.600]  specimen with your discernment just looking at trump at what he doesn't know him i know him as well
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.640]  but what type of man is that i mean he really is standing up to the bullies i mean he is our champion
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.320]  totally a man's man you know they try to make up that he would run but i mean that article in new
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:14.800]  york when he jumped out of his limo to go save that person who had been attacked you know that's
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:19.600]  the president and you know he's putting himself in harm's way put his whole family at risk uh
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:25.680]  basically to face the globalist agenda the lies that are out there so you know you can't support
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:29.920]  the president then back off on the president and he is a thing so somebody said oh well he
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:36.400]  he changes his rhetoric i said no he plays with the media like a cat plays with the mouse and
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.720]  what he does is he comes out over here totally out on left field and then he watches what they do
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.280]  now they let the whole thing on he never even lies about it though he doesn't he says oh i'll hear
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.080]  what they have to say even if it's this person that he didn't say that he said i'll hear them say that
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:57.120]  yeah he's just playing he's playing with the media so the media think oh well he changed
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.000]  these two he didn't change anything he's totally focused on what he's doing he knows what he's
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.280]  doing he's not stupid not an idiot and we have to pray support the president and then like i said
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.800]  earlier everybody watching or listening needs to say what do i do and then instead of people
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:18.880]  ranting and going on about stuff do something everybody can do something but um there's a
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:23.760]  whole new wave coming elix i think it's going to hit here the next month or two or three uh with
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:29.600]  the whole new system that's coming out that's going to set the agenda exactly just like the old
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:37.680]  system we have never gotten a hundred affiliates in just a couple months u hf v hf cable radio big
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:46.400]  stations big cities houston san Antonio uh manhattan all their censorship was like suddenly the green
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:52.320]  light where all these big stations put us on and so exactly for every attack there another door opens
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:58.080]  totally totally there's such a hunger out there people want to know the truth and because they're
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:03.360]  not hearing it from many circles the moment you stand up they know in the gut there's a problem
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:08.640]  and so when a person stands up and tells them they go ah and they connect all the dots um

[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:18.640]  in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:24.080]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:30.320]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.840]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:41.040]  not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.240]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses

[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.400]  well so you got cut off by the break start over because why this book is so important documenting
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:49.520]  where we are pastor all right so basically what we did we started just with the money because
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.640]  basically the whole premises followed the money so when you start with sis or john rhodes you see
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.880]  he was the father of the modern globalist movement and how they really wanted to
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:04.960]  to anglicize the world and this is all about england getting america back and the way they did was
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:10.880]  when they jumped the pond they converted kanee converted the foundations took over the education
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:16.000]  system dumbed down the american people this was all done by design and we talked about around
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.880]  about the world war one they started rewriting history back so everything's documented there's
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:26.640]  over a thousand footnotes in the book so it goes right through about what took place the american
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:32.080]  roundtable the new american pilgrims the duck hunters the foundation of the federal reserve
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:36.960]  jackall island georgia then we talk about their plan for the control of the world how they their
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:43.440]  rigged elections how they fake the news back then and then we were in world war one which was the
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:48.400]  war to end all wars talk about that how america was not going to go into the war and of course then
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:52.800]  they sink the lecithania they get us in through false flag we talk about all of that how they
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:58.160]  prolonged the war and how they were making money off of war we we go through a whole chapter on
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.880]  peace and punishment the shadow government the foundation of the council foreign relations we
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.280]  talk about that extra fact at the end of the book we list all the members of the council foreign
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:11.520]  relations that was set up by british intelligence publicly again not that the british are bad
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:15.760]  they were just setting up and using the british people as their engine for their world government
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:20.560]  and the british empire as their model and then to try to take the u.s. over to create the new
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:25.520]  british empire which will be the model of this whole world government totally totally and so we
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:30.640]  go right through that we talk about a design depression how they collapsed wall street on
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:36.000]  purpose how how the whole thing was done how america was actually put into a police state at
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:42.560]  that time we talk about the occult economy we actually talk about how that the the bailout
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.680]  of the world using a the treaty of his time mother boxes actually have pictures of the box
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:53.840]  it boxes in the book and then when each box was supposed to represent 3 trillion and of course they
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:58.720]  didn't have enough gold to back it was supposed to be backed by 4800 metric tons of gold so that's
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:05.360]  when fdr then confiscated all the gold you know hey just let's take all the gold we talk about
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:09.840]  the birth of the the central bank international bank of settlements out of barcel swiss and then
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:14.880]  let me guess now we go into the world government the casual society the whole thing everything it
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:20.800]  comes right through and then we talk about how a second world war what took place there what went
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:26.400]  wrong in the second world war how things were manipulated again how they produced the plague
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  the heli will plan because remember the cia started right at the end and they were funding themselves
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.840]  through the running of drugs and they brought what they called china white they called it get a gold
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:43.840]  how they worked with the mafia out of cuba and they started targeting all of the jazz musicians
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:48.880]  in the clubs in new york we've got everything let's be clear a lot again this like the left was the
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:54.320]  kkk and all of this they're the prime group they are races they are targeting black people in my
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:59.360]  memories but the it's the democratic party the republicans are partially involved with the democrats
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:03.440]  i mean they are the head honchos of this if you look at the us alone it's incredible what they've
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:10.080]  done correct and also if you look at the story that even under reagan what was taking place in that
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:14.800]  movie with tom cruise american made you know which is based on a true story it's very powerful money
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:22.080]  yeah they were running the cia has been running a drug cartel for a long time and the vatican bank
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:25.840]  is the money laundering bank for all the drug cartel let me bring it back in the book
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:30.000]  look i don't want to get in fights with people i know a lot of catholics that are good people
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:36.400]  they have good souls i'm not a judge they love god but this pope saying communism's great open your
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:44.080]  borders he's got walls the jesuit black pope stuff he is he sounds like the most leftist
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:49.840]  hollywood person he says he doesn't like hearing about europe's christian roots we know they use
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:53.840]  blackmail with pedophilia to get him in charge and i know you were telling me some of this in the
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:59.840]  book what most the catholics i know are the biggest group upset about this pope what who is he
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:05.200]  well he should actually be arrested for war crimes was involved in operation gladio
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:10.720]  an operation condor in central south america and the reason they chose a spanish pope was
[02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:16.960]  because catholicism in central south america is losing a foothold because christianity is exploding
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:21.600]  the gospel is exploding church is exploding so they had to try to stop the bleeding that's why
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:26.480]  they chose a spanish pope but it's still that's the good news though but i mean real bible is
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:32.640]  exploding in latin america you know no question no question about it people people are done
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:40.480]  they're done with the historical lies of the manipulation of the control by some demagogue
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:46.880]  sitting up in some you know thrown somewhere speaking as god people are finding god for them
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:52.720]  for themselves so we talk about you know the the evil systems the will bank the imf how all of
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:56.800]  this stuff is done through the money system everything's controlled through the money system
[02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:01.920]  we come on down we talk about i mean i don't want to read the whole book to you yeah but we
[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:09.360]  talk about how the heli will plan you know to fund the cia basically by the continuation of drugs
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:15.760]  we talk about what's taking place behind the scenes with the with the money system how
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:21.040]  they manipulate war street they manipulate basically because of the international bank of
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:25.440]  settlements which is the bank of central banks out of barcel switzerland which has been going
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:31.440]  it actually started as a bank uh reparation bank for germany for world war of world war one and
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:36.480]  then it became the central bank of central banks but what you say with your advisors is so central
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:43.920]  because the xm bank and all this the marshal plan but also versi these emergency reorganization systems
[02:53:43.920 --> 02:53:49.040]  are the takeover of nation states in the original e u so what you're writing about is that's why i
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:53.440]  know the book for i've read it people should read it because it's the truth that is it's amazing that's
[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:58.480]  how they did this just like they want to bankrupt us to bring us to our knees totally that's how
[02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:04.160]  they reorganized china in 1913 using the same kind of same thing you mentioned south africa the president
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:09.760]  saying take the whites land the deputy president saying kill the whites and i love those black folks
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:15.920]  but the communist takeover immediately he goes right back to this as the country implodes totally
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:20.800]  and that was the plan from day one and they thought mandela was going to do it and he actually didn't
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:26.080]  but we we jump we talk about america the quota system how america had a quota system on immigration
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:31.520]  how they removed that in 65 we talk about it all all on the purpose of destroying america by
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:37.200]  diffusing what america really was made up of uh you know people coming and let's end on that
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:42.480]  right what is america because i know there were rosa crucians and i know there were masons and i
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:46.480]  know there were agnostics and i know there were alchemists and all that but there was a core
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:52.800]  was christians what happened with america uh frances bacon all that i mean how does it all the mystery
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:58.720]  of that tie together and why are they so scared of it well because america you came together 13
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:04.080]  colonies came together really because of a first grade awakening that took place under jonathan
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:09.600]  edwards and and he actually would be like an unofficial basically founding father of the
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:15.600]  united states because that's it was the preaching of the gospel that basically unified the 13
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:20.880]  colonies these were totally 13 rebel colonies they were called the black brigades because back
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:24.880]  then the protestant and catholics wore that and as you know at first the british tried to target
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:31.440]  torture assassinate pastors but they didn't back off sure which i think people back off today
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:36.240]  but let's say we but we show the whole thing of money how it's come down to the present day
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:42.080]  day the globalization of poverty how they took all the the companies we actually list all the
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:47.680]  companies that went to china went to foreign fields on purpose uh to destroy america there's
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:52.960]  a start of the world trade organization the nafta nightmare and then making a nation of takers
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:59.120]  basically destroying the african-american families by offering single as a beta test and now
[02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:05.840]  domesticating everybody totally and then getting all the men on drugs or sending them away to war
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:11.440]  so you uh the african-american family used to be like 80 percent were married and had children
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:17.280]  now they diffuse all that broke them all broke it all up so then get everybody on food stamps
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:22.880]  government aid government support and just make them a nation a group of takers and you see that
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:28.080]  taking place you see what's happening and then we talk about the road to 9 11 and we we actually
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:33.040]  talk about all the false flags that took place uh leading up and let's be clear when they say we're
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:37.600]  saying false flag we mean criminal elements working with radical islam stood down the media

[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:45.520]  gas he was finishing up with the book but just in the closing here the globalists even if somebody's
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:50.640]  not a christian they hate christianity the yellen admits persecution of christians has doubled the
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:56.240]  last decade uh the left everywhere would deny they were attacking christmas or easter now they admit
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:02.800]  they are and the minions of this don't even get me power off of it it's a spiritual thing where
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:08.720]  they'll go out of their way so it makes my faith not that it wasn't strong but i just want to make
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:15.920]  sure we all see through rose colored glasses that i'm getting it right but world government ai systems
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:21.840]  beast systems the image of the beast seen everywhere at one time by people that's television um all of
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:27.280]  this i mean this is heavy stuff and and i just want folks to like kind of stop and go listen it's not
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:32.000]  dancing with the stars or whatever that's really important that won't fulfill you this really will
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.600]  and i'm trying to fulfill people not because i'm even that good of a guy i just as my soul
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:41.840]  and the globalists think i'm an idiot that i know the knowledge i don't try to decide to use it
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:47.680]  against people that just i don't even understand why they work against their fellow humans in the dark
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:54.800]  pastor you know basically because many people feel well the problem is so big we can do nothing
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:00.640]  about it but there is everybody can do something just like you doing something just like i'm doing
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:06.080]  something and even in the last chapter we talk about some of the solutions i'll run through them
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:13.360]  quickly audit the fed produce real money end endless wars terminate the si absolve national
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:18.800]  debt because it's not ours stop university funding investigate the foundation down so
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:25.520]  downsize the government impose tariffs drain the swamp overthrow judicial tyranny uphold states
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:31.120]  rights halt immigration till we find out who's coming here and anyone who comes here with an
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:37.520]  agenda to destroy america should be sent away that's it period and we talk about the solution
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:43.520]  being another great spiritual awakening like what happened in the 1700s and the 1800s and i believe
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:47.360]  i believe alex we sitting right on the brink of that oh that's what they're scared of that's what
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:51.760]  i went what are they so scared of because i know they're scared of me and i'm not that important
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:57.360]  i've not done something yet i'm supposed to do i can tell my spirit what are they afraid of
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:02.320]  they're afraid that the gospel is going to turn everything around they're afraid that people
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:07.440]  because if we see a an awakening break up that hits the primary schools the high schools just
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:12.480]  like when you saw the kids marching you know anti guns but what if they marching for jesus they
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:16.960]  don't want that to happen then it hits the universities then it hits places of government
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:22.000]  this happened in america in the 1700s it happened in the 1800s and i'm telling you it's going to
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:27.600]  you it's going to happen again because people are desperate and all it takes is a spark one spark
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:33.920]  that's going to get the fire going and if they just knew everything they're waiting for is there
[03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:39.520]  full fulfillment empowerment discernment knowledge they just evil has even people that
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:44.240]  service have no idea what's waiting for them if they just choose christ it's all there all the
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:51.040]  answers all the it's all there everything they desire in his presence there's fullness of joy
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:56.400]  at his right hand the place is forever more so when when jesus comes into our hearts he changes
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.200]  everything he changes our way of thinking he changes our way of looking at things and and
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:06.240]  just everything the way our families are conducted the way we conduct and it's not that people you
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:11.280]  know perfect people still make mistakes but they make less of them and they become overcomers and
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.680]  they they get victory they wake up in the morning with the solution well that's what they really
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:22.640]  hate is the spirit of victory totally totally but i i'm i'm feeling it i'm feeling it's so strong
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:28.160]  elix it's about to break it's like a tsunami that's going to hit across america and the enemy can
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:32.880]  feel it that's why they're scared yeah and but there's nothing he can do about it he can't stop
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:38.080]  this one because this is god that's moving it's not about a man moving it's about the wind of
[03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:43.360]  heaven that's blowing in the final hour to bring in the great harvest of souls and jesus is coming
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:48.160]  soon and i would agree and let me tell you something if i was them i'd be afraid because i love god
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:52.960]  but let me tell you i don't fear the devil but i fear i could feel god i would be afraid if i was him

[03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:16.000]  cold and fluze and stuff but i'll get those allergies and barry's like we'll take pollen
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:21.520]  block it's your product works great for me because it's these japanese quail and they feed a special
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:25.840]  diet in france and it's been patented and documented and studied and it just creates the
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:30.640]  scan time flamethrower it's amazing and i took two of them you have to chew them and it's just
[03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:37.840]  it's quail eggs but it's a tablets concentrated and like two hours later i was 90 better i felt
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:43.680]  like i was dying this morning and they said man boss you look and i said yeah it's these allergies
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:47.040]  that's the oak they went uh pollen block and i went oh yeah my product
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:54.080]  that's what i mean we really go out and find out whatever's the best and then i'm not a pill
[03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:59.200]  popper man but when i sit there with that lazy susan in my kitchen and do the iodine and do the
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:05.280]  dna force and you know do the ultimate tumric bodies when i do all that life is great so info

[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:49.280]  nine so thank you all now i wanted to ask Gerald Salinti about this because i like Gerald i love
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:53.520]  personally when i'm on the elliptical or my own personal life i go on the youtube or whatever
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:57.680]  because i got it on the tv in my garage where i have a gym and i watch Gerald because he's a
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:01.760]  smart guy especially when he's singing or playing an instrument he does all sorts of great stuff
[03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:07.280]  but there's this new thing we don't just worship trump we don't think he's perfect but the global
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:12.960]  estate he was he's a nationalist and trying to not go the direction they want but you've got all
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:19.760]  these democratic congressmen here's just one of them this uh tom susie in in front of a city
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:25.520]  council at a town hall saying well we got to use the second amendment to take him out because he
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:33.360]  ignores the courts no he's been winning in court so this call for violence that i mean there's so
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:42.320]  many of them doing it and my 10-year-old daughter was in vermont visiting her mom she was in texas
[03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:47.760]  but they went skiing there last week and she said a guy learns i was talking to one of the sons at
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:52.400]  the ski place that i was Alex Jones' daughter he came in a full grown man got in her face
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:57.200]  and that's what i mean like where do they get these people that'll get a man on a 10-year-old
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:02.000]  girl or anti-ferral attack a woman that's who they are and now they got congressmen going
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:06.800]  we need to use the second amendment to take the president out it's like don't they get the whole
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.120]  cause and effect thing so let's play that clip and get your osalentes take on where this is going here
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:19.760]  it is there's the article dem congressman used second amendment to resist trump and uh we've
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:27.200]  had a few computer problems today that's why stuff's been hiccuping quite a bit but here it is putting
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:30.880]  a public pressure on the president and making it public which is hard to break through the news
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:35.360]  cycle and all the different things and it's probably about going to the courts as well
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:41.760]  uh and then you know i mean this is where the second second amendment comes in quite frankly
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:48.880]  because you know what if the president was to ignore the courts what would you do what would we do
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:13:01.360]  so
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:07.360]  so gerald what do you make of the current climate when history books are written where are we right
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:13.440]  now friends forecaster gerald salenta alex first of all thanks for having me on and thank you for
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:22.560]  all that you do um this has never happened in in our lifetime let's go back to the election
[03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:28.720]  you know after every election it used to be after the presidential election you may not like the
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:35.440]  person but that's our president and it's time to stand behind the president but that's not what
[03:13:35.440 --> 03:13:44.400]  happened this time the day after he was elected the headline story for example in usa today was
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:51.600]  you know president entered his office with you know 74 lawsuits or words to that effect
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:14:00.320]  and the hate russia campaign that began during the election uh under clinton never stopped
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:08.400]  and as we all know there's not one shred of evidence that proves russia had anything to do
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:17.360]  with hacking into the dnc emails total fashion right there's not one piece of evidence i believe
[03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:25.120]  i assume we conclude could you go into court with that we assume we conclude show me the evidence
[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:30.240]  we don't have any evidence then you don't have anything but again these are the same people
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:36.240]  that told us sedan was saying has weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaeda
[03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:41.360]  that's the same group just to put this into perspective and who we're dealing with so no
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:50.320]  proof but the anti russian campaign continues to go on now here this is from and again we didn't
[03:14:50.320 --> 03:14:58.320]  talk before we got on the air but this is a we're on the same page clinton recaps election defeat
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:08.080]  she's in india still crying about why she lost i mean this is over a year ago saying that white
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:18.320]  women are dumb democrats quote do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:25.360]  married white women could you imagine someone saying this do you know why hillary clinton lost
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:31.440]  because she's a disgusting human being that's why she lost and nothing to do with the russians
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:36.080]  yeah and women had discernment and said we're sure as hell not with this which

[03:20:54.320 --> 03:20:59.760]  was on and i was talking about hillary clinton and she can't get over the fact that she lost the
[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:06.320]  election i've never seen anything like this in my life you're lost could you handle it but again
[03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:15.520]  she said that democrats do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married
[03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:24.640]  white women and part of that is an identification with the republican party and a sort of ongoing
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:33.120]  pressure to vote the way your husband your boss and your son whoever believes you should so
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:41.040]  no this really stinks and again the reason hillary clinton lost is because she's a disgusting
[03:21:41.680 --> 03:21:49.440]  human being and talking about stinking if you want some fresh air and if hillary's in the room

[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:10.880]  time on hillary clinton but i want to put this into context this is from our full trends journal
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:17.360]  right after the election she keeps making this money i don't know why people would
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:23.920]  hate to read her book ago see her but she was just in india and she again this is over you're lost
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:30.720]  all right i've never seen this in my life you're lost could you get over it again the reason you
[03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:39.920]  lost is people can't stand you you're a disgusting human being hey you remember that video everybody
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:47.840]  when they asked hitlery how she felt when she found out moe mark adafi the leader of libya
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:57.200]  was killed on a war started by hitlery cement the power susan rice and backed by obama folks anyway
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:09.760]  hitlery said when they asked her how she felt we came we saw he died i can't believe why people
[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:15.200]  didn't vote for her anyway these are the facts from the trends journal this is after the election
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:22.320]  and what we got here as evidenced by polling data the myth that reactionary white working
[03:25:22.320 --> 03:25:29.920]  class men elected trump continues to be perpetuated by the prostitute media and promoted by anti-trump
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:37.360]  demonstrations that erupted following his election in fact trump received the same number of white
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:47.120]  male votes as the mittens romney in 2012 and despite hitlery clinton playing quote the first
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:54.080]  woman to be elected president gendercard since she launched her campaign in spring of 2015
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:03.920]  ready for this she received two million fewer votes from women than obama did in 2012 more
[03:26:03.920 --> 03:26:10.800]  importantly just 30 percent of eligible women cast their ballot for clinton compared to 47
[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:19.360]  percent who did not vote and some two million black voters who cast ballots for obama in 2012
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:27.520]  did not cast ballots for clinton and you know why because slick willy clinton but all those
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:36.320]  people in jail that's right you remember maybe you don't three strikes you're out yeah you remember
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:44.000]  that yeah and built the uh prison industrial complex that's why they didn't vote for you hillary
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:50.560]  again can't stand you and to say that oh women listened to their sons and their husbands and

[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:52.240]  political atheist i look at things the way they are and call them the way they are there are things
[03:33:52.240 --> 03:33:57.600]  i disagree with trump on things i agree with them on but again it's a constant attack on him and it's
[03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:03.120]  not helping us since dividing the nation and one of the ways they're attacking him is on the trade
[03:34:03.120 --> 03:34:08.000]  issue and again you only stay with the facts because that's what we do at trends journal
[03:34:08.640 --> 03:34:15.200]  trends research dot com is that we analyze facts and the facts are these real quick talking about
[03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:21.360]  the disgusting clinton's the murderer you like that yugoslav war folks huh and that one by him
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:26.240]  now maybe you like when he was bombing a rock every three days every time he get caught with
[03:34:27.040 --> 03:34:32.640]  his pants down or so to speak you know he'd be bombing away and bagged that they were bombing
[03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:38.640]  the place about every three days and again you remember madeline all bright or not all that
[03:34:38.640 --> 03:34:45.920]  bright another murderer and her saying on 60 minutes when she was ambassador is the price
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:53.040]  of 500 000 iraqi children under the age of five dead worth it under clinton sanctions
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:35:00.560]  slick willy sanctions worth it she said yes it is so again when i'm talking about clinton
[03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:06.080]  he's a disgusting human being in many different levels but the big one one of his big ones is
[03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:13.360]  the sellout america going back to trade and trades really important because that's the kind of jobs
[03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:24.640]  we have and because of the sellout we have lousy jobs and the facts are there he promised us 200
[03:35:24.640 --> 03:35:34.800]  000 jobs with nafta and we lost almost a million about 850 000 so before i continue to go on to

[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:14.000]  show you propaganda from the new york times they like to call themselves the paper of record i
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:20.320]  prefer to call them the toilet paper record because it's only good for one thing and i have to read
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:25.520]  this garbage every day by the way i'm gonna show you what we read all the time because i just want
[03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:32.080]  to find out what's going on and then i make up my own mind and decide what's fact what's fiction
[03:38:32.080 --> 03:38:37.120]  and what's propaganda and here's a propaganda headline right for you here talking again going
[03:38:37.120 --> 03:38:48.080]  back to trade trump sees trade loss by ignoring key sector you probably work in the service sector
[03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:56.000]  the seems like a safe assertion as 84 percent of private sector jobs in the united states
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:05.920]  are in service by contrast goods producing jobs like logging mining construction and manufacturing
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:16.560]  account for only 20.5 million jobs last month they go on now just remember what i said that little
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:26.880]  lowlife slimy sob murderous slick willy clinton and al gore yeah another guy born on third base
[03:39:26.880 --> 03:39:32.960]  and thought he hit a home run being nobody if his old man wasn't a senator just like the guy
[03:39:32.960 --> 03:39:42.000]  we got here in new york him andrew qualmo and his brother on cnn his old man wasn't mario wouldn't
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:49.840]  know these cats anyway going back to how they promised us service sector jobs hey isn't it
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:58.080]  great working at amazon yeah hey how's your hernia this week got no dough don't worry about it get
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:40:09.360]  a job at target hey maybe see the s no no i know how about wal-mart all right service sector job
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:16.240]  so they're going after trump because he started talking about merchandise goods and that's the
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:26.000]  way that forever they have been reporting the trade deficit not putting service into it but
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:34.960]  merchandise trade deficit because those are the jobs that pay money but now these little clowns
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:43.280]  these little propagandists who by the way sold you the iraq war oh you remember oh you forgot
[03:40:43.280 --> 03:40:50.320]  yeah the new york slime the toilet paper a record i tell you that sonam who's saying got these
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:56.480]  aluminum tubes and yellow cakes and he's gonna be baking and shipping a nuclear weapon and a weapon
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:03.200]  of mass destruction near you soon that's the new york times again distorting the fact it's the
[03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:11.920]  it's the merchandise trade deficit and that's what's been reported ever so that just goes to show you
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:21.600]  what's going on let's look at the facts now the market's down today boom bop down over 400 points
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:26.640]  you know what they're doing first they blame trump for tweeting yeah when it went down a couple of
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:36.880]  weeks ago they blamed them he was firing gary cohen gary who who cared nobody cared that's not why

[03:41:53.280 --> 03:42:02.880]  that's what this is about and there's a reason why that nothing to do with tweets don't care about
[03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:14.160]  gary cohen nope it's bigger and it may hurt a lot of the economy not only in the united states

[03:46:50.480 --> 03:46:52.560]  now from the info wars store
[03:46:52.560 --> 03:47:11.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:28.880]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:39.440]  hey great being back and great being on the alex jones show and info wars and info warriors
[03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:45.520]  thank you guys and women for all that you do anyway was talking before you took the break
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:51.040]  about where are the markets going and where the economy is going again it has nothing to do with
[03:47:51.040 --> 03:47:57.120]  trump tweets or that guy gary what's his name cohen who everybody didn't know and he's gone now
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:48:04.400]  and forgotten it has to do with interest rates and the story and the beginning of the story
[03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:10.960]  the beginning of the story is when the markets crashed and the economy was collapsing back in
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:18.080]  2008 with the panic of 08 which by the way we forecast we even took the domain name out
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:26.400]  2007 the panic of 08 the way they juiced up the economy was with cheap money
[03:48:27.440 --> 03:48:33.120]  beginning and end of story they didn't teach you about uh negative and zero interest rate
[03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:40.640]  policy and quantitative easing in economics 101 so when people say to me you know salenta you said
[03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:47.680]  this thing was going to collapse again in 2012 you're right i did but i didn't know about negative
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:53.280]  zero interest rates and quantitative easing or negative bond yields if you're over there in
[03:48:53.280 --> 03:48:58.240]  japan you buy that 10-year bond and when you cash it in in 10 years from now you're going to give
[03:48:58.240 --> 03:49:04.560]  you a lesson you bought it for hey can't make this stuff up yes they did so it was the cheap money
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:15.840]  it it's like again going back to the products that you get on info wars these help cure and
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:25.040]  prevent unlike big farmers drugs all they do is they just relieve the symptoms there's no
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:33.600]  allotropic drug on the market that cures a chronic degenerative disease and that's what this is the
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:42.640]  low interest rate quantitative easing is an allotropic drug it just relieved the symptoms
[03:49:42.640 --> 03:49:50.160]  it did not cure the problem we all know the data people listen to info wars have heard it over and
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:59.520]  over again you know it's 78% of the people living paycheck to paycheck oh yeah the 13.2 trillion
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:06.160]  dollars in consumer debt oh you've heard it all now interest rates go up how about that student
[03:50:06.160 --> 03:50:14.480]  alone dead huh i forgot about that so higher interest rates go the lower the markets go
[03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:20.720]  because the way the markets got juiced is all that cheap money went into stock buybacks and
[03:50:20.720 --> 03:50:28.880]  merger and acquisition activity tomorrow excuse me wednesday wednesday the fed's coming out the
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:35.360]  fed as courses federal is federal express your private banksters that have taken over the country
[03:50:35.360 --> 03:50:39.520]  they're going to come out with their interest rate program last december they said they're
[03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:45.360]  going to raise interest rates three times in 2018 now it looks like four and that's why you're
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:51.760]  seeing the markets go down they're very interest rates sensitive you're seeing home sales new
[03:50:51.760 --> 03:50:58.720]  home building permits for new homes new mortgage applications all going down as interest rates
[03:50:58.720 --> 03:51:06.400]  go up not only here but hey north of the border up in canada way down to as interest rates go up
[03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:12.560]  and interest rates are extremely low there anyway as they are in the united states the fed rate is
[03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:19.920]  only ranging between 1.25 and 1.50 that's nothing you count that they raised it five times since
[03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:27.680]  2015 that hardly accounts for inflation it doesn't it's below inflationary levels but yet even the
[03:51:27.680 --> 03:51:37.680]  hint of a rise in rates is bringing down the markets and the euro rose on monday that's today
[03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:44.080]  after Reuters reported that the european central bank officials are shifting their debate
[03:51:45.040 --> 03:51:55.280]  from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rate rises so the central bank club
[03:51:55.280 --> 03:52:00.960]  is one club so the united states raises rates they're going to do the same thing over there
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:06.400]  in the eu they got negative rates over there that's right you put money in the bank and you lose
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:10.960]  money actually the same thing here you're really not getting any interest when i was a young guy
[03:52:10.960 --> 03:52:18.800]  you used to get a thing called interest and they had cds but anyway that's what the markets are
[03:52:18.800 --> 03:52:27.200]  sensitive about the quantitative easing and the zero interest rate policy again it only relieved
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:34.880]  the symptoms it did not cure the disease and then you start seeing stories like this one after another
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:41.760]  this is in the financial times fed looks at lifting pace of interest rates
[03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:50.880]  bullish outlook from Powell expected a mid-stronger global growth again can the global economy
[03:52:51.440 --> 03:52:58.080]  take higher interest rates we don't believe so and we believe that if there's pressure on the
[03:52:58.080 --> 03:53:05.200]  market seriously they're going to do a reversal again this is spring time i'm in very soon like
[03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:12.320]  tomorrow right we're a couple of days and what do we have beginning of the housing season there's
[03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:18.480]  the peak season look at auto sales are ready they're going down as interest rates go up
[03:53:19.280 --> 03:53:26.160]  so now let's tie this into gold the stronger the dollar gets the lower prices gold gets
[03:53:26.160 --> 03:53:33.520]  because the higher the interest rates there's a cost of carrying gold so if interest rates go up higher
[03:53:33.520 --> 03:53:43.200]  that's more strength for the dollar full prices go down but you're raising interest rates probably
[03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:50.800]  on the euro so that'll keep the euro up where is the dollar going we believe it's going to be a week
[03:53:50.800 --> 03:53:59.280]  dollar the reason why is i believe the treasury secretary minuchin when he was in davos a few
[03:53:59.280 --> 03:54:05.280]  months ago and said the united states favors a weaker dollar that's coming out of the mouth of
[03:54:05.280 --> 03:54:12.480]  the treasury secretary trump tried to cover it up afterwards but i don't buy it i think the united
[03:54:12.480 --> 03:54:20.320]  states wants a week dollar that's good for gold so here's our gold forecast right now we're looking
[03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:32.960]  at gold trading below 13 20 an ounce 1320 dollar if gold breaks below $1300 an hour we're looking
[03:54:32.960 --> 03:54:38.800]  at another possible hundred dollar downside that's not a big downside where you consider what the
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:47.280]  upside is our forecast is gold has to go over 1385 an ounce solidify under there then move to 1450
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:57.040]  if when it really solidifies over 1450 an ounce then it's a bitcoin bounce way over $2,000 now on
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:04.320]  the other end talking about bitcoin bitcoin you had a bad week it depends on who's going to regulate
[03:55:04.320 --> 03:55:12.240]  what where when and how and the story but now it's bouncing up again over $8,000 so here's our
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:24.480]  forecast of bitcoin if bitcoin goes below $7,000 it's a big downside risk it has to stabilize
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:34.400]  over $11,000 strongly for it to move higher now i say bitcoin because bitcoin is the leader it's
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:39.360]  about third of the market of the cryptocurrency is a year ago was 80 percent of the market
[03:55:39.360 --> 03:55:45.200]  but it's still that sets the pace will there be winners and losers in there yes of course there
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:53.680]  will be but that's our forecast for it and that's what we're sticking to and as i say goodbye in a
[03:55:53.680 --> 03:56:02.720]  couple of minutes i also want to remind you about a great product that you should also consider
[03:56:02.720 --> 03:56:13.200]  purchasing and they're introducing now at info wars myco zx plus from info wars life
