[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:37.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.080]  the French are rioting all across their country over the carbon taxes that are
[00:42.080 --> 00:47.400]  going into place that absolutely hammer the poorest French and they're moving
[00:47.400 --> 00:54.200]  forward with carbon taxes again in Australia and in other nations under
[00:54.200 --> 01:00.280]  globalist control but meanwhile the average American doesn't even know what
[01:00.280 --> 01:07.960]  a carbon tax is but they know about the Cardinals and the Texans and that my
[01:07.960 --> 01:14.320]  friends is why I disdain the worship of sports so much if we were still a free
[01:14.320 --> 01:19.120]  country by any stretch the imagination it weren't being absolutely robbed in
[01:19.120 --> 01:23.360]  front of our eyes then I wouldn't care it'd be like if your wife walked in while
[01:23.360 --> 01:27.840]  you and your buddies are watching an NFL playoff game and she said there's men
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.560]  breaking in in the back and they're walking out with not just the jewelry
[01:32.560 --> 01:37.360]  and the computers and the big screen TV and the antiques they're walking off
[01:37.360 --> 01:42.840]  with our children and the dad turns wearing a sports jersey and says I
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.480]  don't care you're a conspiracy theorist that's basically the response and then
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.280]  laughs with his buddies and gives each other a high five because we're losing
[01:53.280 --> 01:59.280]  our entire society right now our country is being permanently deindustrialized
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.440]  permanently impoverished breaking us so the bureaucrats can run our lives and
[02:04.440 --> 02:11.800]  it's so sad to see it happen we've got so much news today we've got the gentleman
[02:11.800 --> 02:19.520]  joining us who got harassed by the NSA for daring to lampoon them an artist
[02:19.520 --> 02:23.600]  he's now suing them and that's made national news he's going to be joining
[02:23.600 --> 02:27.400]  us and then the journalist that first broke this story and then we broke it
[02:27.400 --> 02:31.280]  and then drudge pushed it out where it became a top story in the country but
[02:31.280 --> 02:35.160]  the person that actually broke it was Ben swan and he's going to be joining us
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.480]  later in the broadcast not so much talk about that story but a bunch of other
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.480]  big stories that the award-winning Edward R. Murrow journalist is going to be
[02:44.480 --> 02:50.120]  covering here on the transmission and the whole state of the world and where
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.400]  we're going as a society I think we should create and and I think it should
[02:55.400 --> 03:00.040]  be a hundred thousand dollar prize a year if I can continue to bring in the
[03:00.040 --> 03:04.600]  capital to do things like this a hundred thousand dollar
[03:04.600 --> 03:11.800]  radigan award for the MSNBC host that blew up on air and said it's all a fraud
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.000]  we're being bankrupted by design it's financial impoverishment we're being
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.680]  stripped mind by offshore mega banks emergency emergency emergency Dylan
[03:20.680 --> 03:26.480]  radigan and then they fired him and I think there should be a Dylan radigan
[03:26.480 --> 03:32.640]  award for $100,000 a year you have Peabody's you have Pulitzer's you
[03:32.640 --> 03:37.600]  have you know things like that that have now gotten kind of watered down over the
[03:37.600 --> 03:40.880]  years because they give them to a lot of establishment hacks like the Nobel
[03:40.880 --> 03:46.520]  Prize it has become a total fraud giving Obama one Henry Kissinger Al Gore I
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.160]  mean it it is I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't take one literally I wouldn't
[03:51.160 --> 03:56.600]  take one if they offered me one who's the famous Rockstar refused a knighthood
[03:56.600 --> 04:01.200]  I forget but I admire that the point is is that that's what's really good is to
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.000]  refuse one of these awards I am announcing and I can't do it this year
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.040]  because I don't have the funds but next year if we have the funds and I think we
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.800]  will have them we'll have a hundred thousand dollar award announced in
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.720]  November the Dylan radigan award and of course who would be the first recipient
[04:22.720 --> 04:26.440]  of the Dylan radigan award well it would be somebody like Dylan radigan
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.680]  because I played that clip again Friday and when it happened earlier this year
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.080]  it didn't really hit me when I played it that's what's gonna save us that exact
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.840]  type of behavior what I did on Pierce Morgan exact same deal hey stop the
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.360]  music I'm out of my comfort zone I'm breaking with your incrementalism I'm
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.520]  awake we're in trouble I'm making a break with the system because the system
[04:48.520 --> 04:51.760]  is going over the edge of a cliff it's like a runaway train about to go over
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.680]  the edge of cliff everybody sitting there sewing and drinking coffee and
[04:54.680 --> 05:00.040]  picking their nose and sitting on their thumbs we need to get off this train

[08:32.280 --> 08:37.280]  that I want to go over today obviously into very informative gas with key
[08:37.280 --> 08:44.960]  intel on this 11th of November 2013 Monday edition but I just wanted to
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.040]  mention this is going to come up later in the next hour we have John Kerry the
[08:51.040 --> 08:58.040]  Secretary of State saying that he doesn't think Oswald acted alone and that most
[08:58.040 --> 09:04.360]  Americans don't either and that's true on average in scientific polls 90 to 91
[09:04.360 --> 09:08.480]  percent it's the same every year for the last decade or so used to be in the 80s
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.040]  believe that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy larger than one man acting
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.760]  alone and the number one suspect is elements of the government so what
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.640]  that means is the entire establishment 50 years later lying to us and treating
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.240]  us like children and calling us conspiracy theorist and having Tom
[09:27.240 --> 09:33.400]  Hanks laugh at us doesn't work anymore well now because she's been fearful and
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.360]  I already knew folks that knew her from time-life books folks that smuggled out
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.560]  the photos of Kennedy's entire back of his head blown off and then published
[09:42.560 --> 09:50.600]  those recently folks like Groden it was one of the top advisors on the JFK film
[09:50.600 --> 09:57.360]  with Oliver Stone the head nurse who received him and was there during the
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.040]  attempts to resuscitate the already dead Kennedy and her expert opinion there
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.600]  was a whole separate shattered bullet laying there on the gurney he was just
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.400]  shot full of holes you watch his body he's being thrown all over the place
[10:11.400 --> 10:16.560]  being shot from the front three men lined up just open fire I mean you're at
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.640]  that grassy knoll I mean it's just like shooting fish in a barrel you're talking
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.840]  30 yards boom they slow down and it's it they just filled him full of holes and
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.520]  shot Connelly a couple times you can even see in photos blown up the limousine
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.960]  all shot up I mean they had triangulated fire they had triangulated fire not in
[10:37.960 --> 10:40.840]  the schoolbook building but the building directly behind they were shooting
[10:40.840 --> 10:45.040]  from behind as well they were shooting from behind the intel is they had the
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.120]  jackals shooting from behind they got it tried to kill de Gaulle shortly after
[10:49.120 --> 10:56.120]  and then they had the CIA shooters in front and then down the road they had
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.840]  other shooters in case in case he tried to flee back to the airport so I mean
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.600]  look it's just a fact and you've lost 50 years later you've really lost you in
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.760]  the last decade or so completely your fraud doesn't work anymore to the point
[11:09.760 --> 11:18.120]  of even sculling bones John Kerry knows that he is a buffoon when he knows the
[11:18.120 --> 11:22.600]  entire Kennedy family and their letters are public now their secretaries have
[11:22.600 --> 11:28.320]  gone public Jackie secretary they knew that day he'd been assassinated by
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.920]  multiple shooters but I mean the crowds all ran to the knoll and police all ran
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.080]  to the knoll and then there were you know guys up there basically flashing
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.520]  badges saying don't worry about it and others piling on back onto the trains
[11:42.520 --> 11:47.920]  to pose as hobos and we even know who the hobos were they had a Howard hunt the
[11:47.920 --> 11:50.720]  guy that carried out assassinations worldwide over three more than seven
[11:50.720 --> 11:53.920]  countries he gave a deathbed confession as well but we always have the photos of
[11:53.920 --> 11:58.040]  him being released from the police department puffing up his face total
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.400]  spy training when he's marched out in front of all of the cameras he puffs up
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.280]  his cheeks closes his eyes and just kept holding that and that's like serious
[12:07.280 --> 12:10.440]  spy training that if you get marched out in front of cameras you don't try to
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.520]  cover yourself up you just puff up your face and close your eyes so that it
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.360]  doesn't look like the same person just amazing with all these other famous CIA
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.400]  hitman wedding we know all their names just being being let out oh here are
[12:24.400 --> 12:31.440]  the tramps here are the here are the CIA assassins his job in World War two was
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.760]  assassinating Japanese military officers in China they would like drop
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.440]  e Howard hunt out for you know two months at a time crawling around and like
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.200]  swamps with bugs biting him they go kill people and then here he is 20 something
[12:44.200 --> 12:48.640]  years later blowing the president's head off now he told it in the in the
[12:48.640 --> 12:56.880]  deathbed confession he said I was a benchwarmer on the on the the big day and
[12:56.880 --> 13:03.160]  for my intel that is complete bull they had all the best of the West assassins
[13:03.160 --> 13:08.800]  there the jackal e Howard hunt all of them and now ladies and gentlemen of
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.000]  course he did a good job blowing Kennedy's head off so then they sent the
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.280]  jackal few years later and there's a movie about it the true story to kill
[13:17.280 --> 13:21.040]  Charles de Gaulle who also was telling the globalist I'm gonna run France for
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.880]  France I'm gonna have our own nuclear weapons you're not gonna have NATO here
[13:24.880 --> 13:27.880]  as part of a world government takeover don't go read all the stuff to call set
[13:27.880 --> 13:31.720]  I'm not gonna be part of that that internationalist Bilderberg group oh you
[13:31.720 --> 13:37.320]  didn't know he talked about that he said I'm gonna cut taxes I'm gonna build up
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.440]  our industry I'm gonna build roads oh my goodness well we're gonna try to kill
[13:41.440 --> 13:52.080]  you buddy boy so it's the same thing over and over and over again it's the
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.480]  same story all right I'm done I'm done talking about that for now ladies and
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.480]  gentlemen here is some of the news that we're going to be covering today
[14:04.480 --> 14:10.360]  colleges has punished a college has punished students for using a gun in
[14:10.360 --> 14:15.480]  their own condo they had rented to protect themselves from a robber a
[14:15.480 --> 14:22.000]  breaker an innerer a home invader and this happens all over the country you
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  can look at crime maps and see how universities sometimes have three four
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.100]  five times the crime in pro-gun cities because if you were a criminal do you
[14:30.100 --> 14:36.400]  home invade say out in the countryside where Alex Jones lives where everybody's
[14:36.400 --> 14:43.360]  got a gun and we shoot first and call 911 later or do you rob a house in Austin
[14:43.360 --> 14:47.200]  where more than half the public is armed and we'll shoot you are no no no no you
[14:47.200 --> 14:52.480]  go to the University of Texas where you can rob you can rape you can it's one
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.120]  of the only places and it still has a low crime rate compared to many other
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.080]  big-city campuses where you still have car jackings and rapes and parking
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.280]  garages and stuff because because they think this is where you go would a lion
[15:05.280 --> 15:14.200]  go and and hunt gazelle that rolled over to them or would they go and try to
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.800]  say try to say hunt grizzly bears I know lions aren't around grizzly bears but
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.520]  it's a hypothetical would here's a better example would a lion go start a fight
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.160]  with a hippopotamus that's giant teeth and is actually much more dangerous than
[15:29.160 --> 15:36.400]  a lion or would it go attack a defenseless gazelle I'm gonna ask that
[15:36.400 --> 15:44.400]  question again would a lion attack a gazelle or would it attack a hippopotamus
[15:44.400 --> 15:53.200]  would a lion attack a gazelle or would a lion attack a crocodile a 24 foot
[15:53.200 --> 15:59.960]  crocodile I'm gonna ask that question again would a lion with a predator attack
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.520]  a gazelle or a pack of wild dogs I'm asked that question again would a
[16:04.520 --> 16:15.640]  criminal home invade a house in rural Alabama when people are home or would
[16:15.640 --> 16:24.480]  they go after somebody in inner city in a city like Chicago where all the guns
[16:24.480 --> 16:31.520]  are banned and I know you all know this I know that you are all aware of this I
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.680]  know that you as listeners you as viewers understand it but we better
[16:36.680 --> 16:42.120]  explain this simple logic even to the dumbest sheep out there they can
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.840]  understand it that's another good analogy would wolves attack sheep that
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.720]  just roll over and show their bellies to be killed politely or would wolves
[16:51.720 --> 17:00.800]  attack say a pack of hunting dogs let's say Irish wolf hounds that are made to
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.760]  go out and kill wolves they would attack the sheep folks they would not
[17:04.760 --> 17:08.720]  attack the Irish wolf hounds and and that's the simple thing a free people
[17:08.720 --> 17:12.800]  are armed they're aggressive they're informed they're not gullible they're
[17:12.800 --> 17:16.840]  not mindless and they're not compliant with tyranny we're compliant with
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.720]  justice and liberty and working together for a freer society and for more
[17:21.720 --> 17:24.280]  opportunity but we have been intimidated and
[17:24.280 --> 17:30.560]  impact into having our language destroyed our sovereignty destroyed our families
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.640]  destroyed every basic bedrock is under attack because the globalist want to
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.080]  bring down this society now I meant to mention this right at the start of the
[17:40.080 --> 17:45.800]  broadcast it should be up within 10 minutes at prisonplanet.com and info
[17:45.800 --> 17:55.040]  wars.com and this is some of the biggest news that we've ever broken concerning
[17:55.040 --> 18:00.720]  surveillance and spying and a lot of it's been hidden in plain view but I
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.400]  actually worked this weekend with Paul Watson on this and again this morning
[18:04.400 --> 18:10.360]  and we were able to actually ferret out admissions of this and this is this
[18:10.360 --> 18:18.720]  is this is beyond beyond anything you've heard about with the NSA and if the so
[18:18.720 --> 18:25.200]  called media out there picks up on this it will absolutely send shock waves
[18:25.200 --> 18:29.800]  throughout the system but just like I told you about every major telecommunications
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.720]  hub having spy grids in it in 1996 because it was it was in the legislation
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.760]  it was in the funding of the regulations no one wanted to listen then
[18:38.760 --> 18:46.440]  well I'm I'm going to tell you what's really going on and it is so far beyond

[18:54.240 --> 18:59.320]  your mind and this is only part one the problem is there's so much evidence
[18:59.320 --> 19:03.720]  hiding in plain view that no one's pointed out or no one's made a big deal
[19:03.720 --> 19:14.520]  about but we're gonna break that coming up as soon as the story goes live the
[19:14.520 --> 19:23.400]  next 10 15 minutes at info wars calm at prison planet calm but this is let me

[23:14.600 --> 23:19.680]  always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the

[24:47.080 --> 24:56.720]  hour today in other news on the economic front food bank CEO people are
[24:56.720 --> 25:05.400]  scared to death from New York to Wyoming they are running out of food and this is
[25:05.400 --> 25:09.960]  just with the small cut in food stamp funding imagine if the government goes
[25:09.960 --> 25:15.920]  totally bankrupt which it's designed to do what that landscape will look like
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.280]  ladies and gentlemen 7 million people starved to death or died from
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.240]  complications from malnutrition during the 10 years the Great Depression major
[25:23.240 --> 25:28.440]  university studies have shown you can look those up imagine this time 90% were
[25:28.440 --> 25:35.160]  self-sufficient it's estimated now it's flipped with 89% being urban and totally
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.240]  unselfsufficient in 2012 last time I saw numbers on that sure it's even worse
[25:40.240 --> 25:45.760]  now I mean it's like extreme if you know how to tie your shoelaces if you know
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.200]  how to wipe your hind in that scene is a sign of it being an extremist if you
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.320]  know how to drool and say football you are a crowning leader of the future
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.320]  is the systems threatened by anyone who doesn't just line up and say vaccine and
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.520]  basically act like children I'm not kidding it's very sad to watch this
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.680]  happen so there's that report up on info wars.com speaking of depression 10 facts
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.520]  about the growing unemployment crisis in America that will blow your mind and I'm
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.720]  going to go ahead and just go over some of those 10 points right now the
[26:19.720 --> 26:26.120]  percentage of working age Americans with a job fell to 58.3% in October what do
[26:26.120 --> 26:31.600]  you call the 58% that still work the slaves the food the lowest that number
[26:31.600 --> 26:35.440]  has been at any point since the year 2000 in other words there has been an
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.160]  absolutely no jobs recovery during the last recession absolutely and they've
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.760]  added 30 million new people to country by then it's what's worse you know some
[26:44.760 --> 26:50.440]  say oh the stock markets at 108% rise since Obama got in that's the new
[26:50.440 --> 26:54.600]  numbers out today from Bloomberg yes but that's every real economist will tell
[26:54.600 --> 27:03.120]  you that's because it's indeed devalued dollars so people are a you can't get any
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.640]  return in the banks so you try to go to the stock market that's the place to
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.880]  invest now not not with straight interest that's a big part of it but b and
[27:12.880 --> 27:20.480]  more importantly there is inflation the dollar has been devaluated so a stock
[27:20.480 --> 27:27.200]  of Apple that was hypothetically 200 bucks years ago is now 300 400 500
[27:27.200 --> 27:31.760]  whatever it is today or the same thing with Google it's very very simple it's
[27:31.760 --> 27:41.520]  a speculative bubble but that is seen as the only sign of real success is Obama
[27:41.520 --> 27:50.640]  stocks among biggest after reelection as rally tested and then it just goes up
[27:50.640 --> 28:01.160]  with the fact that it has gone up 110% up 18% just in 2013 since Lord Obama got
[28:01.160 --> 28:05.200]  in but that's also deceptive because it was a big plunge to make sure Obama got
[28:05.200 --> 28:13.320]  in right before the 2008 election and again it's not that McCain was good
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.320]  it's that everything was designed to make you go with him
[28:17.320 --> 28:24.800]  aka Obama just like right now with Chris Christie you turn on Fox you turn on CNN
[28:24.800 --> 28:35.080]  you turn on MSNBC it is the second coming of job of the hut and I'm not
[28:35.080 --> 28:39.160]  attacking him because he's a fat guy the point is is the whole joke is the
[28:39.160 --> 28:41.840]  elephant in the room but then it's a positive article about him in the
[28:41.840 --> 28:47.880]  mainstream media this guy did one thing where he didn't build a tunnel which
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.280]  would have been a good government program to quote pay off debts no to give
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.720]  bankers money that they weren't really out so see he makes some austerity cuts
[28:55.720 --> 29:01.240]  and that's sold as conservative while he's done all sorts of other stuff to
[29:01.240 --> 29:08.240]  let the insiders loot New Jersey and he's anti-gun pro open border anti-libertarian
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.520]  anti-t-party just like curl rove just like John McCain and so now he will
[29:13.520 --> 29:23.040]  literally be the elephant placeholder and I mean that as a double entendre he
[29:23.040 --> 29:29.440]  will be the placeholder who they run against with Hillary or whoever show
[29:29.440 --> 29:34.120]  that the Democrats get back in or or he gets back in even better will have this
[29:34.120 --> 29:40.680]  monster with like a Rubio or something as his VP just absolute nightmare and
[29:40.680 --> 29:44.640]  that's why the whole power structure is going after the libertarians and the
[29:44.640 --> 29:50.080]  constitutionalist republicans because we are the hope of this country we're on
[29:50.080 --> 29:58.240]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:11.040 --> 30:14.600]  building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[30:14.600 --> 30:18.880]  threat they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack
[30:18.880 --> 30:23.040]  to come told Scousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in

[30:35.440 --> 30:38.800]  every one of these states most people wanting to be ready won't be able to get
[30:38.800 --> 30:42.920]  out of town because there'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness

[36:20.400 --> 36:25.480]  in the middle of it it's a pretty satisfying feeling that's why I fear
[36:25.480 --> 36:33.960]  man nor beast I only fear the Creator I say the beginning of wisdom is the fear
[36:33.960 --> 36:42.600]  of God the beginning of foolishness is fear of the devil my friends we are

[37:31.440 --> 37:36.240]  electricity pretty amazing we're gonna be getting to all of that coming up in
[37:36.240 --> 37:43.280]  this latest Kennedy info as just all the insiders start to go public with the
[37:43.280 --> 37:51.400]  reality of what is going on but first off let me just do this because it
[37:51.400 --> 37:57.280]  is the 50th anniversary coming up on the 22nd and I will be up there in Dallas
[37:57.280 --> 38:03.400]  on the Thursday and the Friday broadcasting from right at or near
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.960]  Dealey Plaza they've never issued a permit to the city park there since they
[38:07.960 --> 38:15.080]  killed Kennedy and covered it up in in my hometown of Dallas and now they're
[38:15.080 --> 38:23.360]  going to give the pro government conspiracy theory group three days of
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.520]  control Thursday Friday and Saturday no one will be allowed there but the
[38:28.520 --> 38:36.160]  corporate state-run medium and those wishing to push the official story but
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.600]  also an attack on free speech so we will be there handing out informational
[38:40.600 --> 38:46.080]  flyers and more and more down there and we're asking everyone who lives in
[38:46.080 --> 38:52.240]  Texas the surrounding areas to be there bare minimum starting early Friday
[38:52.240 --> 39:01.520]  morning but if you can do two days Thursday and Friday into Saturday to
[39:01.520 --> 39:09.040]  basically overwhelm the propagandist and to basically peacefully force our way
[39:09.040 --> 39:12.560]  into the park it's a very large park you have to get tickets though now they're
[39:12.560 --> 39:16.080]  closing it to get in so peacefully we're able to get in get in have not be
[39:16.080 --> 39:19.480]  around the park pointing out that it's a violation of our First Amendment and
[39:19.480 --> 39:23.800]  political discrimination to promote their lives and that 90 plus percent of
[39:23.800 --> 39:26.840]  the American people know that they murdered Kennedy that they're engaged
[39:26.840 --> 39:32.520]  in a criminal cover-up 50 years later still trying to keep the truth of the
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.320]  coup d'etat on the shadow government takeover from coming out so it really is
[39:36.320 --> 39:42.760]  everyone's duty to be at this event coming up but I thought I'd play this
[39:42.760 --> 39:49.960]  clip of John Kerry coming out and almost obliquely but not really real
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.720]  almost almost comes right out and says it that well you know no one really buys
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.200]  into this you know that only he acted alone so it just shows that that we've
[40:00.200 --> 40:06.520]  come so far here's a clip where do you come down on the conspiracy theories to
[40:06.520 --> 40:12.600]  this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone really I
[40:12.600 --> 40:19.920]  certainly have doubts that he was that he was motivated by himself I mean I'm
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.800]  not sure if anybody else was involved I don't go down that road with respect to
[40:24.800 --> 40:30.200]  the grassy Noel theory and all of that but I have serious questions about whether
[40:30.200 --> 40:36.840]  they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald's time and influence from Cuba and
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.120]  Russia and what about the CIA there are some who believe I've never gone there
[40:41.120 --> 40:44.960]  no I don't believe that but you think the Russians and the Cubans may have
[40:44.960 --> 40:50.960]  let's stop right there unbelievably ridiculous you've got Kennedy stopping a
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.400]  nuclear attack on Russia the Curtis LeMay and L. L. Emmanster wanted to carry
[40:55.400 --> 41:05.680]  out on record you've got just all the peace deals he was making and then so
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.400]  again he knows everybody knows that more than one person killed Kennedy so now
[41:09.400 --> 41:12.720]  that's how the skull and bones are operates he now turns it around on
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.400]  Russia and Cuba when the last thing they would want to do and I was no fan of the
[41:17.400 --> 41:21.840]  communist Russians or the communist Cubans the point is is that is that
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.040]  Kennedy was taken out because he didn't go along with a full invasion of Cuba
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.040]  and that's well known that he had to fire the director of the CIA and others
[41:30.040 --> 41:36.800]  over that so here is here is this establishment skull and bones are with
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.040]  Tom Brokaw coming out and doing a special 50 years later pushing their
[41:42.040 --> 41:51.960]  propaganda pushing their garbage pushing their fraud and oh anyone that
[41:51.960 --> 41:58.480]  questions us is a conspiracy theorist questioning known liars and think about
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.720]  what a what what mind control that is that they label questioning them by the
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.120]  way they've got Democrats Democratic boss Wasserman Schultz says dims will
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.880]  campaign on Obamacare failure we have this video coming up but I'm gonna go
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.800]  back to the Kennedy stuff here in a minute Americans have been feeling the
[42:16.800 --> 42:24.840]  benefits since 2010 Debbie Wasserman Schultz and then she goes on to say we
[42:24.840 --> 42:31.640]  to campaign on this it's a lie and a distortion that hundreds of thousands
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.440]  have been getting canceled now it's like 10 million now there's video of our own
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.480]  CNN I mean ladies and gentlemen why don't you just say we're conspiracy
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.960]  theorist McClatchy says it's gonna be 52 million people kicked off in their
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.600]  analysis doesn't matter when you get kicked off if you go complain they'll
[42:49.600 --> 42:53.840]  just go no you aren't hey we saw all those guys lined up shooting him right
[42:53.840 --> 42:57.960]  there oh really all you witnesses are gonna die now but that's not suspicious
[42:57.960 --> 43:04.560]  nothing's going on I mean they talk to us like we're two years old I mean when
[43:04.560 --> 43:07.840]  I was two and a half I said Santa Claus isn't really a fat man can't fit down
[43:07.840 --> 43:13.440]  the chimney one of my first memories I mean at two and a half I was smarter
[43:13.440 --> 43:16.360]  than the average person that goes along with this I'm telling you just just
[43:16.360 --> 43:20.160]  people don't have basic instincts but you know I say people aren't awake it's
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.000]  less than 10% to believe the official story actually you are awake we just
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.200]  have this grip of crooks up there lecturing us nobody's been kicked off
[43:28.200 --> 43:34.760]  that's a lie nobody has Obama I never said you wouldn't be kicked off your
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.920]  insurance plan then he went actually I just said until the bill passes and then
[43:39.920 --> 43:45.840]  actually I'm sorry I did I mean the news is we're not buying your bull anymore
[43:45.840 --> 43:48.840]  now here's the head nurse we'll put the article up on screen I'll give you her
[43:48.840 --> 43:54.680]  name as well but here's the head she was the head nurse over the the receiving
[43:54.680 --> 43:59.360]  of JFK and that she was in there while the doctors all worked on him and she
[43:59.360 --> 44:08.120]  saw an extra bullet that no one else had seen now think about that there's the
[44:08.120 --> 44:16.040]  headline JFK anniversary nurse recalls seeing the bullet beside Kennedy and
[44:16.040 --> 44:22.840]  we're going to play that video right now here it is in my estimation he was
[44:22.840 --> 44:29.360]  dead on arrival I started trying to feel for vital signs there I could feel no
[44:29.360 --> 44:37.560]  pulses I did not have a stethoscope at that time so his eyelids were about
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.280]  half closed and his color was what in medical terms we call cyanotic and that
[44:43.280 --> 44:49.680]  means it's a bluish gray his his eyelids were about half closed and his pupils
[44:49.680 --> 44:55.480]  were fixed and dilated and at this time I noticed what I what appeared to me to
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.120]  be a big exit wound right underneath his Adam's apple and just before then the
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.960]  notch there at the top of the breastbone and on the cart halfway between the
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.800]  earlobe and the shoulder there was a bullet laying almost perpendicular
[45:09.800 --> 45:16.120]  there but I have not seen a picture of that bullet ever since that day most of
[45:16.120 --> 45:21.000]  my time was spent just plastered against the wall there were so many doctors in
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.120]  that room at the time Dr. Kent Clark who is head of the neurosurgery department
[45:26.120 --> 45:31.520]  here at Parkland after he pronounced the president dead he just turned and walked
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.040]  out of the room walked right by Mrs. Kennedy he had been standing at the
[45:35.040 --> 45:38.800]  foot of carriage all the time with her hand on hit and the president's left
[45:38.800 --> 45:43.360]  foot early on that the supervisor to ask her she would like to seat out in the
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.920]  hallway but she declined and the only thing I heard her say that day was no
[45:47.920 --> 45:53.440]  I'm going to stay with him so she didn't she didn't move all that time but after
[45:53.440 --> 45:59.600]  Dr. Clark had pronounced him he just walked right Mrs. Kennedy without
[45:59.600 --> 46:04.320]  stopping and said madam your husband's dead
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.720]  okay folks we are back live and again that was Phyllis Hall one of the main
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.520]  nurses there and the main nurse with the doctors over the surgery reporting
[46:15.520 --> 46:22.600]  that information to you 50 years later and more and more people aren't now
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.920]  going public as well Paul Watson tells me that his big breaking article has gone
[46:28.920 --> 46:39.040]  up on info wars.com I am unable to see it with the system on my computer but as
[46:39.040 --> 46:45.640]  soon as it goes up we will cover it for you and in fact it has now gone up the
[46:45.640 --> 46:55.200]  article is spy grid can now record your conversation in real time we're going to
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.080]  change that headline because I worked on this story last week and over the
[46:59.080 --> 47:03.280]  weekend and today but I'd not come up with a headline hidden in plain sight the
[47:03.280 --> 47:07.760]  next level of NSA snooping will detect dissonance via ubiquitous audio
[47:07.760 --> 47:13.320]  sensors yeah I think the headline we're going to need to change that on this
[47:13.320 --> 47:20.920]  article to national feds deploy national grids of microphones or feds
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.080]  deploy microphones nationwide in public or feds deploy national grid of
[47:25.080 --> 47:29.360]  microphones because that's what it is and they're just now starting to admit
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.480]  it this has been going on for a long time but now we know the types of systems
[47:33.480 --> 47:42.000]  that they have and more now again you're probably saying well wait a minute we
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.400]  saw your article on drudgereport.com this weekend about the IntelliStreets
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.760]  microphones yes but it's it's the computers it's your phones it's everything
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.320]  and it's all Homeland Security funded and the key is they're using voice print
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.560]  recognition to track you as you go and they're much more invasive than cameras
[47:57.560 --> 48:01.480]  they're just aiming general areas they can listen in omnidirectional systems
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.960]  they can pick things up off the vibration off windows with these computer
[48:05.960 --> 48:13.960]  systems it's very very very very sophisticated and this is way beyond the
[48:13.960 --> 48:20.200]  NSA listening to your phone calls and this is way beyond and it ties in to
[48:20.200 --> 48:34.920]  everything. Watson are you there okay say hi everybody on the radio anyways a good
[48:34.920 --> 48:36.920]  job on the article I know you had trouble because there's so much
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.320]  documentation but just in and then tomorrow we're gonna have a part two
[48:40.320 --> 48:46.040]  about what the next level of the grid is but good job so we'll get that headline
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.600]  changed because again they just intend to roll all the sound where nobody notices
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.800]  it nobody gets upset about it and then oh you know five years ago oh we're not
[48:54.800 --> 48:59.680]  listening to you without warrants now we are we've got the DEA admittedly going
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.200]  to the NSA databases and you've got all that in there correct all right good job
[49:05.200 --> 49:11.680]  Watson all right I'll talk to you during the break thank you okay and again
[49:11.680 --> 49:19.840]  ladies and gentlemen it's not just the the it's not just the street lights that
[49:19.840 --> 49:26.360]  we have that this is going on with it is a system where they can now just like in
[49:26.360 --> 49:32.160]  the Batman movie the one before last what was the second one of the latest
[49:32.160 --> 49:37.200]  installment of the dark night where oh to only save the city they use the cell
[49:37.200 --> 49:43.360]  phone function for a sonar system where they can use the wireless internet the
[49:43.360 --> 49:50.320]  wireless frequency from the phone to pick up the the voice resonance and the
[49:50.320 --> 49:54.640]  sonar face resonance and actually use it to see you well that's 20 year old
[49:54.640 --> 49:59.400]  technology that's what the connect Microsoft does is it even looks through
[49:59.400 --> 50:06.160]  your walls to see when you're home the wireless can literally see you using the
[50:06.160 --> 50:12.120]  wireless almost like sonar or radar bouncing back but a lot clearer so it's
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.200]  actually not just listening to you or face scanning you in the room it's now
[50:16.200 --> 50:20.600]  looking through your walls well they're deploying that on the streets they're
[50:20.600 --> 50:26.320]  they're deploying microphones and then they're jacking in with the NSA into the
[50:26.320 --> 50:33.040]  cell phones into the cameras into the smart appliances and they have the smart
[50:33.040 --> 50:36.840]  meters pulsing every 25 seconds worldwide it's the same standardized
[50:36.840 --> 50:42.480]  system tracking all the data getting the latest data and the engineers we've
[50:42.480 --> 50:47.600]  talked to say that it appears to be an actual almost x-ray system where where
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.120]  where it is an x-rays but it's it's microwave rays that bounce back they're
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.800]  able to read off sensors at a central system then what's in your house so

[54:20.440 --> 54:27.520]  so I called Watson up last week who does a lot of the writing based on ideas and
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.760]  angles I want to go with most of the time he basically scans through news or
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.960]  breaking info and does his own stuff but basically we collaboratively write
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.360]  articles together and I said listen I remember back in 1998 when they put up
[54:40.360 --> 54:46.360]  gunshot detectors in Austin Texas I was approached as I was many times at a
[54:46.360 --> 54:52.560]  remote I was doing it was a car dealership or a rodeo or a golf course I
[54:52.560 --> 54:57.280]  don't remember by a fellow who was an engineer and he said look these are
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.360]  really microphones they're not gunshot detectors and the feds are putting these
[55:01.360 --> 55:05.480]  in nationwide and even gave me some blueprints and schematics he said here's
[55:05.480 --> 55:12.560]  the company go online they have audio promos showing people talking and then
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.320]  how it can be recorded and how they can even run it through IBM databases
[55:16.320 --> 55:22.520]  off of these other consortium databases of your voice print and how they're
[55:22.520 --> 55:29.240]  going to track people in real time via an NSA system and all he knew was it was
[55:29.240 --> 55:36.680]  being piped back through the telecoms to offices in the local telecom that went
[55:36.680 --> 55:39.960]  to the NSA and I'm on record breaking that down and now we know that's how it
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.520]  works and then and then as I had that whistleblower and other whistleblowers
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.520]  on or they brought me info I got more and more and more here's an example they
[55:48.520 --> 55:54.320]  have streetlights put up in Austin Texas that quote monitor whether they're
[55:54.320 --> 55:59.320]  working or not with LEDs and they're hooked up into the cable system and
[55:59.320 --> 56:06.240]  through that cable system some of the lights have microphones in them and I
[56:06.240 --> 56:12.440]  confirmed that from a city inspector and I am yet and I do intend to do this I
[56:12.440 --> 56:18.560]  am yet I'm just gonna be honest I'm going to get a cherry picker I know a
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.080]  location where I can get to one pretty easy without too many eyes and I'm going
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.720]  to rip it open and show everybody so I mean because it's one thing if I tell
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.240]  you or play a newscast where they admit these things have microphones it's
[56:30.240 --> 56:34.520]  nothing when I rip the thing open on video so I've got to get the cherry
[56:34.520 --> 56:39.200]  picker I got to go over to this spot and I've got to get up there and do it it's
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.960]  by my parents house and my dad went out and questioned the guy and said my son
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.680]  says that's hooked into the cable system and you can listen to people and he
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.640]  said yep that's true but he goes I'm not supposed to look inside these when I
[56:51.640 --> 56:55.240]  install them but we know some of them have microphones and my dad said to the
[56:55.240 --> 57:00.160]  installer you're you're kidding this is like on the edge of his property my
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.800]  dad's on a bigger piece of property with neighborhoods all around it and he's on
[57:03.800 --> 57:07.080]  the edge of a neighborhood so there's one right there by his house so I can get
[57:07.080 --> 57:11.440]  the cherry picker in there and I'm gonna I'm gonna tear that sucker open but the
[57:11.440 --> 57:16.320]  point is I mean I'm not gonna hurt it the precious government spy bot I won't
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.960]  do it hand solo did to the Imperial probidroid but the point is is that I'm
[57:20.960 --> 57:23.160]  gonna go up there and show everybody and I've been told right where the
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.240]  microphone is so but the point is I've got the documents I know it's there I've
[57:28.240 --> 57:34.520]  got newscast admitting it but this is in 1998 I was approached about this and I
[57:34.520 --> 57:38.360]  was told these are not gunshot detectors so I had Watson go look it up because I
[57:38.360 --> 57:42.080]  wouldn't found that company at the time played it on the radio in 98 then
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.320]  bragging that you know you can use this to listen to people and be of the gunshot
[57:46.320 --> 57:49.960]  detector so see that's how they do it oh these cameras aren't to watch you 20
[57:49.960 --> 57:59.800]  years ago they're for traffic monitoring which do duly they were okay and then
[57:59.800 --> 58:05.360]  they went on and said oh by the way we are watching you now and then now it's
[58:05.360 --> 58:09.320]  oh these are gunshot detectors well Watson was able to find government
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.840]  documents and even footnotes in the New York Times admitting that they're
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.280]  listening to everyone and using them just like I told you from my DEA source
[58:18.280 --> 58:22.840]  that for 30 years they go through all the NSA data plus and that but they can't
[58:22.840 --> 58:25.920]  use it in court so they create fake investigations the New York Times
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.680]  reported last week now they just use warrantless stuff from the NSA in the
[58:30.680 --> 58:34.960]  drug cases and others so but now it's going to be spanking your kids they're
[58:34.960 --> 58:40.160]  coming you understand microphones are everywhere
[58:42.280 --> 58:49.040]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:00.400 --> 59:04.920]  you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95 percent of

[59:08.880 --> 59:13.760]  silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media for
[59:13.760 --> 59:17.880]  removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element it is

[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.240]  alex jones
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:37.160]  all right Paul Watson has his article up on info wars commits in red feds
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:44.000]  deploy national spy system of microphones to record conversations and again it is
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.400]  in your scientific Atlantic cable boxes and all the other major ones Google is
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.600]  watching and listening to you over your computers on record they have press
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.880]  releases out so that's not even hidden but the street lights and fake
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:03.520]  transformers have hidden cameras hidden microphones in them and you could go
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.920]  look this up this is actually in hundreds of documents the point is it's
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.000]  rolling out everywhere and everyone's freaking out about a little bit of NSA
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.440]  spying but this is going on ladies and gentlemen across the board and I want
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:27.720]  to explain to you with voice recognition software to then create a record where it
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.880]  hears who you are database clicks and then creates a map of where you've gone
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.800]  you say well what do I have to hide imagine if Hitler had technology like
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:44.600]  this or if the communist Soviets would have at it we have a bad group who
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:52.520]  didn't ask us and illegally deployed this and if you can rape someone of their
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.520]  privacy you can take all the rest of their liberties that is a quantum level
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:09.520]  building block of everything here's an example you try to go aim a conal
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.840]  microphone long-range microphone system at the White House I will guarantee you
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.440]  if you pulled up with one of those and aimed at the White House they would
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.840]  arrest you and claim you were trying to violate national security oh why why do
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.280]  you get privacy oh cuz bad people could do bad things if they knew your
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.760]  privacy why do you lock your doors why do you close your blinds at night because
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.760]  you don't want thieves that come up looking in your house to know where
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.720]  you're at or where you're doing to have the advantage and you don't do this
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.200]  because you're living in fear you do it because you're living in why does your
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.240]  dog bark when they hear a noise because they know to look out their instincts
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.080]  have brought them as far you close your blinds at night so you have privacy
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:59.600]  why does my bathroom have a door on the toilet stall for privacy see that's an
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.080]  extremist thing my toilet should be on my roof with a floodlight over it just
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.560]  to prove I'm not doing bad things there should be toilet safety police up on the
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:18.440]  roof who are gonna say it up there making sure that bin Laden is unhiding
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:29.280]  hiding in the toilet bowl I mean this is all a total takeover of society and
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.720]  I'm gonna say something really bad oh god help me oh almost ran somebody off the
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.400]  road this morning I haven't had a wreck in like 15 years and this weekend some

[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:51.520]  me and I bumped them and then today I was getting over and this car was speeding
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.520]  a little bit but I didn't see it almost hit it and they did run off the road I
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.640]  pulled over to check on them and they were all right and there were listeners
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.240]  both of them so everything was fine but I mean it's weird how when it rains it

[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.240]  host Alex Jones and here's CBS news right now reporting Oregon health care
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.520]  exchange has yet to enroll a single person but later we're gonna play the
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:02.200]  video of establishment political wonk DNC boss Wasserman Schultz says dims will
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.440]  campaign on Obamacare and I have her quotes here that it is a distortion to
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.920]  say that people have been kicked off their health care or that the health
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:19.160]  care exchanges are not are not working so so there they are absolutely
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:26.680]  completely and totally denying reality to everyone a mclatchy is reporting new
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.880]  service more than 50 million to be thrown off it's now close to 10 million
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:37.240]  that have now officially been thrown off but all they've got to do say you're a
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.240]  conspiracy theorist because that's what they do if you say you know I think the
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.560]  NSA illegally spying on us is illegal they're not doing that conspiracy
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.920]  theorist there were whistleblowers in the 80s the 90s the 2000s I interviewed
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.280]  most of them but the media would just say that's a conspiracy theory and no
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.880]  one would cover it and then now so much has come out at first all Snowden's a
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:10.000]  traitor we spy on you for your own good now they've got to admit what's going on
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.040]  to a certain extent but they hope you think it's terror related and for your
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:20.400]  own good no it came out in the Icelandic parliament last week and RT picked it up
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.000]  that the British government was using their spy grid as part of the NSA it's
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.360]  all one big international system to spy on even individuals trying to get their
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.560]  money out of the banks that were trying to take it to bail the banks out like we
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.680]  saw in Cyprus earlier this year with the bail in and then they were using it to
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.600]  economically sabotage not just the government but individuals and then
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.320]  of course the government ended up doing the right thing arresting the
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.640]  government ministers that were involved in the foreign banking takeover and
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.240]  refusing to pay the debt that was not theirs and now we're three years later
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:05.960]  so the model of defeating these people is what Iceland did and they stood up
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.160]  against the US British government European EU systems as well who were
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.400]  going to bankrupt and loot that country by signing the people on to their system
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:26.520]  now the story is up on info wars.com right now and Paul Watson is there
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:35.640]  breaking it down the feds have put up a national grid the feds of
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:42.480]  deployed a national spy system of microphones to record conversations
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:50.640]  hidden in plain sight the next level of NSA snooping will detect descent via
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:57.840]  ubiquitous audio sensors so this is beyond 1984 it is a total criminal plan
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.880]  and this article by Paul Watson takes the admissions that they're putting up a
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.680]  network of fake street lights fake transformers you name it that
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.160]  literally listen to you as you walk down the street and record it and then add it
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.560]  to voice prints I will break this down after our guest leaves us at the start
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:25.080]  of the next hour this is a big breaking special report if you want to know how
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.040]  deep the rabbit hole goes I'm going to be breaking that down but I want to ask
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.160]  all listeners to get this article that's up on info wars calm and prison
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.920]  planet calm and to get this article out to everyone you know so they
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.080]  understand this is an investigative report because if we just take it like
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.360]  it's okay they listen to us on the street it's learned helplessness it
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.800]  becomes just accepted but if we fight back then it boomerangs back on them
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.320]  and discredits them so they want to just standardize this and acclimate us to
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.520]  accept it now what else they want to do is use the IRS against real anti-war
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.720]  activists against land rights activists against Amish against pro-life groups
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:13.320]  against tea party against anybody who's for liberty or common sense or justice
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.560]  they don't want you active they want you to do what you're told as a spectator
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.040]  that's why the TSA has taken down websites threatened to sue people had
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.120]  Facebook censor parodies of them censored our videos censored other videos that
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:34.480]  exposed the TSA well the NSA is the same and and a couple months ago this was
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.760]  first reported by Ben Swan investigative journalists coming up about 30
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.880]  minutes and then picked up a week and a half ago by info wars calm when he
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.600]  filed suit then picked up by CBS News and drudge put it out worldwide to be one
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.840]  of the top stories about a week ago but free speech t-shirt maker threatened by
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:03.280]  NSA DHS fights back with lawsuit and he made two clear parodies of the NSA the
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.520]  US Department of Homeland Stupidity and another one that said National Security
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:13.320]  Agency peeping while you're sleeping the NSA the only part of government that
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:19.680]  actually listens Jay Leno made similar jokes about well you know at least you
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.640]  know we do have big brother it's big bro so this is a total surveillance prison
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.560]  grid totally illegal light years worse than 1984 and now they tried to threaten
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:39.600]  and shut down the artist Dan McCall who joins us and he said no I'm gonna
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.640]  continue and I'm suing you and now the publicity he's selling his t-shirts and
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.320]  items we're gonna make our own variants we've had TSA ones before but I'm gonna
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.080]  make some NSA ones as well we should all get it on the act we're having a $10,000
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.600]  contest to make videos exposing the NSA and TSA that new contest is going a new
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.000]  film contest as well so we we're fully getting behind the first amendment here
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.880]  because you either stand up and use the enemy's attack as a way to gain ground on
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.600]  them or you roll over and die Liberty maniacs.com is his website he's an
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.200]  American artist designer and founder of the brand website Liberty maniacs.com
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:22.160]  and a design business so evil evil free speech entrepreneur he is currently
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:29.640]  being demonized an attack by the NSA so he's fighting back and he joins us right
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.040]  now sir thank you for coming on with us well thanks so much for having me on
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.800]  Alex I really appreciate it appreciate it it's great to talk to you and your
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.560]  listeners and yes it's been an interesting few weeks here to say the
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.640]  least to say the least so so tell us about how well this began how they
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.320]  threaten you and I'm guessing but I would imagine you're selling a hundred
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.040]  times more stuff than you were previously. I've learned of something
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.720]  that called the Streisand effect I'm still not sure what exactly where that
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.400]  comes from I take it is something that Barbara Streisand wanted to originally
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.960]  take down off the internet but the attention that that brought of her
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.000]  action trying to do that caused it to be much more much more of a sensation than
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.120]  it actually was so that's definitely been a factor here and it's kind of
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:21.440]  in a way almost turned into a sort of art form in and of itself almost I guess
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.480]  I'd call it performance art the way that the NSA and the DHS has reacted to the
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.080]  original parody that started well a while back but I learned of it this
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:37.560]  summer so originally it started two days after the snow and revelations had
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.560]  come out I think that the heroic work that Glenn Greenwald had done to expose
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.040]  this with with the leaks from Edward Snowden had come out and days after
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.280]  that especially when I found out that it was Glenn Greenwald that had done it and
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.720]  and some of the information was starting to come out I decided to kind of take a
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.600]  stab at this subject I was enraged like a lot of people were I think not
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.520]  enough people at the time I think but I think that's a growing demographic of
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.200]  people that are not only angry about what the NSA has been doing but as you
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.760]  just reported sounds like they're planning on doing as well so I like you
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.480]  said I created this parody and it was basically sort of the classic sort of
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.880]  parody that I've done over the years over the ten years that I've done
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.840]  Liberty Maniacs and it was basically take their logo and flip it on itself make
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.760]  them the butt of the joke by using their own imagery something that you see you
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.800]  know classically done as a parody from Mad Magazine to everything else I'm sure
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.920]  some of your shirts and stuff like that do very similar things and have over
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.160]  the years so yeah it's it's it's core it's it's not a design too many ways I've
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.920]  said that many ways but many times but no you are a great designer because you
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.320]  come up with a unique very striking ways you do it so the issue is for those
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.640]  that don't know free speech is protected obviously but political speech and
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.720]  lampooning is the highest level having a media operation dealing with this for
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.360]  18 years I've had to learn the law this is the most protected speech when it's
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.840]  political when it's a parody it's the highest level of protection and here
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.200]  they are trying to shut you down and it's an example of how you mildly
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.160]  criticize Obamacare on Twitter or Facebook they'll suspend or delete your
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:31.240]  account it shows a rain of authoritarian terror it's truly frightening the fact
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:37.560]  that days after the very day that I placed my parody up for for sale just
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.160]  hours afterwards I was notified by the by the seller by the by the actual
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.960]  manufacturer that I wasn't allowed to do it and when I when I finally looked into
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.440]  the matter I had learned that they'd been contacted by the NSA and then later
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:56.520]  found out the DHS actually two years prior they were acting on letters of
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:02.960]  cease and desist that were issued two years prior in 2011 and and because sort
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.000]  of red flagged by account even though I had been very close partners with them
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.080]  over the years and so that they were immediately taken down it took our
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.480]  lawyers and we were public citizen I'm working with this sort of they've been
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.360]  doing a great work try to expose what's going on to get to the bottom of it it
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.600]  took a lot a lot of work that's right so this is torturous interference we're
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.320]  behind the scenes they're trying to sabotage your connections we've had that
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.520]  happen to us many times but the companies are always so scared they just say
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.040]  look I can't work with you homeland security so it just shows what criminals
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.320]  these people are stay there folks this is torturous interference it's criminal
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.160]  racketeering or a group of people get together and threaten things to shut
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.440]  down your free speech to shut down your business this is the essence of Soviet
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:54.000]  style tyranny the Nazis did this as well as you know I mean it is unbelievable so

[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:15.760]  so Dan McCall learned that his longtime suppliers couldn't produce t-shirts for
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.200]  him because Homeland Security and that in the NSA had been threatening them with
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.000]  cease and desist letters and this is what they do you'll parodies like all
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.400]  your data agency you know we're spying on you stuff like that that's totally
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.120]  clear it's like t-shirts that say CIA cocaine importation agency this this is
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.960]  the most protected art is political art but getting back to Dan McCall Dan roll
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.520]  through then how you had to discover it and what's happened since and what your
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:25:02.840]  suit is up to the company to see what happened there definitely was a
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.080]  silencing effect because after working with them for over five years it was
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.320]  like hitting a brick wall of silence so I knew something was up there was a red
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.080]  flag that something's going on but I also knew that that I had to get to the
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.680]  bottom of it to find out what's going on because there's a huge portion of what I
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.960]  do as an artist and as a designer and as a small business person so we looked
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.480]  into it I finally was able to we got in contact like you said with with Ben
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:33.880]  Swan and he did an expose on it on his on his media program that that sort of
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.480]  highlighted what had gone on as far as I understood at the point then public
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.120]  citizen the contact had been and offered help to kind of look into it
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.320]  because as you said it seems as though this could be a possibly important civil
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.160]  rights case if they're impinging upon you know what is the most important
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.920]  aspect of the First Amendment which is to criticize the government and so we
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.160]  looked into it and the rabbit hole got a little deeper the company was very
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.280]  resistant to even give us any information and since hasn't because
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.000]  they've been so scared and bullied they haven't even issued us the original
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.160]  cease and desist letters stating that those are confidential they don't see a
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.480]  reason why they should do it they were able to dictate word for word what
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.720]  what those letters were so we're able to sort of formulate the case and decide
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.920]  whether or not this is you know a practical matter to bring to court and
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.400]  if that's sort of a court remedy is something that we were going to to go
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.000]  ahead with after finding out about it we and what the actual designs and parodies
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.560]  and and art that they were using their statues to try to silence and criminalize
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.880]  in this case it was it was there was no choice no matter it was definitely a
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.440]  case where we had to press the issue we have to clarify what the law is in this
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.520]  case and and try to overturn and that's what this case is kind of about
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.280]  overturn those those aspects those statutes that are completely incompatible
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.720]  with the First Amendment and make sure that that not only these these parodies
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.160]  are not criminalized but that anyone else whether they're making a joke as a
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.560]  as a comedian or as you're doing you know in a radio after making a parody
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.760]  you're selling shirts anyone that that that there's a clear path and we know
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.720]  exactly what fair use is and that we we challenged the the very idea that these
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.280]  government agencies could brand themselves own on the things like their
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.640]  seal and like you may have read the NSA is claiming that to even use their seal
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:39.480]  or the letters NSA or national security agency I have to ask permission to the
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:45.560]  director of the NSA to do that that's absolutely you know it's mind-boggling
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.560]  that they could actually make that case so that's what I'm I'm trying to do it
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.240]  and move forward with is to make make sure that that's nothing like this ever
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.280]  happens again well it shows a culture of criminal activity they're illegally
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.440]  spying on us they're dialing into our cell phones our computers they've
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.560]  worked with Google with the Google cars to go around grabbing everybody's data
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.480]  and they're trying to just commit these crimes in mass to where they
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.560]  overwhelm us and set a new precedent through common law where possession is
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.000]  nine-tenths of the law so they overrun us they get away with it so long it sets
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.280]  a new standard it's conscious and so it also shows how behind the scenes they
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.920]  go around and shut down Twitter accounts that are criticizing Obamacare they
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.440]  shut down letting us sell on Google Store the Obama deception they just told
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:37.360]  this point blank Democrats don't like it to where really it's a reign of terror
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.360]  where they get away with whatever they want you are standing up and saying no I
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:49.560]  will lampoon the NSA and so hopefully by you resisting it shows others that it's
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.480]  not illegal to have parodies politically I mean look at you open up the
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:58.680]  newspaper and they've got parodies of presidents and people this is this goes
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.800]  back to the Greeks and before and so this is really an amazing level of
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.680]  tyranny yeah it's a strange thing I think there's a portion of this too where
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.320]  they when they think they can get away with this and obviously you have a large
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.360]  large audience and and and so when they're messing with you I think it
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.240]  it's just strange to me but I think in this case that when they're messing
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.280]  with a little guy they're thinking that everyone's just gonna lay down and and
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.920]  and to some degree we're seeing I mean we're seeing people there's another
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.320]  company that's that's that has my shirts up and it's helping me market my shirts
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.880]  but even now they're there a little bit you know it makes people nervous to go
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.920]  against the largest yeah listen brother we salute your courage and I want to say
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.040]  this if we all don't stand up we're gonna be enslaved people should be afraid

[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:59.480]  start the third hour I'm gonna get into a national spy grid of microphones
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.960]  hidden in public places and now the feds are trying to pressure businesses into
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.760]  wiring in quote with the local police department and the threat fusion center
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.600]  your internal cameras and mics so that they can control them and surveil

[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.000]  gonna be breaking that down coming up in the third hour then I'm gonna get into
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.920]  your phone calls and a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet geopolitically
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.160]  on the second amendment front some big developments there as well we're gonna
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.840]  go to Ben swan here in a moment award-winning journalist who's been
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.040]  breaking a lot of big stories dealing with the NSA and more we'll get his take
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.360]  on that and then other stuff he's working on right now but we only do this
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.160]  once a year in November it always ends up stopping in early December because we
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:35:01.280]  end up shelling out of the factories pro pure pro one gravity fed stainless steel
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.040]  filters we went out did two years of research found the very best gravity
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.280]  fed filter systems the best filters the best quality the best customer service
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.120]  we are the biggest distributor of these in the world is very simple why we have
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.480]  10% off the already lowest prices with promo code water but by the time you go
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.200]  to info wars dot com or info or store dot com this is being changed and updated
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:30.720]  right now there will be 20% off we and we've never gone that high it's been 15
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.800]  before 20% off we're selling more of these than ever I've just decided to do
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:39.080]  this for our listeners because I want to cut the fluoride and the glyphosate and
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:42.320]  all the poison on the water this is the system that does it annihilates the
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.520]  competition there's a whole giant line we have everyone they produce that we've
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:52.160]  got the the little picture systems that I have it as well for as low as 59 or
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.480]  54 dollars nobody can can top that it's all there this is a cut above the rest

[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:15.600]  with promo code water 20 and this will probably only run two weeks or so because
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.040]  we always end up selling out of everything they've got even though it's a
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.440]  giant facility then they've got to produce more but they've done a
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.040]  production and expanded production run so this could probably run two three
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.240]  weeks right now ladies and gentlemen and it funds our operation water 20 when

[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.920]  couple more weeks so we've expanded production of the proprietary patented

[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:55.480]  all right now I wanted to get Ben Swan back on the broadcast because he is the
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.520]  model of folks like Dylan Rattigan myself and others Matt Drudge Drudge
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.640]  report.com world that daily you name it that are the cutting edge of real media
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.000]  and I don't care if you come from a liberal or conservative background if
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.240]  you were a real journalist and just cover the real historical facts you find
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:18.120]  out there's a revolution of tyranny coming down on us and so he's won
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.800]  multiple Edward R. Murrow awards and Lone Star Emmys he went on to have a top
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:29.000]  show on Fox that became a national sensation just from his local Fox
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.440]  affiliate and then he basically left there because they wanted him to only
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.040]  cover local stuff and basically put handcuffs on him same thing happened to
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.000]  me 16 years ago locally on radio and since then he's launched his own
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.160]  operation and it's just very exciting because most media folks don't have other
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.440]  media people on to promote them but I do because if we don't defeat the New
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.560]  World Order we don't have a future so it's great to not be lonely out there so
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.360]  it's why we've got Ben Swan on with us and Ben there there's a lot happening in
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:03.200]  the news I want to get your take on but first off getting into the NSA and
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.520]  their intimidation of the press the war on the media the Obama's war on the
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:14.160]  media and now the war on political cartoonist and the war on people
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.920]  criticizing the NSA I mean this really shows us that they would like to turn
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.600]  America into the old Soviet Union Ben Swan yeah absolutely I mean everything
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  the Soviets wanted but couldn't do because they were hamstrung by the lack
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:31.640]  of technology it's what we're seeing in America today and you know Alex we talk
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.160]  about this all the time is do you it's not a left versus right issue this is a
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.960]  liberty versus tyranny issue and so what we're seeing around the country right
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.040]  now is this incredible crackdown not just on whistleblowers not just on on
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.960]  journalists but on anyone who is critical of this administration critical
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.880]  of its policies critical of government in general you know we've talked to this
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.840]  this t-shirt maker who basically designed a parody of the NSA it's a round
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.120]  logo the NSA logo and it says peeping while you're sleeping the NSA the only
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.280]  government agency that actually listens or only part of the government that
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.240]  actually listens it's pretty clever but it's a parody and the NSA has gotten all
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.240]  those shirts pulled from from marketplaces across the internet claiming
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.640]  it's trademark infringement and it's nonsense you know one of the problems
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.320]  that we run into in America right now is that we have courts and we have laws
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.120]  and we have copyright law and trademark law already in existence what we find is
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.320]  that the NSA the DHS they don't want to use those those avenues instead they
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.480]  want to go around those avenues and instead just crackdown on anyone they
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:39.600]  don't like threaten intimidate scare you know businesses and business owners
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:47.600]  into compliance when I look at it added to what I mentioned earlier the admitted
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.240]  war on the press the arresting of whistleblowers the NSA spying on the
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:56.160]  press I mean this is a criminal group I'm sorry there's no other way to slice
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:00.120]  it and they're building giant spy databases everywhere and they just
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.280]  expect us to go along with it but the good news is they tried to paint
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.200]  Snowden as a traitor in all the polls he's a hero it looks like the sleeping
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:14.160]  giant is awakening and they should understand that they're going to end up
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.960]  going to jail and no amount of intimidation is going to save them yeah
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.960]  I think you're absolutely right that you know this idea that they're ultimately
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.640]  going to be able to control what anyone says we had a story up on Ben's mom
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.200]  dot-com I'm sure you guys saw it as well Carol Costello from CNN saying that
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.200]  this administration threatens the jobs of any reporters who were even critical
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.040]  of the administration and we see this happening everywhere but I agree with
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.720]  you I you know we talk about this all the time Liberty is rising right and the
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.840]  whole idea that across the country people are fed up with it I mean they're
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.000]  really sick and tired of what we're seeing right now in the country they're
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.200]  not really sure I think what to do about it fully and that's why you know
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.680]  programs like yours are so important because I think you're giving people
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.400]  steps to take here are steps you can take certainly with your dollar as a
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.520]  consumer steps you can take in terms of going around mainstream media instead of
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.480]  allowing them to continue to be the gatekeeper the propagandist and so we're
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:12.640]  giving people opportunities to step forward and to do something about what
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.200]  they're seeing and I think people are ready for it more so than they've been
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.440]  in a number of generations in this country
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.320]  where do you see the political landscape you're a smart guy get your finger on
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  the pulse you talked a lot of people like I and others do do you see the
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.680]  landscape as being explosively awake right now
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.360]  and accelerating that process or do you think that it's just
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.920]  too little too late no I don't think it's too little too late I think that
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.280]  more and more people are waking up look go back
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.720]  five or six years ago and and I think the left-right paradigm has fallen apart
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.240]  so much and and I speak all over the country about this and and actually
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.800]  Alex I use info wars often to make the point that the story you all broke in
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.400]  terms of of DHS and the you know shoring up all
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.680]  that ammo and buying up all that ammo that was a story you guys broke but at
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.520]  least a year a year and a half before mainstream media would even touch it
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.480]  they didn't touch it because they had the integrity to finally talk about it
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.840]  they finally touched it because there was so much attention on the work that
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.920]  that you had done and info wars had done that they were forced to talk about it
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.040]  and I think that's what we're seeing now is that that mainstream media which is
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.240]  really I think tempered the pace of things
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.520]  distracted most americans and really much of the world as to what was going on
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.280]  they've lost their standing and through the internet and through alternative
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.480]  media new media the public is able to say I'm just
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.200]  going to go around these guys and they're getting really good information
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:40.320]  I mean a great example of that I think is what happened with Syria
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:43.520]  I mean here was a case for mainstream media played the same cards they played
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.480]  in 2003 with the war in Iraq and then it was
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.600]  you know sites like you are sites like mine that are coming out and saying wait
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.040]  a minute wait a minute hold off because there's so much you're not being told
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.040]  I mean you tell me Alex when did you hear mainstream media ever talk about al-Nusra
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.840]  front ever talk about al-Qaeda in Iraq ever talk
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.960]  about the fact that al-Nusra front had sarin gas
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.160]  they didn't talk about it it was new media it was guys like you and me who were
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.240]  talking about it and and I think it is really a testament to how
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.080]  powerful new media has become that we did not go to war
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:20.000]  overtly with that's right in fact so many people just just always think
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.480]  we're the underdog and aren't ready for liberty to win
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.400]  liberty has won countless times in history when people believe in it
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:31.360]  and stand up and if you look at the metrics of new media real media versus
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.120]  what I call state-run media basically or controlled media
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.840]  they're dying we're exploding across the board and the White House regulations
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.080]  are said the only hope is to try to get us to
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.720]  infight with each other and to put out this info but that isn't working anymore
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.080]  and speaking of this info what do you as an award-winning journalist an
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:54.880]  investigative reporter call it when obama comes out and says i never
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.520]  said you could keep your plan under this bill
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.200]  or and then he comes out and says well what i meant was unless the bill passed
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.200]  and then that didn't work so he goes okay i apologize but his surrogates the head
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.960]  of the democratic party is in the news saying that no one's
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.600]  being kicked off i've got the video no one's being kicked off
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:20.160]  and it's not increasing rates on seeing in i mean that level of bald face lying
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.200]  and it's like they think they can still just get away with it
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.840]  i'm watching them like an old barn burned down in front of me
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  and is it that they just can't stop or are they so narcissistic
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.880]  they don't realize that they're butt naked and everybody sees
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.280]  their hand in the cookie jar what's happening because the lying
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.840]  it isn't just that that they've been caught lying now
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:45.760]  the lies are more outrageous what's happening
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.720]  well i agree with you i think the lies are more outrageous and i think it's a
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.520]  kind of a combination of factors i think part of it is
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:55.040]  that we've reached a point because of the left-right paradigm
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.480]  in mainstream media um those who go listen i have this theory that people
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.120]  do not go to media most americans do not to to get the truth
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.560]  they go there to be validated in the belief system they already hold
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.760]  so if you are already a supporter of the president you're just going to run to
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.080]  media who's going to tell you that it's okay he didn't mean that
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.120]  he's being taken out of context and look he's so contrite and
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.560]  and so willing to apologize i mean that shows what a great guy he is
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:25.840]  and then if you you know don't like this president already you're going to run
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.160]  to media who's going to tell you no no he's a bad guy
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.720]  he's a terrible person he's just a liar and you knew that already
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:34.320]  so so people are already divided on those levels i think where new media has
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.920]  the opportunity and is and is winning is where we say listen
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.240]  i'm not interested in how you feel about this president or how you feel about
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.600]  his policies what we want is accountability
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.800]  for statements that are made look when a president says
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.480]  these are the conditions by which i am guaranteeing because that's what it was
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.800]  when over 30 times you have said if you like your doctor you keep your doctor
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.400]  if you like your plan you will keep your plan over 30 times you have said this
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.200]  uh in in public addresses and your rates not gonna go up your rates gonna go
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.760]  down that's right it was a guarantee it was a
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.200]  guarantee to the american people that this will be the case and when you come
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.040]  back and say we have now forced the largest tax increase in american history
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.640]  the largest overreach of government in american history
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.000]  oops sorry i guess i was wrong i guess that's okay right
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.240]  i think there's a certain informed group of americans that's growing
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.760]  who says you know what forget about the politics of it this is about right and
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.960]  wrong it's about truth and a lie it's about being deceived
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.080]  it's about if you make me a guarantee and you don't keep it
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.200]  i'm not going to be held to that so i think that's what's shifting no no i
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.040]  agree and carol rove famously told the new york times and others at a cocktail
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:46.960]  party he said look whoever's in government controls reality
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:50.320]  will tell you up is down down is up will change the reality tomorrow
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.840]  you'll do what you're told or you'll lose your job that only works when you're in
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.080]  north korea or the jim jones compound when people finally wake up to the
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.480]  fact that it's a cult it doesn't work so i wouldn't call us left or right
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:08.160]  we are the reality community that's right and we are the survival community
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.840]  and the dignity community and just want to be free
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.640]  and it's not about labels it's about man this country's in trouble
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.520]  and so you're right though there's certain people that go to establishment
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.480]  republican or establishment democratic media
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.160]  just to hear their old version of establishment kool-aid
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:31.040]  but that isn't working anymore i agree i think the shift the shift now
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:34.240]  it's just growing segment that says you know what i'm done with that
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.840]  tired of it i mean it's all predictable now to me and so instead they say when
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.760]  there's a when there's a different voice a different voice that says
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:45.440]  what you're being told is a lie and here's why it's a lie and what we want is
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:48.640]  accountability and we want transparency and it doesn't matter
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.160]  what side of the aisle this person is on because we're going to go after all of
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.080]  them i think that's what the american people have
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.160]  been waiting for some of them and for the increasing number of people who are
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.960]  waking up to that reality i think that's where the shift is taking
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.400]  place it's a very powerful thing
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.400]  you're right and again it shows the shift has happened because in the past
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.560]  they would just deny they ever said that now just because of
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.960]  things like youtube and then your show my show and others who will show it
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.920]  that's what the pentagon said earlier this year about drudge report drudge
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.560]  report dot com they said look because of drudge report dot com
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.160]  and other sites like it they will show what we said one month ago
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.040]  and show what we said today and show the lie we can't do this anymore
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.200]  and so it's not that we even are being journalists we're going
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.200]  the emperor is butt naked you have lied to us
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:42.960]  and no amount of bull is going to work and i think that is what is going to
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.320]  bring them down the question has been swallowing we come back
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.920]  is how do you think the establishment is going to strike back
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.520]  that's the big question ben swan dot com is his website
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.720]  can follow him at ben swan on twitter our sites info wars
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:01.440]  dot com you can follow me at real alec shows
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.280]  you are now in the crosshairs the nsa and the fb i are treating you like a
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.520]  criminal and monitoring your every move ron paul said recently the evidence of
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.880]  the totalitarian nature of this government is on display

[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.480]  in the next hour then i'm going to get into our big breaking news story
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:31.440]  that's up on info wars.com today dealing with microphones being put up nationwide
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.200]  and we've proven that these gunshot detectors are really microphones that
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.800]  listen to you gunshot detector is just one program they have
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.560]  hooked into it a total cover and we have them admitting it
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.640]  in this article that's what's big that's what's breaking and then
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:50.480]  in the article we get into how the connect system on record scans your whole
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:53.600]  house and sends it back to microsoft it's beyond
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:57.280]  an essay and we go through the google microphones all of it
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:00.800]  now ben swan investigative journalist is our
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:06.000]  guest here and ben talking to you here you heard the question before the break
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.840]  what is the establishment going to do now that they see the real
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.640]  media being reborn filling the vacuum because the establishment media
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.720]  is completely sold out right well i think that we can expect a couple of
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.080]  things to happen first of all i would expect to see a big
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.040]  pushback to see syspa and those kinds of bills the sopa
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:32.240]  pipa acta essentially they're intellectual property
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.800]  bills as you know which are designed to protect content on the internet
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.920]  but those bills are a red herring they're really designed to say we're going to
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.440]  shut down a lot of these blogs and alternative media sites
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.160]  that basically take you know content from national networks or from mainstream
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:51.440]  media and they write articles about them and they show their clips
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:55.760]  by doing that you're able to shut down the entire side of even one piece
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.640]  of the intellectual property that belongs to someone else is found on your
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:01.440]  site so just like the nsa and that's what the
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.960]  bills for those that don't know actually said that's why they got shot down
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:09.120]  that's right just like oh you made fun of the nsa in your cartoon
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.720]  on in the magazine we're going to shut you down now
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.080]  it is a reign of terror go ahead yeah the other thing though
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.760]  keep an eye on is net neutrality and that's a very important bill right now
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.960]  net neutrality that law is is going before a dc circuit court who was
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.280]  going to rule on it any day now they're one step below the supreme court
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.400]  but net neutrality for folks who don't know what it is essentially is a law
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.760]  that says that that internet providers like AT&T or
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:41.360]  horizon or Comcast cannot simply discriminate against one
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.800]  website over another they have to provide the same service to all of them
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.400]  what i expect to see is that dc court will come back and say you know what net
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.120]  neutrality doesn't need to be here we're going to do away with it
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.760]  they're going to do away with it i suspect and when they do
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.560]  essentially you're going to now allow these big conglomerates to be able to
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.880]  say we're going to make it very difficult so for instance
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.560]  if info wars is causing you problems you go over to AT&T and Comcast if you're
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:07.440]  the government you say hey listen slow this guy down
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.640]  and so they make it very we've already had that happen we've already in
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.920]  australia and england and europe and at bus terminals you name it
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:18.000]  they just delist us and say that we're radical and bad and you just can't go
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.120]  there period right and that's what net neutrality will do by
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.120]  removing net neutrality uh as law in the united states you would
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.400]  essentially give these companies the ability to decide what people can see
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.000]  and what they can't see it's a very very dangerous bill
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.280]  i obviously look at it from from a news and information standpoint i see other
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.080]  people talking about it like well you know this could actually make it
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.720]  difficult because it's a pay-to-play system that's
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:44.240]  being set up and that's true but i see it much more in the
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:47.840]  danger of being able to control information i mean that's what this whole
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.680]  fight is over if you guys use the the the logo as a war for your mind what
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:56.080]  really is and in this case it's a war for for who's going to be able to put
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:59.760]  content out there and that's what net neutrality is all about well ben i've
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:03.360]  been doing this 18 years and all i've ever dealt with is this
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:06.560]  type of censorship and manipulation so what you're saying
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.160]  is going to happen they're already doing as you know they just want to
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.880]  actually have a law behind it that's right instead of just doing it fraudulently
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.600]  where you know most libraries block info wars
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.440]  as extremist just because the government database said so
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:24.880]  but again once the genie is out of the bottle
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:28.080]  i think it's already too late for them back in 60 seconds i want to ask you
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.360]  that will this create a mass strizan effect
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.440]  as they try to have a war on the new real media just like they tried to list
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:41.360]  drudges issuing viruses to delist it this is what they do
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:49.280]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today

[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:50.640]  okay guys
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:56.640]  this is vivis and butthead at the library looking in info wars
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:03.760]  oh my god
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:18.160]  you're all getting detention for the rest of the year
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.760]  all right bin swan is here with us investigative journalist bin swan
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.360]  dot com launching his own successful real media operation so
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:31.280]  what do you expect them to do you've said it attack us
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:35.200]  what they're already doing absolutely a fairness doctrine for talk radio
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:39.040]  it's all coming back but now that people have a taste for all this
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.400]  because they put i mean take my radio show on every major
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:47.200]  audio platform now it's in the top five in many cases number one and we're not
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:50.160]  even promoting this stuff what are they going to do in an open
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.840]  market where they cannot compete with reality what are they going to do
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.480]  they're going to try to censor but it's not going to work so do you think
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.280]  they'll be successful putting the genie back in the bottle
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.360]  no i i don't think so look i think one of the things they underestimate is when
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.200]  we talk about issues like net neutrality it's this idea that well if it takes a
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.720]  long time to load a page if it's difficult to get a hold of then people
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.640]  will just go someplace else the problem is is they can't go someplace else
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.360]  because these folks are awake so they're not just going to turn around and say
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:20.560]  well i can't get to your content so instead i'm just going to go back to
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.640]  listening to the same voices that i used to listen to
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.960]  they're already awake so um yeah for those folks it's going to continue to be
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.640]  you know they're prerogative to go and seek you out and find you
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.480]  where it's going to be difficult in in the strategic part of it
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.800]  is to say how do we block sharing how do we block this information from
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.200]  from being spread so easily and i think again go back to the the case of syria
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.640]  and syria is a great example of where you have this great information by new
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.640]  media but then spreads so quickly through social media through
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.400]  through email through twitter and facebook and
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.640]  direct you know sharing of content and because of that they saw how quickly
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.080]  they lost that battle so i don't think they necessarily are going to be
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:05.440]  successful at it but i think it's going to be a very difficult fight
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:08.880]  that's ahead well i agree with you but just going back to people setting up
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.040]  twitter accounts to show how they got their
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:14.480]  insurance cancelled the white house went through and had thousands of accounts
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.920]  deleted i mean it shows if they can censor us
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:22.320]  they will try they are tyrants and people should really take this personal
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:25.600]  because when they first take your speech they later make you a slave
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.760]  or even take your life historically i mean we're far down the rattle
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.960]  with these people yeah absolutely and then that actually brings me to this
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.000]  point tonight if you don't mind me mentioning this but uh today we actually
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.520]  launched a new project really pushing people towards
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.480]  jury nullification it's a little bit of an aside but i think it goes back to the
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:46.480]  oh no very exciting yeah but we're very excited about this it's called just us
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.440]  it's kind of a coalition of some new media folks and alex actually here on

[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.960]  this tremendous voice out there uh but and i know you're a big
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:57.200]  supporter of the idea but it's very simple it says
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:00.880]  instead of dodging jury duty go go volunteer for jury duty if you get
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.040]  called to jury duty go there because you have with with your vote as a juror
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:08.160]  that's the most important vote you have and when people complain about not
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:10.640]  having a voice or their voice being taken away

[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:29.920]  pretty old but still very articulate because we see juries nullifying tyranny

[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.640]  my personal experience about being in every one of these states most people

[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:31.440]  you're listening to alex jones
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:49.760]  the bill in this grave so that the states
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:56.320]  you and i don't vaccinate the preparedness ladies and gentlemen a lot of media
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.280]  people that are out there even if they're real
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:06.080]  journalists they revel in breaking things
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:10.160]  and obviously when you break news you get the ratings you get the advertising
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:13.920]  you're able to fund yourself that is a very positive thing
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:17.360]  and it's also fun to break new news and
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.840]  to expose bad guys investigative journalism is is really exciting
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:25.120]  the first time i caught them trying to take old people's houses with zoning
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.720]  rules and i exposed them and there was big
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:34.400]  fallout in the city and folks ended up getting indicted over it
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:39.520]  it it really felt good like nothing i'd ever done in my life
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.640]  it was the closest thing to it was like a bully starts a fight with you you
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.160]  kick their butt that's a satisfied feeling
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:48.720]  it's not satisfying to kick somebody's butt who doesn't deserve it it's
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.760]  satisfying when somebody starts a fight with you and you stop the living hell
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.800]  out of them and it that's just the way it is
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.000]  it's like a natural good healthy thing so i'm not
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.880]  criticizing folks that are into breaking things because that's how you
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:05.600]  are effective that's how you have a free society
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:10.400]  but a lot of folks are just constantly saying they're breaking this saying
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:16.240]  they're breaking that and most the time they're not breaking anything
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:19.760]  but it's good that they are reporting on it because
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:24.160]  the for the general public they are still not aware of it is what i'm trying
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:29.280]  to get at and i saw this article on friday
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:32.880]  on info wars dot com originally from story lake dot com
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:39.440]  from a local NBC affiliate in las vegas and it had the headline las vegas
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:42.640]  installs and tell a street light fixtures
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.240]  capable of recording conversations and that's a good report
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:49.440]  for our great writers and the folks over at story lake that they're doing
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:53.280]  it's good to report when the mainstream media finally reports something
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:57.520]  because sometimes you can wake up
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.840]  sheeple who won't listen to info wars dot com
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:05.440]  or who won't listen to prison planet dot com or who won't
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:08.320]  you know believe something that world net daily puts out
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:13.760]  but if it is mainstream they'll they'll they'll pay attention to it
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:20.800]  and we reported two years ago back in 2011 and also in 2012
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.760]  from their own promo video that in tele streets one of many companies
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:29.680]  getting tens of billions of dollars a year to put in
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.480]  surveillance cameras hidden microphones uh
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.360]  street lights that have cameras and microphones in them
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.600]  that's a very important piece of intel so the reason i give you some of this
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.720]  background info is that what we're breaking today
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:53.040]  isn't really breaking but it is breaking
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:59.120]  and again i'm talking i'm talking about this
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.640]  because i want people to not just become acclimated
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.920]  and conditioned to accept this now what is breaking is is this is the first
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.920]  article pretty much ever that i know of that pulls
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:18.400]  in a bunch of pieces of what's happening and puts them together
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.240]  to give you what is going on in the larger
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.440]  equation and so when i see a news article where
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:30.800]  we're reporting on one piece of something and it's on drudgereport.com
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:33.520]  or something you would think i'd be real excited about that
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:39.200]  and i am excited about that i'm excited that the local nbc piece
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:42.560]  is anti microphones hidden in the street lights
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.960]  listening to you you're actually seeing sanity
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.160]  out of people that don't want to be total slaves like dylan radigan
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:53.920]  flipping out and getting canned
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:57.920]  because he realizes there's no future if we don't do something
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:01.920]  sell out today to be destroyed tomorrow no thanks i'm gonna fight for a free
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:05.760]  future today to survive and thrive tomorrow
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.960]  that's the thing we're not heroes we don't have courage
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.040]  when we fight the evil folks this is what you do if you don't want to be a
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:16.000]  slave that's why i don't want people calling
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.680]  up saying you're such a hero you're such a great guy all day
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:25.360]  i love you i care about you i appreciate you i'm nothing special
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:30.480]  i'm just somebody who historically is aware of tyranny and who sees it
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:33.040]  happening again and so i'm running around like a chicken
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.960]  when my head got off trying to get people active so god bless the story
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.880]  leak writer
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:46.080]  who put this out is that mackayle felon i think he pronounced it
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.160]  it's good they did this because it is breaking that that they're putting these
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.560]  in in los vegas my point is though when i see a
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.120]  report like this i get upset at one level because
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.320]  i call up watson who's a better and quicker writer than i am and i said
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  listen since 98 at least they've put up microphones everywhere
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.720]  hidden in transformers street lights they dial in our phones and listen
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.400]  they use voice print i met with the whistleblower and showed the documents
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:18.320]  and you can go dig up the audio or these companies promote it in their promos
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.800]  and he goes send me the link and i go okay i will
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.240]  and then he went and found even more where they're now admitting that they're
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.360]  using these as microphones and the point is they
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:33.200]  consciously are rolling out microphones
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.840]  in the last
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.400]  12 years accelerated but it's really been
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.560]  the first when i first learned about this was in 98 but it been going on for
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.480]  about five years so i don't know 2003
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:54.160]  1993 till now 20 years this has been going on for 20 years
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:57.840]  they've got pin cameras pin microphones
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:01.280]  they've got pin microphones they can aim at an apartment building
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:05.440]  and listen to the vibrations through the glass i mean it is an orgy
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.800]  of illegal spying that is going on and they've got weird arguments in the
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.200]  police departments most cops don't even know about this
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.320]  it's compartmentalized the threat fusion centers that well if the
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:21.040]  microphone is outside an acoustic and it picks up vibrations off your window
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.920]  your window is interfacing with the outside world
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:27.600]  and so it's okay that we grab the communication when real common law and
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.480]  common sense says no it's wiretapping it's peeping tom
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.160]  invasion of privacy because you have the perception of privacy
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.520]  in your apartment especially when the blinds are closed
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.120]  and that you don't even know that one of these stinking things
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:46.560]  can be tuned with computer programs they've got in the
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:52.240]  late 90s to triangulate a quadrant and listen to what's happening
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:56.720]  200 yards away on the surface of a building
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.840]  and that's what's breaking is you think i'm excited that i i know
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:08.160]  all this stuff and here's the deal i'm getting a headache right now
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.320]  i'm getting a headache these people should all be arrested
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:16.080]  this isn't used to solve crime it's meant to protect the government
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:20.160]  and its criminal operations this isn't meant to make our society free and
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:23.760]  safe it's meant to make us slaves
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:28.800]  they have been using the built-in cameras and microphones on computers for 20
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:34.240]  plus years to surveil everyone they were putting hidden microphones in most
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.160]  digital cable boxes by the mid 1990s they've been putting
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:43.040]  cameras in government run bathrooms in the stalls for 30 years
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:47.040]  they have been committing crime across the board
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:52.960]  on purpose so that they can put in a total technological
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:58.000]  enslavement grid that the public isn't even aware of to study us
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  scientifically how we behave and how we operate
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:07.200]  so that there is almost no way for us to ever get out of it
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.840]  so these probes are to study humans like they're an off-world group
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:15.360]  they're not but they behave like it so there's no way
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:20.080]  for us to ever defeat them okay that's in their own words by the way
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:24.800]  they are studying us to destroy us they are studying us to know our hopes to
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:29.360]  know our dreams to sell us false hopes and false dreams
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.640]  they want to know the trends that organically come out of the group
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.360]  collective ether so in their words they can be the mind of god
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:39.920]  the pentagon said that 20 something years ago
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.680]  google said it five years ago they said it two weeks ago again
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.280]  all of them at their symposiums that are secret
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:50.720]  some are public but i've had sources that have been the secret symposiums
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.720]  some of their people have gone public in secret symposiums like bill joy
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.240]  and and he wrote in wire magazine in april 2000
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:03.680]  that the plan is to build the technocratic pentagon to dehumanize us
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:11.680]  for orderly extermination so again the plan has been made
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:17.600]  to use our tax money to build a surveillance control dehumanization

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:37.680]  joined us but what I was getting at is it's very
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.480]  frustrating to hear them go is it true the NSA intercepts phone calls and
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:45.760]  records them is it true they're giving it to certain
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:49.600]  economic groups for advantage I mean this is
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:56.000]  40-year-old stuff that's been going on for at least 20 years
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:02.480]  the different DVR proto DVRs digital cable boxes computers
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:07.840]  cell phones on record in the worldwide consortium
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.360]  treaties and agreements in the telecommunications act of 96
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:17.680]  it's all listened to I had AP call me twice last week and I was talking to one
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.120]  of the reporters like so you think the NSA spying and I said look
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.840]  I don't have time to argue this with you it's in the telecommunications act I'm
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.160]  hanging up and I slam the phone down it's white going
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:34.080]  you claim the Grand Canyon's in northern Arizona
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:40.560]  no it's there shut up shut up shut up I'm sick of your crap and I'm not
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:43.200]  trying to get mad up here on air for no reason
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.880]  this is all admitted they put fluoride the water to brain damage us
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:49.760]  it's doing it they're murdering us they're criminals
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:55.360]  they're the enemy period doesn't matter of the military and police don't join
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:58.080]  me they're already under attack and are in the
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.600]  same boat as alex jones that's what's so frustrating
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.600]  there's not a choice you join the republic you join humanity
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:10.160]  you join common sense period period period period
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:12.960]  period obama likes to say period all day
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.800]  he's a lion killing scumbag period he's a fraud
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.560]  meant to bamboozle you into a screwjob and create racial division
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:26.480]  period the NSA through homeland security grants
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.280]  has been putting up hidden microphones all over the place including
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:36.320]  in my parents backyard and I'm so acclimated by it I'm so comfortable
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.560]  with it that I've known this for six months
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.840]  since my dad talked to the installer because he'd heard from me that some of
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.360]  the city of austin had hidden microphones because I had the federal grant
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:49.680]  documents and my dad walked over and the guys engineer said yeah how do you know
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:53.120]  that yeah most some of these units maybe this
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:56.800]  one some in some areas most of them have a microphone it's hooked into the
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:00.240]  time-warner cable that's what we use as the data stream
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:04.080]  if it goes out the light bulbs if the leds aren't working we know but
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:07.920]  yeah it's a smart system it can have all sorts of stuff put in it
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  and my dad said like what and he goes look mr uh i'm not going to talk to you
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.240]  about it and I'm so acclimated I haven't got a cherry
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:20.800]  picker yet and gone up there and torn the thing open to show everybody
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:24.960]  you've literally got an imperial probe droid sticking its head over in my dad's
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.640]  yard and these new streetlights by the way are low
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.360]  it's only at about 12 14 feet that's about 14 feet
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.840]  and it's just sitting there and it makes me want to throw up that I have been
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.280]  acclimated I have been conditioned I have been
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:45.840]  destroyed I am pathetic I mean info wars.com has
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:48.720]  articles about this that are like another city got systems that have
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:52.800]  microphones listen to you another city
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:59.680]  it's much worse than I'm saying you can't just take this stuff as one piece
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:03.440]  let me show you some of these articles here okay let me show you some of these
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:06.960]  here's our article our main article feds deploy national spy system of
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:10.240]  microphones to record conversations hidden in plain sight the next level
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.240]  then I say snooping will detect descent via ubiquitous that means
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:19.520]  everywhere audio sensors and then here's the key
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:24.000]  we have the the voice print from IBM and 88 promo their
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.960]  tv ad we're going to play that when we come back
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.000]  they had good voice print in the 80s they've got voice print now
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.280]  that is 100% ladies and gentlemen and they can hear your inflection from
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:43.040]  hundreds of yards away and they know it's you
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.960]  and you're like what do I have to hide again folks Hitler
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:49.520]  what would he have done with this what would Stalin have done
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:53.280]  they are raping you they are stealing your privacy
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:57.680]  what if criminals had this technology well there are criminals running things
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.800]  so see just because you're not a bad person
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.080]  doesn't mean that they in the aggregate
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:08.640]  shouldn't know what you're saying under a park bench
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.080]  and again it's all illegal it's all a violation of the fourth amendment
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.880]  but just like they put in cameras 20 something years ago under federal
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:19.040]  control and admitted that they had law enforcement purposes
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:22.400]  they would always have john hurt the head of the public safety spokesman
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.640]  in texas go oh we at the department of transportation use it
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:30.000]  and there's no law enforcement use so I went interviewing and I said but law
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.960]  enforcement uses it but you can't speak to that because you're not law
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.840]  enforcement and he goes you ought to be a lawyer
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.640]  started laughing when we turned the cameras off and said of course they're
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:42.240]  watching everyone it's like it was funny to me
[02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:45.840]  this is the kind of stuff I'm talking about folks it's all
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.320]  being used pointed at you to break the country
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:54.160]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:59.040]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:36.880]  but no one in media reports on the wide spectrum system
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:40.880]  they reported all in piecemeal
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:47.680]  the decision has been made that you and i and our children in the future
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:53.920]  are going to be enslaved dumbed down and phased out
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:34:01.200]  that is official and the iphone of today the modern latest iphone
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:08.000]  has multi thousands of times more computing power processing power
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.240]  and speed than computers like the IBM system we're about to show you
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:20.640]  from 1988 and that's what people need to understand
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:24.560]  is that built in to a so-called iphone
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:32.880]  this is a computer that was the super computers in the 80s
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:38.960]  had less power than this little iphone super computers
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:44.320]  ladies and gentlemen this is a super computer super spy to listen to you
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:47.840]  even when it's off to track everywhere you go
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.480]  and more importantly spy on your thoughts your habits and everything you do
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:58.480]  this is literally a surveillance grid and they think you're so stupid
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:02.800]  they're now under homeland security for 20 years
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:10.160]  dhs has been around 12 but under federal funding for 20 years
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:14.160]  they have been deploying cameras and microphones hidden
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:17.600]  hooked into the threat fusion centers of the nsa
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:21.680]  listening to you and our article on info wars dot com
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:26.400]  feds deploy national spy grid of microphones to record conversations
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:29.440]  and i'll guarantee you they'll probably have mainstream media corporate media
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.560]  come out and say this doesn't exist just like they've got to have the
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:36.560]  democratic party saying no one's getting kicked off their insurance
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:40.080]  uh nobody is you know there's no premium in crisis
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:44.800]  and you're like but that's a total lie they are talking to their audience
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.000]  that literally thinks obama really cares about them
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.720]  now we've got libertarian tea party people like rand paul who i know personally
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:58.240]  and ted crews and others who are real people who actually care about their
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:02.480]  kids and who are historians and who have families that have dealt with
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:05.840]  tyranny like ted cruise
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:10.480]  in cuba who are fundamentally upset and fundamentally don't want to go down
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:13.280]  this road because it's a really dark road the global
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:17.840]  is to put us on and the whole system is demonizing them and yours truly
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.240]  and anyone else that is not a flaming authoritarian
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:25.920]  let me tell you who i'm against folks it's not white people it's not black
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:29.760]  people it's not hispanics it's not asians it's not gay people
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:33.680]  it's not straight people it's not dog lovers it's not people that don't like

[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.200]  it's people that want to wreck our human destiny
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.240]  it's people that get off on lying to other people
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:54.320]  and dumbing folks down that's my enemy and that's who i hate
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:59.200]  and they go oh that's bigoted too you're a conspiracy theorist
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.440]  you know history you're informed you know about smart dust
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:07.280]  you know about rfid you know about smart cards being a scam
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:10.000]  you know about how they want to make biometrics ubiquitous
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.280]  where you will not be able to buy or sell even if you have cash
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:18.320]  if the face scan doesn't say authorized my dad flew out of the country

[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.400]  and said you go right on through no screening for you
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:43.200]  austin airport and he sat there flying to atlanta and then to europe
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.760]  he sat there and watched him and he walked back over and watched about a
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:51.440]  third of people being passed through and they walked over
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:54.960]  and the person you know he asked him he said what and they go this is the smart
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:57.200]  screening

[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:07.680]  it was a different tsa person mr jones so see this is it you go that's great

[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:57.280]  and the whole time they'll be managing it they'll be fixing it oh
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:01.120]  another terrorist got in with the zikronian 12 mutagen
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:07.200]  and i'm telling you they're planning a dystopia where they call us in waves
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.760]  and the technocrats sit back and play this war off
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:15.920]  that's why all our insiders have broken down how they'll how they'll fund
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:22.480]  the big intel from atosh plumley is the pentagon and and turkey
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:28.800]  they're not just selling weapons to the al-qaeda insurgents
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:33.440]  they're they're selling weapons to Assad as well
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:38.560]  they fund Shiite they fund Sunni in iraq they fund the drug lords and have the
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:44.320]  war against them and the war against the users they are full spectrum
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:49.120]  they're like Shiva with all the arms folks they've got a thousand arms they
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:52.240]  run all the arms but they don't run the tea party
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:57.120]  they don't run me and they know that and that's why they're coming after us
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:01.920]  because we represent the alternative elite and i'm not
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:04.720]  saying i'm an elite but when you're actually thinking about master
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:07.920]  planning real social engineering all the world works
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:11.920]  you're automatically in the realm of real people you're automatically
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:16.240]  in the realm of debating with them and we're having a real debate going
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:19.280]  we don't think we should bring in a tyranny and genetically engineer
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.480]  everybody and exterminate everyone plus you're the ones that blocked
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:25.840]  industrialization to increase population to use it against the first
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:28.720]  world to blow the first world what is your real plan
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:34.800]  your plan is madness you're not even following your eugenics plan
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:45.360]  and so it just goes on and on and on and on and on ladies and gentlemen
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.080]  where they say in fact we keep the george cloney clip
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.400]  george cloney was asked a couple days ago it's up on info wars.com
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:57.280]  and this shows he's actually a smarter guy than somebody like
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:00.640]  Sean Penn who has trouble tying a shoelaces and just walks around acting
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:08.080]  important all day uh but george cloney knows that the majority of
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:12.320]  scientists say man-made global warming isn't real and isn't a threat
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:15.840]  but they put out that line that all the scientists agree but one
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.680]  first it was no one disagrees algor would say total consensus but then he
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:23.200]  adds but it doesn't matter let's just clean things up
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:28.080]  let's just say it's real so cloney goes with the whole insider deal
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.240]  where they're like okay it is a fraud i've been with big insiders
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.240]  in the environmental movement big big at dinner
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.880]  you know national household name worldwide if i said the person's name
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:43.920]  and they said alex actually we know this is all true but
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.680]  the the we're using too many resources it's hurting the earth
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:51.600]  this is a way to cut back on expansion and waste to put a tax on all carbon and
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:55.040]  fund public works programs worldwide and i go yeah that's what the third world
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.480]  leaders were told you've been told what presidents and third world countries
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:01.760]  have been told but i said the copenhagen document that just came out
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:04.720]  and this has just come out a few weeks before it's like four years ago three
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:08.080]  and a half years ago shows that they were going to double the taxes
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:11.360]  or right at double the taxes in the third world and i had these people
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:14.880]  totally freaked out by the end of this
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:18.480]  totally freaked out by the end of this which they should be freaked out
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.840]  and i haven't seen that person out pushing that anymore
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:26.080]  since then it's kind of like bruce willis saw my films and told rick link letter
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:29.600]  and later told vandy fair that i'm not a big
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:33.360]  mainline republican anymore there's a shadow government that runs both parties
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:36.080]  but i am a conservative at heart which is great
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:39.760]  bruce willis gets it he's a smart guy when presented with full spectrum
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:44.240]  analysis from full spectrum domination one could only say
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:49.440]  it's a fraud so cloney puts out the talking point of
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:52.640]  well you know 99 percent of the scientists agree with this so
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.480]  if 99 doctors tell you that something's really bad
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:59.600]  but one tells you it's okay you're going to go with the 99 but then he says
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.000]  besides let's just clean it up here's the deal cloning
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:07.680]  clean burning coal is one of the cleanest things we've got
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:10.880]  but i believe there's i know there's other cleaner technologies that we haven't
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:13.520]  been allowed to develop the whole fake green movement
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:18.240]  is make is meant to control uh innovation
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:21.280]  the best way to destroy opposition is by leading it
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:26.320]  so the globalists lead the clean energy and free energy
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:29.200]  movement so they can control it and sabotage it
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:35.440]  stopping real innovation to use the energy wars that are coming
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:41.040]  as a tool of global domination and a post industrial world to artificially
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:44.320]  coal populations during a global crisis that's been
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:50.240]  planned and engineered out of which they intend to have almost no one left
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:54.640]  if the leaders of this transhumanist movement
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:58.960]  proto transhumanist movement being the eugenics movement
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:03.440]  if they're able to carry this out it is literally a nightmare science fiction
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:06.320]  movie the likes of which no one has ever even imagined
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:09.360]  i mean you you could not have a movie like this it would be too complex
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:12.640]  no one could even understand it it's so horrific
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:17.600]  and giant but see for cloney he's just some soap opera actor
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:22.640]  who had family in hollywood so he knows you you play the part of the liberal
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:25.120]  and you get to go around and feel important and trendy
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:28.720]  everyone bows down to you and thanks you while genetic engineering destroys
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.840]  the earth overfishing annihilates the oceans toxic
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:34.480]  waste dumping and nuclear reactors are leaking everywhere
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:38.880]  total environmental meltdown on every front absolute hell on earth
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.000]  and you've got the entire environmental movement running around going i
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.480]  plug my car in which comes from coal most the time by the way
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.240]  and doesn't even work so that you feel good and feel like you've done something
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.120]  and get into being poor and having austerity
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:59.680]  when they planned a giant economic boom so that they could later turn it off
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.520]  and have you totally dependable so that it wouldn't be sustainable
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:07.040]  and now they're doing everything they can to make it not sustainable while
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:10.880]  saying it's not sustainable so they can pose as the saviors as it all
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.040]  implodes comprende george cloney
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.640]  the australian government has now come out and said no more socialism
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:25.120]  masquerading as environmentalism that's what their federal cabinet has said
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:28.160]  uh in the australian newspaper it's called the australian
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:32.160]  their big national paper they they say it's a total scam to shut the economy
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:34.560]  off and transfer the money to the third world
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:37.920]  they're even buying the the mid-level propaganda they were given
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.600]  see they tell the country leaders we're going to take the money from the rich
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:45.440]  white people in australia and give it to the poor blacks
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:48.480]  just like the hollywood folks think that and i'm like actually
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:51.920]  they're going to double the taxes on them as well this is meant to shut off
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.560]  development they go you mean i'm not helping the precious black people
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:00.720]  you see it it's all standard levels of propaganda
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:04.960]  we decompartmentalize taking right to the top of the pyramid
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:09.680]  imagine a pyramid with an elevator we just take you right up
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:13.120]  to the all-seeing eye and we walk right in
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.280]  we're right next to lucifer and we're here telling you the plan
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:21.440]  okay because that's how the universe always works is you've got to be given
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:24.640]  a way out and i realize cosmically that that's
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:28.160]  why the globalists allow me to live because they understand in god's
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:31.840]  creation the rules that myself and many others are here
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:35.520]  to tell you that the vampire is asking to be let in
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:38.880]  show that i could say don't let him in he's a vampire and you go no he's not
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:42.640]  racist get back and then have the vampire come into your house
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:46.080]  so he can literally tear you and your family limb from limb
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:51.280]  after he slowly sucks the blood out of you and that's what barack obama and
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:59.440]  all these other people are is vampires they enjoy tearing
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:02.960]  your heads off politically they enjoy watching you flail around
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:05.360]  and i told you the democrats will come out and say
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:09.520]  we need to get another democrat elected to promise that obama care will finally
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:12.160]  get there like the donkey with the with the carrot in
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:16.240]  front of it where it keeps plowing the field to get the the carrot
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.320]  they will get more seats on obama care probably unless we expose it
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:23.920]  in the house and senate unless we point out no you're no no don't get conned
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:27.920]  again you're not gonna get it you had free healthcare before the hospital lied
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:31.840]  to you
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:36.240]  you understand we have to expose this folks and now the head of the democratic
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:38.560]  party has said exactly what i knew they would say
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:41.600]  because they're talking to a bunch of people that are desperate
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:46.560]  and really believe obama loves them let's go to this clip of george cloney
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:51.200]  and we're at the end he admits the truth oh let's just clean it up but see it's
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.840]  not it's the excuse to say they've cleaned it up
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:57.520]  when they're actually not cleaning it up putting attacks on what plants
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:02.400]  breathe is not going to help the earth come print day here it is
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:05.680]  well it's just a stupid argument i mean whether or not
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:11.040]  this particular storm is anyone if you have 99 percent of doctors who tell you
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:15.280]  you are sick and one percent that says ah you're fine
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:18.880]  you probably want to hang out with them check it up for the 99 you know what i
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:23.840]  mean i i the idea that we ignore that we're in
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:28.160]  some way involved in climate change is ridiculous what's the worst thing that
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.560]  happens you know we we clean up the earth a little bit and
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.720]  you know and yeah i find this to be the most ridiculous argument ever
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:40.560]  and let me tell you what i'd say to cloney across the table i'd say cloney
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:45.040]  i can pull up government documents right now on more than a dozen major vaccines
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:49.120]  where they knowingly put cancer viruses in them and the cancer rates up 3000
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.840]  percent you weren't lit in on that were you cloney
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:55.920]  and he would say something like uh no i wasn't and i'd say do you want to be a
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:59.600]  part of that well there are too many people wait a minute
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:02.880]  you're kind of a porch elitist you're not in the real
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:08.240]  confines okay i mean you want to be part of killing
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.600]  all these people worldwide no i don't okay well let me show you where this is
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:16.960]  real and then i could show him where it was real
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:20.560]  and then i'd say now you have a decision to make because i'll assure you buddy
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:24.160]  the elite aren't going to want to be in the underground bunker with you
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:29.760]  when they're carrying out their emergency uh surgery to to get rid of
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:33.840]  humanity when they're the ones engineering everything to destroy the
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:37.520]  earth they are insane they they can't help their
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:41.520]  destructive tendencies the average top globalist likes to rape and kill small
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:44.240]  children okay so believe me nothing they're
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:47.600]  going to set up is going to end well
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:50.800]  you want to know what goes on at these globalist palaces it keeps coming out
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:56.000]  they love to savage small children so that's who's building our world
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:59.520]  i don't think we should follow them and george cloney deep down

[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.200]  learn about surveillance they're now ready to
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:34.720]  learn how bad it really is and why it's being done
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:38.080]  more importantly and so we have the article feds
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:41.600]  deploy national spy system of microphones capable of
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:45.600]  recording conversations
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.120]  and the whole thing is they lied and called them gunshot detectors as the
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:52.240]  cover now they think you're so dumb
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.360]  they're admitting the the the listening part see right now is the

[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:23.440]  were death panels because she gave the subsection now

[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:49.760]  it today saying the elites are exempt that's why we're in

[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:09.440]  raped of our liberties across the board by the globalist
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:13.920]  there's the article dnc boss wasserman shaltz dims will campaign
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:18.480]  on obama care get behind obama and you'll get it someday
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:24.080]  just buy another lottery ticket it's right around the corner dummies

[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:33.120]  that's out there and there's this story from my fox new york i told you this
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:36.720]  was coming honesty doesn't pay off for x
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:41.840]  homeless man he admit that he found some cash on the
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:44.400]  sidewalk
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.960]  look at this a good deed has come back to haunt a formerly
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:53.520]  homeless northern new jersey man james brady found 850 on a
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:57.120]  hack and sack sidewalk last april and turned it into police
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:00.720]  brady was awarded the money six months later after no one
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.840]  contacted police during the required waiting period
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:08.080]  now he went in to get public health assistance i thought obama care would do
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:11.360]  that and they said well you have 800 to 50 you don't get it of course they're
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:14.800]  lying to him through fraud folks and again i'm an expert on this because my
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:16.960]  family have been a bunch of them have been physicians
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:19.760]  and i know the real law and the history of it might have been an expert just
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:23.680]  common sense and i've had friends and family that got
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:26.800]  kicked off their insurance with the previous conditions and i showed them
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:31.120]  the charity forms and i showed them how by law these hospitals are supposed to
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.960]  render charity care if they're a charity and most of them are
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:39.440]  but they're not they're really greedy pigs just because they've overrun the
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:42.720]  system and are cheating everybody and the insurance companies are do you think
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:44.560]  something new they come up with will be better
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:47.920]  no it's gonna be 10 times worse is the whole point suckers
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:52.320]  that's what i'm saying stop being suckered i'm sick of it
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:56.960]  anyways so for 850 bucks they go sorry you're not going to get any medical
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:02.480]  emergency assistance they're not allowed to deny that care
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:06.160]  ladies and gentlemen in fact even a paid clinic
[02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:10.400]  if they call themselves an emergency room cannot refuse someone an emergency
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:14.160]  besides someone came with their arm chopped off what doctor would refuse
[02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:17.600]  them this is total bull and it shows how the bureaucracy
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:22.080]  has given people an excuse oh the bureaucracy says i don't have to
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:25.040]  the bureaucracy says and then of course now it's going to get totally
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:27.840]  destroyed because these doctors are acting like pigs
[02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:32.000]  and the system's acting corrupt it's unbelievable but there's your obama
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.160]  care their answer is they'll just try to give him some
[02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:37.680]  medication to kill him that's what they do now under obama care
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:40.960]  is just kill the old people that's liberal that's trendy
[02:58:40.960 --> 02:58:45.440]  that's loving that's happy and your racist if you're against it kill grandma
[02:58:45.440 --> 02:58:48.720]  or you're a racist and microphones on the street
