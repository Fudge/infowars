[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:16.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.920 --> 00:20.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.760 --> 00:28.040]  Hundreds of thousands of Greek citizens
[00:28.040 --> 00:31.760]  have attempted to storm government buildings.
[00:31.760 --> 00:34.680]  Citizens are being fired on by police.
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.400]  Banks have been burned.
[00:36.400 --> 00:38.480]  People are dying.
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.280]  This is the IMF riot.
[00:40.280 --> 00:44.480]  This is the takeover of a sovereign nation.
[00:44.480 --> 00:47.760]  And major economics publications
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.080]  are reporting that England is the next to fall
[00:51.080 --> 00:54.760]  with a similar debt ratio as Greece.
[00:54.760 --> 00:56.960]  The bankers believe that they have successfully taken over
[00:56.960 --> 00:57.320]  Greece.
[00:57.320 --> 00:59.960]  Now they're in the process of downgrading and imploding
[00:59.960 --> 01:04.080]  Spain and Portugal, then England and the United States.
[01:04.080 --> 01:07.360]  The economic conquest is moving forward.
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.840]  It is Thursday, the sixth day of May, 2010.
[01:11.840 --> 01:14.720]  We've got Godfrey Bloom joining us.
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.560]  He's in the same political party as Nigel Farage, who
[01:17.560 --> 01:21.040]  this morning crashed in a small aircraft.
[01:21.040 --> 01:24.720]  The pilot was taken by helicopter, very badly hurt.
[01:24.720 --> 01:26.240]  They had said that Nigel Farage was
[01:26.240 --> 01:27.440]  going to try to continue the campaign,
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.840]  but now he's in stable condition.
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.600]  It's worse than they had first thought.
[01:30.600 --> 01:33.640]  We've got folks from that party that
[01:33.640 --> 01:35.600]  was gaining so many seats in the European Parliament
[01:35.600 --> 01:43.280]  and in the British Parliament joining us, the UKIP party.
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.520]  And so they will be giving us info on that briefly
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.960]  in the next hour.
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.200]  And then Red Beckman will be joining us coming up
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.200]  in the third hour to talk about the banking takeover as well.
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.720]  Look, I've already seen articles like this in the past.
[02:00.720 --> 02:05.200]  Just to be clear, this is standard operating procedure.
[02:05.200 --> 02:08.960]  OK, I'm sure many of you have already heard about the NBC
[02:08.960 --> 02:10.280]  report.
[02:10.280 --> 02:12.560]  And they basically in this article
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.840]  imply that the students are bad.
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.480]  Talk about things being upside down.
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.840]  Students kicked off campus for wearing American flag t-shirts
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.640]  on Cinco de Mayo.
[02:22.640 --> 02:26.720]  You are not allowed to do that, and the Hispanic teachers
[02:26.720 --> 02:29.000]  and Hispanic students were interviewed by NBC.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.560]  They said, yes, we are insulted by the American flag.
[02:33.560 --> 02:36.800]  Now, that's the type of crisis we're facing.
[02:36.800 --> 02:38.880]  The average American, whether you're black, white,
[02:38.880 --> 02:40.240]  Hispanic, it doesn't matter, has been
[02:40.240 --> 02:42.560]  taught to be these quote, multicultural people
[02:42.560 --> 02:44.440]  that America is bad, and we've got
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.720]  to lick the boots of any foreigners.
[02:46.720 --> 02:48.640]  You've got Mexico, where they've been taught to hate
[02:48.640 --> 02:50.720]  the United States in their public schools.
[02:50.720 --> 02:53.800]  You've got 30 million of these people up here.
[02:53.800 --> 02:56.240]  And they're saying, look, you don't wear American flags
[02:56.240 --> 02:56.680]  to school.
[02:56.680 --> 02:57.240]  Do you understand?
[02:57.240 --> 02:59.120]  You don't do that in Mexico.
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.520]  And this is Mexico.
[03:00.520 --> 03:03.000]  The United States Southwest is Mexico,
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.680]  and that's what the mayor of Los Angeles says.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.120]  That's what all these representatives in the Congress
[03:08.120 --> 03:08.680]  say.
[03:08.680 --> 03:10.520]  This is treason.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.840]  This was done by design.
[03:12.840 --> 03:15.040]  And the media is hyping it where these people feel
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.280]  like they've been wronged.
[03:16.280 --> 03:18.920]  And I mean, I walked into a gas station yesterday
[03:18.920 --> 03:21.560]  to pay for gas, and there was a Hispanic fellow
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.640]  behind the counter.
[03:22.640 --> 03:25.440]  And he said, Alex, what do you think of, Melissa, your show,
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.880]  what do you think of the situation with Arizona?
[03:27.880 --> 03:30.080]  And then another guy walked up behind me who was Hispanic.
[03:30.080 --> 03:32.160]  He said, yeah, Alex, here were the info wars.
[03:32.160 --> 03:33.640]  What do you think?
[03:33.640 --> 03:35.880]  And I said, well, the country's collapsing,
[03:35.880 --> 03:37.880]  just like Mexico is collapsed.
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.280]  And I said, they have border patrol checkpoints 100 miles
[03:40.280 --> 03:42.440]  into the country where they search citizens.
[03:42.440 --> 03:44.800]  And all this law is doing is signaling force the law.
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.280]  What do you say to that?
[03:46.280 --> 03:47.880]  And they didn't say anything.
[03:47.880 --> 03:50.760]  But the point is, people are hyped up about this,
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.960]  and the media is deliberately.
[03:53.960 --> 03:56.840]  I mean, imagine any other country on Earth,
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.520]  unless it's England, Germany, or the US,
[03:59.520 --> 04:00.840]  it's very hard to get into it.
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.600]  And if you're an illegal alien, you get deported.
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.000]  But here, they bring in hordes of foreigners.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.800]  They tell them that anybody wearing an American flag
[04:08.800 --> 04:10.920]  hates them and is a racist.
[04:10.920 --> 04:13.240]  They invoke division.
[04:13.240 --> 04:19.880]  They create the self-fulfilling prophecy, the pipe dream,
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.920]  that anyone that says we should have sovereignty,
[04:22.920 --> 04:25.240]  anyone that says we should control our borders,
[04:25.240 --> 04:27.800]  anyone who says that we should stand up for this country,
[04:27.800 --> 04:29.080]  is evil.
[04:29.080 --> 04:34.120]  And the principal said, you don't wear American flags, pal.
[04:34.120 --> 04:36.280]  Do you understand?
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.960]  And all over the country, the illegals take over post offices,
[04:39.960 --> 04:42.520]  they pull down the American flag, they stomp on it,
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.800]  they run Mexican flags up, they burn down shops in Santa Cruz,
[04:46.800 --> 04:49.600]  and the media says, on ABC Local, well,
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.920]  they're doing what needs to be done.
[04:51.920 --> 04:53.280]  See how sick that is?
[04:53.280 --> 04:56.440]  But then they say Tea Parties are supposedly terrorists.
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.760]  You understand what's happening?
[04:57.760 --> 05:01.800]  We'll break it all down when we get back.
[05:01.800 --> 05:02.400]  Hi, folks.
[05:02.400 --> 05:03.400]  This is Alex Jones.
[05:03.400 --> 05:05.880]  I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:05.880 --> 05:09.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.040]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream.
[05:12.040 --> 05:14.760]  By breathing the solution through the lungs,
[05:14.760 --> 05:17.000]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.400]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[05:19.400 --> 05:22.800]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[05:22.800 --> 05:25.760]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.440]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly
[05:29.440 --> 05:30.840]  into the bloodstream.
[05:30.840 --> 05:33.160]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[05:33.160 --> 05:35.400]  of nano-silver products, you can now
[05:35.400 --> 05:38.440]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[05:38.440 --> 05:40.280]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.840]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.760]  are provided, making production fast and simple.
[05:45.760 --> 05:50.400]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.480]  about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.240]  Generator.
[05:53.240 --> 05:56.200]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:00.200 --> 06:04.440]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[06:04.440 --> 06:05.720]  Tyranny is here.
[06:05.720 --> 06:09.640]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:09.640 --> 06:12.040]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:12.040 --> 06:14.640]  The United States is now recognized globally
[06:14.640 --> 06:17.760]  as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[06:17.760 --> 06:20.160]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.240]  of a secret network of FEMA cares,
[06:22.240 --> 06:24.440]  now being expanded nationwide.
[06:24.440 --> 06:26.840]  This documentary exposes how the continuity
[06:26.840 --> 06:28.520]  of government program has established
[06:28.520 --> 06:30.400]  an all-powerful shadow state.
[06:30.400 --> 06:32.800]  Police State IV chronicles the sickening depths
[06:32.800 --> 06:34.600]  to which our republic has fallen.
[06:34.600 --> 06:37.080]  Prepare to enter the secret of world
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.680]  of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[06:40.680 --> 06:43.640]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.800]  on every street corner.
[06:44.800 --> 06:48.400]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[06:50.320 --> 06:51.400]  It's here.

[07:00.040 --> 07:03.600]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water
[07:03.600 --> 07:05.720]  is the most important factor in maintaining
[07:05.720 --> 07:07.600]  high energy and vibrant health.
[07:07.600 --> 07:09.840]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[07:09.840 --> 07:12.040]  should be at a pH level of eight or higher.
[07:12.040 --> 07:15.640]  Alkavision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.200]  of the most alkaline minerals.
[07:17.200 --> 07:20.040]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way
[07:20.040 --> 07:23.080]  to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.640]  and regain your health and energy.
[07:24.640 --> 07:27.080]  Simply put, 10 drops in the water you drink
[07:27.080 --> 07:29.320]  to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.720]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[07:32.720 --> 07:35.440]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[07:35.440 --> 07:38.720]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer
[07:38.720 --> 07:42.320]  cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[08:02.040 --> 08:04.160]  From his central Texas command center
[08:04.160 --> 08:08.560]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.560 --> 08:11.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.800]  Laging war on corruption, crashing,
[08:22.800 --> 08:24.280]  relies on disinformation.
[08:24.280 --> 08:26.560]  We're gonna cover the amazing battle
[08:26.560 --> 08:29.280]  against the bankers going on in Greece.
[08:30.280 --> 08:33.480]  The banking takeover spreading to the rest of Europe,
[08:33.480 --> 08:36.680]  England, and now the United States all by design
[08:36.680 --> 08:39.920]  as Bob Chapman and as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[08:39.920 --> 08:43.560]  and as Gerald Salente and countless other true experts.
[08:43.560 --> 08:44.600]  How do you judge an expert?
[08:44.600 --> 08:46.880]  Their predictions have almost all come true.
[08:46.880 --> 08:48.600]  They know what they're talking about.
[08:48.600 --> 08:50.080]  Webster Tire Police predictions.
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.320]  It's all online, all planned by the IMF and World Bank.
[08:54.320 --> 08:56.120]  We have their battle plan.
[08:56.120 --> 08:57.440]  We have their own documents.
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.840]  We have their minutes.
[08:58.840 --> 09:01.280]  We've read the books written by central bankers.
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.760]  Criminals love to brag.
[09:02.760 --> 09:05.600]  We know their battle plan.
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.800]  That's why it's so important for people to pay attention
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.720]  to what you hear on this show.
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.480]  Gerald Salente two weeks ago said
[09:14.480 --> 09:16.640]  we're gonna have bombings out of Pakistan.
[09:16.640 --> 09:17.480]  Boom.
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.880]  We have the guest on that know what they're talking about.
[09:22.880 --> 09:24.440]  When we talk about something here,
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.440]  it's because it's historically backed up.
[09:26.440 --> 09:27.680]  This isn't a game.
[09:27.680 --> 09:28.880]  This isn't a drill.
[09:28.880 --> 09:30.960]  This isn't a joke.
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.720]  When I tell people who are listening
[09:32.720 --> 09:34.440]  that they're putting hundreds of deadly chemicals
[09:34.440 --> 09:36.520]  in the water by design,
[09:36.520 --> 09:39.960]  I've had the head toxicologist of the EPA on.
[09:39.960 --> 09:41.280]  They know it.
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.680]  When I tell you that every major GMO crop
[09:43.680 --> 09:47.280]  is designed to cause cancer and to sterilize you,
[09:47.280 --> 09:50.480]  to reduce your fertility and finally sterilize you,
[09:50.480 --> 09:52.760]  we have mountains of proof.
[09:56.200 --> 09:57.600]  When I get up here and I tell you
[09:57.600 --> 10:00.920]  that Army manuals officially train Army captains
[10:00.920 --> 10:03.800]  in black ops and above how to stage terror attacks,
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.360]  it's declassified.
[10:07.240 --> 10:09.760]  I'm a political atheist, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:09.760 --> 10:10.720]  I'm not a liberal.
[10:10.720 --> 10:11.640]  I'm not a conservative.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.760]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.880]  I'm a freedom lover.
[10:13.880 --> 10:14.760]  I'm a truth teller.
[10:14.760 --> 10:17.640]  I look at the facts and I report them.
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.280]  That is it.
[10:19.280 --> 10:20.640]  I study history.
[10:20.640 --> 10:22.480]  I learn how elites operate.
[10:22.480 --> 10:24.120]  I've learned their tricks.
[10:24.120 --> 10:29.120]  There have been stabbings and riots and death
[10:30.800 --> 10:33.360]  all over the country during Cinco de Mayo.
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.360]  It is not even a holiday celebrated in Mexico.
[10:36.360 --> 10:38.640]  It is not even Mexican Independence Day.
[10:38.640 --> 10:42.120]  It is a made up Ford Foundation event
[10:42.120 --> 10:44.600]  for liberation theology.
[10:46.480 --> 10:49.480]  To bring in a group of people who would have gotten along
[10:49.480 --> 10:52.520]  and been part of America and to fill a large portion
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.120]  of them full of abject hatred of the United States.
[10:57.120 --> 10:59.760]  We're gonna be covering that in a moment.
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.520]  Students kicked off campus for wearing American flag tees.
[11:05.920 --> 11:09.440]  Cultural expression.
[11:10.640 --> 11:12.680]  They say that it was hateful culturally
[11:12.680 --> 11:13.920]  to wear an American flag.
[11:13.920 --> 11:18.240]  Freedom of expression or cultural disrespect on Cinco de Mayo.
[11:18.240 --> 11:20.160]  No disrespect all over the country
[11:20.160 --> 11:23.880]  as hordes of illegal aliens going to police stations,
[11:23.880 --> 11:27.880]  fire departments and private businesses,
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.120]  auto repair shops, as well as post offices
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.200]  and pulling down the American flag,
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.720]  stomping on it and running Mexican flags up.
[11:36.720 --> 11:40.000]  That is sedition.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.280]  That is military operations.
[11:43.280 --> 11:45.680]  That is what's going on.
[11:45.680 --> 11:47.400]  And you've got the Spanish media,
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.400]  the Tejano, the rap, I've read the lyrics of it.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.400]  It's how great it is to be a drug dealer,
[11:54.400 --> 11:56.040]  how great it is to be a coyote,
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.200]  how great it is to smuggle any legals,
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.320]  how great it is to kill the gringo.
[12:00.320 --> 12:03.200]  And this is all going on right under the surface.
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.320]  And Hispanic Americans are concerned about it and upset,
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.960]  but the media is telling them,
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.680]  you've got to be with these people or you're a sellout
[12:11.680 --> 12:14.720]  or you hate Hispanics.
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.280]  They're making a violent gang related revolution in America
[12:19.280 --> 12:21.640]  be associated with being Hispanic.
[12:22.760 --> 12:25.680]  The media, the government is selling this
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.760]  and covering up fire bombings and torch attacks
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.200]  and murders and killings going on all over the country,
[12:33.480 --> 12:35.400]  from Arizona to California.
[12:37.720 --> 12:41.800]  Racial attacks on Tea Party people in Miami covered up
[12:41.800 --> 12:46.080]  on and on and on while demonizing Americans
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.280]  who want to audit the Federal Reserve and cut taxes
[12:49.280 --> 12:50.600]  and get our country back.
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.320]  And Bloomberg implying that Tea Partiers,
[12:55.320 --> 12:57.280]  anti-government run healthcare people
[12:57.280 --> 12:59.200]  were the ones behind the bombing.
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.200]  You get nonviolent pro-America groups being demonized
[13:04.200 --> 13:07.360]  by the illegitimate criminal government
[13:07.360 --> 13:10.600]  who has brought the illegals in, paid their way,
[13:10.600 --> 13:13.280]  given them welfare and they teach in the public schools,
[13:13.280 --> 13:16.040]  not just in Mexico, but in the United States,
[13:16.040 --> 13:18.720]  that America is bad and America is trash
[13:18.720 --> 13:21.920]  and America is scum and they teach in public schools
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.600]  in all 50 states that the Southwest of the US
[13:26.600 --> 13:29.160]  belong to Mexico and then America's bad.
[13:29.160 --> 13:32.860]  When I was in public school, I was taught this.
[13:34.200 --> 13:38.480]  Okay, the government wants to break America up.
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.080]  The North American Union is a private corporate government.
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.440]  This country is going down and if the globalists succeed,
[13:45.440 --> 13:47.520]  I want all of you fools out there
[13:47.520 --> 13:50.520]  who support the open borders when you are getting paid
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.000]  a lot less or you're homeless and this country falls apart
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.280]  and we live just like they do in Mexico or North Korea,
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.760]  I want you to remember how you were sold fake pride,
[14:00.760 --> 14:04.560]  how you were sold by the mind controllers, a false paradigm.
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.360]  So we're gonna cover that.
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.040]  Student kicked off campus for wearing American flag T's.
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.680]  You don't do that in America.
[14:12.680 --> 14:14.040]  Do you understand?
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.120]  Times Square Bomber linked with CIA controlled terror group
[14:21.120 --> 14:23.120]  and we now know they were running drills
[14:23.120 --> 14:25.920]  in and around Times Square of a bombing that day,
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.400]  totally staged.
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.160]  Meanwhile, what did Bloomberg testify for
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.000]  before Congress yesterday?
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.600]  Bloomberg says, deny second amendment
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.800]  to people on terror watch list.
[14:39.800 --> 14:41.240]  What does that mean?
[14:41.240 --> 14:43.360]  They can put anybody they want on that list,
[14:43.360 --> 14:45.360]  over a million and a half Americans now on it.
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.480]  It's a secret list and then you can't buy a gun.
[14:48.480 --> 14:49.320]  And what does Bloomberg say?
[14:49.320 --> 14:51.600]  He says, let the FBI, if they think you might be
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.600]  an extremist, domestic groups where you suddenly can't buy
[14:56.600 --> 14:59.080]  guns and they're gonna come take your guns at your house.
[14:59.080 --> 15:01.200]  This is a guy suing other cities and states
[15:01.200 --> 15:02.680]  trying to ban the second amendment.
[15:02.680 --> 15:04.600]  This is a guy way out of his jurisdiction
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.320]  and this is a crook.
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.040]  This is a mafia don who wants to control you
[15:09.040 --> 15:09.880]  and run your life.
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.920]  And remember what Rahm Emanuel said?
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.520]  He said, we want no fly, no buy bill
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.360]  and it's in Congress.
[15:15.360 --> 15:16.320]  He's pushing for its passage.
[15:16.320 --> 15:17.520]  Bloomberg is right now.
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.960]  Where if you're on a no fly list, you're on a no buy list
[15:20.960 --> 15:22.840]  and they can expand that to a no work list.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.600]  It's just a federal black list
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.600]  where you can't have a job, own a gun, nothing.
[15:27.600 --> 15:30.360]  And remember what the internal documents show?
[15:30.360 --> 15:35.360]  The terrorists are the American people and now
[15:35.400 --> 15:36.440]  they're out in the open.
[15:36.440 --> 15:38.600]  And of course, a judge ordered Hitari release.
[15:38.600 --> 15:40.000]  The feds are appealing it.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.040]  Basically saying it was all made up with the Hitari militia.
[15:43.040 --> 15:45.280]  They're gonna be out there setting up groups
[15:45.280 --> 15:47.840]  to create the perception that there's all this violence.
[15:47.840 --> 15:50.480]  But when you've got illegal aliens beating up cops,
[15:50.480 --> 15:52.720]  setting fire to restaurants full of people,
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.440]  running around in the streets with torches
[15:54.440 --> 15:56.640]  all over the place, stabbing people.
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.600]  That's right, I got stacks of that news today.
[15:58.600 --> 16:03.600]  Stabbing people, it's oh, how sweet, how good.
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.320]  And the media is just filling these people
[16:05.320 --> 16:07.360]  full of righteous anger.
[16:07.360 --> 16:08.720]  It's totally fake.
[16:08.720 --> 16:10.880]  Oh, you poor people.
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.120]  Oh, anybody that wants to control the border
[16:13.120 --> 16:15.240]  or cut welfare to all these illegals,
[16:15.240 --> 16:16.960]  they hate Hispanics.
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.480]  They hate you.
[16:18.480 --> 16:19.680]  They don't like you.
[16:19.680 --> 16:22.400]  Get them, burn them, kill them.
[16:25.480 --> 16:28.040]  To the point of these people are so self-righteous
[16:28.040 --> 16:29.240]  that the school administrators said
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.880]  you can't wear that old Navy shirt.
[16:30.880 --> 16:32.240]  There's a photo of it.
[16:32.240 --> 16:33.600]  You can't wear that old Navy shirt
[16:33.600 --> 16:34.440]  with an American flag on it.
[16:34.440 --> 16:36.040]  You get out of here.
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.840]  You take that shirt off and you get out of here.
[16:38.840 --> 16:40.480]  This isn't San Francisco.
[16:40.480 --> 16:41.480]  This is Mexico.
[16:41.480 --> 16:44.200]  You get out of here right now.
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.600]  Do you understand?
[16:47.320 --> 16:50.200]  And they hyped the drug culture and how cool it is
[16:50.200 --> 16:51.400]  and how fun it is.
[16:51.400 --> 16:55.280]  And so Sugar Lantin found dead in Mexico,
[16:55.280 --> 17:00.280]  a beautiful young lady, 18 years old, Elizabeth Mandala, 18.
[17:01.480 --> 17:03.280]  She told her mom, I want to be a Coyote.
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.480]  I want to have Oslo and I want to bring illegals over.
[17:07.480 --> 17:09.200]  And so she went down to Mexico
[17:09.200 --> 17:11.680]  and was found raped and murdered.
[17:11.680 --> 17:15.560]  Oh, it wasn't sexy to be a Coyote, was it?
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.840]  Mexico totally collapsing and the people living in bondage
[17:18.840 --> 17:21.920]  and open sewage running through the streets.
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.920]  Oh, oh, she's dead.
[17:28.520 --> 17:31.840]  Like the 23,000 people dead in the last two years.
[17:33.440 --> 17:36.680]  In Mexico, now spilling across like all the dead ranchers
[17:36.680 --> 17:39.520]  in Texas and Arizona, murdered by illegals
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.880]  or 14 homes burned in one night or the cops being killed.
[17:43.880 --> 17:46.680]  Oh, it's not cute and funny now.
[17:46.680 --> 17:49.760]  Hey, listen, they don't even celebrate Cinco de Mayo
[17:49.760 --> 17:50.720]  in Mexico.
[17:50.720 --> 17:52.520]  It's not the National Independence Day.
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.200]  It's a made up type day like Kwanzaa to create division.
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.120]  The government is criminal and has forged groups of foreigners
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.040]  into political weapons to riot and burn cities on command
[18:07.040 --> 18:09.160]  and to vote to take the American people's
[18:09.160 --> 18:10.960]  private property and guns.
[18:12.320 --> 18:14.040]  The interest of the people,
[18:14.040 --> 18:16.200]  I could care less what color your skin is,
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.440]  but you better believe I care about the content of your mind.
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.440]  And over 90% of these immigrant rights people
[18:21.440 --> 18:24.240]  vote to take my guns and my private property.
[18:24.240 --> 18:26.880]  And let me tell you something like they said in Gonzalez
[18:26.880 --> 18:31.080]  before the war started in 1836, you can come and take it.
[18:31.080 --> 18:34.680]  Just keep pushing and keep driving you offshore banks.
[18:34.680 --> 18:37.120]  You think you can bring in hordes of foreigners
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.760]  to help slit the throat of this country?
[18:38.760 --> 18:39.880]  Go ahead and push it.
[18:39.880 --> 18:41.080]  Push it over the edge.
[18:41.080 --> 18:42.320]  Drive it even harder.
[18:42.320 --> 18:43.520]  Go even faster.
[18:43.520 --> 18:45.600]  We have identified the globalist.
[18:45.600 --> 18:47.480]  We have identified the bankers.
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.800]  We have identified in Europe how they bring in hordes
[18:49.800 --> 18:52.760]  of foreigners who push for whatever the big government says.
[18:52.760 --> 18:54.360]  We understand the treason.
[18:54.360 --> 18:55.920]  We understand the treasury.
[18:55.920 --> 18:58.200]  We know what's going on and so good.
[18:58.200 --> 19:01.440]  Good, go ahead and show us exactly what you think.
[19:01.440 --> 19:03.960]  Go ahead and kick five students out of school
[19:03.960 --> 19:05.440]  for wearing American flag shirts.
[19:05.440 --> 19:07.680]  Go ahead and tell them the American flag's offensive.
[19:07.680 --> 19:10.360]  Show everybody what's going on.
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.680]  Go ahead and have your riots.
[19:11.680 --> 19:13.480]  Go ahead and march with your Mexican flags.
[19:13.480 --> 19:14.760]  Go ahead.
[19:14.760 --> 19:17.840]  Flags that represent a completely collapsed narco-terror
[19:17.840 --> 19:20.640]  state that's been in slavery for thousands of years
[19:20.640 --> 19:23.360]  before Mexico even existed as a country run
[19:23.360 --> 19:26.480]  by blood-drinking Aztec demons who ran around
[19:26.480 --> 19:28.920]  and slaughtering all the native tribes.
[19:28.920 --> 19:30.360]  Oh, that's real nice.
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.120]  That's real good.
[19:31.120 --> 19:32.400]  That's something we need.
[19:32.400 --> 19:34.800]  That's something we need to hold up and say is good.
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.320]  That's something we need to promote.
[19:36.320 --> 19:37.880]  That's something we need to embrace.
[19:37.880 --> 19:44.160]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.440]  You will not pass.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.600]  You will not have victory over the Republic.
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.120]  The foreign banks will not have victory.
[19:50.120 --> 19:51.680]  You will be defeated in Iceland.
[19:51.680 --> 19:53.240]  You will be defeated in Greece.
[19:53.240 --> 19:55.040]  You will be defeated in the United States.
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.720]  You will be defeated worldwide.
[19:56.720 --> 19:58.160]  And you will not divide the people.
[20:01.440 --> 20:03.880]  Are you considering taking herbal supplements instead
[20:03.880 --> 20:07.240]  of overpriced and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical drugs?
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.240]  But just not sure where to start?
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.400]  Are you confused by the thousands of products and brands?
[20:12.400 --> 20:15.200]  What if you could find what you're looking for in herbal
[20:15.200 --> 20:18.520]  supplements from one source without the guesswork?

[20:56.800 --> 21:01.200]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[21:01.200 --> 21:02.240]  Gold isn't for you.
[21:02.240 --> 21:04.480]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources,
[21:04.480 --> 21:07.240]  one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing
[21:07.240 --> 21:07.760]  firms.
[21:07.760 --> 21:08.320]  I get it.
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.160]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[21:10.160 --> 21:12.200]  that the government is doing a great job,
[21:12.200 --> 21:13.800]  that the Fed will stop handing out
[21:13.800 --> 21:15.800]  trillions of dollars like bailout candy,
[21:15.800 --> 21:17.960]  that social security would be there for you.
[21:17.960 --> 21:19.360]  That's not what's happening.
[21:19.360 --> 21:22.720]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't
[21:22.720 --> 21:25.760]  fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value,
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.760]  or that your retirement would be secure.
[21:27.760 --> 21:31.240]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[21:31.240 --> 21:32.520]  For the realists, there have never
[21:32.520 --> 21:35.440]  been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[21:35.440 --> 21:39.320]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30%
[21:39.320 --> 21:41.400]  while gold has risen 300%.
[21:41.400 --> 21:43.600]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[21:43.600 --> 21:44.840]  to their portfolios.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.720]  You should, too.
[21:45.720 --> 21:46.840]  Find out what they know.
[21:46.840 --> 21:48.560]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons
[21:48.560 --> 21:50.520]  why gold will do very well, free.
[21:50.520 --> 21:53.280]  800-686-2237.
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.040]  800-686-2237.
[21:56.040 --> 22:00.680]  That's 800-686-2237.
[22:00.680 --> 22:03.080]  They helped to create a new world order.
[22:03.080 --> 22:05.360]  We are part of a new world order.
[22:05.360 --> 22:08.520]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[22:08.520 --> 22:11.680]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[22:11.680 --> 22:13.720]  through their own words and documents.
[22:13.720 --> 22:15.720]  The new world order really is a tool
[22:15.720 --> 22:18.160]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[22:18.160 --> 22:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[22:20.680 --> 22:23.440]  The United Nations would take over America.
[22:23.440 --> 22:26.280]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[22:26.280 --> 22:29.800]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.760]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[22:31.760 --> 22:34.240]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[22:34.240 --> 22:36.080]  I believe, first of all, that we now
[22:36.080 --> 22:38.240]  need nothing short of a world constitution
[22:38.240 --> 22:39.640]  for the global financial system.
[22:39.640 --> 22:42.480]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[22:42.480 --> 22:44.840]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite,
[22:44.840 --> 22:46.160]  and then everyone else.
[22:46.160 --> 22:47.280]  And I got news for you.
[22:47.280 --> 22:48.520]  You're everyone else.

[23:00.880 --> 23:01.680]  The problem.
[23:01.680 --> 23:04.200]  How do I cook food without power?
[23:04.200 --> 23:06.920]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[23:06.920 --> 23:09.640]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[23:09.640 --> 23:12.120]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[23:12.120 --> 23:13.960]  When your power goes out, the solution
[23:13.960 --> 23:16.800]  for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio,
[23:16.800 --> 23:19.720]  and producing clean water is the family emergency
[23:19.720 --> 23:21.120]  kit from Kero Stove.
[23:21.120 --> 23:23.640]  Kero Stove has been in business for over 12 years

[23:55.760 --> 23:58.560]  Kero Stove for family emergency solutions.
[23:58.560 --> 24:03.560]  I'm going live at prisonplanet.tv in the next segment
[24:03.560 --> 24:06.560]  for three and a half hours of the four-hour radio
[24:06.560 --> 24:07.560]  transmission.
[24:07.560 --> 24:08.560]  I'm going to say this right now.
[24:08.560 --> 24:11.560]  It's time for people to choose sides.
[24:11.560 --> 24:14.560]  You know, I've seen Gallup polls of upwards of 80%
[24:14.560 --> 24:20.560]  of Hispanic Americans who are great people saying that they
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.560]  want to control our border.
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.560]  They know it's destroying the country, driving down wages.
[24:28.560 --> 24:30.560]  They know that we're going to turn into Latin America.
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.560]  They understand that.
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.560]  They always talk about Latin America because that's
[24:34.560 --> 24:36.560]  the majority of the illegals.
[24:36.560 --> 24:40.560]  They understand it's being turned into a political weapon.
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.560]  But the media, by hyping this and saying American flags
[24:43.560 --> 24:46.560]  are racist, tea parties are racist, anybody that wants
[24:46.560 --> 24:50.560]  to stop the crime wave, they want to stop the crime wave.
[24:50.560 --> 24:53.560]  I mean, we're becoming like Mexico that's collapsed all
[24:53.560 --> 24:55.560]  over the Southwest.
[24:55.560 --> 24:58.560]  That's the main issue.
[24:58.560 --> 25:01.560]  And so the media is invoking race instead of saying, oh,
[25:01.560 --> 25:04.560]  it's totally reasonable to protect our borders and to be
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.560]  sovereign.
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.560]  No, our country's been seized by foreign banks that want to
[25:08.560 --> 25:10.560]  bankrupt us, just like Greece and Iceland.
[25:10.560 --> 25:12.560]  This is a political weapon.
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.560]  Look at California completely starting to collapse like
[25:15.560 --> 25:16.560]  Mexico.
[25:16.560 --> 25:18.560]  This is economic conquest.
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  These people are just being used.
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.560]  But I hear about boycotts of baseball teams or basketball
[25:23.560 --> 25:25.560]  teams that are in Arizona.
[25:25.560 --> 25:28.560]  I hear about boycotting gringo businesses.
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.560]  And then meanwhile, who packs the Mexican-owned Mexican
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.560]  food restaurants, the stupid gringos, the scum gringos?
[25:36.560 --> 25:38.560]  Who funds all this?
[25:38.560 --> 25:40.560]  So I'm going to say this.
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.560]  I'm going to boycott any establishment that's flying a
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.560]  Mexican flag, these car dealerships, these Mexican food
[25:46.560 --> 25:48.560]  restaurants.
[25:48.560 --> 25:49.560]  That's it.
[25:49.560 --> 25:51.560]  If it's painted on the wall, if it's being promoted, that's
[25:51.560 --> 25:52.560]  it.
[25:52.560 --> 25:53.560]  It's over.
[25:53.560 --> 25:54.560]  Zero.
[25:54.560 --> 25:56.560]  I, for the rest of my life, it's done.
[25:56.560 --> 25:57.560]  Okay?
[25:57.560 --> 25:58.560]  You're not getting my money.
[25:58.560 --> 25:59.560]  That's fine.
[25:59.560 --> 26:00.560]  Okay?
[26:00.560 --> 26:01.560]  That's fine.
[26:01.560 --> 26:02.560]  It's over.
[26:02.560 --> 26:03.560]  It's over.
[26:03.560 --> 26:05.560]  I refuse to have guilt for something I haven't done.
[26:05.560 --> 26:07.560]  I refuse to be called a devil.
[26:07.560 --> 26:09.560]  I refuse to be told the American flag is bad.
[26:09.560 --> 26:12.560]  I refuse because I know what this is part of.
[26:12.560 --> 26:14.560]  And it's time for everybody, black, white, Hispanic.
[26:14.560 --> 26:16.560]  To declare what side you're on.
[26:16.560 --> 26:19.560]  Are you for lawlessness and open borders and illegals running
[26:19.560 --> 26:22.560]  around, burning buildings and pulling down American flags
[26:22.560 --> 26:25.560]  and stabbing people and stomping on it and killing ranchers
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.560]  and burning down their houses?
[26:27.560 --> 26:33.560]  And, I mean, they've had all these, you know, brothers of
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.560]  city council people in the past and Austin are caught, you
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.560]  know, as coyotes and beating people up and every...
[26:40.560 --> 26:42.560]  It's just a bunch of lawless crooks.
[26:42.560 --> 26:48.080]  It's the lawless crook groups out of Mexico that are promoting with the Ford Foundation
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.840]  and the U.S. government this take away the Southwest for Mexico.
[26:51.840 --> 26:53.320]  It's not going to be taken away to Mexico.
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.560]  The entire North American continent is to be merged into a global corporate state.
[26:59.560 --> 27:00.560]  And I'm done.
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.360]  I'm not going to Mexico ever again on vacation.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.360]  I'm done.
[27:04.360 --> 27:05.360]  You understand?
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.360]  Never again.
[27:06.360 --> 27:07.360]  Ever.
[27:07.360 --> 27:08.360]  I'm done.
[27:08.360 --> 27:09.360]  The whole country will collapse.
[27:09.360 --> 27:10.360]  Good.
[27:10.360 --> 27:11.360]  Have what you want.
[27:11.360 --> 27:12.360]  I'm done.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.360]  I'm done.
[27:13.360 --> 27:14.360]  It's over.
[27:14.360 --> 27:15.360]  You understand?
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.360]  I don't have any guilt.
[27:16.360 --> 27:17.360]  I've done nothing wrong.
[27:17.360 --> 27:18.360]  And I'm not your slave.
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.360]  And I'm tired of the racism that the media promotes, the big, banker-owned media to divide
[27:23.360 --> 27:24.360]  everybody.
[27:24.360 --> 27:28.360]  The only way to cure this is to stand up and to tell these people, you're wrong.
[27:28.360 --> 27:29.360]  You're wrong.
[27:29.360 --> 27:43.360]  Just like when they had a Cinco de Mayo parade what, six, seven years ago, we had to dig
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.360]  that video out and put it online.
[27:45.360 --> 27:50.360]  I went out there with about 200 people in front of 10,000 illegal aliens and their supporters
[27:50.360 --> 27:53.360]  running around calling for this to be Mexico.
[27:53.360 --> 27:54.360]  And you know why I went?
[27:54.360 --> 27:57.360]  I called up one of the organizers of it and said, I'm going to come out there and cover
[27:57.360 --> 27:58.360]  it.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.360]  You're a coward.
[27:59.360 --> 28:00.360]  You're a coward.
[28:00.360 --> 28:01.360]  You're scared.
[28:01.360 --> 28:02.360]  You know what?
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.360]  I went out there and most of the crowd wouldn't even go with me to the front of that march.
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.360]  And I stood in front of that march and I blocked that march.
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.360]  And I sat right there and people threatened me.
[28:10.360 --> 28:12.360]  And I said, come on, come on.
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.360]  If this has to be the Alamo, right here it is.
[28:15.360 --> 28:16.360]  Strike me down.
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.360]  I don't care.
[28:17.360 --> 28:18.360]  I'm not afraid.
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.360]  If that's what it takes to get Texas going, that's what it takes to get the Republic going.
[28:22.360 --> 28:23.360]  I'm ready.
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.360]  I'm ready 100%.
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.360]  I'm not putting up with this anymore.
[28:26.360 --> 28:27.360]  You understand that?
[28:27.360 --> 28:29.360]  You tell me you want war?
[28:29.360 --> 28:31.360]  You tell me you're going to run me over?
[28:31.360 --> 28:33.360]  You tell me I'm trash?
[28:33.360 --> 28:35.360]  You tell me you're going to plan a San Diego me?
[28:35.360 --> 28:36.360]  Okay then.
[28:36.360 --> 28:37.360]  Let's go.
[28:37.360 --> 28:38.360]  Let's go.
[28:38.360 --> 28:41.360]  I'm sick of it and I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.360]  I know full well what's going on around here.
[28:43.360 --> 28:44.360]  I've had it.
[28:44.360 --> 28:46.360]  I want to live in peace.
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.360]  I want my second amendment.
[28:48.360 --> 28:49.360]  I want my property rights.
[28:49.360 --> 28:53.360]  And I'm not letting the bankers take this country down.
[28:53.360 --> 28:56.360]  It's time for people to grow a spot.
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.360]  It's time for people to grow a spinal cord and stop being intimidated and cowed by all
[29:00.360 --> 29:01.360]  this.
[29:01.360 --> 29:04.360]  Burning buildings, stabbing people, burning houses down.
[29:04.360 --> 29:07.360]  The media covering it up.
[29:07.360 --> 29:10.360]  I've had it.
[29:10.360 --> 29:12.360]  I have had it.
[29:12.360 --> 29:15.360]  In fact, I know Mike Hanson is listening right now.
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.360]  I know the Ritters are.
[29:16.360 --> 29:17.360]  They've got footage of all this.
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.360]  They've got to get it up on YouTube.
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.360]  So you can see how you deal with an illegal alien march.
[29:22.360 --> 29:24.360]  I'll tell you how you deal with it.
[29:24.360 --> 29:27.360]  I'm going to keep my American flag anywhere I want.
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.360]  And you can go to hell if you think you're going to stop me.
[29:30.360 --> 29:31.360]  You understand that?
[29:31.360 --> 29:33.360]  And I'm going to have everything that flag stands for.
[29:33.360 --> 29:35.360]  I'm going to keep my bill of rights.
[29:35.360 --> 29:36.360]  I'm going to keep my state sovereignty.
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.360]  I'm going to keep my private property rights.
[29:38.360 --> 29:40.360]  I'm going to keep my fourth amendment.
[29:40.360 --> 29:41.360]  I'm going to keep my second amendment.
[29:41.360 --> 29:42.360]  It's all mine.
[29:42.360 --> 29:44.360]  My ancestors fought and died for it.
[29:44.360 --> 29:50.360]  And the guy that wrote the Constitution for the state of Texas was a Hispanic, Tejano Texan.
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.360 --> 29:59.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.360 --> 30:04.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[30:04.360 --> 30:05.360]  Terany is here.
[30:05.360 --> 30:09.360]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:09.360 --> 30:11.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:11.360 --> 30:17.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[30:17.360 --> 30:21.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares.
[30:21.360 --> 30:23.360]  Now being expanded nationwide.
[30:23.360 --> 30:29.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[30:29.360 --> 30:33.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:33.360 --> 30:38.360]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[30:38.360 --> 30:44.360]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:44.360 --> 30:47.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[30:47.360 --> 30:49.360]  The police state isn't coming.

[31:05.360 --> 31:09.360]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[31:09.360 --> 31:12.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[31:12.360 --> 31:17.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[31:17.360 --> 31:22.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps.
[31:22.360 --> 31:24.360]  Now being expanded nationwide.
[31:24.360 --> 31:30.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[31:34.360 --> 31:38.360]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[31:38.360 --> 31:44.360]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[31:44.360 --> 31:48.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[31:48.360 --> 31:50.360]  The police state isn't coming.

[33:00.360 --> 33:22.360]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[33:22.360 --> 33:32.360]  The media wants all Hispanics to see themselves as part of the government.
[33:32.360 --> 33:42.360]  The government has funded every major immigrant group with liberation theology.
[33:42.360 --> 33:51.360]  The media wants all Hispanics to see themselves as part of the government.
[33:51.360 --> 34:01.360]  The media covers up the Santa Cruz riots with illegal torches, burning down buildings, restaurants,
[34:01.360 --> 34:07.360]  people barely escaping, stabbings, murders, burnings, killings, going on the last two weeks all over the country.
[34:07.360 --> 34:09.360]  It only makes it in the local news.
[34:09.360 --> 34:12.360]  You never see it on the national news.
[34:12.360 --> 34:14.360]  This is being done by design.
[34:14.360 --> 34:19.360]  These illegal aliens and their supporters really feel righteously wronged.
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.360]  And that's because the media is there telling anybody who has an American flag, literally,
[34:24.360 --> 34:30.360]  anybody who's for national sovereignty, anybody who wants to control our borders and cut the crime wave that's happening,
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.360]  anybody that doesn't want the states going bankrupt with criminal and medical care and welfare,
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.360]  anybody that does that is a racist and evil.
[34:38.360 --> 34:45.360]  Meanwhile, the media and the cultural systems hype up anger and disgust and hatred of America
[34:45.360 --> 34:51.360]  to the point of where high school kids can't even wear American flag old Navy shirts now in school
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.360]  because in many school districts, I've seen a lot of reports of this, it is found to be offensive.
[34:56.360 --> 35:01.360]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens all over the country and their supporters pull down American flags at fire stations,
[35:01.360 --> 35:10.360]  at auto repair shops, at a bunch of famous cases, at post offices and run Mexican flags up.
[35:10.360 --> 35:13.360]  You are supposed to become angry about this.
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.360]  You are supposed to not like what's happening.
[35:16.360 --> 35:22.360]  So they're selling you on the fact that it's normal for groups to burn things, it's normal for people to attack,
[35:22.360 --> 35:28.360]  that it's good that they're angry, that ABC News piece in Santa Cruz, everybody they interviewed was like,
[35:28.360 --> 35:30.360]  I think it's good they're burning things.
[35:30.360 --> 35:32.360]  You know, I understand why they did it.
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.360]  Meanwhile, they're blaming the Tea Parties with wanting to carry out terror attacks and saying they're racist,
[35:37.360 --> 35:44.360]  so Hispanics and blacks and others don't feel welcome in joining organizations and groups that want to audit the Fed,
[35:44.360 --> 35:51.360]  that want to cut taxes, that want to secure our borders and they have the Republicans coming in from the right angle
[35:51.360 --> 35:55.360]  trying to take over the Tea Parties so it can be controlled.
[35:55.360 --> 36:06.360]  That's how this is being done and it enrages me to see people so self-righteous who have all been played by the media,
[36:06.360 --> 36:15.360]  and hyped into boycotting America, and hyped into pushing racism and hatred of white people,
[36:15.360 --> 36:21.360]  as if it's good when these other groups do it, but then bad when anybody else stands up for themselves.
[36:21.360 --> 36:23.360]  And that's why I'm so angry today.
[36:23.360 --> 36:25.360]  I mean, here's an article out of NBC.
[36:25.360 --> 36:26.360]  What a whitewash.
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.360]  Students kicked off campus for wearing American flag t-shirts.
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.360]  Freedom of expression or cultural disrespect on Cinco de Mayo.
[36:33.360 --> 36:39.360]  See, if somebody thinks your American flag is disrespectful, you don't get to have it now.
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.360]  But they get to wear their Mexican flags.
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.360]  Well, why are you here if you want to fly Mexican flags?
[36:44.360 --> 36:45.360]  Why don't you want to be an American?
[36:45.360 --> 36:51.360]  I mean, I don't fly English flags or German flags because I've got some of that in my ancestry.
[36:51.360 --> 36:52.360]  It's ridiculous.
[36:52.360 --> 36:54.360]  I am not a hyphenated American.
[36:54.360 --> 36:57.360]  And the globalists want to destroy our sovereignty.
[36:57.360 --> 37:00.360]  Bill Clinton said we've got to merge the countries for social security.
[37:00.360 --> 37:06.360]  For six years, the U.S. government's been paying social security payments to Mexico.
[37:06.360 --> 37:08.360]  I mean, this is really going on.
[37:08.360 --> 37:10.360]  The country is dying.
[37:10.360 --> 37:13.360]  And they've now moved in these giant groups of people.
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.360]  They've taught them to hate America.
[37:15.360 --> 37:22.360]  They've taught them to hate anybody that says, hey, wait a minute, so that it's now a huge political weapon in our country.
[37:22.360 --> 37:24.360]  It has to stop now.
[37:24.360 --> 37:32.360]  No matter what color you are, the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Second Amendment is what we should support because that's what protects us and our families and our future.
[37:32.360 --> 37:39.360]  And the bottom line is in every poll, over 90% of the illegal aliens and their supporters, it's a religion of hating America.
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.360]  They are for gun control and open borders and more taxes.
[37:43.360 --> 37:44.360]  Okay?
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.360]  So we must stand against this now.
[37:47.360 --> 37:49.360]  I stand up against injustice.
[37:49.360 --> 37:50.360]  This is injustice.
[37:50.360 --> 37:52.360]  This is a mind game.
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.360]  To say the people wearing American flags are the bad ones.
[37:56.360 --> 38:07.360]  And to let illegal aliens all over the country, hundreds of videos on YouTube, beat up veterans groups, beat up groups of blacks, whites and Hispanics out there calling for sovereignty.
[38:07.360 --> 38:14.360]  I mean, in Arizona, in California, almost every Fourth of July parade, even if it has nothing to do with the illegals, people get beat up.
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.360]  The illegals come out with their Mexican flags and they beat people up and the cops let them do it.
[38:19.360 --> 38:21.360]  I have played countless videos here.
[38:21.360 --> 38:22.360]  This is outrageous.
[38:22.360 --> 38:26.360]  And that was a minority of the Hispanics that were like this.
[38:26.360 --> 38:27.360]  Okay?
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.360]  And I learned about this from Hispanic listeners many years ago, warning me about it.
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  Okay?
[38:33.360 --> 38:43.360]  But now the media is trying to brainwash until all Hispanics, they've got to, quote, choose the side of la reconquista, of la raza, of the race.
[38:43.360 --> 38:52.360]  And then once they have everybody in a race consciousness, they can attach the entire political agenda to that race consciousness message.
[38:52.360 --> 38:53.360]  Now I'm going to get into Greece.
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.360]  I'm going to get into the real attack on civil liberties here in the United States.
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.360]  Open calls to arrest any U.S. citizens without trial that the government calls extremist.
[39:02.360 --> 39:12.360]  This is out in the open being promoted by Chuckie Schumer, by Bloomberg, by Rahm Emanuel, by John McCain, and by many others.
[39:12.360 --> 39:14.360]  And we have all the legislation.
[39:14.360 --> 39:16.360]  I mean, look at this.
[39:16.360 --> 39:23.360]  S-3081, this is the detention of belligerence act.
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.360]  And it just says, for any reason, the Pentagon wishes citizens could be arrested and never seen again.
[39:29.360 --> 39:30.360]  Okay?
[39:30.360 --> 39:39.360]  And you got the media whining and crying and saying, cops, if they pull somebody over and have probable cause and ask for ID and they're illegal, they are to arrest them.
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.360]  Oh my gosh, it's so horrible.
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  What are we doing?
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  We need to stand up for the Bill of Rights.
[39:45.360 --> 39:47.360]  That is in the Bill of Rights.
[39:47.360 --> 39:50.360]  That is what the federal government's supposed to do.
[39:50.360 --> 39:53.360]  But meanwhile, oh, where's the Democratic Party?
[39:53.360 --> 40:03.360]  Where's the Republican Party all upset about all of us citizens being stripped of our citizens' rights whenever a secret military group wants to?
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.360]  Do you see how sickening this is?
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.360]  And they're all over TV saying you want us to keep you safe from truck bombs.
[40:10.360 --> 40:14.360]  We've got to be able to get rid of due process and habeas corpus.
[40:14.360 --> 40:17.360]  We've got to be able to arrest people and take them away to a dungeon.
[40:17.360 --> 40:24.360]  They've got Border Patrol checkpoints 50, 75, 100 miles under law, up to 100 miles in the entire border.
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.360]  In Vermont, they just pull citizens over and beat the daylights out of them.
[40:28.360 --> 40:39.360]  How many YouTube videos have you seen of them pulling over black people, white people, Hispanics, who speak perfect English, have their ID, and they say, we're going to search your car, 100 miles in, and they just beat the living snot out of you.
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.360]  Oh, where's all the civil rights groups on that? Where are they?
[40:43.360 --> 40:50.360]  We're going into a dungeon system and people from Eastern Europe, not against them.
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.360]  But people from Russia, not against them. People from China, not against them.
[40:54.360 --> 40:57.360]  People from Mexico, Latin America, not against them.
[40:57.360 --> 41:06.360]  But they have grown up with police on the street corners with machine guns and tanks and armored vehicles and surveillance and people disappearing into dungeons.
[41:06.360 --> 41:12.360]  And they're being promised goodies by the government if they'll come here and vote for tyranny.
[41:12.360 --> 41:18.360]  It's very, very simple. This is life and death for this country.
[41:18.360 --> 41:25.360]  Look at your children. Decide, do you want them to be an American or do you want them to be a globalist?
[41:25.360 --> 41:33.360]  Do you stand with the Raza of America, the red, white, and blue? Is that your color or is it brown?
[41:33.360 --> 41:37.360]  I have decried the white supremacists because they're federally controlled for division.
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.360]  I have decried the black separatist, nationalist, racist because they're funded by the government in every major case.
[41:42.360 --> 41:51.360]  I have decried the hordes of people pouring across large percentages of them totally amped up with hate.
[41:51.360 --> 41:58.360]  And you've got the U.S.-owned, big corporate-owned Spanish radio and TV offering the free food, the free t-shirts,
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.360]  telling them, come out to this big, you know, fun family rally. The gringos want to arrest you.
[42:04.360 --> 42:08.360]  The gringos are racist. The gringos hate you. The gringos want to get you.
[42:08.360 --> 42:13.360]  And they've got these people so mad they're out there stabbing and burning and attacking.
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.360]  And the media says, that's good. That is mind control, okay? So it's simple.
[42:20.360 --> 42:23.360]  They plan on us being at each other's throats and having a war.
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.360]  And so if white people and others cow and say, I'm sorry. I'm evil. You're right. Slip my throat. I'm bad.
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.360]  If you have that attitude, then the mind control is going to work.
[42:34.360 --> 42:39.360]  See, these people are under mind control, folks. They really believe it's their right to come to the most open nation on Earth
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.360]  that gives them all this welfare and everything and that everyone is racist and hates them
[42:43.360 --> 42:47.360]  and that any Hispanics that decide to be Americans are evil.
[42:47.360 --> 42:53.360]  See, this is an attempt to get that 75, 80% of Hispanics who are bedrock members of this community
[42:53.360 --> 42:58.360]  and wonderful people. From my experience and research, I mean, it wouldn't even be that bad
[42:58.360 --> 43:03.360]  if we had 30 million illegals here who wanted to be like George Washington's Second Amendment private property.
[43:03.360 --> 43:09.360]  But no, no, that's not how this is going to work. Have you seen the Communist revolutions in Latin America?
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.360]  Do you want to live like that? Because that's what the bankers are funding.
[43:13.360 --> 43:19.360]  It's a Communist-style takeover of this country. There's no longer any doubt about it.
[43:19.360 --> 43:26.360]  And let me tell you, it just outrageous me to see people all full of themselves to the point that they're pulling down American flags all over the country.
[43:26.360 --> 43:33.360]  They are attacking police. They are burning down buildings. They are stabbing people. They are killing ranchers every week.
[43:33.360 --> 43:41.360]  They are murdering people. They are murdering their own people. It is just a lawless, criminal cauldron south of the border that has completely collapsed.
[43:41.360 --> 43:47.360]  We must. It's like if your neighbor's house is on fire, you better get out there and spray water on the side of your house so it doesn't burn down.
[43:47.360 --> 43:53.360]  And I'm here spraying water on the side of the house going, my God, look at that fire. It's starting to light shingles on my roof.
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.360]  I'm trying to put, and they're like, that's racist to be trying to put those shingles out.
[43:57.360 --> 44:03.360]  You need to throw a few torches into your house. This is a wonderful thing we've got here in Mexico.
[44:03.360 --> 44:10.360]  The third most corrupt nation on earth. Now continuing here, students kicked off campus for wearing American flag tees.
[44:10.360 --> 44:15.360]  And it continues, freedom of expression or cultural disrespect of Cinco de Mayo.
[44:15.360 --> 44:21.360]  So the article's like, oh, should you be allowed to wear American flags? Imagine how absurdist that is.
[44:21.360 --> 44:28.360]  See, oh, maybe this is good. Yeah. See, that's just like Europe.
[44:28.360 --> 44:37.360]  All over England, they just put up signs outside internet cafes on the street saying, if you visit any extremist material as listed by police, you are going to jail.
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.360]  That article's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. In fact, print that again for me. It's a Steve Watson article. Thank you.
[44:43.360 --> 44:50.360]  Students kicked off campus for wearing American flag tees. Freedom of expression or cultural disrespect of Cinco de Mayo.
[44:50.360 --> 44:59.360]  Maybe we can just take the stars off and put a Mexican eagle in the blue field with a snake in its hand. Maybe that would be okay then.
[44:59.360 --> 45:10.360]  On any other day at Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, Daniel Gala and his four friends would not even be noticed wearing T-shirts with American flag.
[45:10.360 --> 45:17.360]  But Cinco de Mayo is not any typical day, especially on campus, with a large Mexican American student population.
[45:17.360 --> 45:26.360]  But they're not Mexican American. I'll guarantee you these are the kids, the kids of illegal aliens who are all full of la raza and matcha and they teach it.
[45:26.360 --> 45:37.360]  Those inside the race, everything, those outside the race, nothing. That is Ku Klux Klan and I've protested them and I'm going to protest you because I'm somebody who's steadfast and tells the truth, period.
[45:37.360 --> 45:43.360]  By the way, you love your little liberal leaders, illegal aliens. Why are they setting up Planned Parenthoods in your neighborhoods?
[45:43.360 --> 45:49.360]  Oh, that's good to kill your babies. See, I'm racist because I don't want you to kill your babies. That's how screwed up you are.
[45:49.360 --> 45:59.360]  That's how under mind control you are. Oh, I'm a white devil because I don't want blacks to abort their babies. 50 plus percent of them. See how that sickening, twisting mind control works?
[45:59.360 --> 46:05.360]  No. I look at something and I decide what is justice, what is for the Republic, what is for freedom, and what do the globalist want?
[46:05.360 --> 46:15.360]  If the globalist are for something, I'm against it. And the globalist are for open borders and have filled these people full of hatred as a political weapon. That is treason.
[46:15.360 --> 46:21.360]  Notice Bloomberg says arrest citizens with no rights and put us in dungeons. I'm going to cover that in a moment.
[46:21.360 --> 46:31.360]  But oh, he said, come to New York, he legals. Come to New York.
[46:31.360 --> 46:47.360]  Golly, I guess you pronounce it, G-A-L-L-I, says he and his friends were sitting at a table during a brunch break when the vice principal asked the two boys to remove American flag bandanas that they were wearing on their heads and for the others to turn their American flag t-shirts inside out.
[46:47.360 --> 47:05.360]  When they refused, the boys were ordered to go to the principal's office. They said we could wear it on any other day, Daniel said, but today is sensitive to Mexican Americans because it's supposed to be their holiday, so we are not allowed to wear it today.
[47:05.360 --> 47:11.360]  The boys, said the administrator, called the t-shirts incendiary that would lead to fights on campus.
[47:11.360 --> 47:19.360]  And that's how they're going to get rid of all our free speech in America. Oh, does it hurt someone's feelings? You can't have it. Student told Cinco de Mayo is not the day for patriotism.
[47:19.360 --> 47:27.360]  They said we tried to go back to class with our shirts not taken off. They said it was defiance and we would get suspended.
[47:27.360 --> 47:41.360]  Dominique Marcel said, the boys really had no choice and went home to avoid suspension. They say they are angry. We were not allowed to express their American pride. Their parents are just as upset.
[47:41.360 --> 47:55.360]  Of course, these kids are in there in this majority-lalient school hearing about the takeover of American Oslo. And I guarantee you, we get these kids on. They're going to go, yeah, this is all we hear is how America scum and how the illegals are taking over and how go back to Europe pilgrim and we're going to get you.
[47:55.360 --> 48:04.360]  I will guarantee it. I bet this school is taking down the American flag and run up the American flag. I mean, taking down the American flag and run up the Mexican flag.
[48:04.360 --> 48:14.360]  I will guarantee you that there's been discussions at this school pulling down the American flag on Cinco de Mayo. In fact, I bet this school did it. I bet if you go into a lot of schools, do do it.
[48:14.360 --> 48:26.360]  Now, you take that American flag down. Can't have your American flags on. Can't have the American flag outside. But to many Americans, to many Mexican American students at Live Oak, this was a big deal.
[48:26.360 --> 48:38.360]  They say they were offended by the five boys and others for wearing American colors on a Mexican holiday. It's a gang thing. You see, it's a gang thing. And that's what nations are. It's what group do you belong to.
[48:38.360 --> 48:45.360]  Well, I belong to the red, white and blue. I belong to the red, white and blue. That's why infowars.com is red, white and blue. If you go to the website, it's red, white and blue.
[48:45.360 --> 48:53.360]  That's the colors of infowars.com. Red, white and blue. Okay, it's not red, green and white. You understand? Period. Period.
[48:53.360 --> 49:02.360]  Because that flag symbolizes my Bill of Rights and my Constitution that protects me from tyranny.
[49:02.360 --> 49:10.360]  The boys really had no choice and went home to avoid suspension. It goes on. But to many Mexican American students at Live Oak, this was a big deal.
[49:10.360 --> 49:17.360]  They say they were offended by the five boys and others for wearing American colors on a Mexican holiday.
[49:17.360 --> 49:24.360]  And the school probably did have to tell them to take it off. They're probably going to get attacked. You know, you don't, you don't wear that here, pal. This is Mexico.
[49:24.360 --> 49:36.360]  I think they should apologize because it's a Mexican heritage day and see a new as of Live Oak High students said, we do not deserve to get disrespected like that.
[49:36.360 --> 49:42.360]  She said, we wouldn't do that on the 4th of July. What are you talking about, lady? All over the country, people get beat up at 4th of July per raise.
[49:42.360 --> 49:50.360]  You're not allowed to have those in LA. You're not allowed to. I mean, I can show you countless videos right now. Just go Google, 4th of July, rally, attack by illegals.
[49:50.360 --> 49:57.360]  I mean, there'll just be hundreds of videos, blood, two by fours, old ladies being beaten ahead by full grown men, the cops just stand by and go, we love it.
[49:57.360 --> 50:07.360]  Where would the government? The government wants this. I mean, literally, that's what's so sick is we're fighting the bankers, the corrupt government that's taken over, and the illegal alien hordes.
[50:07.360 --> 50:16.360]  I mean, look at 4th of July all the time. They haul down American flags all over the country.
[50:16.360 --> 50:22.360]  And they went on to say they want an apology. As for an apology, the boys and their families say, fat chance. I'm not going to apologize.
[50:22.360 --> 50:30.360]  I did nothing wrong. I went along with my normal day. I might have worn an American flag, but I'm an American and I'm proud to be an American.
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.360]  The five boys and their families met with Morgan Hill Unified School District officials Wednesday night.
[50:35.360 --> 50:40.360]  The district released a statement saying it does not agree with how Live Oak School administrators did it, how they handled it.
[50:40.360 --> 50:47.360]  Look, here's the deal. When you can't wear an American flag in America, I mean, what does that tell you about this illegal alien group?
[50:47.360 --> 50:55.360]  What does that tell you? You better go read their literature. You better go find out what they're saying. They're saying as soon as they can, they're going to kill every white person in this country.
[50:55.360 --> 51:00.360]  Now, most Hispanics aren't for that. They need to speak out against it. The threat is these illegals.
[51:00.360 --> 51:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[51:05.360 --> 51:10.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[51:10.360 --> 51:15.360]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.360]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[51:21.360 --> 51:25.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.360]  And now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[51:29.360 --> 51:36.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[51:36.360 --> 51:41.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[51:41.360 --> 51:46.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[51:46.360 --> 51:52.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[52:08.360 --> 52:13.360]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[52:13.360 --> 52:18.360]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.360]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.360 --> 52:25.360]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[52:25.360 --> 52:33.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:33.360 --> 52:39.360]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.360]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.360 --> 52:48.360]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[54:17.360 --> 54:32.360]  We have to speak out against this, especially Hispanic Americans, because the globalists are trying to force all Hispanic Americans to adopt this view so they can further destroy this country.
[54:32.360 --> 54:43.360]  This is just a horrible situation that we're facing. And you know what? You have to make sure that when you have a pool put in or you have a garage expansion on your house,
[54:43.360 --> 54:51.360]  you've got to make sure that the contractor you hired is using legals. You have to do that. And you have to not be lazy.
[54:51.360 --> 54:57.360]  People say, well, they're the ones that do all the work. Yeah, a carpenter 15, 20 years ago was paid about double what they are now.
[54:57.360 --> 55:04.360]  You can make a living doing it. It's driven the wages down. Now we're only those groups because they don't pay taxes in most cases.
[55:04.360 --> 55:17.360]  And so they can take a lower wage, are able to do the construction. And it's moved into every other entry-level position and now over 80% of the meatpacking employees in the numbers I've seen are illegal aliens.
[55:17.360 --> 55:27.360]  Most of the custodians are illegal aliens all over the country. And it becomes unions where, and I've seen this in the news, where if you're not Hispanic, you basically get run out of it.
[55:27.360 --> 55:38.360]  I mean, this is racism, folks. This is control. This is tribalism. This is division. Imagine in America not being able to wear an American flag to school.
[55:38.360 --> 55:46.360]  And how many articles have you seen in the news where the illegals all over the country in the last four years of protest pulled down American flags?
[55:46.360 --> 55:54.360]  I mean, if they're marching down the street in a protest and they see a car dealership, they pull it down. If they see an auto repair shop, they pull it down.
[55:54.360 --> 56:01.360]  If they see a post office, they pull it down. They even go to police stations and pull it down and the cops stand there and take it.
[56:01.360 --> 56:09.360]  If citizens did it, they'd come out and attack them because they've been trained. Citizens are open season regardless of what color they are.
[56:09.360 --> 56:17.360]  But this illegal alien group, this is a precious organization for the New World Order to be used as a political weapon here in the Republic.
[56:17.360 --> 56:26.360]  And that is now what is happening in this country. So I beg people to understand, we're going to collapse like Mexico and California.
[56:26.360 --> 56:35.360]  And all this fake pride that they've put into the La Reconquista, La Raza race groups is just pathetic.
[56:35.360 --> 56:43.360]  It's a mind game. It is mind control. It was created by the liberation theology push by the system.
[56:43.360 --> 56:53.360]  Now, here's the deal. We've got Godfrey Bloom coming on because Nigel Farage, who speaks against von Rumpi in the head of the EU and exposes the New World Order,
[56:53.360 --> 56:59.360]  and his party is getting a lot of seats in the European Union Parliament and in the British Parliament.
[56:59.360 --> 57:05.360]  He was running for the British Parliament. His plane crashed this morning and the pilot was in very bad condition.
[57:05.360 --> 57:13.360]  The campaign had said we think Farage is okay, just hurt in and out of consciousness. Now he's in stable condition. It was a little bit worse than they thought.
[57:13.360 --> 57:21.360]  The plane is just completely destroyed. Just devastating crash. Thank God he's still alive. And he's doing the same thing.
[57:21.360 --> 57:27.360]  He is talking about how the government's brought in tens of millions of illegals and is using him as a political weapon.
[57:27.360 --> 57:35.360]  They've had other members of governments in Europe who are speaking out against the open borders. Illegals walk up and just shoot them in the head.
[57:35.360 --> 57:42.360]  I mean, we've seen those cases. They just murder whoever they want. Again, the foreigners are being used as political weapons.
[57:42.360 --> 57:47.360]  If you can get foreigners here, educate them, get them to be patriots, then it's fine.
[57:47.360 --> 57:55.360]  As long as they're not on welfare, is that further bankrupt things. But if you can't get to them, which we can't, with these language barriers,
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.360]  they are so hyped up and so delusional that they think American flags are bad.
[57:59.360 --> 58:04.360]  Look, you don't have American flags in Austin. You don't have American flags in San Francisco.
[58:04.360 --> 58:11.360]  If you got an American flag on your business, we're going to pull it down and stop on it. We might even throw a fire bomb in your window.
[58:11.360 --> 58:16.360]  That is the point that we've reached. And look, it's only going to get worse from here.
[58:16.360 --> 58:23.360]  You're going to see this country engulfed in riots and flames in the next few years unless we reverse this.
[58:23.360 --> 58:29.360]  And for all of you that love Raza and all this, when you're homeless, when the country fully collapses,
[58:29.360 --> 58:34.360]  when you think, man, America used to be a lot better, just remember you were warned.
[58:34.360 --> 59:02.360]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that somebody was there explaining to you how this works.
[59:02.360 --> 59:11.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[59:11.360 --> 59:19.360]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[59:19.360 --> 59:24.360]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[59:24.360 --> 59:50.360]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[59:54.360 --> 1:00:04.360]  On Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:13.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:22.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:29.360]  We are now into hour number two. Coming up, the federal government and others are calling for arresting citizens
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:34.360]  and stripping them secretly of their citizenship and putting them in secret dungeons,
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:40.360]  including people that are involved in the Second Amendment. You cannot make up evil of this level.
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:45.360]  It's unbelievable. Illegal alien groups are demanding that American flags be taken down all over the country.
[1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:49.360]  Children wearing American flag shirts are being sent home from public school.
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:53.360]  You're not allowed to wear American flags. This is MSNBC.
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:01:00.360]  That is all coming up. I mean, our government has brought in all these foreigners to help them be political tools to bring the country down.
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:05.360]  And you've got the UK Independence Party, a former head of it running for parliament in England.
[1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:09.360]  He was on the European Union parliament confronting the bankers.
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:13.360]  Nigel Farage, a frequent guest on this show, hurt pretty bad in a plane crash.
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:17.360]  The pilot hurt even worse. There's images of the plane.
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:27.360]  And we are now going to go to Godfrey Bloom, who is a European Union member of parliament with the UK Independence Party.
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:36.360]  Also an outspoken critic of world government to give us the inside scoop on exactly how Nigel Farage is doing after this plane crash.
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.360]  Good to have you with us, sir.
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:41.360]  Good to be here, Alex. And thank you for inviting me.
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:46.360]  Well, how is Mr. Farage doing?
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:50.360]  Well, he's badly battered from this crash.
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:02:00.360]  But, you know, Alex, my father was a Spitfire pilot in 1940 when we were trying to, you know, maintain our independence and fighting physically for it.
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:04.360]  And my father was shot down and he was badly injured.
[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:10.360]  And he was fighting the good fight as soon as they put him back together again.
[1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:13.360]  And believe me, Nigel Farage will be no different.
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:18.360]  Good. And he was up there in his Spitfire towing a banner exposing the tyranny.
[1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:27.360]  That's absolutely right, yeah. And so there's a man who's, you know, prepared to put his life on the line for this sort of, for our cause as well.
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.360]  And all credit to him.
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:32.360]  What are the polls showing? Does he have a chance of winning?
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:38.360]  It's going to be very difficult on this, Alex, but yeah, I think he does have a very good chance.
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:51.360]  It's a question of whether people are going to be taking the opportunity that Nigel's given them to vote for somebody who is actually not part of the great World Government conspiracy.
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:55.360]  Absolutely. UK Independence Party is just awesome.
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.360]  So at first they had said he wasn't hurt that bad.
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:01.360]  Then in and out of consciousness, now they're saying he's stable.
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:03.360]  I mean, how badly hurt is he?
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:16.360]  Well, I don't have the latest information, but what I can gather from a phone call from one of our assistants a couple of hours ago, but he's badly battered about, but it's not life threatening.
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:25.360]  And he'll be back in his usual good form just as soon as he's had a good glass of whiskey or a pint of beer.
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:36.360]  What about the crash? Some are saying that the banner got tangled up around the aircraft, but others are saying this is very suspicious on the eve of the election for this to happen to him.
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:44.360]  Well, we're getting a lot of suspicious things. It's not just this, which I personally think is probably just a straightforward accident.
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:57.360]  I don't see anything other than it just being an unfortunate accident, but there's lots of other much bigger things that have happened to the UK Independence Party in the last two or three months, which are far more significant.
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:04.360]  Can I just explain that it's in England, it's very much a television campaign.
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:10.360]  Nothing much happens online. It isn't quite the same to the extent of the United States.
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:18.360]  And although the UK Independence Party came second in June, and I've spoken to you and I had the pleasure of being on your show.
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:24.360]  We came second. We beat the Liberal Democrats and we beat the Labour Party in the third and fourth place.
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:29.360]  We're the second biggest party, but we haven't been allowed any television time hardly at all.
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:33.360]  The powers that be have kept us off the television.
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:42.360]  And it's impossible to win an election or get anywhere over here if you're not allowed on television and they've kept us off.
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.360]  Stay there. Let's do a few more minutes. I know you're very busy, but that's key.
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:56.360]  From nowhere in just a few years, you guys could literally take England back, but the leader of your party suddenly has a plane crash and they're not letting you on television.
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:05:00.360]  Stay there, sir. Let's talk about it when we get back.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:04.360]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:27.360]  This is the Democratic Party whining about Arizona saying they're going to control the border there because the feds won't do it.
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:35.360]  We've got a few minutes left with Godfrey Bloom. He is a European Union Member of Parliament from England, Yorkshire and Humber.
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:44.360]  And the former head of their party and former member of the European Union Parliament, Nigel Farage, a frequent guest here.
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:52.360]  I mean, this party's come from nowhere. Just a few men set it up a few years ago. Number two now in the elections, panicking the system.
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:09:03.360]  And his plane flipped and it is a miracle they're not dead. I mean, the plane was just decimated with a big pile of grass and turf crammed into the cockpit.
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:11.360]  We need to pray for the pilot, but Nigel Farage, at least for now, is okay. We need some guards in there guarding him, though, in case this is some type of foul play.
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:15.360]  Probably isn't. We hope that's not the case, but it is suspicious.
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:22.360]  Again, sir, you were talking about what's happened to the UK Independence Party and how they've tried to block you and the dirty tricks you've gone through.
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:23.360]  Please tell us.
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:29.360]  Well, we've been kept off. It's been a three-way deal for all the people on the platform.
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:36.360]  It's been the main parties, or so-called main parties, and public service broadcasting is part of it.
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:44.360]  And they've been kept on. The UKIP have been kept off. The United Kingdom Independence Party has been kept off, but it's bigger than that.
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:50.360]  The riots in Greece. Three people this afternoon were killed in Greece. The riots in Greece.
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:10:01.360]  Greece is virtually breaking down. And this is a Europe-wide conspiracy, because if you look at the French newspapers, there's absolutely nothing about this in the French newspapers.
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:12.360]  They're still talking about football. And we've got a really serious conspiracy going on to try and close down just how serious this situation is.
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  We are in a financial meltdown in Greece. We are in a meltdown. We will be in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and possibly Ireland.
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:26.360]  And it's all being covered up. None of this has been discussed in the United Kingdom election.
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:33.360]  I was in the European Parliament yesterday afternoon, and I would made a speech there to say how it's on website.
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:38.360]  It's on the UKIP website to say that they simply don't get it. This is really, really dangerous.
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  And apparently I gather that people in Germany now are selling euros and buying gold bullion as fast as they can.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:50.360]  This is just the beginning, Alex. This is just the beginning.
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:11:01.360]  Well, I have a London Guardian article today with top economists saying that England has almost the same debt ratio as Greece, Portugal, and Spain, and that England may melt down.
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:09.360]  That's absolutely true. And we've just had an election where nobody's talking about it. Nobody's actually addressing the real issues.
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:21.360]  And the British debt is very much worse. It's very much worse because a lot of things that we don't show, we don't show public financial initiatives, we don't show public pension liabilities,
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:28.360]  which you're bound to do as an individual company globally, I think now, under accounting rules.
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:34.360]  So people are being liked to constantly, right across Europe, and I suspect they're the same as the United States,
[1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:44.360]  but nobody's actually telling the truth. And I think it was your Teddy Roosevelt who said that the more you tell people the truth, the more they hate you.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:49.360]  But I don't believe that actually perhaps to be the case. Now is the time for truth and we're just not getting it.
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:55.360]  Let me shift gears to another issue and then talk about Nigel Farage and how people get involved in the UK Independence Party.
[1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:04.360]  Because if we can bring down the Euro and restore sovereignty again, over 70% of the decisions made in England are made by unelected bureaucrats.
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:09.360]  Some numbers are even higher. The same things happening here under the North American Union by stealth.
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  I know there's been secret deals under Blair and Brown and others that have been confirmed where illegal aliens have been brought in as a political weapon that the state can use to menace against Brits regardless of their color.
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:30.360]  Here in the US, we have illegals firebombing restaurants, stabbing people, burning buildings, attacking police in Arizona, California.
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:36.360]  It's only in the local news. The local news defends it and says it's some type of 1776 freedom.
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:43.360]  Meanwhile, the media is demonizing the nonviolent tea parties that want to audit the Federal Reserve and get our country back.
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:53.360]  School children are not allowed to wear American flags. Illegals are for the last four years straight pulling down American flags at post offices, running up Mexican flags.
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:13:08.360]  Number one, how are they using foreigners as a political weapon in England? A, and then B, what would happen in England if they told kids they couldn't wear your national flag?
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  We're getting exactly the same situation here. All you need to do basically here in the United Kingdom is turn up, register as a voter and you're a vote.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:28.360]  So what's actually happening, the establishment are getting hundreds of thousands of voters to vote for their policies.
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:32.360]  People who haven't been to this country, they've not paid any tax, they've only just turned up.
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:41.360]  So the whole democratic system is virtually over here, completely and totally broken and nobody's actually talking about it.
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  And it's not just in the United Kingdom. The same thing is happening in Germany and France. It isn't just here.
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:59.360]  And if anybody dare do anything to the hordes of foreigners, particularly Muslims in France, they burn down part of the city and it's covered up.
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:02.360]  I mean, this is a political weapon.
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:21.360]  Well, the problem that we have, I'm not sure about North America, Alex, but one of the problems we have in this country is that public service broadcasting, BBC, is living on its reputation, which was established for giving the truth to people in dire times in the war.
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:32.360]  And what's happening now, that reputation is being used. So people think that if they hear something on the BBC, that it's actually true, but it isn't.
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:37.360]  We're being lied to consistently and covered up by public service broadcasting.
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:47.360]  And this is one of the problems we've got because most people, most people, Alex, their only access to information is public service broadcasting, the BBC.
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:55.360]  They listen to the BBC and they give it the credence that it used to have. And of course, they're being lied to and cheated to all the time.
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  And it's given us that most, some people now are beginning to understand that and they're not voting. It's extraordinary that you know that nearly half the electorate today won't vote at all.
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  Absolutely, because they don't trust the mainline parties and they're not even aware of the UK Independence Party that's having victory after victory inside of a complete news blackout.
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:22.360]  And that's the good news is that the British people are starting to find out what's happening if they'll just get out there and vote.
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:31.360]  They can defeat this system. It's like a week or two ago, Gordon Brown was in a meeting with a lady in one of these staged events and she said, look, the illegal aliens are bankrupting us.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  They're voting. The country's falling apart. And he got in his car and called her a bigot. I mean, since when, if you don't let your country be overrun and you don't let your country go bankrupt and you stand up for your country, you're not a bigot.
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:47.360]  I mean, Gordon Brown, is he going to be defeated?
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:16:01.360]  He's certainly going to be defeated, but you see that the interesting thing is, if you mention immigration, if you mention these things, which real people, she was an ordinary working person.
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:10.360]  She was an ordinary little old lady in an ordinary little old working town of this country and she's the bigot for mentioning it.
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:18.360]  That's not just Gordon Brown, Alex. That's how they all think. They all think the same way. The establishment parties think the same way.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:31.360]  But that's the globalist plan. I mean, the UN and others admit no nations, no borders, and they will bring in people. They will get them on welfare, have a dependent group, and then somebody says, hey, this has got to stop.
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:39.360]  And Gordon Brown calls her names. Give us a forecast. What do you see happening in the next few years in England?
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:49.360]  Well, it's going to get worse and worse because the country, I'm afraid the country's broke. It's just the same as grief. We've got a guy coming in.
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:58.360]  I think tomorrow morning you'll see that the new Prime Minister here will be Dave Cameron and he has got nothing to offer.
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:10.360]  He believes in just the same things. He looks better on TV. He sounds better. He's more plausible, but he's just as stupid and hopeless as the outgoing government.
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  You've had the same thing over in America. You had somebody going out who didn't get it right. You had somebody came in who would look good on TV, didn't they?
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:23.360]  Didn't Obama look good on TV and plausible and smooth and handsome?
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:38.360]  He's got no more idea than the group that went out. And we've got exactly the same thing. We're losing a guy who's unpopular, looks bad, doesn't perform well on TV, and we've got another guy coming in who's smooth and slick, but just as bad.
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:48.360]  Absolutely. And all the cameras, all the surveillance, Cameron said he's going to keep the open borders. He's going to try to force you into the Euro, which over 80% of Brits don't want.
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:57.360]  But it looks like time is running out for these people, though. I mean, do you agree that worldwide the people are really starting to wake up to this globalist agenda?
[1:17:57.360 --> 1:18:11.360]  Well, they are, but the trouble is it's going to get worse before it gets better. And because it's always the same, isn't it, Alex? It's always the same. The people that have got us into this mess will have their Swiss bank accounts nicely stuffed.
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:15.360]  It's ordinary working Joe's that are going to suffer.
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:27.360]  And we know it is the big private central banks that are openly announcing a global government. They have engineered the entire thing. They want the third world population pouring into every wealthy nation to bankrupt them by design.
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:32.360]  I appreciate Godfrey Bloom joining us today. Give us the UK Independence Party website.
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:48.360]  If you just hit the UK website, you'll find us. Absolutely. So it's the UK Independence Party website and you'll find us and you'll find speeches, you'll find manifestos, you'll find the lot.
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:53.360]  You'll find my witty and amusing speeches, Alex. They're brilliant. I recommend them to all your listeners.
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:19:03.360]  I know, sir, we've played a lot of them here. I love how you and Nigel Farage and others really stand up to these crooks and tell them they're illegitimate thugs and expose what's happening.
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:24.360]  Hopefully, we'll see, you know, on the eve of the election, Nigel Farage out on TV or something, you know, him with a bandage on his head. I mean, hopefully.
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:34.360]  I would be delighted to come and do a live show in Austin, Texas, whenever you invite me to tell people over there your side of the pond, how it really is.
[1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:43.360]  Absolutely. You're welcome to come anytime and we appreciate you joining us. Any other websites, Mr. Bloom? No, you keep, you'll find us.
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:48.360]  All right. God bless. We'll talk to you soon. We'll all pray for Nigel Farage. Thank you so much, Alex.
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:58.360]  All right. Have a great week coming up. Hopefully, you guys win big tomorrow in the elections. Everybody get out there and vote in the UK to defend your sovereignty from the bankers.
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:19.360]  We'll be back with more key news straight ahead.

[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:07.360]  Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst depression.
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:09.360]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:14.360]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:18.360]  When the market becomes volatile, US Treasuries are a safe haven.
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:23.360]  But what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:28.360]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:32.360]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:37.360]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:06.360]  Sinus pressure. Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:09.360]  You've struggled for years. You've tried everything to get relief,
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:13.360]  but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.

[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.360]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.

[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:12.360]  All right, we have got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:16.360]  We've got the situation in Greece spreading into Europe.
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:24.360]  We've got gold above $1,200 an ounce, as we predicted earlier in the week.
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:27.360]  We have got the top story.
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:34.360]  Bloomberg, Lieberman, Schumer, White House, Chief of Staff, Emmanuel.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:40.360]  All calling for being able to arrest Americans with no charges, no nothing.
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:47.360]  And to deny the Second Amendment to anyone they want as a no-gun buy list outside of law.
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  I mean, just the total end of due process, total tyranny, that is coming up.
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  I also want to open the phones up, but we have Red Beckman scheduled today,
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  but this is such a big news today. We'll just be all over the map with Red Beckman
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:02.360]  and take calls while he's on with us in the full fourth hour.
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:07.360]  I'm going to have nothing but open phones today about all of these issues.
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:12.360]  Meanwhile, New Hampshire police investigate bomb threat on bus.
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  Now, the evidence is mounting, and it's been confirmed that this Pakistani guy
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:20.360]  was part of a CIA-run Pakistan terror team, probably a Patsy they're setting up.
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:25.360]  They were running drills, we now have confirmed, on May Day in Times Square.
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:29.360]  They always run drills to cover up their operation, to fund their operation,
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:31.360]  and so they can have personnel already on hand.
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:35.360]  So if any of the feds get caught staging the attack, they can say they were just part of the drill.
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:38.360]  But New Hampshire police investigate bomb threat on bus.
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:43.360]  This could just be a schizophrenic. Every time they hype bombings and just constantly cover it,
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:45.360]  you will get nuts that go out and copycat.
[1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:50.360]  Police and fire officials are blocking streets in Portman, New Hampshire, around a Greyhound bus
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:52.360]  after a man reportedly threatened he had a bomb.
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  Now, I've caught the army. This is in police state to the takeover in Texas,
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:01.360]  running a fake bomb drill saying it was real. That's covered, and the police admit it.
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.360]  So just, they've done this before. Officers evacuated residents and buildings,
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  and the parking garage has been closed.
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:12.360]  Police chief Lou Fairland told the Portsmouth Herald that the man threatened he had a bomb.
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:16.360]  A broadcast report says the bus left Bangor, Maine, in route to New York City.
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:18.360]  Associated Press.
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:23.360]  Here's another one. Stabbing during Cinco de Mayo brawl,
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:33.360]  and it just goes on and on and on with the violence all over the country.
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:38.360]  Portsmouth police investigate bomb threat on Boston-bound bus.
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  Again, we will continue to cover that as it develops.
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:46.360]  But here's the headline. Gold prices flirt with $1,200.
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:53.360]  There are even more than that in Europe, but they're right up at $1,200 an ounce.
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:56.360]  And notice, as soon as they said, OK, we're going to bail out Greece,
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  which means give hundreds of billions of dollars to private banks that have looted them,
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:04.360]  suddenly they said, OK, now we need bailouts for Spain and Portugal.
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:08.360]  Oh, in England. Oh, in Ireland. Oh, everything's going to collapse.
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.360]  Just give everything to the bankers, and we've got to take your pension funds,
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:15.360]  and we've got to raise your taxes, even though they know raising taxes
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:17.360]  actually kills the economy and reduces revenue.
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:19.360]  What did California just announce?
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:22.360]  Our revenue went way down, even though we raised all the taxes.
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:24.360]  They know what they're doing.
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.360]  The banks create currency and credit out of nothing.
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  They want to destroy the economy.
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.360]  They could buy the whole world up a thousand times.
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.360]  They could make any amount of money they wanted up out of thin air.
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:39.360]  Why did Thomas Jefferson said you could take all the banks, private banks, power,
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  and a day later they'd have it all back with the stroke of a pen
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:44.360]  that would give themselves the money?
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:47.360]  And if you allow them to do this, you will end up homeless on the continent
[1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:49.360]  your forefathers conquered.
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:53.360]  This is why all these other countries like Latin America and Africa and Asia
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:58.360]  are so poor is because they have the very same fraud in their nations.
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:01.360]  This is the essence of the New World Order.
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.360]  And the Greeks are going absolutely wild.
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  They're saying you're not taking our pension funds.
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.360]  You're not taking our bank accounts.
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  We are not going to let this happen.
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:13.360]  But Europe says we don't care.
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:16.360]  We're going to give the money to the private banks to, quote,
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:19.360]  pay them off for derivative fraud they created and sold the government.
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:24.360]  And the government is then going to have to raise taxes and take pension funds
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  to pay the banks again because the banks get bailed out with the bailout money
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  and also loan the bailout money to the government.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:35.360]  So they get it going both ways.
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  That's what's so incredible about this.
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  You give banks bailout money and they loan it back to county cities
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:43.360]  and private individuals as well as the central government.
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:47.360]  I mean, this is a fraud, a biblical level proportions.
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  And how dare the American people try to audit the Fed?
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:50.360]  They must be terrorists.
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:53.360]  How dare the American people wear American flag shirts?
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.360]  That can't be allowed.
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  That hurts Hispanics.
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:58.360]  It doesn't hurt Hispanics.
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:00.360]  Hispanics love America.
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  But it's selling the idea that an American flag means you don't like Hispanics.
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:09.360]  Think of the invocation of race, the invocation of divide and conquer,
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:16.360]  a balkanization, the treason being run by these banks that now control our government.
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:19.360]  This is incredible.
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:22.360]  Now, I'm going to go ahead and give the number out.
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:26.360]  And I'll get to as many calls as I can after I cover this top story.
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.360]  I didn't come yesterday, but now it's unfolded and it's even worse.
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:33.360]  We've got articles up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:36.360]  Bloomberg denies second limit to people on terror watch list.
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:44.360]  Labor man seeks to strip citizens of...citieship of Americans.
[1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:46.360]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:49.360]  This is all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:51.360]  1-800-259-9321
[1:29:51.360 --> 1:29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:55.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.360]  This is Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:30.360]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.360]  And here's the best part.
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:34.360]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:38.360]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:57.360]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:00.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:02.360]  They helped to create a new world order.
[1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.360]  We are part of a new world order.
[1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:08.360]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[1:31:08.360 --> 1:31:13.360]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:17.360]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:20.360]  It means all the world under their control.
[1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:23.360]  The United Nations would take over America.
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:26.360]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:31.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:34.360]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:39.360]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.360]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:46.360]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:48.360]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:13.360]  The bad rock of the Bill of Rights and Constitution is due process and citizens' rights.
[1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:15.360]  Under the Bill of Rights.
[1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:22.360]  The federal government under Bush and now Obama is pushing
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:31.360]  and they have the legislation introduced S3081 to without a judge, without a jury, without anything
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:37.360]  just say you can't buy guns anymore, you're not convicted of a crime, there is no appeal,
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:44.360]  you can't have a second amendment, we're going to come confiscate your guns, not only deny you the sale.
[1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:51.360]  And they're saying we want to be able to arrest citizens and literally have you disappear into a black hole
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:57.360]  and that only an act of Congress can free you.
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:01.360]  So you have the executive saying no more courts basically.
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.360]  That is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:12.360]  You have gold up at $1,200 an ounce right now, you have grease imploding by design,
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:18.360]  you have all of Europe on the verge of going under, I have the London Guardian, UK budget deficit to surpass Greece
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:23.360]  as worse than EU, the United States is even in greater debt ratio to these private banks
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:26.360]  that again made the money out of nothing.
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:31.360]  I don't know if you'll have to use guns to defend yourself from criminals or whatever else.
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:37.360]  I don't know if we're going to have a full board depression but I know we're already into a economic depression
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  and it's only getting worse.
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:42.360]  I don't know if we're going to have a full collapse like Greece or Mexico
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:48.360]  or most of the economists we talked to, Mark Fauber said 90% chance China's going to collapse in the next year.
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:53.360]  This is a global organized financial implosion that's taking place
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:58.360]  and I have an attic and a garage full of storeable foods.
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:05.360]  I've got a three-year supply for my entire family and I bought storeable food from three or four different companies over the years.
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:09.360]  It had MSG in it, it was made in China, it was old.
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:15.360]  So I did research and I found the J. Michael Stevens Group, oldest company out there, others claim they're older.
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.360]  It's not true, folks.
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:18.360]  And they're selling 5, 10, 15-year-old crap.
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:20.360]  This stuff is made fresh every month.
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  They got giant multiple food lines, special meals for diabetics, you name it.
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:30.360]  It's organic, it's non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:34.360]  It's all grown right here in the U.S. except for the bananas because they don't really grow here.
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:38.360]  And it's just super high quality and because they are the biggest and they are the best,
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:41.360]  you also get the best price and they're patriots.
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  And I wanted to have Steve Shank on to remind people that now is the time to get fresh, high quality food that lasts more than 10 years.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  Don't buy 10-year-old food that lasts 10 years because it's worthless.
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:53.360]  Buy fresh.
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  Most food you buy is not fresh.
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:57.360]  This is new.
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:01.360]  This is made monthly at his own factories.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:03.360]  Steve Shank, good to have you here with us.
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:05.360]  Hey, Alex, it's good to be aboard.
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:07.360]  Things are going nuts, aren't they?
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:08.360]  They are.
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:18.360]  People need to get guns, gold and food and water filters as an insurance policy to total collapse because if there is a full depression,
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:24.360]  I mean, people need to buy things before the dollar is worthless.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:27.360]  Well, we had an interesting situation in March.
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:31.360]  We made an offer that an awful lot of people couldn't refuse.
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  We decided to pre-order a bunch of food and then manufacture it based on what people needed.
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:41.360]  And that thing just went absolutely nuts.
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  And the reason I wanted to get with you today, Alex, is that we have so many people calling in since we shut down the ordering.
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  Now most of the food is shipped out that we had on that program.
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:02.360]  And we've had so many people calling and saying, hey, we missed out or we need more or whatever.
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:09.360]  So I'd like to have your listeners just really pay close attention for just a second here and then we'll get off on some of these other subjects.
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  What we're announcing is that we're going to do one more week of the buy three, get one free program.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:24.360]  We're starting it as of today and it will go through May 14th at midnight.
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:31.360]  And any of the folks that missed out on this or needed to add some more to it, this program is phenomenal.
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:35.360]  What we're doing is we're putting together the orders pre-production.
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:43.360]  And that way we know exactly what to produce and by the volume that we can get in just this one week based on what happened in March,
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:52.360]  we'll be able to put together a program where for every three of the items of this new product that we've got,
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  this new traversal product, for every three items that they order, they'll get one free.
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:05.360]  That is just absolutely unheard of with food because the margins are so tight, particularly on the quality of stuff that we're putting out.
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:18.360]  But with this Icelandic volcano and with this oil spill that we've got messing up the Gulf capacity to do offshore drilling,
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  we're going to see that result in food issues just from the standpoint of transportation problems.
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:30.360]  And Europe this next year is going to have a dickens of a time growing their food.
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  We not only have a worldwide famine at this point in its fifth year,
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  but all of the circumstances that we've got are just pointing to transportation being impossible.
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  The food issues all around the world are going to be something and very simply any patriot out there that's concerned about those guns.
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:55.360]  You know, Alex, just as sure as I do, that when they get down to the bottom line,
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  after they've told everybody to turn in their guns, once they get the ones that are dumb enough to volunteer,
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:03.360]  then anybody that doesn't have enough food never has to stand in.
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:09.360]  If they have to stand in a government bread line, I will guarantee you they will give up their guns, their children,
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:13.360]  anything else they've gotten, including burying their butt to the bird flu shot.
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  But the fact is that food is the most important dependency,
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  and right now we've got 34% of our families that go to the grocery store in America
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  that go to the grocery store every day and have to decide whether they're going to be able to afford food or pay their electric bill.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:35.360]  This is getting absolutely serious and food is at the forefront of the inflation rate.
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  And the government is only raising taxes on every level. I read an LA Times article yesterday
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:49.360]  where the government said we raised taxes across the board on average by more than 25% and less receipts came in.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:55.360]  Well, government has always known when you raise taxes less money comes in because it slows down the economy.
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:02.360]  Kennedy cut income taxes by 50%, tax receipts doubled, a similar thing with Ronald Reagan.
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  They want, and this is in the IMF World Bank documents, they want to bankrupt things.
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:13.360]  They want to wreck things. And so I'm telling you, folks, with inflation, everything else that's going on,
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:17.360]  you are crazy if you don't get historical food. Steve, give people the toll-free number.
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  Give them the website. And again, I encourage people to not sit on their butts.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  Well, on the website is eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, slash Alex.
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:39.360]  After eFoodsDirect.com goes slash Alex, and that will show you the buy-three-get-one-free extension that we've put together.
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:49.360]  For those that aren't on the computers, 800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633.
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:57.360]  And if you think all of this stuff is Harry Alex, wait till they do this VAT, this value-added tax.
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  Every step along the way from the farmer right to the consumer, they are going to add costs to the food.
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:09.360]  Oh, how many articles have we seen of states taking the exemption off of food for sales tax now?
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  I mean, they are passing taxes that hurt the poorest people in America,
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  and it's all going to interest to these bankers just like Greece. We're just not as far along the line as Greece.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:25.360]  We're about a year and a half out, and that's maximum from where Greece is.
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:29.360]  England is about a year out. Portugal and Spain are about six months out.
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:37.360]  This is a global strategic program. I'm going to give that number out one more time for folks that just joined us to call eFoodsDirect.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:41.360]  Give folks that number one more time. We'll put it on screen for viewers.
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:45.360]  It's 800-409-5633.
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:52.360]  And on eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, they can get all the information that they need there too as to what's going on.
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.360]  And also, this three for one program is just phenomenal, Alex.
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  800-409-5633 running till midnight on the 14th of this month.
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:05.360]  Real quick question, and then I'm going to let you go, Steve.
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  Did you hear about the illegal aliens, again, just like the last few years, pulling American flags down at post offices nationwide and running up Mexican flags?
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  And did you hear about San Francisco where the kids aren't allowed to wear American flag shirts because it, quote, is hurtful to the illegal aliens?
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:29.360]  Yeah, I heard about all of that. And I tell you what, I got one of the cutest little posters through the email.
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  The guy standing in front of one of the government buildings, and he's got a poster up there that says, illegal immigration is destroying America.
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:41.360]  Look what it did to the White House.
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:47.360]  That's excellent. Well, you know, did you hear about Obama bragging and making jokes about he's from Kenya?
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  And now his wife's giving all these speeches saying he's from Kenya?
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:53.360]  I mean, they're just throwing it in our face. Steve, good to have you here with us.
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:55.360]  Hey, good to be with you, Alex. You be good.
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  Thank you so much, sir. EatFoodsDirect.com. Big banners up on infowars.com. Okay.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:13.360]  I cover so much important information. We cover so many hardcore issues that are life and death for liberty and freedom.
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:22.360]  But this next issue is one of the biggest. We have, and so I just want to highlight this right now for everybody, this is important.
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:31.360]  There is a systematic move through Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act, through the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the the Enemy Combatant Act.
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:39.360]  And through this piece of legislation, the other stuff I just mentioned is passed. This is very close to passing.
[1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:47.360]  But they're saying they're going to go ahead and implement this to the Enemy Combatant Act, even if they don't pass S3081, the Violent Belligerence Act.
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:44:03.360]  And when you read S3081 that looks like it may pass, introduced March 4, 2010 by John McCain and Lindsey Graham, when you, and shamefully, Inhofe is behind this,
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:12.360]  because it's conservative to do this, it says U.S. citizens will be stripped outside of a court for any reason the Pentagon wishes or any designation of the president
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:21.360]  or for any intelligence gathering purposes, okay? Now, that is a fundamental end of all freedom.
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:27.360]  Because, look at Hattari, a federal judge, looked at the evidence and said they didn't even threaten to attack anybody.
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:37.360]  They talked and said maybe if things get bad, we'll have to fight the police. They had some fake, you know, fighting scenarios in their drills where they were fighting gun confiscation.
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  This is ridiculous. Release them. The feds have appealed that because they got a trial. They got a court hearing, okay?
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:53.360]  Under this, they wouldn't get a hearing. And this is what they want to use. And I told you eight years ago, the Patriot Act was written for the American people.
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:01.360]  And now I've seen the articles hundreds of times where the state of Tennessee used the Patriot Act more than 10,000 times this year.
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  Just search the term Patriot Act used in non-terror related cases. Patriot Act being used by states. Patriot Act being used by counties.
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:18.360]  Marijuana, family violence, resisting police. And then you don't get your due process and it makes it federal crimes.
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:28.360]  Now, Senator Lieberman has been all over TV. I know you've heard it or seen it because I'm not even looking for it and I've heard it all over radio and TV.
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  We have articles about this with his quotes and links to the TV newscast. Senator Lieberman denies citizenship to suspected terrorists.
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:45.360]  Now, what did Ron Emanuel say three years ago? What did he say two years ago? What did he say a month ago?
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:54.360]  He said, if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist, not that we think maybe you could be, but we think maybe you could be possibly a terrorist, you don't get a second amendment.
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:46:06.360]  Well, what has Bloomberg now called for? Lieberman, no U.S. citizenship for terrorists. That means no trial. They just say you're a terrorist. No due process.
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:16.360]  Lieberman, deny citizenship to suspected terrorists. Well, really, it should be revoke citizenship. Actually, additionally, that's what this is.
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  No U.S. citizenship rights for terrorists. If you're a citizen, your rights are taken away if they say, without a trial, you're a terrorist.
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  Oh, the Hitari militia, they don't get any rights because we say they're terrorists. Well, prove it in court. No, we can't prove it in court, so we say no court, no hearing.
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  In this belligerence act, it states that you can be taken to any location, even offshore, and never get a trial, and be, quote, given enhanced interrogation, and never heard from again.
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:47:04.360]  Now, this is so bad that Chucky Schumer had been supporting it for the last two weeks, but he finally read the bill. As bad as Schumer is, Schumer changes tune on stripping extremist of citizenship.
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:14.360]  Raw story. So even, I hate to say Chucky Schumer's done something good. This may be the first time I've ever seen Chucky Schumer, the gun grabber, do something good.
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:32.360]  But he's saying, I mean, do you understand the magnitude of what we're talking about here? I mean, I'll keep saying the magnitude, the magnitude. The magnitude of this is off the charts insane.
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:49.360]  The magnitude of this. I want to play a clip now of Bloomberg saying no judge, no jury. The FBI should be able to say when you do your next background check, which is federal registration, which we always told you they'd start denying people for outside felonies.
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  Now it's misdemeanors. Now it's PTSD. Now it's, we just feel like it. You don't get a second amendment. No appeal. No nothing.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:05.360]  Now here is Bloomberg testifying before Congress to pass the no fly, no buy. If they've put you on this fake list, you don't get a second amendment. And then they could just expand the list.
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  Anybody they want. Here it is.
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  When gun dealers run background checks that they have to by law send to the FBI, shouldn't FBI agents have the authority to block sales of guns and explosives to those on the terrorist watch list and deemed too dangerous to fly?
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:33.360]  I actually believe that they should. And so do 500 mayors who are part of our bipartisan coalition of mayors against illegal guns. But right now the fact is they don't.
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  And as Senator Lautenberg and Congressman King have just said, it's time to close this terror gap in our gun laws.
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:52.360]  At a time when the threat of terrorism is still very real, as we in New York City know all too well, I think it's imperative that Congress close this terror gap in our gun laws and close it quickly.
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:49:00.360]  The car bomb the NYPD found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9 11.
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:19.360]  It was far from it. And sadly, I can't even look at these mafia thugs up there sitting there saying we want the power to extra judicially strip you of the Second Amendment whenever we want and use the FBI next system to stop anybody we feel like shouldn't be able to own a gun.
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  And you better believe that's targeted at you. What did Bloomberg say on CBS Monday?
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:31.360]  What did he say? He said, if I had to bet, I think it's one of these anti government health care people.
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:41.360]  If he had to bet, you're the terrorist. He wants your guns. There's a total gun ban in New York. I mean, it's just sick. It's sick. Finish the clip.
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  We don't think it will be the last. Our founding fathers did not write the Second Amendment to empower people who wanted to terrorize a free state.
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:57.360]  They wrote it to protect people who could defend the security of a free state.
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:14.360]  Today, the security of our free state is being tested by terrorists. And I urge you to take the common sense steps in this law to strengthen law enforcement, including closing the terror gap and to protect the American people from more attacks.
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  I came away pleased in the sense that the public saw something and did something. As Senator Collins point out, we keep telling the public to do, turn security over to the professionals.
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  You can be the eyes and the ears, but they're the ones with boots on the ground.
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:35.360]  He's not only saying outside of law they can just ban anybody they want from owning guns for no reason who hadn't committed a crime.
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  He said the Second Amendment was basically for professionals. And then he goes on to say law enforcement to protect the state.
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:51.360]  Did you hear that? He's saying the Second Amendment is for the military and police, which is what his public stance is.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:51:00.360]  So he's saying you don't get a Second Amendment. The American people are terrorists. Bloomberg is the real terrorist.
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:19.360]  Your answer may be at hand. Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization. She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:27.360]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:30.360]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:39.360]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.

[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:12.360]  Let's talk tough. Let's talk comfort. Let's talk about down-home value made in the USA blue jeans, like you wore as a kid. Remember?
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:38.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They soak pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:54:00.360]  We're good old fashioned comfort. Get diamond gusset jeans. Every stitch guaranteed, and our Defender motorcycle gene comes Kevlar reinforced. See them at gusset.com or call 888-848-7738. That's 888-848-7738. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:35.360]  So imagine, every time there's a dud terror attack, every time somebody throws a stick in the air and it lands in the mud, you've got senators, congressmen, presidents, White House chiefs of staff, mayors coming out against the Second Amendment.
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:49.360]  And you've got Bloomberg who suits states, cities, gun manufacturers. I mean, he wages war against our Second Amendment. And then he talks about, we've got to close the terror gap and not let terrorists get weapons.
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  The Second Amendment is not for terrorists. That's what they say as a terrorist. No judge, no jury, no indictment, no grand jury, no investigation, just you're a terrorist. You can't have a Second Amendment.
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:11.360]  Who are they denying through the NIC system already? They're already doing this. Veterans. All these veterans go into buy guns now and they can't do it. And it's just kept quiet in the news. Well, sorry.
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  And then veterans try to go buy a gun from a private citizen that's still legal and they get SWAT-teamed. And you have Lieberman and you have McCain and all these other people running around saying, we want to be able just to arrest you, period, and have the army take custody of you as a citizen and you're never seen again.
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  And there's no checks and balances, no nothing. Now, here's Rahm Emanuel saying that if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist, if we think maybe possibly you could be Superman or the Easter Bunny, we just feel like it.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:55.360]  You don't get a Second Amendment anymore. It's over. This from a guy who's not even an American. He's an Israeli military officer. His dad founded the Air Gun Terrorist.
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:06.360]  I mean, you got a foreign person here telling me I can't have a gun. And again, this whole system is saying you, the American people are terrorists.
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  But the terrorists are the people that want to disarm us. And Bloomberg is saying the Second Amendment isn't for terrorists. Remember, when he says that, he means the American people.
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  We have their internal documents and he said that we supposedly did the latest bombing, you know, the Tea Parties.
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:28.360]  And he's saying that's for professionals. That's for people to defend against terrorists. He's talking about only the police having guns, and that's his set policy.
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  Now, here is Rahm Emanuel, the Mossad officer, saying you don't get your guns. Here it is.
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  That is, if you are on the no fly list, because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist, you cannot buy a handgun in America.
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.360]  Secret list.
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:57:00.360]  And I am not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy. But as my old boss used to say, give me that vote and throw me into that fire patch.
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:09.360]  I'll make politics out of that every day. Because if it's between that terrorist list and the NRA, I know where America is going to be every time.
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:16.360]  And they're going to make the right choice. And we have got to start building on that. That is the right thing to take into the election. And it's the right policy.
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:23.360]  If you're on that no fly list, your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because you're not part of the American family.
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:28.360]  You don't deserve that right. There is no right for you if you're on that terrorist list.
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:29.360]  Now, that's the spin.
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:30.360]  That should be number one in what we do.
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  That should be the number one thing. And you got Bloomberg and everybody else with laws where they've got a million and a half innocent Americans, five-year-old kids are on it.
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:46.360]  And of course, oh, they forgot to put the latest CIA, Watson has an article today confirming this guy was part of CIA.
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  He's some patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald, Tim McVeigh they're burning. They were having drills in New York. They staged that.
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:58.360]  So for four or five days, they could say who did it and they could speculate and they could say it was the American people.
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:01.360]  And then the no fly list wasn't strong enough. He got on the plane.
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:08.360]  So we need to now expand this and basically put everybody on it and have a no work list and a no gun by list.
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:15.360]  And by the way, you're not part of America. You don't get your rights because somebody in the government or the Pentagon says so.
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.360]  No judge, no jury, no due process. You're not part of the American family, Alex Jones.
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:24.360]  You're not part of the American family, Atari militia. You're part of that Tea Party.
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:33.360]  You're part of that Ron Paul group and look at all the secret military manuals. All they're training to do is take our guns and take on the American people.
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:40.360]  This is high treason. This is a foreign takeover. This is sedition of our Republic.
[1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:50.360]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:50.360 --> 1:58:54.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:58:54.360 --> 1:58:59.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:04.360]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:10.360]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:15.360]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:22.360]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:25.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:31.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:34.360]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:59:34.360 --> 1:59:45.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:59:45.360 --> 2:00:05.360]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:17.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:23.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:28.360]  We have completely open phones in the final hour coming up.
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:36.360]  We'll take some calls during this hour. Sean, Tim, David, Chris, Carl and others that are patiently holding.
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:38.360]  Red Beckman joins us during a heavy, heavy news day. I haven't even gotten into what's happening in Greece in detail.
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  How that's part of the global banking takeover, how the U.S., England and others are also in line to be brought down by this financial tyranny.
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:01:01.360]  I also want to get into this call by Republicans and Democrats and to just let the government and the FBI say you can't own guns and come confiscate your guns without even you committing a crime and not let you buy guns.
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:13.360]  Federal government's got bills to do it. Bloomberg's calling for it. They also have another bill that we just covered earlier where they will secretly arrest U.S. citizens under the Pentagon, secretly strip you of your citizenship.
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  They're allowed to torture you. It says enhanced interrogation. That's their new orwellian term and take you overseas.
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:23.360]  I mean, this is as bad as Hitler or the Soviets or anything we've ever seen.
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:30.360]  If there's any doubt, these guys are hardcore tyrants. And if this is focused on the American people, those doubts are out the window.
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:40.360]  Now, Red Beckman co-wrote the law that never was traveling around the country, proving that the amendment to give us the income tax was never ratified properly in many states and it was a fraud.
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:47.360]  He's also the father of the fully informed jury association that's really had a huge effect teaching juries that they're in command, not the judge.
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  They judge the facts as well as the law. And then, of course, he also is an author.
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:59.360]  And I wanted to get him on in a host of issues and he's no spring chicken, as he says.
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:07.360]  He's been somewhat, you know, in the hospital lately off and on. But he's here with us today and it's always great to have Red Beckman with us.
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:13.360]  But out of the gates, Red, I wanted to bring this up to you because I just ended the last hour with it.
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:16.360]  World net daily. Next step. No guns allowed for right wing extremists.
[2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:22.360]  Bill empowers Attorney General to forbid firearms for those suspected dangerous. No judge, no jury.
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:29.360]  Lieberman says no U.S. citizenship rights for terrorists. You just get stripped. No judge, no jury and you disappear.
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:38.360]  And I just covered before that the bill s three zero eight one, which which is is as judge to Paul Itano said.
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  Just only an act of Congress can get you out of the secret prisons if they even know you were there.
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:47.360]  I mean, this is is this not the ultimate tyranny.
[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:52.360]  This is this is the worst scenario that we could have.
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:03:02.360]  I mean, this is absolutely preposterous. And I think that they're they're peddling a lot of fear.
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:05.360]  But I think it's going to backfire on them.
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:11.360]  I think that, you know, with all the tea parties and all the others.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:35.360]  And of course, one of the things that's really making their world a little bit shaky is that old keepers, you know, they're going out and getting police and FBI and military people to more or less sign this.
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:55.360]  It's like a contract almost that they will not that they will not do the kind of things that the military and such the politicians are going to want as far as terrorizing the people and taking their guns and all of that.
[2:03:55.360 --> 2:04:08.360]  You know, I think that there is such a desperation on the part of that small nucleus of tyrants.
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  You know, they are outnumbered by such a large percentage. They're outnumbered big time.
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:27.360]  And so I think that, you know, I just think they're running scared.
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  And I think that's why we're hearing all this. They want to know if their threats are going to have the kind of effect that they would like.
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.360]  But it isn't going to work.
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:53.360]  Stay there. Let's go over the Bill of Rights and Constitution and talk about what articles this violates. Just where the executive branch and the Pentagon can arrest any citizens they want, ban you from owning guns, torture you, take you away.
[2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:59.360]  I mean, this is the right of kings they're giving themselves and they really are coming out in the open.
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:11.360]  Stay with us.
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:41.360]  It's beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home. Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.

[2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:12.360]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:33.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:15.360]  This is Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:34.360]  America has been the open free society because we've had a bill of rights and constitution and we've been very open to foreigners. We're a nation of immigrants. But now the federal government with liberation theology has brought in tens of millions of illegals predominantly from Mexico and filled them full of a hate of America.
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  Fire bombing, burning things down, stabbing people, killing people in the last two weeks, only in the local newspapers, a national news blackout, pulling American flags down and then in San Francisco kids wearing old Navy shirts that have American flags on them, they're told that's racist, that's bad, take them down.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:09:05.360]  And NBC says, is this bad? Should this be banned? Imagine, that's how crazy it's gotten. And oh, you're against government health care. You're a racist. Oh, you're, you know, you're for sovereignty. You're a racist.
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  Oh, they beat you over the head with this while they're invoking race, while they're creating this division and then all these immigrant populations here now think if they see an American flag, it means you hate them.
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:30.360]  This is the government involved in divide and conquer. And now we have senators and congressmen and the bills introduced. I mean, I've had Judge Andrew DePaulitano on concurring with what this bill says.
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  I'm not just saying it allows them to secretly arrest you, torture you, the Pentagon strips you secretly of your citizenship, fly you overseas to a death camp. They call them ghost sites, black sites.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:48.360]  This is in the news. Lieberman's out there saying, if we think you're involved in terrorism, you don't deserve to be a citizen. We're going to strip you of your citizen rights.
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:10:03.360]  What Emmanuel say, you're not an American, you're not part of this culture. You lose your rights. And they're saying now, if we believe you're an extremist or hold extremist views, which means being a Ron Paul supporter, we've gotten our internal manuals, you will not be allowed to own guns.
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:12.360]  And we're going to come take them from your home. No judge, no jury, no indictment, no charges, no nothing. And you're not going to be able to buy guns. That is the essence.
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  That is Hitler. That is Stalin. That is Mao. When you see politicians do that, they are criminals. They are enemies of the country.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:29.360]  And I'm going to get Red Beckman, one of the granddaddies of the modern patriot movements, take on this in just a moment and to expand on the Constitution and how this legislation is illegal.
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:45.360]  But before I do that, here is a newscast from NBC going, did you really wear an American flag? Oh my gosh, you, oh my gosh, you had an American fall. Oh, we might have to strip you of your rights. This is so dirty.
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  Meanwhile, you got all the illegals running around. La Raza met you. Our race, everything. Your race, nothing. The federal government, oh, they burned some buildings down. Good job.
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:01.360]  Because they want to play these groups off as political weapons against America. So the fight is on. Here's this video clip.
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:13.360]  Daniel Galli says he's proud to be an American and shows it by the shirts and the shorts he wears. But on Cinco de Mayo at Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, his patriotic clothes got him into trouble.
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  They said we could wear it on any other day, but today is sensitive to Mexican Americans because it's supposed to be their holiday, so we weren't allowed to wear it today.
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:26.360]  Galli and four of his friends who were wearing similar red, white and blue colors found themselves in the principal's office.
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:33.360]  They said if we tried to go back to class with our shirts not taken off, they said it was defiant and we'd get suspended.
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:39.360]  They say they had no choice but to leave school and go home. They're angry. They were not allowed to express their American blood.
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:50.360]  And that's enough. Oh, can't have an American shoe either. Oh, red, white and blue. You don't hoist those in America anymore. Now, here's the deal. Hate speech, hate crime.
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:58.360]  The Soviets unify their giant empire like three times the size of the US or bigger by playing different groups off against each other.
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:08.360]  And that's how it was in the Soviet Union. It took them decades to get it that bad where they would play groups off against each other and ban things like this.
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:16.360]  But again, they are invoking this and this is mind control. Now you can't even have the American flag.
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:42.360]  Red Beckman, your take on this. Well, I'm absolutely convinced that, like I said earlier, they're in a panic. The tyrants are in a panic. Now, this morning's paper here said that the Washington Post has put the paper that they, the magazine Weekly Newsweek, they put that up for sale.
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:55.360]  Because they're losing their subscribers. And of course, the NBC ABC, all those on the course. How many newspapers have we had go bankrupt and shut down?
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:06.360]  And how many of them are in financial trouble? Because they're spewing out this garbage and the American people aren't buying.
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:17.360]  And of course, you see, there is some politicians saying that they've got to shut down the internet. Well, that's not going to happen. I've got news for them.
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:23.360]  That was in the New York Times. Today they're calling for shutting down the freedom on the web.
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:37.360]  Yeah, they're talking about it. And of course, what they're doing is pointing the finger at themselves as being the outlaws. They're afraid of free speech.
[2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:57.360]  You see, that's not American. That's the communists and that's the Nazis and the whole bad mix. And so the American people are waking up at a rapid, rapid rate. And, you know, these tea parties, you know, they're all, they're all more or less autonomous.
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:18.360]  They're not all under one, you might say, top heavy head, like the NRA. The NRA is top heavy and everybody knows it. And so I think that what we're seeing is a desperation on the part of the scoundrels.
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:41.360]  I got that list and you have to the SPLC Southern Poverty Law Center. You and I are both on that list. And I'm convinced that they shot themselves in the foot with this because we've got millions of people out there that are trying to wake up.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:15:00.360]  Here we've got Newsweek, they're losing their subscribers. I dare say that Alex Jones, that his audience is expanding by leaps and bounds. And I think, you know, I've been doing quite a bit of talk radio and such around.
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  I think that the people are tuning in to Alex Jones because they don't accept Washington Post and Newsweek and time and such anymore because they have been betrayed so many times.
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:31.360]  And so people are studying the Constitution. They see that free speech and, of course, the ACLU and such, they've been pushing free speech and First Amendment for a long time.
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:40.360]  And now they want to work against themselves. They're working against themselves with some of this stuff that they're putting out.
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:55.360]  I'm a real optimist, as you well know. And I think that, you know, that the scoundrels, you know, if we get our grand juries back and they're coming.
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:14.360]  And, of course, we've got that Dr. Manning, the black pastor in that church in Harlem, that is coming out and spelling things out. The guy is as solid as the rocket Gibraltar, and he's got an audience.
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:34.360]  And I just, you know, the scoundrels are losing it. And, of course, SPLC, the Southern Poverty Law Center, what they did, they give these millions of Americans that are just waking up to what's happening and how dangerous the situation is.
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:39.360]  It give them a list of things that they need to do, people that they need to contact.
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:47.360]  Let me, let me add to that. I keep hearing from military officers, law enforcement officers, even, you know, mid-level and high-level.
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:58.360]  And they keep saying, I tuned in because in a military or law enforcement briefing, they were demonizing you, Mr. Jones, specifically, saying you wanted police and military killed.
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:01.360]  That's their big lie against me. They lie and say I'm calling for violence.
[2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:13.360]  And they tune in to hear about, you know, to hear this evil person, and they find out it's the opposite, then they know they were lied to by that ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, internal material.
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:17.360]  And I've been making that point all week, the point you just made. They're so arrogant.
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:25.360]  Don't they know when they come out and say strip citizens of their citizenship? Don't let citizens buy guns if we say so?
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:31.360]  Arrest citizens, take their guns? That's why 18 million guns have been sold the last year and a half.
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:35.360]  I mean, don't they, I think these people are somewhat delusional, Red.
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:43.360]  I don't think they realize that when they tell cops that I'm here on air saying murder all police, and then the cops tune in and find out it's a lie.
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:46.360]  Don't they understand they're destroying themselves?
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:56.360]  It just seems like there's an insanity on their part, and it is an insanity too, because they're not looking at reality.
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:08.360]  And if they think that they can go out and seize the guns from the American people, boy, have they got a surprise.
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:17.360]  Yeah, and I'm not looking for that surprise. I mean, they could try to incrementally ban this person on a gun and swat team that guy that has a gun.
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:25.360]  But if 1% of gun owners stood up, that's over 1.5 million people, and it's over.
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:41.360]  Now, like I said earlier, Alex, they are outnumbered, big time, and we've got over 25 million military veterans in this country.
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:51.360]  It's been over 50 years since I was in there, but I haven't forgot a lot of it, and I wouldn't be worth much,
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:19:05.360]  but we've got a lot of younger ones out there, and the ones I talk to are just absolutely angry to the point that they're just waiting for something to break loose,
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:12.360]  and they're going to be sure to be on the right side, and that's our side.
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:18.360]  They're going to be on the side of the folks back home.
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:25.360]  Absolutely. Be on the right side of history. I mean, we are at such a crossroads, and we're here and have a fighting chance, Red,
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:29.360]  because you and others fighting them for over 55 years.
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:36.360]  Yeah, it's just, you know, I tell people all the time back in the mid-70s.
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:42.360]  I was pretty lonesome in saying what I was saying. I'm not lonesome anymore.
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:49.360]  Everybody up in the Northwest or anywhere in the country, in Montana, a low-population state,
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:59.360]  at the University of Montana Field House, the 21st and 22nd of May, they're expecting 5,000 people there.
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:01.360]  Stay there. Stay there. Got a break.
[2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:07.360]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation? Listen.
[2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:12.360]  My name is Ellis, and I am 66 years old, and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:18.360]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries. I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:22.360]  They wanted me to go on plebics, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:27.360]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe
[2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:30.360]  at maximum absorption, around 95% at the cellular level.
[2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:37.360]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference. The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:06.360]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:14.360]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:20.360]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:27.360]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:32.360]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:37.360]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[2:21:37.360 --> 2:21:45.360]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:52.360]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:59.360]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:22.360 --> 2:22:25.360]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[2:22:25.360 --> 2:22:33.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:41.360]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:47.360]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:08.360]  Remain in your houses. The President of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:12.360]  Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time?
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:18.360]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:20.360]  Think it can't happen here?
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:24.360]  Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:29.360]  Executive order 10,995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:34.360]  Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:40.360]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:49.360]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:54.360]  That's martiallawsurvival.com. Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:23:58.360]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[2:23:58.360 --> 2:24:10.360]  Folks, this is the type of news pouring across my desk. NBC Miami, suspicious package, TSA worker jaildecker.
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:16.360]  Joke. MIA worker assaults colleague who made crack at Genitalia after walking through a machine.
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:23.360]  They wave good looking women in, sit there and laugh, they record the naked images, they do it with movie stars,
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:29.360]  and they make a joke at the end of the article about, well, he had a small, a small, it says,
[2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:37.360]  but if this latest incident is any indication, the scanners sound like good news for anti-terrorism and bad news for less than average men.
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:43.360]  So now they're just admitting, yeah, we're going to record your genitals and we're going to laugh at them and we're going to arrest you if you don't like it.
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  And they make the TSA workers go through it too to teach them to be slaves.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:53.360]  Going back to Red Beck, when you were talking about an Oathkeeper rally, it's supposedly going to have 5,000 people at it in Missoula, Montana,
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:25:02.360]  and that's just out in the middle of nowhere. I mean, everywhere, people are rediscovering the Constitution and discovering the bankers that are taking over.
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:14.360]  The Oathkeepers, Chuck Baldwin is going to be there, and of course, Richard Mack, the former sheriff in Arizona, and of course, I plan to be there.
[2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:29.360]  There'll be four of the speakers that I know of off of SPLC's top 40 there at that rally, and it's going to be a great, great rally of freedom lovers.
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:39.360]  And, you know, these one-worlders, when can they, when do they ever put anything together with that kind of a crowd?
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:46.360]  Absolutely. They are really getting scared. Going back to legislation in Congress, moving quickly.
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:53.360]  Bloomberg saying, just let us put anybody we think is an extremist on a list and you can't buy a gun outside of law.
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:58.360]  I mean, they're really getting bold. You're an expert.
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:02.360]  They're panicking.
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:14.360]  Well, as an expert on the Constitution, Red Beckman, I mean, how many areas of the Constitution Bill of Rights does this violate? I mean, that's one of the main reasons for 1776 was the king was doing similar things back then.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:30.360]  Absolutely. And, you know, the rights that we, the people, the powers which we, the people, enumerated in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:48.360]  we gave certain powers to the national government. If those powers are abused, if those powers are unused, those powers go back to the people. That's the 10th Amendment.
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:27:00.360]  We reserve those powers. If those powers are not properly administered by the government, they come back to us.
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:07.360]  You know, a Montana history, they've got a history, of course, a heritage.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:23.360]  They come back in 1862 or three. The gold miners, their gold was being stolen by a gang and they found out that the gang was, the head of the gang was the local sheriff that had been elected as sheriff.
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:25.360]  They took him out and they hung him.
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:38.360]  Well, you see, this was just having, they just retrieved the powers that they had delegated to the sheriff and he did, he was misusing them and so the people took the powers back.
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  And you know, we've got an international precedent that we really need to bring out and tell the people about. And back in 1989, all of Eastern Europe was in an uproar, Poland, Hungary and all.
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:20.360]  On Christmas Eve in Romania, in Budapest, the people took to the streets and they'd had a long time communist dictator and the people took to the streets.
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:27.360]  They'd had enough. And the old dictator, he thought, well, I'll show them.
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:41.360]  And so he sent the military. He told the military to go and clear the streets and the military, their unit started down the street with their tanks and their troops and they didn't go very far and they stopped.
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:52.360]  They had a little conference. They turn around and went back to the government building. They arrested the dictator and his wife and I think it was one of his sidekicks.
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:29:04.360]  They arrested him. They had a military tribunal trial and they took him out behind the building up against the wall and had a firing squad kill them.
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:10.360]  And it was in worldwide television. I'm sure you saw it on television just like I did.
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:28.360]  Now that's a precedent that we want to get across to the American people that this is what we may have to do. But the power that we have enumerated to the government to set up a police force, to set up the FBI and a military and all.
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:46.360]  If they misuse that power, if they use that power against us, we have a right to take that power back and put it back in our hands and then we're going to have to do what we have to do with these counteralls.
[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:51.360]  Red Beckman, stay there. We're going to be right back after the break. Phone call straight ahead.
[2:29:51.360 --> 2:30:00.360]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:04.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[2:30:04.360 --> 2:30:09.360]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:12.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:24.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[2:30:24.360 --> 2:30:30.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:45.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:51.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:35.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.

[2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:08.360]  But to many Mexican-American students on campus, it is a big deal, saying they were offended by classmates wearing American colors on a Mexican holiday.
[2:33:08.360 --> 2:33:17.360]  I think they should just apologize because it is a Mexican heritage day and we don't deserve to get disrespected like that. We wouldn't do that on 4th of July.
[2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:20.360]  But the boys and their families say there will be no apology.
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:26.360]  I'm not going to apologize. I did nothing wrong. I went along with my normal day. Okay, I might have worn American vibes, but I'm American and I'm proud to be Americans.
[2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:30.360]  That's why I wore it. I don't feel like it's wrong at all. I'm not apologizing to anybody.
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:41.360]  There will not be an apology. Matthew is part Hispanic. Okay, he's American. So no, there's no apology. There will be no apology from any Darion.
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:49.360]  See, this is the criminal government invoking racial division. By the way, all over the country on the 4th of July, you can just Google,
[2:33:49.360 --> 2:34:01.360]  4th of July rally beat up by illegals and you'll see it all over the country. The illegals come out and attack. They pull American flags down. You've seen it all over the news. Kids that had shoes that had red, white and blue on them.
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:09.360]  Kids that had old Navy shirts. Some of the kids, it's turned out, I mean, people were American flags all the time, weren't even wearing it because it was Cinco de Mayo.
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:19.360]  Cinco de Mayo isn't even celebrated in Mexico. It's like Kwanzaa. It's a made up thing to create division and they are so threatened by the American flag.
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:26.360]  What does it tell you about those Hispanic students? They don't see themselves as American. They see themselves as vehemently anti American.
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:34.360]  Now, I want to go to some of your phone calls and I want to get read Beckman. He'll be with us a little bit in the next hour to talk about solutions, the power of the jury, the grand jury,
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:49.360]  how we take our states back. We're going to be doing that. But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up here for just a few minutes because a couple months ago we were selling gold at $1,050 an ounce when gold was $1,100 plus.
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:59.360]  Because Ted bought it when it went low and sold it to you at the lower price when it went high. In the last week he had to go up a little bit, but it's still a lot less than what gold's selling for now.
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:12.360]  He will run out of that gold and silver as well. They're running out of gold in Europe. Gold is at all time record highs in Europe. It has gone above $1,200 an ounce and climbing here in the United States.
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:22.360]  And so I wanted to have Ted Anderson on the owner of the Genesis Network to give you gold and silver deals that no one can top. Listen, I buy some gold and silver every few months, a few pieces.
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:35.360]  It was my backup plan and I've searched around and I cannot ever find deals as good as the specials that Ted offers. Now, his regular deals are great as well, but these specials are for Alex Jones listeners.
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:46.360]  You've got to say Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of these and he ran out of the gold at the $1,050 level. He ran out of the gold that he bought at the $1,060 level.
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:56.360]  He ran out of the gold he had at the $1,070 level. He's about to run out of gold he had at the $1,090 level is basically I was talking to him off air. That's what it just about comes out to.
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:06.360]  It's right at $1,200 right now. So you're getting savings passed on from when the market was way down. They're talking about England going under to the banks.
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:17.360]  And we know the supreme annotated plan. They're talking about, well, Greece has already imploded murdered death, burning buildings. They're trying to take the pension funds. Bloomberg's reporting the feds want to take our pension funds.
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:29.360]  This is being done by design. This is how the banking cartel takes control of society. And obviously it supports the network and this radio show as well. So it's a win, win, win, win, win.
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:39.360]  But I've seen the margins on these coins, even at the time he buys them. You know, you're talking $3, $4 that, you know, the Ted's making. I mean, he's all about volume and having customers.
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:51.360]  That's why he's one of the fastest growing gold and silver companies out there. He's been around for 30 plus years. He's had this company for 13 plus years. Ted Anderson, tell us what's happening in the markets and give us today's gold and silver offers.
[2:36:51.360 --> 2:37:07.360]  Yeah, well, I mean, right now we've seen $1,201 per ounce. The resistance level for gold is $1,200. It backed off just a little bit below that. But what this means is that the support level for gold is sitting at that $1,190 range.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:22.360]  The next run could be $1,300 an ounce, $1,400 an ounce. It really makes me smile because I've had a lot of your listeners buy gold from us and they're looking at profits now that they're not seeing obviously in the stock market.
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:32.360]  Certainly not if you have your money in the bank. It's really getting nice. And I'm not necessarily suggesting that people buy gold to just merely speculate.
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:49.360]  But what's going on in the world right now, I don't know how you can afford not to get into gold because of just the loss of purchasing power in the Euro and the loss of purchasing power in the US dollar against rock commodities like food and clothing, shelter, all that stuff.
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:38:04.360]  Reuters is reporting that the gold shops in Europe are almost completely empty or empty. People are dumping euros as fast as they can. And this is a concerted effort. You won't just have the Euro go down. You'll also have the dollar go down throughout this system.
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:19.360]  This is the banking takeover. The only way to even have any type of insurance policy against these globalists is physical holding of gold and silver. I do not believe in people that have gold and silver receipts. You are asking for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:26.360]  This is something that is your emergency nest egg. I believe in it. Ted, tell folks about today's offer.
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:48.360]  Well, right now we have the Frank for the same price that when I was on the air with you last time, gold was just touching $1,190 an ounce. Right now, gold is at $1,200 an ounce. I was offering the Franks at $254.68 and you get a four year subscription to the international forecaster if you only buy one.
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:59.360]  I mean, Alex, I gotta tell you right now that Frank has gone up in price and it increases every time you see a dollar increase in gold. These things increase one-fifth of that.
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:12.360]  So, you know, as gold goes up, the cost of the Franks go up and everybody who's been buying Franks for me within the last few weeks right now are sitting in a position where they can sell Franks back to me and actually get more money than they paid.
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:19.360]  And I just think, you know, I mean, how can you beat that? Plus, also you get to keep that subscription to the international forecast.
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:21.360]  But let's talk about the other coins you've got.
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:30.360]  Well, we have the, we also have the British sovereign currently right now at $324.43. I haven't raised that price yet. That's the same price.
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:40.360]  I'm still trading that walking Liberty half at $975. I mean, silver's up over the $19 range now. Everything is going up in the precious metals end.
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:44.360]  If you're interested in the older $20 Liberties, here's a price for you.
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:51.360]  When gold is at $1,200 an ounce, you can buy $20 Liberties from Midas right now for $1,489.
[2:39:51.360 --> 2:39:56.360]  Usually they get, you know, almost $600, $700 more than, than spot.
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:00.360]  Right now you can buy them almost at spot, which is just absolutely low.
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:06.360]  And then we also have the Eagles, the Maple Leafs, you know, bars of gold. You've seen those Pamp Squeeze bars.
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:08.360]  Those are really cute little bars.
[2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:19.360]  Here's the savings. They've got to say it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson special, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237, or you will pay more, which is still a good price.
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:27.360]  This is a great price, 800-686-2237. Don't procrastinate. Take action today before the prices go up.
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.360]  Ted, I didn't even know you were going to be able to hold the prices again. How long can you hold these?
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:36.360]  Well, you know, I'm going to hold them until I run out of inventory and then I'll have to pay more and then I'll have to pass it on.
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:42.360]  You'll be, you'll watch it. If gold continues to increase here, next time you have me on air, I'm going to have to bring up my prices.
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:46.360]  800-686-2237. Ted, thank you.
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:47.360]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:54.360]  You bet. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Don't procrastinate.
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.360]  Going back to Red Beck, I'm going to hold them a little bit in the next hour.
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:01.360]  Patriot icon. And I do want to get to some of your calls for those that are patiently holding on all these issues.
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:06.360]  But, Red, you weren't trying to get into solutions when we hit that break.
[2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  I mean, we have solutions. We have the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and through that, we have the juries, the grand juries, which are really the heart of states' rights.
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:21.360]  Explain to people the path towards Tenth Amendment restoration of the Republic.
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:45.360]  Well, you see, this is one of the reasons why I'm so optimistic. Because for the last year, especially, you know, two years ago, if you had talked about states' rights, states' sovereignty, and such, people would not have known what you were talking about.
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:42:10.360]  I think just about every state in the Union, within the past year, their state legislatures have been studying state sovereignty and discovering that the Tenth Amendment tells the people that, you know, that the states, any power that we gave to the federal government,
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  if they misuse it or don't use it, it reverts back to the states and to the people. That's the big thing, to the people.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:39.360]  And so we're going to see here, in the very near future, we're going to see more states. You've already got Vermont. Vermont has had it on their books for quite some time, that they understand that they have the right to secede from the Union.
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:55.360]  In Texas, there's a lot of talk about secession in Texas. There's talk about secession in Alaska. And of course, what this is, is the states that they are the ones who created the national government.
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:04.360]  And so they are flexing their muscles. For the first time in my lifetime, we have states that are flexing their muscles.
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:18.360]  We have Arizona right now. Boy, the pressure that's on the people of Arizona because of the immigration law that they just passed at the state level and the governor signed it.
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:40.360]  The federal law that they passed is very little more than just a confirmation of the federal law. And oh my goodness, if you listen to all these liberals out here and the far left, oh, they're just condemning Arizona, no end.
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:55.360]  Arizona, I got a hunch that they're going to start enforcing this at big time. And the people of Arizona, the real Arizonans, they are backing the government, I think it's 70 to 80% they failure.
[2:43:55.360 --> 2:44:12.360]  And so, you know, we've got some activity going at state levels. In Montana, of course, they passed that gun thing last year. And of course, that's going to go to the U.S. Supreme Court here right shortly.
[2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:25.360]  It's on kind of a fast track. And I know the people that backed that bill and how they got it done. And they're not backing off. And so...
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:36.360]  By the way, Red, I got to stop you. The stock market has dropped several hundred points just in the last half hour. It's now down over 500 points. Plump, just plunging right now. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:52.360]  No, I'm glad you're injecting that into this because this will get on the media. This will get the attention of the American people. They're going to start listening to Alex Jones.
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:45:06.360]  More than they ever listened to Alex Jones. They're going to listen to Red Backmount. They're going to listen to Stewart Rhodes. And they're going to listen to all these people like Sheriff Mack.
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:17.360]  And of course, Sheriff Mack is a friend of the sheriff down there in Maricopa County, Arizona. The guy, the best sheriff in the United States of America.
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:26.360]  Yeah, and so, you know, 500 points. We've got a...
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:36.360]  It's 600 now. My God, it's like, I've never seen the stock market drop this fast. Let's get a graph up on screen right now. I'm sorry, Red, go ahead.
[2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:53.360]  You and I know that they have been using a lot of smoke and mirrors to push that stock market up where it is. And it's not been a good solid increase.
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:46:11.360]  Holy mackerel, I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm watching Fox News right now. It's losing 20 points every second. What in the hell is going on here? 700 points. It's going to be...
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:28.360]  Oh my God. I'm laughing because it's like Gallo's humor. Folks, Europe is imploding to the bankers and they're engineering this right now. And they've got riots in Greece. 750 points.
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:43.360]  We've never seen that in our lifetimes. It's like when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. I had a call and I said, turn your television on. I turned it on and the first building had been hit.
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:47:03.360]  Then I saw a picture of the second plane. 800 points. In the last three minutes, it's dropped 300 points. My God, this could be like the Great Depression. What the hell 900 points? Man, what is going on here?
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:09.360]  I'm sorry, Red. I've never seen anything like this in my life. Hang right in there. I can't believe you're on air with us for this to happen.
[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:19.360]  Boy, the bankers... I mean, you know they're engineering this as soon as they agreed to pay Greece and now it's going to be... Oh my God. It's about to hit 900 points. I can't even believe this.
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:24.360]  Let me tell you something, Alex. They're losing control.
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:29.360]  What a backup. 900. 900 point drop. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Red.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:44.360]  They're losing control, the bankers are. They can't control it. They haven't got enough smoke and mirrors and lyes to put a floor under it. It's going to drop freefall.
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:57.360]  945. 951. Oh my... Red, we're seeing a 500 point drop in five minutes. Good job to Matt Ryan. Matt Ryan, how did you know this was going on?
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:01.360]  Oh yeah, we have a bunch of TVs up in there. God almighty.
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:12.360]  Red, I mean, you're right though. They are crazy where they come out and say, we're just going to secretly arrest anybody we want. We're going to take your guns from anybody we want and they say it with a straight face.
[2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:25.360]  They are really pushing. It just hit 1000 points. It suddenly mega plunged to 1000 points. Dow suffers biggest interday drop in history.
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:37.360]  Greek riots accelerating the bankers. Now the bankers have been engineering the slow slide, but I think the Greeks saying no is actually scaring them.
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:45.360]  Well, they're going to take the streets like they did in Budapest, Romania, Christmas Eve of 1989.
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:56.360]  In fact, guys, pull up the hanging of Chalcescu. If you just go to YouTube and type in the execution of Chalcescu, they shot him and then they strung him up too.
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:07.360]  You see, it was a precedent and that's what I was trying to bring out. And we're going to see it again. We're going to see it right here, probably in the next 24 hours.
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:18.360]  Well, they may be able to organize this and block it for a while, but as many other experts have said here, either the globalist win and totally take over or they totally lose.
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:23.360]  Do you agree that they have committed all in and now it's a desperation move for them?
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:39.360]  It's a desperation. They can't stop this thing and when the people take to the streets in the United States of America, boy, I'll tell you, there's going to be hell to pay.
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:58.360]  People are losing their pensions. They're losing everything and they're going to be real glad that they bought that gun or two in the last 18 months.
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:09.360]  Well, I tell you, it plunged by a thousand points in just 15 minutes or so by the time we watched it, it was in about five minutes and now it's going back up a little bit.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  So the bankers may have engineered that to go in and buy up some stuff cheap, but the point is when you start seeing stock markets doing their biggest drops or gains in just a few minutes while riots are going on in Greece and the euros on the brink of going under,
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:32.360]  I mean, bottom line, this is the season of revolution. The bankers have got their revolution of tyranny. We've got our restoration of liberty, Red.
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:38.360]  Absolutely, and we can show the rest of the world how it's done.
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  Incredible. Red Beckman, stay there. I promise to go to phone calls and we're going to do that with Red Beckman, keep him a little bit in the next hour here.
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:55.360]  And I'm going to continue with open phones throughout the final hour and we can discuss it all. You're not allowed to wear an American flag in America. You're not allowed to have an American flag over your house or business.

[2:54:02.360 --> 2:54:11.360]  Okay, Matt Ryan was out there watching Fox while this was happening because I wasn't sure how fast it lost a thousand points.
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:18.360]  He said it happened just in a matter of minutes and now it's holding right at about 950 or so points that it's lost.
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:25.360]  So the plunge protection team has gone in there to prop it up, but just a massive, massive loss in the Dow.
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:26.360]  Tell us what you saw.
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:30.360]  Basically, we're looking over at the different news stations we had up.
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:37.360]  We're following a few different stories and almost all of them just suddenly went over to the stock market and said it's down 300 points.
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:41.360]  Big news. There's riots in Greece and that's causing the stock market to plummet.
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:47.360]  So I whispered in the air, I said, hey, it's down 300. By the time I'd gotten that out, it was at 400.
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:56.360]  We put it on screen 500, 600, 700, 800. As soon as it hit a thousand, they took over and it started leveling out just a little bit.
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:54:59.360]  It's still like negative 700 right now.
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:02.360]  So it was just amazing how quickly that fell.
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:09.360]  And now it's racing back the other direction to only being down 500.
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:11.360]  This is a completely rigged market.
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:16.360]  We'll have Bob Chapman on tomorrow to explain exactly what's going on here, but this is incredible volatility.
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:17.360]  Red Beckman.
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  Oh, these these Scala Wags that are pulling this all off, they have pulled it in the past.
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  They've done it in the past and I don't know how many times that same kind of thing and their luck is going to run out.
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:43.360]  I'm reminded of a story in the Old Testament in the Bible.
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  Old Jezebel, she was a real witch.
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:49.360]  She ran the kingdom.
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:52.360]  The king was a wimp and she ran the kingdom.
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:56:07.360]  She was out of that in this upper story and she is telling her henchman down below her protectors to get the prophet or something.
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:17.360]  And the prophets have spoke up and he said she had she had her personal guards up there and the prophet says throw her down.
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:27.360]  And her own guards, the ones that was taking care of her security threw her out through her out of the window.
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:36.360]  And so we may well see the people that have done all the dirty work.
[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:47.360]  For these bankers, their security and all of that, they may turn on those bosses because they have to know what a bunch of scumbags they are.
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:52.360]  And so I anticipate some of that kind of thing happening.
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:57:08.360]  It's going to be one of the greatest shows that this planet has ever seen but it's going to happen in the next few days right here on planet Earth.
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:22.360]  Red, why are you saying you think it's going to happen very soon? I mean I agree the next few months, the next few years, this is a quickening, an acceleration of everything and we do see the riots in Europe and all these major currencies plunging.
[2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:25.360]  I mean you say you feel it in your gut or why are you saying this?
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:54.360]  I'm saying it because I've read an awful lot of history and you know what we had back in 89 with Eastern Europe kicking over the traces that the Russians had harnessed them into, they lost, you know, well the USSR went down in December of 91.
[2:57:54.360 --> 2:58:18.360]  And they were able to maintain some kind of an order over there when it went down because they had already been, you see, Hungary, Poland, Romania, all those countries there in Eastern Europe had already broken loose from the USSR.
[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:35.360]  And when the USSR finally went down, all of those, what they call republics, what we would call states, they all stepped into the breach and took care, you know, that's what the states are going to have to do here.
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:50.360]  And you see that same thing, so do I, the question is when, back in one minute.
[2:58:50.360 --> 2:59:09.360]  They helped to create a new world order, we are part of a new world order based upon collective action.
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:24.360]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[2:59:24.360 --> 2:59:40.360]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.

[3:00:08.360 --> 3:00:13.360]  On the news, we'll cover this hour, Times Square bomber linked with CIA controlled terror group.
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:16.360]  They were also running drills, we confirmed that.
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:21.360]  This is CNBC, Greek debt crisis on verge of going global.
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  And we've seen a thousand point drop at the stock market, then the feds went in and propped it back up, of course, with taxpayer money and drove it back up another 500 points, but it just shows how serious this situation is.
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:40.360]  Dow plunges amid Europe lending worries. I appreciate callers holding so long.
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:45.360]  We've had Red Beckman on and so much has been going on. Sean, Tim, Chris, Carl, Mike and others.
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:48.360]  Red Beckman, founder of the fully informed jury association.

[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:56.360]  Sean in Michigan, you're on the year with Red Beckman. I tell you, stuff's getting crazy.
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:01:06.360]  Yes, it is. It is Alex. I want to thank Mr. Beckman for specifically mentioning the precedent set back in 1989.
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:11.360]  I'd also like to request that you could wait till a commercial break and get my phone number.
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:15.360]  I have some important information I need to get into your hands, Alex.
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  Well, I promise I work so much. Callers call the time. I want to talk to me. You ought to just send it to me in email, but go ahead, sir.
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:27.360]  Well, I have sent an email, but I know that your volume has got to be skyrocketing with what's going on.
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:32.360]  But I really want to thank you two up. Patriots, that's for sure.
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:34.360]  Well, thank you, sir. What else is on your mind?
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:41.360]  Well, what's on my mind? I know that you're not a believer in astrology, and I'm sure you've been taught that.
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:47.360]  But I've stumbled upon some astrological information that I really do need to share with you.
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:52.360]  George Humphrey was just here. Former city council member, economist, really respect him, and he said that he was telling me,
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.360]  it's the greatest thing ever happening coming up in August. It's deadly. It means the world government.
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:00.360]  It means the total. I mean, is that basically it?
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:02.360]  July 30th, sir.
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:04.360]  Okay. Well, maybe he said a different month.
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:06.360]  Between all the major planets.
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:13.360]  Well, I know this. The elite are obsessed with this, and so they do do things according to that.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:17.360]  I mean, they admitted that Ronald Reagan made all those decisions according to an astrologer.
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  Let's get a quick take on this interesting point from Red Beckman.
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:26.360]  Red, whether it's real or not, and I don't tend to put stock in it, I'm more scientific about things.
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:29.360]  The point is, the elites certainly do, don't they?
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:35.360]  They do. They do. But it doesn't always work. They're a favor.
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  I don't think it's going to work in their favor this time because I think they've gone way too far.
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:49.360]  I think they've pushed the people on this planet to the point where they're not going to, you know, take it any longer.
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:03:04.360]  Now, you see, I'm going back to the late 80s again, you know, when those satellite nations are republics of the USSR.
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:12.360]  See, it went from one to the next. I mean, it was just like a chain reaction across Eastern Europe as those countries,
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:18.360]  East Germany, and they took the wall down, and all these other countries wanted to be free.
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:26.360]  That was just kind of a microcosm, you see, of what is going to happen worldwide.
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:37.360]  That was just preliminary. Now we're going to see the whole thing. We're going to see all across the planet.
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:51.360]  We're going to see the people wanting to be free from that small group of scoundrels that have been manipulating us for centuries.
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:04:00.360]  The Rothschild family and the Federal Reserve Bank and such, those guys have to be sweating blood right now,
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:06.360]  because I'll tell you, if this thing gets out of control and it will, it will. There's no question about it.
[3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:14.360]  It may not be just today, it may not be tomorrow, but it's coming. It's coming. No ifs, ands, or buts.
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:27.360]  People want to be free. They don't want to be dictated to by some outlaws, and it's going to be right across the board all over the world.
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:32.360]  I mean, where in the world do we have a stable government today?
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:38.360]  No, they're all run by J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and others, ripping everybody off and taking over the governments
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:45.360]  and telling us, the head of the IMF two weeks ago said in the headline, the good times are over for you.
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:48.360]  You're going to pay all your money to us and just laugh at everybody.
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:04:51.360]  And Obama make jokes about predator drones killing people.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:56.360]  And they now admit, here's a headline, no-name terrorist, now CIA drone targets.
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:05:09.360]  The zit-faced kids flying these drones can kill whoever they want.
[3:05:26.360 --> 3:05:30.360]  You can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[3:05:30.360 --> 3:05:34.360]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:38.360]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:41.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:48.360]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:05:48.360 --> 3:05:52.360]  That's 877-327-0365.
[3:05:52.360 --> 3:05:57.360]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:05:57.360 --> 3:06:26.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:52.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.

[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:03.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:09.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:11.360]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:07:11.360 --> 3:07:16.360]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:18.360]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:20.360]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:07:20.360 --> 3:07:23.360]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:26.360]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:31.360]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:07:31.360 --> 3:07:35.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:07:39.360 --> 3:07:41.360]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:43.360]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:07:43.360 --> 3:07:44.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:51.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:54.360]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:54.360 --> 3:08:15.360]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:01.360]  And again, this was all because derivatives were sold premeditatedly to destroy the markets for consolidation.
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:07.360]  We have the internal Goldman Sachs emails and the White House is almost completely run by Goldman Sachs.
[3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:11.360]  They're planning that here and they're planning to take your pension funds.
[3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:13.360]  You watch. They're now announcing it.
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:16.360]  Red Beckman, founder of the Fully Informed Jury Association,
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:18.360]  Patriot icon over 50 years, author.
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:20.360]  I'm going to go to Tim, Chris, Carl, Mike.
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:25.360]  You've been holding a long time, but we did pull up the video of Chalcescu, Romania,
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  the beginning of the fall of the Soviet Empire and their corrupt system in Red Beckman,
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:32.360]  an Air Force veteran Patriot.
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:35.360]  He's saying he believes worldwide, he's been saying this for a while,
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:37.360]  that we're now going into this phase.
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:39.360]  So does Gerald Salente. So does Bob Chapman.
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:41.360]  So does Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:43.360]  They're saying it can go either way.
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:48.360]  Getting a word out about the New World Order and the banking cartels setting up world government.
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:52.360]  They're openly announcing it. No more denial is life and death.
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:55.360]  Red recap what happened with the fall of the Soviet Union.
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:10:00.360]  While we play video of Chalcescu, one minute with his surveillance cameras, his secret police,
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:05.360]  his torture, his arrest without charge, everything the White House is now calling for.
[3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  That's mainstream news, saying you're a terrorist.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:10.360]  You don't have rights as a citizen.
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:14.360]  One minute he's up there waving to the crowds.
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:16.360]  Everybody's afraid to speak out.
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:19.360]  And then within hours, this happens to him, he's bound.
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:24.360]  Now, again, I'm not for bounding anybody and this happening because Chalcescu actually ran things.
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  He was the dictator.
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:31.360]  This is a global banking system of crime that must be dismantled, charged by grand juries,
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:33.360]  due process for everyone.
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  But Red Beckman, break down while we roll this video in the background at prisonplanet.tv,
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:41.360]  radio listeners, we're going to post this up on InfoWars if you want to view it.
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:44.360]  While we roll this video in the background, go ahead.
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:50.360]  Well, the Eastern Europe, of course, you've got Poland, East Germany,
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:55.360]  all those small countries, Czechoslovakia, you've got Hungary,
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:03.360]  and then Romania, of course, has been ruled by that outlaw Chalcescu or whatever his name was.
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:07.360]  First, I think over 20 years, if I remember right,
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:13.360]  and the people had been hammered by this dictatorship.
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:20.360]  And all of this was a fever that was contagious, this wanting to be free.
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:26.360]  And all of Eastern Europe broke away from the Union, the USSR.
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:36.360]  And Christmas Eve of 1989, the people in Romania gathered in Budapest
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:42.360]  and they were in the streets, massive amounts of people in the main street downtown.
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:48.360]  And old Ciescu ordered the military to clear the streets.
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:55.360]  And the military sent a detachment and they started up the street and then they stopped.
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:12:00.360]  And they had a little session, a little conference amongst themselves, the military.
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:08.360]  They turned their weapons around, went back to the government building, arrested Ciescu.
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:18.360]  They had a military tribunal that tried him for treason and everything else and found him guilty.
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:25.360]  And within a matter of a couple of three hours, they had taken him, his wife, and one cohort, I think it was,
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:33.360]  if I remember right, out behind the building up against the wall and had a firing squad eliminate him.
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:42.360]  And the picture was shown on television, worldwide, the three of them laying in the snow, the bloody snow.
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:51.360]  And that's a precedent that is only 21 years old. That's recent. That is very recent.
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:58.360]  And with what's going on, of course, they're talking about the riots and everything in Greece.
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:03.360]  I'm wondering what's going on in Portugal, what's going on in Spain.
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:14.360]  Because those two countries, they figure the next two dominoes in the problem, the collapsing systems.
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:21.360]  Greece, of course, has apparently pretty well collapsed financially.
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:25.360]  And they say that Portugal and Spain are the next two.
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:28.360]  I'd like to know what's going on over there in those two countries right now.
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:35.360]  Well, the bankers got emboldened by the fact that the EU said, we're going to take taxpayer money and give it to the bankers.
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:41.360]  And so the bankers the next day, two days ago, said, OK, we want money for England, Ireland, Portugal, Spain.
[3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:46.360]  We want your pension funds now. The government's going to take your pension funds and give it to us.
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:52.360]  And I want to go back to this footage of hours before you've got crowds of Chelsescu supporters
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:55.360]  who instantly turn against him and kill him.
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:13:58.360]  And this is your cops. This is your government people.
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:02.360]  This is everybody that knows this is a criminal system, but they're going along through fear.
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:09.360]  And then the mind control lifts, the brainwashing lifts, the spell lifts,
[3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:16.360]  and suddenly the crowds drop all their Pro Chelsescu banners and he is seized and the military grabs him
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:21.360]  and they put it on television within three hours, him being machine gun with his wife.
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:25.360]  And all they were was little criminal thugs, scumbags.
[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:30.360]  It would be so easy, so easy to bring Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to justice.
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:33.360]  It would be so easy to have our grand juries indict these people.
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:37.360]  If Americans would just have courage and sure, it's dangerous for me to be up there standing up against them.
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:40.360]  It's dangerous for red, but if they kill us, it just makes us martyrs.
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:47.360]  Nothing can stop this. If you find your Cajones, if you find your guts, if you find your spinal cord,
[3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:54.360]  then peacefully take America back. But I'm telling you, if the globalists go ahead with hardcore secret arrest of citizens,
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:59.360]  SWAT teaming gun owners, it will bring on what people just saw on screen.
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:05.360]  They will conjure their own destruction, as all thugs do, because they think they're invincible.
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:11.360]  You know, when they're hauling Mrs. Chelsescu out to get shot, she is arrogantly, you know,
[3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:16.360]  griping at the troops like she's still God, but she found out she was just a human, didn't she?
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  You bet. And that, you see, the American people, when Arizona passed that immigration bill down there,
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:38.360]  they had the Hispanics, I should say, in Portland and Seattle and all these cities up north,
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:42.360]  here they've got these Hispanics taking to the streets.
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:48.360]  Well, they haven't seen nothing yet. If the white people, if we, the people, we, the Americans,
[3:15:48.360 --> 3:15:54.360]  if we take to the streets, there isn't going to be any room for any of the rest.
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:16:02.360]  Well, we want everybody to be part of the red, white, and blue, and the globalists have smartly said,
[3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:09.360]  Tea parties are evil, they're terrorists, but foreigners here protesting in mass, that's a good thing.
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:12.360]  They've come out and said, that's acceptable, that's good.
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:18.360]  I mean, look at Santa Cruz where they attacked families eating in a restaurant, set it on fire,
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:21.360]  and the media blacked that news out last week.
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:23.360]  I hadn't heard that one.
[3:16:23.360 --> 3:16:29.360]  Oh, yeah, they're stabbing, murdering, killing, torches, burning, and the media, ABC locals said,
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:32.360]  well, this is good what they did. I've played the clip.
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:35.360]  The people they interviewed said, well, folks have a right to be angry.
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:41.360]  And so the arson is a good thing now. When it's a group, see, the globalists are counting on the foreigners
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:44.360]  to be their ace in the hole. It's not going to work, is it, Red?
[3:16:44.360 --> 3:16:50.360]  Yes, that's what they got in mind. That's what they've got in mind.
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:17:02.360]  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, Alex, you and I, we've been at this a long time, and we have known
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:06.360]  that this kind of these days had to come.
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:14.360]  And so, you know, we may be the only ones that aren't surprised, but I don't think so.
[3:17:14.360 --> 3:17:19.360]  Well, let's talk to Tim and Nevada. Tim, thanks for holding your own the year with Red Beckman. Go ahead.
[3:17:19.360 --> 3:17:28.360]  Hey, good afternoon to both of you guys. I just wanted to tell you guys three things and get both of your outlooks on them.
[3:17:28.360 --> 3:17:33.360]  I pay close attention to everything because that's what, you know, you tell us to do.
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:36.360]  You tell us to research, do our own research, keep track of everything.
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:40.360]  And there's three things that I haven't heard you talk about, Alex.
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:49.360]  April 25th, around noontime, around two o'clock, there was a Joe, Joseph, Sean, McVeigh, age 23.
[3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:55.360]  He was arrested in the parking lot of the airport where Obama was vacationing and leaving from.
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:18:02.360]  With a gun. With a gun. The weird thing about this individual was when they came up on him, he had an earpiece in his ear.
[3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:05.360]  He had a police scanner in his hand.
[3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:08.360]  No, no, no. That was in my stack, and I meant to get to that.
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:14.360]  And it sounded like some type of intelligence operation and just a fake bust of somebody to create another little story about,
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:17.360]  oh, somebody had a gun for Obama, probably a government agent.
[3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:19.360]  I saw it on the treadmill when I was at the gym.
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:25.360]  The next two days after that, I saw at the gym on April 27th, Tuesday in Bangor, Maine.
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:28.360]  I don't know what it is about Bangor, Maine, but they're using that city a lot.
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:33.360]  Derek Stansberry, Delta Flight 273, former US intelligence specialist.
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:38.360]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He said, I'm a US intelligence agent. I've got a bomb.
[3:18:38.360 --> 3:18:42.360]  And then it turned out he was high level intelligence.
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:47.360]  I believe it was Army and something weird went on like they were trying to set him up or something.
[3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:49.360]  I can't keep track of it all. Go ahead.
[3:18:49.360 --> 3:18:53.360]  The other point, he also admitted that he was on Cybertropic drugs.
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:19:02.360]  They said he was really out of it, and he had claimed that he took, I don't know, volume and some other pills, big dosages.
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:03.360]  Xanax.
[3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:05.360]  Yeah, and that was in the report.
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:07.360]  The other thing that I wanted to tell you that's not in the news,
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:13.360]  I have a lot of military friends in the northern Nevada area that are military and military intelligence and stuff,
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:17.360]  and they tell me stuff that they're not supposed to when we're working out at the gym like,
[3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:24.360]  one of the guys tells me that FEMA is storing generators and medical equipment and other things at the Reno Airport.
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:30.360]  Well, I flew out of Reno Airport on Friday to go down to San Francisco,
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:37.360]  and sure enough, there were FEMA people there in uniform, and they were all over the airport.
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:42.360]  They are gearing up for something big. They admit they're getting ready for continuity of government.
[3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:47.360]  FEMA is training the military to take on the Tea Parties and gun owners militarily.
[3:19:47.360 --> 3:19:53.360]  Oh my God, Red Beckman, stay there. We're going to come back with more calls and continue to get into all the news.
[3:19:53.360 --> 3:19:56.360]  I mean, it is so crazy. The stock market drops by a thousand points.
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:20:01.360]  Citizens aren't allowed to wear American flags. I mean, it is just insane.
[3:20:01.360 --> 3:20:06.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[3:20:06.360 --> 3:20:11.360]  tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:14.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:19.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[3:20:19.360 --> 3:20:26.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[3:20:26.360 --> 3:20:32.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[3:20:32.360 --> 3:20:36.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[3:20:36.360 --> 3:20:41.360]  We are prepared to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[3:20:41.360 --> 3:20:46.360]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[3:20:46.360 --> 3:20:50.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[3:20:50.360 --> 3:20:53.360]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[3:22:20.360 --> 3:22:28.360]  Pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:31.360]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:35.360]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.360]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.

[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:09.360]  Red Beckman is our guest. We'll give you a PO box address. We want to get some of his great books before he leaves us.
[3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:21.360]  Tomorrow, we're going to know a lot more. We've got Gerald Salente, top trends forecaster and Bob Chapman, expert on the markets, joining us to analyze the incredible market manipulation.
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:35.360]  A thousand-point drop on the nose, races back up another 500. I mean, totally staged. You've got to know insider trading, plunge protection team, riots all over Greece, euro plunging, gold.
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:46.360]  Like, let me just see where gold is right now exploding. And this is because the markets are so rigged and the world is so angry and so upset over the fact that everybody's got to give their pension funds up.
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:58.360]  Yeah, it went up to 1,206 plus, went down to 1,202 right now. Just amazing. Again, Red Beckman is our guest here today. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:05.360]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv. Let's talk to Chris and Marilyn. Chris, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:14.360]  Yeah, no problem, Alex. Thank you. I got a question for you. What the stuff going on that I was listening to you guys just now talking about in Europe?
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:18.360]  And I assume or I would guess that the euro was falling at this time?
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:19.360]  Yes.
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:27.360]  Okay, now how would that affect them trying to collapse the dollar? Would it be like kind of a teatotter effect where they're trying to collapse the euro?
[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:39.360]  The G20 has said they're going to target certain regions, the U.S. a year and a half ago, Europe now, to try to have organized banking collapses so they can consolidate without collapsing the entire system.
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:46.360]  So they lower us, then they lower Europe. They lower the third world, then they lower us again, they lower Europe, then they lower Asia.
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:54.360]  Mark Fauber and others, a great analyst, he's saying 90% chance next 12 months total implosion of China.
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:26:02.360]  And so this is an organized global collapse and it's been declassified. The Great Depression was engineered. Wealth is not destroyed. It's transferred.
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:09.360]  The banking system, not your corner bank, but the big mega banks, they organize the booms and busts and the bubbles.
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:12.360]  We have this in the internal Goldman Sachs emails.
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:34.360]  Redback, then explain to them how fractional reserve banking works.
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:52.360]  There are numbers that somebody has deposited in their savings account or into a CD. The bank will loan out eight to ten times that much money that they have in their reserve.
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:27:01.360]  They can put out eight or ten loans out there covering a thousand bucks and all they've got is a thousand bucks in their reserve.
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:06.360]  It's a gamble for them that nobody's going to come in and want all their money at the same time.
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:12.360]  That's not a good explanation, but that's...
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:21.360]  And that gives them an unfair trade advantage and they also control the regulators so only the mega banks are allowed to do this, so of course they take the planet over.
[3:27:21.360 --> 3:27:38.360]  And it's all phony, it's all fraud and we've just been... we've been had by our trust. We trusted people and they violated our trust.
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:47.360]  And so what the bankers now do instead of just fractional reserve banking, with derivatives it takes it to a level of a hundred to one, two hundred to one, three hundred to one.
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:58.360]  But instead of the banks doing fractional, they sell paper crud that's certified as gold backed up by taxpayers to the governments, to the pension funds.
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:02.360]  They make money on the way up and then on the bailout on the way down.
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:23.360]  Yeah, the bankers... well, just to give you an example of how Goldman Sachs operate, in Montana we had the Montana Power Company and it was a blue chip stock on the big board for many, many years, one of the very best.
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:42.360]  It was a company that was so solid and everything and Goldman Sachs went to the state legislature in Montana and talked them into deregulating and one thing and another and they had a Patsy that got elected or chosen as the CEO.
[3:28:42.360 --> 3:29:01.360]  And today in a matter of, well it's been ten years now almost, but in a matter of a couple of years, a company that was blue chip and worth just tremendous amount of money was totally wiped out, totally wiped out.
[3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:23.360]  Those people, one lady that had spent her life as a bookkeeper in the headquarters for the company, she was getting about three thousand dollars a month to live on in her retirement and she lost every penny of it and she was having to live on three hundred and some odd dollars of social security.
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:32.360]  And to explain how this works, Goldman goes into governments, corporations, they take all the real assets out, run up debts in the company's name and then implode it.
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:47.360]  I mean, it's a mafia organization and they do that to countries right now and now they're doing it to the United States and of the American people, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, stand up and say no, they just say you're a racist, sit down and shut up, we're taking over healthcare, we're taking over everything.
[3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:58.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:23.360]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:21.360]  It means all the world under their control.
[3:31:27.360 --> 3:31:35.360]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:40.360]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[3:31:40.360 --> 3:31:43.360]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[3:31:43.360 --> 3:31:49.360]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[3:33:00.360 --> 3:33:07.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:11.360]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:33:11.360 --> 3:33:15.360]  There is a war on for your mind. We're going to let Red Beckman go here in a moment.
[3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:19.360]  I appreciate all this time and I'm going to talk to Carl, Mike, Paul, John and Cliff.
[3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:25.360]  And then that's it for calls because I want to recap the top news stories and hit some other news we haven't gotten to.
[3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:30.360]  But I'm looking at the Drudge Report right now. TSA worker made fun of every day.
[3:33:30.360 --> 3:33:32.360]  They make the TSA workers go through the body scanners.
[3:33:32.360 --> 3:33:37.360]  The staff would all stand around and make fun of the size of his sexual organ.
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:40.360]  And he finally punched one of them and he's been arrested.
[3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:47.360]  And they put it in MSNBC and said, this is good to fight terror and too bad if you got a small, you know what?
[3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:49.360]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:57.360]  This is MSNBC headline, MIA worker assaults colleague who made crack at genitalia after walk-through machine.
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:01.360]  And they've got the police report that the smoking gun linked up on Drudge.
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:04.360]  In fact, let's go to Drudge and put that smoking gun article up for people.
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:09.360]  This is the humiliation where they put your family, your wife, your children, you through it.
[3:34:09.360 --> 3:34:11.360]  They're staging the terror. It's all fake.
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:17.360]  You got Bloomberg saying, if we say you're an extremist, you can't own a gun, no judge, no jury.
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:21.360]  We got Lieberman saying arrest citizens, charge them as terrorists without even charging them.
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:25.360]  No judge, no jury, no habeas corpus, no due process.
[3:34:25.360 --> 3:34:29.360]  I mean, there is no doubt the people running this country want tyranny.
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:33.360]  And they abuse the abusers. They make the TSA people do this.
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:38.360]  And I've seen article after article where they make fun of good looking TSA women's breast,
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:42.360]  where they print off Hollywood stars, naked bodies and record them and laugh at us.
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:45.360]  I mean, this is just total police state domination.
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:51.360]  What is it about tyrants, Red Beckman, where they just love to dominate you and rub it in?
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:56.360]  They are crippled. They are mentally crippled.
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:02.360]  And when reality hits them, they're going to be in a state of shock.
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:14.360]  And of course, you know, I really anticipate some very, very, very severe backlash
[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:19.360]  coming from the people. It's going to come from the masses.
[3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:25.360]  Because as I've said so many times, there's so many more of us than there is of them.
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:31.360]  And we are the ones who are going to win. It has always been this way in history.
[3:35:31.360 --> 3:35:38.360]  Sure, they take a toll to start with, but then enough people become upset and angry
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:46.360]  and they reach a point where they lash back. And when they lash back, it's Katie Barthador.
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:51.360]  Absolutely. And that's why they want to invoke racial division.
[3:35:51.360 --> 3:35:54.360]  That's why they want to play the illegal aliens off against the American people.
[3:35:54.360 --> 3:35:57.360]  And the media tells them, oh, you're poor victims. Go burn some stuff.
[3:35:57.360 --> 3:36:01.360]  It's because the globalists want us fighting with each other.
[3:36:01.360 --> 3:36:05.360]  Instead of recognizing the offshore banks that have destroyed all of our nations
[3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:08.360]  and are in the process of further destroying our economic base.
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:13.360]  That's why I reach out to all Americans and say, don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.360]  We must secure the borders. And when the banks try to invoke racial issues over this,
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:23.360]  they are engaged in treason. They are engaged in divide and conquer.
[3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:27.360]  But they're divide and conquer, you know, saying if you're against socialized medicine,
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:30.360]  you're a racist. It isn't going to work anymore.
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:35.360]  And I think I know, Red, they've overplayed this so many times that they have screwed the pooch.
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:45.360]  Absolutely. They've done it to themselves. And their day of judgment is coming shortly.
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:50.360]  Absolutely, my friend. Now, before you leave us, you've written several great books.
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:53.360]  You basically sell them at costs. They're very informative.
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:56.360]  And you got a big response the last time you were on.
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:36:58.360]  It's great to get your material out to people.
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:01.360]  Tell folks about a few of your books and how they get them.
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:04.360]  Well, I was on a couple of months ago on your program.
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:10.360]  And this is a barometer that tells me how this thing is expanding
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:13.360]  and how people are searching for answers.
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:17.360]  Because we got the biggest response to an offer that I made,
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:20.360]  and I'm just going to remake that offer today.
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:26.360]  Anybody that sends us a $10 bill or so, we will send them a copy of my book,
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:29.360]  Why the Militia, a very, very good book.
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:31.360]  They will love that book.
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:36.360]  And then the little book, Walls in Our Minds, that is just so basic.
[3:37:36.360 --> 3:37:39.360]  And you'll want to read it more than once.
[3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:42.360]  And for $10, why? We'll send that.
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:48.360]  And that's about a $15 offer because it's over $2 for the postage.
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:51.360]  The postage is eating us alive on this stuff.
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:57.360]  But we'll send that, Why the Militia, and Walls in Our Minds.
[3:37:57.360 --> 3:38:01.360]  And if you ordered last time, order again and see to it that your family,
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.360]  all the people in your family, get a chance to read these two little books.
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:09.360]  And, of course, they have to order it from Red Beckman.
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:13.360]  And that's P-O-Box, 6-1, Carols.
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:20.360]  And that's C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S. Carols Washington.
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:25.360]  And that is 98609 zip code.
[3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:32.360]  And the last time we had to have extra help come in and take care of the mail.
[3:38:32.360 --> 3:38:39.360]  And people that have listened to this program today and have heard this excitement about what's going on,
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:45.360]  they should be trying to get themselves better informed immediately.
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:47.360]  Not tomorrow, the next day, or anything else.
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:53.360]  Try to get going on it right away, and you'll be glad you did.
[3:38:53.360 --> 3:38:58.360]  Absolutely. And, you know, the Southern Poverty Law Center demonized Ron Paul yourself, myself, and others.
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:05.360]  But they called you Bulldozer Red because the IRS bulldozed your house many years ago.
[3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:12.360]  And that just is an example of just how criminal these groups are and how they think it's funny.
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:15.360]  Red Beckman, we'll talk to you again soon. God bless you.
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:25.360]  And God bless you. And I just know that you're in a good position to get the word out, and it's working.
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:27.360]  Thank you for letting me be on.
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:29.360]  Thank you for joining us. There goes Red Beckman.
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.360]  Now, I'm going to jam some final calls in, but first I want to recap news and one plug here.
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:36.360]  Because I realize I've done three and a half hours of radio and never even plugged my videos today.
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:39.360]  And that's how we fund this operation and this imploding economy.
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:41.360]  Number one, the videos wake people up.
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:47.360]  They're one of the best, most successful tools out there. And it's you getting them and making copies that is having this big effect.
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:52.360]  But secondarily, it also financially supports it. So you see it basically as a donation.
[3:39:52.360 --> 3:40:00.360]  When you buy a Patriot Don't Tread on Me t-shirt or an Obama Joker t-shirt or Fall the Republic that details how the banks are taking over
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:03.360]  and how to stop them, this film, everybody's got to see this, folks.
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:06.360]  This is the number one most important video out there.
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:12.360]  This film, Invisible Empire New Order Defined, just came out year and a half of the making, big budget.
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:19.360]  Jason Burmes was the director, I'm the producer, covers the globalist crimes, their activities, their pervert rings, their drug dealing.
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:23.360]  Such an important film for people that want to understand the New World Order.
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:28.360]  And just hundreds of clips of world leaders calling for world government, New World Order.
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:33.360]  Anybody in denial needs to see Invisible Empire available at infowars.com on the online video bookstore.
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:37.360]  And of course, police state for the rise of FEMA.
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:44.360]  Two hours, 20 plus minutes, 30 minutes of extras, the FEMA camps, the troop splitting train to take on the Tea Parties, the gun confiscation training,
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:50.360]  all documented, the military admitting it, the military being told to set up my camera crew and say they're terrorists.
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:54.360]  It's all on video, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the Patriot Act.
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:41:01.360]  Anybody that wants to know how they're coming at us, how the globalist have tried to brainwash the military and police to go after the American people.
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:10.360]  The Governor's Council under North Com, the Homeland Security, Homeland Brigade, police state for the rise of FEMA.
[3:41:10.360 --> 3:41:12.360]  I had made a police state film in almost eight years.
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.360]  This is my fourth film. It's on the police state. It is so important.
[3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:21.360]  Everyone see this available on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:27.360]  Or you can see all my films in super high quality and download them and burn them to desk and give them to people at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:34.360]  We have 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month. And again, your financial support of our sponsors and the products we sell makes this show possible.
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:37.360]  So please support us as well.
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:41.360]  You can also write to us. If you want to give us a donation, that's fine too.
[3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:51.360]  That's all helping us. P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:54.360]  We're having the biggest effect. We are the tip of the spear.
[3:41:54.360 --> 3:41:58.360]  We're one small part of the whole, but we are the biggest small part.
[3:41:58.360 --> 3:42:02.360]  And we're really having a big effect. And all that credit goes to you out there.
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:04.360]  I want to salute you and thank you.
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:07.360]  And the Straits are dire.
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:10.360]  This isn't just Alex Jones saying this. You can go read the bill.
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:15.360]  Judge Napolitano two weeks ago talked about this on the show, and he's a former federal judge.
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:24.360]  S3081, John McCain and others that have introduced this, Lieberman.
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:32.360]  It says no judge, no jury, no charges, no indictment, no grand jury, no trial, nothing.
[3:42:32.360 --> 3:42:37.360]  The government, the Pentagon, for any reason it states wants to arrest a U.S. citizen.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:42.360]  You can be secretly arrested, snatch and grab. They pull up in a white van, throw a bag over your head.
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:47.360]  They can fly you to torture centers. It says enhanced interrogation. You don't get a trial.
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:54.360]  It is for U.S. citizens. And no court, no nothing can do anything about it.
[3:42:54.360 --> 3:42:58.360]  It is just the absolute end of America. Now, what dovetails with that?
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:02.360]  Raw story, Lieberman. No U.S. citizenship rights for terrorists.
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:06.360]  So they're saying, oh, this guy was a U.S. citizen. He doesn't deserve a trial.
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:09.360]  Well, if you've got the evidence that he did this, you need to put it on.
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:14.360]  But it turns out they were running drills, which is always a sign of it being staged.
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:19.360]  And it turns out that he was part of a CIA controlled group.
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:24.360]  This is official information. It's up at prisonplanet.com, Times Square Bomber,
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:29.360]  link with CIA control group, terror group, always the same, just like Lee Harvey Oswald,
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:34.360]  Tim McVeigh, same story, over and over and over again.
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:39.360]  And continuing Bloomberg says, deny second amendment to anyone on the terror watch list.
[3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:43.360]  Million and a half people on it. Now they're saying you can't have a job if you're on it.
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:48.360]  No way to get off of it. Secret list, a secret government, they arrest you and say you're a terrorist.
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:53.360]  And remember, all the training is for the Tea Party's conservatives, returning veterans and gun owners.
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:58.360]  All you conservatives have been sold on getting rid of the Bill of Rights because you think it's for brown people overseas.
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:01.360]  It's for Americans, regardless of what color you are.
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:04.360]  Here's another one, World Net Daily, in case you doubt me.
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.360]  Next step, no guns allowed for right-wing extremists.
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:12.360]  Bill empowers Attorney General to forbid firearms for those suspected dangerous.
[3:44:12.360 --> 3:44:16.360]  World Net Daily, HR 2159.
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:20.360]  They have federal and state bills all over the country to do this.
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:24.360]  100% unconstitutional, 100% illegal.
[3:44:24.360 --> 3:44:30.360]  You better be afraid of the big out of control government, not their little patsy boogie men, okay?
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:36.360]  People just, oh, I'm so scared, I want to give all my rights up or the terrorists might give me a break.
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:42.360]  Now, here's another one, Lieberman seeks to strip citizens of citizenship.
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:48.360]  No judge, no jury, the Pentagon strips it. Same deal, federal bill.
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:55.360]  Here's another one, Schumer, as bad as he is, says Schumer changes tune on stripping extremists of citizenship.
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:45:02.360]  A key U.S. senator who indicated tentative early support for stripping U.S. nationals tied to overseas terror groups.
[3:45:02.360 --> 3:45:04.360]  It's a third discretion.
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:06.360]  Other citizenship now firmly opposes the plan.
[3:45:06.360 --> 3:45:14.360]  His office said Wednesday, Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer has said Tuesday that he had not reviewed the controversial proposal from independent Senator Joe Lieberman,
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:16.360]  but that it sounds like something I'd support.
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:22.360]  Having learned about the proposal, the senator believes it would be found unconstitutional and would also be ineffective in this context.
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:30.360]  So they want, and they've got the bills introduced, because just suddenly you can't buy a gun because the government says so.
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:34.360]  And remember who Bloomberg blamed on Monday and Tuesday?
[3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:38.360]  He said, I think Tea Party people probably did this attempted bombing.
[3:45:38.360 --> 3:45:42.360]  This is going to be used on the American people.
[3:45:42.360 --> 3:45:46.360]  You're the target. You're not even allowed to wear an American flag.
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:48.360]  Businesses that have them up get them torn down.
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:52.360]  Kids that try to wear them at school, this isn't the first time, get sent home.
[3:45:52.360 --> 3:45:55.360]  You don't even have the right in America to wear an American flag.
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:46:00.360]  That's these people. They're not liberals. They're not conservatives. They're a bunch of tyrants.
[3:46:00.360 --> 3:46:03.360]  This stuff's all bipartisan to strip citizens of their citizenship.
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:08.360]  The Pentagon strips you of your citizenship and throws a bag over your head.
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:15.360]  They're the terrorists, folks. The people running our military staged the terror attacks to fool the military into going along with this.
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:18.360]  They've been caught over and over again.
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:24.360]  Oh, man. I mean, look at this article. Students kicked off campus for wearing American flags.
[3:46:24.360 --> 3:46:31.360]  Then they cut to teachers and students saying, it is insulting of Mexican heritage to wear an American flag.
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:37.360]  What in the world? That's telling Hispanic Americans that you can't, because some of the kids are Hispanic,
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:42.360]  that you can't wear it. They tell Hispanic kids you can't wear American flags.
[3:46:42.360 --> 3:46:48.360]  I mean, this is not the twilight zone. You think Chalcescu was a joke? You think Stalin was a joke?
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:52.360]  You think Mal was a joke? You think Hitler was a joke? You think Pol Pot was a joke?
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:57.360]  You think Fidel Castro was a joke? You think Julius Caesar was a joke? You think Lenin was a joke?
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:01.360]  You think all this evil. This is what normally happens, folks.
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:07.360]  America's being taken over by offshore banks. I don't want to be the enemy of the illegal aliens.
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:13.360]  A lot of them are hardworking good people, but the government and the media and the universities are radicalizing them,
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:19.360]  teaching them to hate America. When I went to Anderson High School, I was taught in history class that America was bad
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:26.360]  and that the U.S. belonged to Mexico, and I was taken to a UT field trip by art class to be told the same thing.
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:31.360]  I mean, you know, this is what goes on. And how dare I ever wear an American flag?
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:37.360]  I cannot believe this is going on. More articles they just brought in here.
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:41.360]  Oh, my God. These are from GCNLive.com, and I'm going to your phone calls.
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:44.360]  I mean, I'm not the radical for wanting to wear an American flag.
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:47.360]  I'm not the radical for wanting my bill of rights and constitution.
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:51.360]  I'm not a terrorist because I support the original Tea Party that Ron Paul founded.
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:55.360]  Audit the Fed pushed strengthened by second front in the Senate.
[3:47:55.360 --> 3:48:00.360]  Very exciting. Steve Watson, GCNLive.com. That's another important article.
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:04.360]  Patriotic American students persecuted for stars and stripes on Cinco de Mayo.
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:09.360]  This is a Curt Nimmo article that fully details what's going on. GCNLive.com.
[3:48:09.360 --> 3:48:14.360]  Here's another one you want to watch this video. We ran out of time. It's Alex Jones on RT.
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:22.360]  Greek crisis will come to America. Times Square Eyewitness said bombscare looked like drill,
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:27.360]  and we also have a cop saying it was a drill.
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:31.360]  Very important information. Stock market falls more than a thousand points.
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  That's also GCNLive.com. Okay, we are out of time here except for calls for people that have been patiently holding.
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:42.360]  It stops getting crazy, folks. Gold up $33 today.
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:47.360]  Let's talk to Carl and Oklahoma. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:51.360]  Yes, sir. Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:56.360]  I want to give kudos to you and all the other guys that are out on the front lines taking the heat.
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:04.360]  I know you're sacrificing your life for this, as I have been for 22 years against these buggers.
[3:49:04.360 --> 3:49:10.360]  I have some heads up for you here if you'll ask your people to just take a look at it.
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:17.360]  The insurance military game is done by Munich Re out of Germany.
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:25.360]  They use derivatives on derivatives on derivatives, and they're taking $2 million per person.
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:28.360]  They get killed over in the other country.
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:35.360]  Yes, I had actually seen that. That's like Walmart and others take $2, 3, 4, 5 million insurance policies,
[3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:37.360]  especially out on those greeters.
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:41.360]  Those greeters, oh, they're paying them $7 an hour. They give an old lady a job.
[3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:46.360]  No, they got $3 million on her, and they've got an actuary knowing when she's going to die,
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:48.360]  and the family never knows they get $3 million on her.
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:54.360]  Exactly. We're all seen as animals. They suck on, and all the big banks make money off of every dead troop,
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:58.360]  and the more dead troops, the better. That's why they won't buy them body armor.
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:00.360]  They just hate everybody. Go ahead.
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:07.360]  Harper's Magazine, October 2009. You get that on page 42. You'll come up with some of that.
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:11.360]  Give folks the headline. Harper's Magazine, tell us again.
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  Harper's Magazine, October 2009. It's page 42.
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  And they talk about how these big derivatives companies are buying insurance policies on the troops.
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:29.360]  Yes, sir. And it goes back to Munich Re, and isn't it interesting that Germany just surpassed China as a world leading economy?
[3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:35.360]  Well, the Germans government itself is always trying to take over, and it's a big part of the euro,
[3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:40.360]  and Germany's now the third largest weapons producer.
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:43.360]  There are three more things that I need to cover with you, Parme.
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:44.360]  Go ahead.
[3:50:44.360 --> 3:50:48.360]  Armories have been shut down back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s,
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:51.360]  and they moved in the SWAT teams at the local armories.
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:53.360]  Yes, I know. That's key.
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:51:00.360]  Animals now are migrating from the higher parts in the northwest.
[3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:01.360]  Stay there.
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:03.360]  Don't answer it.
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:07.360]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:10.360]  it's time for you to call zero dead in 90 days.

[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:24.360]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:31.360]  and without attorneys or going to court.

[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:05.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:06.360]  tyranny is here.
[3:52:06.360 --> 3:52:10.360]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[3:52:10.360 --> 3:52:13.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[3:52:13.360 --> 3:52:18.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:25.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:31.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:35.360]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:42.360]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[3:52:42.360 --> 3:52:45.360]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[3:52:45.360 --> 3:52:49.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:51.360]  The police state isn't coming.

[3:53:00.360 --> 3:53:07.360]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:16.360]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?

[3:54:00.360 --> 3:54:17.360]  Okay, look, we got loaded phone lines. I'm trying to give each caller about 45 seconds so we can get to as many of you as you can. I forgot to mention pre-sale of Don't Tread on Me about states rights, how to take the states back.
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:24.360]  Great new Gary Franchi slash William Lewis film is starting pre-sales today at infowars.com. You'll get it first if you order it from us.
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:36.360]  I'm in the film. Great new film. The trailer, the new trailer that we produced is going up in the next 10 minutes at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and it's going to be up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com the next 30 minutes or so.
[3:54:36.360 --> 3:54:40.360]  So just be made aware of that. Very excited about that. Another salvo in the info war.
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:50.360]  Real fast Carl, you're talking about animals moving out of a lot of areas. They're saying the super volcano could blow up that's thousands of times bigger of what's in Iceland.
[3:54:50.360 --> 3:54:53.360]  Is that what you're getting at? Because I've seen the articles.
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:55:02.360]  Right. Now I called Canoupe up there in the South Dakota. You had him on your program before. He's the one that's going to get the new order up there.
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:10.360]  And I gave him the heads up on that and he says, yeah, he's aware of it. And so are the people in Oregon. I talked to White Feather last weekend.
[3:55:10.360 --> 3:55:23.360]  And then Canoupe was to pull it over and stop at gunpoint yesterday as they try to take his little boy from him. He's already gone through the tribal courts and they gave him permission to have.
[3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:29.360]  Unfortunately, we're out of time. You've covered about five subjects. You'll have to call me back another day because I want to get to some other people, but I appreciate your call.
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:36.360]  I got to just do a whole show. The next bunch of shows with no guests, but we do have Salente coming up tomorrow and Bob Chapman. So it's a catch 22.
[3:55:36.360 --> 3:55:41.360]  I do want to hear your calls though. Mike in California, you're on the air quickly. Go ahead.
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:49.360]  You bet, sir. Thank you. Bloomberg gave us a bit of an important record. I mentioned the other day on the phone that took that guy's statement.
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:55.360]  You're saying we need to protect, we need the professionals to protect us against terrorists and take our guns away, but if you call the cops, they don't show up.
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:02.360]  We are the professionals. We are the people. We are the professionals. We're the ones who are always on duty at 24 hours a day in this country.
[3:56:02.360 --> 3:56:12.360]  You're talking about Bloomberg saying we don't have a right to guns, only the police have rights to guns, and he wants to ban citizen zoning guns, basically.
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:19.360]  Yeah, but we don't have any policemen. They take you out from the ramp or two on duty, so we're going to be the car those guys. It doesn't do any good.
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:22.360]  Well, they're already telling all the cops they can only write tickets. They can't help us.
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:29.360]  Yeah, exactly. So we need to be the ones taking care of it and watching for terrorists and being able to protect ourselves against terrorists, in my opinion.
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:36.360]  Real quick on the other point, Limpoletano was mentioning three laws to help protect the people from the federal onslaught.
[3:56:36.360 --> 3:56:48.360]  It looks like it's tending. I kind of rewrote it and put it up to Barbara Botcher adding me, state isn't any, but any state employees know how to enforce unconstitutional laws, as well as any military with no amnesty,
[3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:58.360]  and the penalty would be either their choice. They could be either exiled or put to death, let them have their own choice of what they want for doing so.
[3:56:58.360 --> 3:57:07.360]  All right, I appreciate your call. I got to jump. Your phone's not that good. We're almost out of time. Let's talk to Paul in California. You're on the air.
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:17.360]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing today? I wanted to say thank you. Obviously, you're always on the top, and I love you for it. I've actually been with you in New York, and we've actually protested together.
[3:57:17.360 --> 3:57:28.360]  I'm actually at a sidebar note. I was calling basically just to get in touch with you because I have somebody who wants to help you with a lot of your funding.
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:41.360]  Side of that, you know, I haven't listened to your show in quite some time, and it upset me because there's so much stuff that's happening that I'm just unaware of, and that really upset me because I've always been one of these guys.
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:55.360]  Don't worry. I do this about 16 hours a day, and I don't know half of what's going on, and that's the problem. It's so bad, so crazy, you know, you can't wear American flags in America because the illegals say so.
[3:57:55.360 --> 3:58:05.360]  I mean, I'm out of time. Send us an email, showtipsandinfowars.com. I apologize to John, Cliff, others. Call me back tomorrow, head of the line.
[3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:12.360]  Maybe I should just open the show up tomorrow with your calls because we do have a bunch of big, informative guests on the Friday show coming up.
[3:58:12.360 --> 3:58:19.360]  Quite a rant in the first hour on a host of issues, especially students kicked off campus for wearing American flag tees.
[3:58:19.360 --> 3:58:28.360]  That's about to be retransmitted on the internet at infowars.com, the podcast, the free iPhone app at infowars.com, and reared on AM and FM stations across the country.
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:36.360]  We are getting a lot of new affiliates. I want to salute all of them and just want to say a great job to all the listeners, sponsors, everyone that makes this broadcast possible.
[3:58:36.360 --> 3:58:41.360]  We, the people, will defeat the New World Order and all their servants. God bless you all. Great job, crew.
