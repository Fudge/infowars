[00:00.000 --> 00:22.680]  So I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos
[00:22.680 --> 00:27.960]  of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[00:27.960 --> 00:33.600]  Now four media giants are banding together to take down controversial info wars content
[00:33.600 --> 00:34.600]  from their site.
[00:34.600 --> 00:41.560]  YouTube, Facebook and Apple all announcing they're removing his content from their platforms.
[00:41.560 --> 00:44.720]  Yesterday Alex Jones became an unperson.
[00:44.720 --> 00:50.360]  Apple last night removed the entire library of Alex Jones' podcast from their store.
[00:50.360 --> 00:56.120]  The conspiracy theories are beyond the realm, are not only beyond being offensive, they're
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.880]  dangerous and we don't do enough in telling people out there right now this morning people
[01:01.880 --> 01:06.800]  who read newspapers exactly who these people are and what they believe.
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.720]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.720]  corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead
[01:16.720 --> 01:19.480]  of this critical midterm election.
[01:19.480 --> 01:24.480]  And the Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.200]  who's running this whole thing to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.040]  to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[01:33.040 --> 01:37.160]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.440]  cannot violate people's free speech.
[01:39.440 --> 01:43.040]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning
[01:43.040 --> 01:47.120]  people that are outright banning people and they're blocking conservatives involved in
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.720]  their own first amendment political speech.
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.840]  The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don't know they've been banned because
[01:54.840 --> 01:57.720]  they keep posting but no one sees their content.
[01:57.720 --> 02:01.840]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.880]  conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other just like communist China.
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.360]  This is dangerous authoritarianism and they packaged silencing Americans who are popular
[02:12.360 --> 02:17.120]  and well-spoken as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News not because what I say is bad
[02:17.120 --> 02:19.960]  but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.080]  Hey, Jack, I appreciate your first amendment.
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.320]  But I have a right to face my accusers, Jack.
[02:25.320 --> 02:27.320]  You are incredible, Shane.
[02:27.320 --> 02:28.320]  How are you doing?
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.320]  You're just a look at you.
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.320]  Look at you.
[02:30.320 --> 02:34.320]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[02:34.320 --> 02:35.320]  Who are you, my friend?
[02:35.320 --> 02:36.320]  Yeah, sure.
[02:36.320 --> 02:37.320]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are.
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.320]  Anybody hoping to be platforming?
[02:38.320 --> 02:39.320]  Tens of billions of views?
[02:39.320 --> 02:40.320]  Info wars.
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.320]  Better than Russian land ball?
[02:41.320 --> 02:42.320]  You know who Info Wars is.
[02:42.320 --> 02:43.320]  Playing this joke over here.
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.620]  At that point, somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones
[02:47.620 --> 02:50.320]  while they were looking for him and speaking with anyone.
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.320]  And they tell Congress that they're not censoring anybody.
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.320]  Even though we have all the Google documents, we have internal Google videos, we have internal
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.620]  Twitter videos, where their executives talk about how they're censoring everyone.
[03:03.620 --> 03:10.120]  I think as someone with a Ph.D. in computer science and five years of working at one
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.120]  of the world's top computer science companies, I don't see any doubt that it's very politically
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.120]  biased.
[03:17.120 --> 03:19.120]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.120]  We're aware of your activities trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.120]  results.
[03:25.120 --> 03:27.120]  Google is evil.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.120]  Google is evil.
[03:29.120 --> 03:30.620]  Google is...
[03:30.620 --> 03:37.600]  In 2016, Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.480]  at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported.
[03:43.480 --> 03:50.200]  I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches prior to
[03:50.200 --> 03:57.000]  Election Day, and Google's search results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  Clinton.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.280]  When I joined Google, I saw a lot of employees being mistreated and abused and harassed for
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.280]  sharing conservative views or just for questioning company policies.
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.400]  I don't get a day in court, they lie about me, Google only puts lies up, all the top
[04:11.400 --> 04:15.480]  searches are lies about me and my family, and that guy helps round the political dissidents
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.720]  and then his people come to lie to Congress over and over and over again and we don't
[04:19.720 --> 04:25.240]  get to respond to them, so Google is helping build censorship systems in China for a global
[04:25.240 --> 04:29.440]  social score they've tested there to totally control every aspect of our lives.
[04:29.440 --> 04:35.640]  There's this very peculiar background where Google is working with the Chinese Communist
[04:35.640 --> 04:40.480]  government and not with the U.S. military, so the Project Maven decision was a decision
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.240]  not to work with the A.I.
[04:42.240 --> 04:49.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on this Wednesday, August 7th, 2019, global transmission.
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.720]  As I warned, Pakistan is now announcing that they intend to go to war with India.
[04:55.720 --> 04:56.720]  This is huge.
[04:56.720 --> 05:02.720]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.040]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.480]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[05:10.480 --> 05:11.480]  over two decades.
[05:11.480 --> 05:14.880]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.200]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[05:18.200 --> 05:22.440]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[05:22.440 --> 05:25.520]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.560]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.600]  politics and ran American economy, almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.680]  after the Great Depression.
[05:34.680 --> 05:39.880]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[05:39.880 --> 05:44.600]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.600]  free press.
[05:45.600 --> 05:50.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time, it's not happening.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.760]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[05:56.760 --> 06:26.720]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[06:26.720 --> 06:56.280]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw, even it is what
[06:56.280 --> 07:12.320]  you just saw.
[07:12.320 --> 07:24.320]  I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War? Terror? Disease? There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:24.320 --> 07:30.320]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Suttler.
[07:30.320 --> 07:43.320]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:43.320 --> 07:52.320]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[07:52.320 --> 08:04.320]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[08:04.320 --> 08:20.320]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[08:20.320 --> 08:26.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:50.320 --> 09:15.320]  Welcome my friends, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide transmission, Wednesday, August 7th, 2009.
[09:15.320 --> 09:38.320]  Pakistan warns of war after India's move to end Kashmir's special status, and the entire leftist globalist media decries India taking back roughly 20% of their nation that was taken by Islamists from them with the UN's backing.
[09:38.320 --> 09:50.320]  All of Pakistan was once India. India once stretched all the way to where Iran is today and then into the middle of China, but it's been taken.
[09:50.320 --> 10:16.320]  And the communist Chinese have invaded with paramilitary plainclothes people. They've been aiding the Islamists and working with Pakistan, and Modi has been telling them, since he got into office, that they better stop or he's going to stop letting it be an autonomous zone and is going to invade.
[10:16.320 --> 10:27.320]  Local governments will still be in control there, but Indian citizens will be allowed to move there. You know why that's important?
[10:27.320 --> 10:46.320]  Because there are millions and millions and millions and millions of Indians who are Hindus, or who are Buddhist, or who are Christians, who were driven out of Kashmir in the last 70 years.
[10:46.320 --> 11:14.320]  There was a strange twist of fate. Yesterday, I was with my wife shopping, replacing something that she lost, and the man helping us was a gentleman from Kashmir, basically a refugee from Kashmir, and we talked about 20 minutes about the situation.
[11:14.320 --> 11:28.320]  So you think about that, the Muslims made India make a deal where people that aren't Muslims can't move, even if they lived there previously, to Kashmir.
[11:28.320 --> 11:46.320]  But see, that's how it works. Once the Muslims become a majority, they say, hey, hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more.
[11:46.320 --> 12:09.320]  And so CNN, the Associated Press, and all of them are, oh, Indian, Hindu, extremist, supremacist, nationalist have gone into Kashmir, and it could cause World War, the most dangerous place in the world, the flashpoint.
[12:09.320 --> 12:24.320]  Now, again, notice this all started Monday when China devalued their currency that also screws over India, and China is taking about 30% of the country without asking. They were never even in the deal.
[12:24.320 --> 12:41.320]  The autonomous UN, 1949, original deal, 1947. And now, suicide bombers every week are blowing people up at military bases, they're driving trucks into military bases, all over India.
[12:41.320 --> 13:05.320]  And Modi said, listen, I know the Connie network and all you guys are behind it, so we're going to send in, the word is, the real word is, a half a million troops, that's the numbers I've got from inside sources, a half a million, or roughly 40% of India's military has rotated into Kashmir.
[13:05.320 --> 13:16.320]  So yeah, this is the stuff World War's made of. So there's a lot of other incredible breaking news. But I kind of obsessed on this for three, four hours yesterday, because it is a big deal.
[13:16.320 --> 13:34.320]  And obviously, any of our military listeners or folks that are into history know how serious this is. But I'm going to suspend the coverage of it until later in the second hour, because I really want to be able to cover all the other big stuff that's been breaking
[13:34.320 --> 13:50.320]  and take your calls. But nothing is as big as this. And it all ties in to the proxy war World War four that started with China devaluing the currency with the economic warfare going on, and with Trump increasing the tariffs
[13:50.320 --> 14:07.320]  another 300 billion on top of the other 300 billion. China, again, was given a one sided deal, allowing all of this. And there's another very important paper out today that I'll be hitting next hour.
[14:07.320 --> 14:27.320]  From the National Endowment of Democracy, the National Endowment of Democracy, it's really a think tank CIA group is a US nonprofit soft power organization. And then it just goes into how they are trying to establish a peaceful world government.
[14:27.320 --> 14:39.320]  And the reason this is so important is this is the establishment. And you read their testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[14:39.320 --> 15:00.320]  It is word for word, word for word. What I've been telling you about China for at least 15 years that I've been hot on the China issue that they've infiltrated the media, the colleges, the high schools that they're buying off the reporters and that they're the ones funding all the social warfare
[15:00.320 --> 15:12.320]  breakdown. Yeah, when you see people saying the president's a white supremacist that he's directly responsible for the deaths in El Paso, and that he better not show his face there.
[15:12.320 --> 15:27.320]  Those people are getting money from companies that are multinational that are chai comm owned. And the chai comms have a term they use called sharp power.
[15:27.320 --> 15:40.320]  And that's a nice word for absolute criminal mafia activity. And no holds bar warfare economically culturally. And this whole thing breaks it down.
[15:40.320 --> 15:52.320]  So when I tell you the Democrats are chai comm operatives, they are not now let that sink in. That's why they're distracting with this Russia stuff that I'll tell you.
[15:52.320 --> 15:58.320]  Russia can't tie its shoelaces, man. Russia is teetering on the verge of having the globalist overthrow it.
[15:58.320 --> 16:08.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:08.320 --> 16:15.320]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[16:15.320 --> 16:28.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:28.320 --> 16:40.320]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:40.320 --> 16:49.320]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:49.320 --> 16:54.320]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:54.320 --> 17:06.320]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:06.320 --> 17:18.320]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.

[18:00.320 --> 18:03.320]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[18:03.320 --> 18:12.320]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.320 --> 18:21.320]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[18:21.320 --> 18:29.320]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.320 --> 18:35.320]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.320 --> 18:43.320]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.320 --> 18:51.320]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[18:51.320 --> 18:57.320]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.320]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[18:59.320 --> 19:08.320]  Before I started working at Info Wars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:08.320 --> 19:15.320]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[19:15.320 --> 19:23.320]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests, telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[19:23.320 --> 19:32.320]  And so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.320]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an elite supplement.
[19:38.320 --> 19:45.320]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went.
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.320]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[19:48.320 --> 19:54.320]  It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[19:54.320 --> 20:21.320]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:21.320 --> 20:30.320]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. India is now in a proxy war with the United States against China as China threatens to invade.
[20:30.320 --> 20:36.320]  Taiwan is invading with paramilitary forces. Hong Kong.
[20:36.320 --> 20:46.320]  We have the deep state here openly trying to trigger an open civil war and they're actually starting to get some traction.
[20:46.320 --> 20:54.320]  It now emerged that the shooter in Ohio was basically responding to what he thought was a right-wing attack in El Paso.
[20:54.320 --> 21:00.320]  And so a vowed devil worshiper and a worshiper of Antifa and the rape of women.
[21:00.320 --> 21:07.320]  He actually was in a cult that had a rock band that was into the direct rape of women and torture of women.
[21:07.320 --> 21:14.320]  He loved Bernie Sanders. This is the standard meth-head woman-hating demon we've described for. He was an incel.
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.320]  And so he went out in a blaze of blood and death killing his own sister.
[21:19.320 --> 21:24.320]  And now it's our fault. We've got to turn our guns in so this guy can come kill us. Our people like him.
[21:24.320 --> 21:28.320]  The same spirit just jumps out of him into somebody else and goes and has some fun.
[21:28.320 --> 21:38.320]  So we've got that all coming up. We've got Boy Scouts have a pedophile epidemic, MSM reports, and are hiding hundreds in its ranks.
[21:38.320 --> 21:43.320]  They're not hiding anything. They hand out the condoms and tell people to have sex with five-year-olds. That's official.
[21:43.320 --> 21:52.320]  So I was on an airplane with one of the Boy Scouts of America leaders and I guess he didn't know who I was.
[21:52.320 --> 21:58.320]  And he was talking on the phone when we landed about how they were going to cover it up.
[21:58.320 --> 22:01.320]  I didn't even say anything, but sorry. Tomorrow's news today.
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.320]  Oh, and don't forget we've got all these other shows that are tomorrow's news today.
[22:05.320 --> 22:14.320]  We've got Owen Schreuer, weekdays, 3 p.m. with the War Room. We've got David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m. with the David Knight show and so much more.
[22:14.320 --> 22:19.320]  Also, the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m. And there are those times where you on screen.
[22:19.320 --> 22:24.320]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[22:24.320 --> 22:28.320]  Let me make a few announcements here in the shorter segment.
[22:28.320 --> 22:33.320]  I told you that we were going to be suing folks and I'm not happy about that. It takes money.
[22:33.320 --> 22:42.320]  We're not going to file fake lawsuits. They spent over $2 million trying to get $15,000 from us for the pep in the frog situation.
[22:42.320 --> 22:50.320]  The judge basically ordered them to settle and told us, too, if you go to trial, it's not going to go well.
[22:50.320 --> 22:53.320]  So we said, OK, well, the judge tells you that will do it.
[22:53.320 --> 22:57.320]  So they got $15,000 for $2 million. That's how we operate.
[22:57.320 --> 23:02.320]  And I spent $100,000 for your money fighting.
[23:02.320 --> 23:06.320]  So I try to be judicious about all this. I work as hard as I can to keep this place afloat.
[23:06.320 --> 23:12.320]  But we've defeated over 30 plus the lawsuits that are filed. We've defeated over 20 of the 30.
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.320]  And the Supreme Court of Connecticut did a public interest event.
[23:18.320 --> 23:27.320]  These are like one out of 5,000 or more, I'm told, where they came in, stayed the persecution I'm going through in New Haven, Connecticut.
[23:27.320 --> 23:32.320]  They're just calling bones country. I mean, the tomb is right down the road.
[23:32.320 --> 23:37.320]  One of the big Illuminati secret societies. And the Supreme Court came in and said, this is unprecedented.
[23:37.320 --> 23:43.320]  We're going to have hearings on this, on what you're doing to Mr. Jones, because it's just incredible.
[23:43.320 --> 23:48.320]  I mean, the judge will say stuff like, we know you've got marketing and made money off Sandy Hook.
[23:48.320 --> 23:53.320]  And we go, there is no marketing. And they go, sanctions, we know.
[23:53.320 --> 24:00.320]  Because Blumenthal and his son say, our listeners know we've hardly ever talked about it. I can't stand it.
[24:00.320 --> 24:09.320]  Google Analytics shows 0.2 coverage of it. And that's what the media attacking me being forced to cover it.
[24:09.320 --> 24:17.320]  But I digress. I knew a month before Barnes had intel that the Covington kids suits were going to be thrown out.
[24:17.320 --> 24:23.320]  I'm not going to say what he told me off record, but he was dead on. It was thrown directly out.
[24:23.320 --> 24:32.320]  And that's why he was waiting for it to be thrown out until he filed his. You notice he filed that last week.
[24:32.320 --> 24:36.320]  There's more about to be filed, a bunch. And it's being worked on right now.
[24:36.320 --> 24:45.320]  I've got 10 lawsuits to choose from. And that's what I've been doing in my extra time is looking at 10 lawsuits with Barnes
[24:45.320 --> 24:54.320]  and which ones we're going to pull the trigger on first. We have to do this.
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.320]  You know, the CIA calls up and they say, well, don't sue this group. We're going to fix it.
[25:00.320 --> 25:07.320]  Okay, we'll see if they're going to fix it. The point is, is that I'm not going to sit here and take this crap anymore.
[25:07.320 --> 25:13.320]  From G2 in Boston or any of these other people, we've got all the dirt on you.
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.320]  I'm not going to sit here and be de-platformed and unpersoned like the Nazis did to the Jews.
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.320]  I am not going to take it lying down. So get that through your head.
[25:22.320 --> 25:29.320]  So I've got 10 groups. We're looking to sue. And Barnes with his lawyers are going to do it at cost for the filings and things.
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.320]  Once you get into depositions and all that, it's astronomical, the amount of money.
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.320]  So we're a year behind launching new shows. We're a couple months behind Thalma Lawson.
[25:39.320 --> 25:50.320]  We're going to file. But we're going to do everything we said that we are going to do because I don't know how this is going to end.
[25:50.320 --> 25:54.320]  But they started the fight. And if they want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[25:54.320 --> 26:01.320]  And I just, it's all on God. I give it all to God, which really means you. God works through you.
[26:01.320 --> 26:06.320]  God works in mysterious ways. And I'm going to cover all the news when we come back, but we're fighting hard here, folks.
[26:06.320 --> 26:17.320]  And our secret weapon is you, the listeners, prayer, this great crew and people like Matt Drudge and others that aren't cowards and haven't turned their back on us.
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.320]  And you really find out who the men are from the boys when things get rough.
[26:21.320 --> 26:25.320]  That's what's always been said. When times get rough, you find out who your friends are and who aren't.
[26:25.320 --> 26:32.320]  Find out who people really are. We've seen a lot of folks out there that have gotten better under the pressure like Tucker Carlson.
[26:32.320 --> 26:39.320]  Instead of worse under the pressure, like a lot of people we can name that run for the exits as soon as stuff gets tough.
[26:39.320 --> 26:46.320]  So I'm not a victim. I'm a warrior. I'm an activist on the front lines. And I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[26:46.320 --> 26:52.320]  So I'm just going to say this right now. If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana,
[26:52.320 --> 27:00.320]  if you want to bet on not being run by the chai comms with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSN and CNN,
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.320]  the Chinese government does, it's all coming out. It's so devastating.
[27:05.320 --> 27:10.320]  And the government didn't even sure how to bring this out. They're starting to bring it out, going, Democrats, stop.
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.320]  Democrats aren't going to stop. They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.320]  They're starting to get some purchase. Trying to start a fire, they got some fire going.
[27:19.320 --> 27:27.320]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities getting attacked, dead people everywhere. It's on, folks.
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.320]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.320]  So now more than you've ever done for yourself, for me, for everybody.
[27:35.320 --> 27:42.320]  Spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio TV, tell folks about info wars dot com, porn slash show.
[27:42.320 --> 27:48.320]  And let them know, hey, they wanted to shut this guy down because he exposed the Chinese government funding and controlling Hollywood.
[27:48.320 --> 27:56.320]  You wonder why Hollywood's anti-American? It's literally owned by the Chinese military.
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.320]  The UT is basically run by China now. It's unbelievable. It's all coming out in Senate and House reports.
[28:01.320 --> 28:07.320]  We'll cover that next hour. But listen, everybody else is scared. Everybody else ran for the exits a long time ago.
[28:07.320 --> 28:13.320]  We know if we told the truth, bet on you. You'd stand up. You'd see what happened. Good people in government would see what happened.
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.320]  And that we would finally get people to take action. But somebody's got to make that first example.
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.320]  So I am honored to be in the position of having the enemy trying to destroy me right now.
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.320]  And the threats and all of it, it just makes me so alive. It's amazing.
[28:26.320 --> 28:29.320]  And I'm very thankful to God for putting me in this position.
[28:29.320 --> 28:34.320]  But that said, I want to fight hard and I need you to buy the products at info wars store dot com.

[29:26.320 --> 29:30.320]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.320 --> 29:33.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.320 --> 29:59.320]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:59.320 --> 30:06.320]  Serving with info wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[31:25.320 --> 31:27.320]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[31:27.320 --> 31:31.320]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[31:31.320 --> 31:39.320]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[31:39.320 --> 31:42.320]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[31:42.320 --> 31:47.320]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[31:47.320 --> 31:48.320]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[31:48.320 --> 31:53.320]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[31:53.320 --> 31:58.320]  Infowarstore.com
[31:58.320 --> 32:04.320]  The globalist are hyper competitive, scientific dictators.
[32:04.320 --> 32:05.320]  They are technocrats.
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.320]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[32:07.320 --> 32:14.320]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[32:14.320 --> 32:16.320]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[32:16.320 --> 32:19.320]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[32:19.320 --> 32:25.320]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[32:25.320 --> 32:30.320]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the fourslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[32:30.320 --> 32:35.320]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality.
[32:35.320 --> 32:40.320]  And double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[32:40.320 --> 32:46.320]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[32:46.320 --> 32:50.320]  It is amazing, experience pure, medical bottom and B12 for yourself.
[32:50.320 --> 33:19.320]  And fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[33:20.320 --> 33:31.320]  All right, let's launch right into it, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:31.320 --> 33:41.320]  On the Russiagate front, the fact that Mueller lied, the fact that Strock lied, the fact that all of them were in a conspiracy to frame the president is coming out.
[33:41.320 --> 33:51.320]  There is a entire stack of news and information on that front that we are going to be getting to here today.
[33:51.320 --> 33:58.320]  We obviously have the huge news, Pakistan warns of war after India has moved into Kashmir's special status.
[33:58.320 --> 34:06.320]  Special status is Pakistan's cutting it away with the Chinese and ethnically cleansing Hindus and other folks.
[34:06.320 --> 34:17.320]  So it's just absolutely horrible. And Modi, after 140 million dead Hindus that Islamic hands is not putting up with it, got to admire the fighting spirit.
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.320]  Both countries have over 100 hydrogen bombs and are threatening to nuke each other right now.
[34:22.320 --> 34:27.320]  This is a proxy war with China, like I said, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[34:27.320 --> 34:29.320]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[34:29.320 --> 34:35.320]  We're going to be breaking down the incredible developments on the mass shootings and the way the media has been handling that.
[34:35.320 --> 34:48.320]  And more on Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant and all of these major systems are listening to you in your house.
[34:48.320 --> 34:57.320]  And they're primed when they hear sex terms to particularly record you having sex with your wife or husband.
[34:57.320 --> 35:03.320]  And doggone it. I'm sitting there this morning and I look over and there's the damn phone on the nightstand.
[35:03.320 --> 35:10.320]  I mean, think about how we just bring these Trojan horses into your house and you look over and you're having sex with your wife.
[35:10.320 --> 35:16.320]  And there's a robot sitting right there listening to you and you know it's listening.
[35:16.320 --> 35:27.320]  And even Alex Jones is so stupid and so habituated that I can't even control myself and keep the damn robot away.
[35:27.320 --> 35:35.320]  Imagine the intelligence power that the globalists get and I don't tell those type of stories to be crass here.
[35:35.320 --> 35:43.320]  I tell it because I want you to think about what we've done and what we've put up with and how insane this has gotten.
[35:43.320 --> 35:51.320]  Amazon Alexa captured audio of people having sex, sends those reports back to the HQ Newsweek.
[35:51.320 --> 36:01.320]  I told you that about smart TVs and the video cams on Apple computers 20 years ago.
[36:01.320 --> 36:08.320]  Amazon forced to give Alexa users the option to stop staff listening to recordings of them having sex.
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.320]  They now have a flag button you click.
[36:11.320 --> 36:22.320]  Hey, you think Jeff Bezos? You think Jeff Bezos has an Alexa on his yacht? You think Jeff Bezos has one in his bedroom?
[36:22.320 --> 36:24.320]  You could bet he doesn't.
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.320]  And I'm not even blaming Jeff Bezos here because of all the big tech guys.
[36:28.320 --> 36:37.320]  He's, you know, actually works with our country and, you know, I mean, Google's helping run death camps basically in China.
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.320]  I mean, Apple gave all the code keys to the Chinese government last year and admitted it and said,
[36:41.320 --> 36:45.320]  well, that's what you do when you move to China. Yeah, they have the keys to everybody's iPhone.
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.320]  But let me just take Bezos since he's the one in the news about this, all these assistants do it.
[36:50.320 --> 36:56.320]  Their argument is, well, everybody is just doing this, so we've got to do it too.
[36:56.320 --> 36:58.320]  They've got our market share.
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.320]  So you go to Whole Foods and it says on the side of the free bag they give you because, you know, Austin banned plastic bags.
[37:04.320 --> 37:11.320]  So they have the bags that you kind of buy if you forgot a bag and it says, oh, Alexa, order my avocados.
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.320]  That's at my house, by the way.
[37:15.320 --> 37:27.320]  I mean, I've got a bag from Whole Foods and it's like, I'm looking at it and it says, hey, Alexa, order me avocados and have them delivered to my house.
[37:27.320 --> 37:32.320]  But see, it's also listening to me having sex with my life.
[37:32.320 --> 37:36.320]  But see, oh, Alexa isn't my house, but let me tell you what's been in your house, folks.
[37:36.320 --> 37:52.320]  The Phones in the Telecommunications Act of 96 said that by law they're triangulated by satellite and cell tower for location and they can be remotely turned on even when off to listen to you.
[37:52.320 --> 37:54.320]  The FBI asked for that.
[37:54.320 --> 38:02.320]  The FBI, our domestic security force, lobbied to have all phones in the future.
[38:02.320 --> 38:12.320]  Talk about visionaries in 1996 that by 2000 all phones would be remotely accessible.
[38:12.320 --> 38:13.320]  That's why the headlines are out.
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.320]  One text to your iPhone turns on the microphone.
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.320]  Hackers found out.
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.320]  Yeah, because the system built all these back doors.
[38:22.320 --> 38:24.320]  Yeah, Jeff Bezos is doing this too.
[38:24.320 --> 38:33.320]  Jeff Bezos is doing it in 2019 because that's the architecture, like a plug in the wall.
[38:33.320 --> 38:36.320]  Like a plug in the wall.
[38:36.320 --> 38:37.320]  It's like, well, why do we have a plug in the wall?
[38:37.320 --> 38:38.320]  Well, that's standardized.
[38:38.320 --> 38:40.320]  Why are the power lines there?
[38:40.320 --> 38:42.320]  Why are the street signs green?
[38:42.320 --> 38:46.320]  Because it was all standardized.
[38:46.320 --> 38:57.320]  So the metric system and now we're here and it's just part of the system that all these
[38:57.320 --> 39:06.320]  devices and now they're coming out with refrigerators and coffee makers and washing machines and you
[39:06.320 --> 39:12.320]  try to go and buy new washing machines and they don't have the old fashioned ones that
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.320]  work.
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.320]  You can't see ones with all this computerized crap in it that never works and breaks constantly
[39:17.320 --> 39:19.320]  because it's listening to you.
[39:19.320 --> 39:21.320]  And how do I know that?
[39:21.320 --> 39:29.320]  The CIA director at the time 10 years ago said your dishwasher is listening to you.
[39:29.320 --> 39:36.320]  They've got microphones on and you ask, why do you need a microphone?
[39:36.320 --> 39:46.320]  Why did scientific cable boxes that worked for the NSA and major corporations, he said
[39:46.320 --> 39:50.320]  because they're already listening to everybody and they're training the AI on voice print
[39:50.320 --> 39:52.320]  and voice recognition for the rollout.
[39:52.320 --> 40:04.320]  And I broke one open on access TV in like 1998 and then as best I could tell they started
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.320]  having the army follow me around for a while and I said go ahead and do whatever you're
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.320]  going to do, I'm not going to shut up.
[40:11.320 --> 40:14.320]  Let's see, back then that was a big national security secret.
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.320]  The time-warnered cable boxes nationwide had a microphone in them and were listening to
[40:19.320 --> 40:21.320]  every damn thing you said.
[40:21.320 --> 40:30.320]  That was over 15 years before people now know to talk, do voice and talk to the cable box.
[40:30.320 --> 40:34.320]  Now it's like, oh my cable box, I talked the whole time, exactly.
[40:34.320 --> 40:41.320]  But when I told you it was listening to you 22 years ago, man, time's flying.
[40:41.320 --> 40:43.320]  Oh, I'm that cook.
[40:43.320 --> 40:45.320]  Oh, I'm that bad guy.
[40:45.320 --> 40:53.320]  You know, I saw an AP report about how nice these emergency centers are for all the immigrants
[40:53.320 --> 40:57.320]  to process them and all these pieces came together yesterday.
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.320]  And I went and looked it up and sure enough, there it all was.
[41:01.320 --> 41:05.320]  And sure enough, we were right.
[41:05.320 --> 41:12.320]  And it was that key piece of evidence that now they're willing to admit that I'd never reported on.
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.320]  So let me just tell you that piece of news right now because I'm just going to be all over the map today.
[41:16.320 --> 41:22.320]  We had listeners freaking out all over Texas, all over Florida, all over New Mexico, all over
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.320]  Arizona, all over California saying, listen, they're closing.
[41:26.320 --> 41:33.320]  They're closing Walmarts and they're building basically containment areas, showers.
[41:33.320 --> 41:36.320]  They are putting in all this stuff.
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.320]  And then when we cover it, they'd say it's a conspiracy theory.
[41:40.320 --> 41:44.320]  And we're like, are they concentration camps, which the Democrats are now calling them?
[41:44.320 --> 41:50.320]  Because for whatever reason, when Obama was building these to process the people they were saying come to the U.S.,
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.320]  back then they were even a little more reasonable 10 years ago.
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.320]  They were going to get the criminals out of the group and ship them back.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.320]  But you've got to process people.
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.320]  So Obama wanted to bring in replacement labor, new voting population.
[42:02.320 --> 42:05.320]  They were going to, but they did say, well, what do we got in the Southwest?
[42:05.320 --> 42:06.320]  What do we got in Texas?
[42:06.320 --> 42:09.320]  We got a bunch of older Walmarts we can close.
[42:09.320 --> 42:11.320]  Walmarts opening super Walmarts.
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.320]  And so Walmart did this deal.
[42:15.320 --> 42:17.320]  Special forces was involved.
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.320]  The Army was involved as an actual security emergency as Rex 84, but under Obama.
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.320]  And now I'm watching an AP report.
[42:24.320 --> 42:33.320]  It's like, these are converted Walmarts that in the last decade were turned into emergency centers in case we had this crisis.
[42:33.320 --> 42:36.320]  And I'm going, wow, bingo, we were right.
[42:36.320 --> 42:40.320]  Because people are like, the people working in them are like, yeah, we're putting showers in and toilets.
[42:40.320 --> 42:42.320]  And they're locked up areas.
[42:42.320 --> 42:45.320]  And some areas are like jail cells for criminals that are caught.
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.320]  And we go, hey, there's Walmarts putting jails in.
[42:48.320 --> 42:51.320]  And it turns out it's all true.
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.320]  It's incredible.
[42:53.320 --> 43:22.320]  We'll be right back.
[43:23.320 --> 43:25.320]  We'll be right back.
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.320]  And check out a pack power stack today and jumpstart your supplement routine.
[43:58.320 --> 44:02.320]  Yes, I got a plug for the Patriot points.
[44:02.320 --> 44:04.320]  I get $180 so far this year.
[44:04.320 --> 44:06.320]  And I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[44:06.320 --> 44:09.320]  I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[44:09.320 --> 44:12.320]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.320]  So I rather give that money to you.
[44:14.320 --> 44:15.320]  And they're getting quality products.
[44:15.320 --> 44:17.320]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[44:17.320 --> 44:20.320]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[44:20.320 --> 44:21.320]  I've lost weight.
[44:21.320 --> 44:22.320]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[44:22.320 --> 44:24.320]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[44:24.320 --> 44:29.320]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[44:29.320 --> 44:31.320]  Sir, let me break this down for you.
[44:31.320 --> 44:33.320]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[44:33.320 --> 44:34.320]  I want a good price.
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.320]  But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.320]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[44:40.320 --> 44:44.320]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[44:44.320 --> 44:45.320]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.320]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[44:49.320 --> 44:55.320]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we'll get 50% off and then you do something like that.
[44:55.320 --> 44:57.320]  We have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay.
[44:57.320 --> 45:24.320]  Thanks for the support.
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.320]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free.
[45:29.320 --> 45:36.320]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[45:36.320 --> 45:47.320]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.

[46:30.320 --> 46:33.320]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[46:33.320 --> 46:39.320]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paint mfullwars.com on the side of your barn.
[46:39.320 --> 46:42.320]  Every time you stand up to leftist bullies, every time you tell the truth,
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.320]  every time you keep the symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive,
[46:47.320 --> 46:50.320]  the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[46:50.320 --> 46:53.320]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.320]  And now we've got a fighting chance if y'all take action of defeating the globalist.
[46:57.320 --> 47:12.320]  Stay with us, we'll be right back, but please take advantage of the sale.
[47:27.320 --> 47:46.320]  Disinformation.
[47:46.320 --> 47:50.320]  I'm gonna post this congressional testimony to mfullwars.com.
[47:50.320 --> 47:54.320]  And then at the bottom of the next hour, I'm gonna cover it on how
[47:54.320 --> 48:01.320]  the Chinese government controls the universities, Hollywood, and the Democratic Party.
[48:01.320 --> 48:06.320]  And this is congressional testimony by the National Endowment for Democracy.
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.320]  Now, who's the National Endowment for Democracy?
[48:11.320 --> 48:19.320]  It's the voice of the major foundations that admit their world government plan is in shambles
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.320]  and that the Chinese have double dealt and that it's over.
[48:23.320 --> 48:29.320]  It gets its funding from the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development,
[48:29.320 --> 48:33.320]  and it's subject to congressional oversight as a non-governmental organization.
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.320]  It gets $135 million a year.
[48:37.320 --> 48:42.320]  And then it goes into the United States Information Agency.
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.320]  That's above the CIA.
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.320]  And what are they saying?
[48:47.320 --> 48:49.320]  Well, you might wanna go read the report.
[48:49.320 --> 48:54.320]  I'm gonna get one of the guys to post both that information from the National Endowment for Democracy
[48:54.320 --> 48:55.320]  who funds them.
[48:55.320 --> 49:01.320]  It's the voice of the government, the voice of the real deep state, the deep, deep state,
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.320]  and the actual report.
[49:05.320 --> 49:11.320]  This is all gonna get posted on mfullwars.com and newswars.com in the next 10, 15 minutes.
[49:11.320 --> 49:14.320]  And you wanna go read this congressional report for yourself,
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.320]  because you're gonna read it and you're gonna go, is that a transcript of the Alex Jones show?
[49:19.320 --> 49:22.320]  No, it's, we're taking our government back.
[49:22.320 --> 49:25.320]  They're admitting a deal to sell us out to China completely and collapse us,
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.320]  and that deal's been revoked.
[49:27.320 --> 49:31.320]  Piss up a rope, New World Order, telling you this is unbelievable.
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.320]  This is just happening right now.
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.320]  This testimony, we need to pull this testimony from Shakespeare.
[49:39.320 --> 49:40.320]  We need to error this.
[49:40.320 --> 49:44.320]  I mean, this is cough and nails the New World Order, folks.
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.320]  This is gold.
[49:47.320 --> 49:49.320]  That's coming up.
[49:49.320 --> 49:52.320]  And like I said, I just digressed from something I noticed yesterday.
[49:52.320 --> 49:54.320]  I didn't even prepare it for the show.
[49:54.320 --> 49:56.320]  I can get you the report where AP saying,
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.320]  in the last decade, they converted all these Walmart's in the Southwest
[50:00.320 --> 50:03.320]  in case emergency migrant waves came in.
[50:03.320 --> 50:06.320]  Well, yeah, because Obama knew they were triggering it,
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.320]  and the UN was building the refugee centers in Central and South America
[50:10.320 --> 50:13.320]  and building up to this, and then they handed Trump the problem.
[50:13.320 --> 50:18.320]  But all those Walmart's that we would have guests on stage,
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.320]  listen, Alex, I'm a truck driver.
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.320]  I delivered the sheet rock in there and they're building toilets
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.320]  and they've got jail cells and part of it's like open living areas,
[50:28.320 --> 50:29.320]  part of it's jail areas.
[50:29.320 --> 50:30.320]  Yeah, you're processing people.
[50:30.320 --> 50:31.320]  There's gonna be criminals.
[50:31.320 --> 50:35.320]  The point is, is that they, this has all been built.
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.320]  All the people saying Walmart's are being converted to some type of jail facility,
[50:40.320 --> 50:43.320]  it's true.
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.320]  And then the Democrats then flip and say,
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.320]  oh, Trump did it when they're the ones that engineered it all,
[50:49.320 --> 50:53.320]  and these facilities were built before Trump ever got into office.
[50:53.320 --> 50:57.320]  And it's all classified, so Trump's got to sit there while he's being blamed for all this,
[50:57.320 --> 51:00.320]  even though since Trump got in, they've made the facilities better,
[51:00.320 --> 51:02.320]  and now they're not secret.
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.320]  And the point is, we had callers from Alabama and Florida
[51:06.320 --> 51:10.320]  and truck drivers and construction workers that would travel to Texas
[51:10.320 --> 51:13.320]  and give me a file and say, I've been working at three Walmart's last year,
[51:13.320 --> 51:18.320]  I'm a foreman, but they are putting in areas with fences
[51:18.320 --> 51:20.320]  and in areas for living, areas in families.
[51:20.320 --> 51:22.320]  Who do you think this is for?
[51:22.320 --> 51:25.320]  And I'm like, I have no damn idea,
[51:25.320 --> 51:27.320]  because Obama was planning to collapse the economy,
[51:27.320 --> 51:29.320]  start race wars, we got those documents.
[51:29.320 --> 51:32.320]  We were like, oh, it's for us.
[51:32.320 --> 51:37.320]  No, it was Democrat party officials given the hundreds of millions in contracts
[51:37.320 --> 51:40.320]  to run these now private facilities,
[51:40.320 --> 51:44.320]  and then they cause the crisis, tell the illegals to come here,
[51:44.320 --> 51:47.320]  and then blame Trump when they're in facilities
[51:47.320 --> 51:50.320]  that the Democrats are making the money off of,
[51:50.320 --> 51:52.320]  and that's all been confirmed.
[51:52.320 --> 51:55.320]  All these facilities, it turns out, Democrat donors
[51:55.320 --> 51:59.320]  own the lease on and own the building.
[51:59.320 --> 52:03.320]  And then the border patrols sit in there with all this lavage care
[52:03.320 --> 52:07.320]  and taking care of everybody with all these aids that they have,
[52:07.320 --> 52:10.320]  one aid for every five people in there.
[52:10.320 --> 52:13.320]  AP showed it, it's like, Candace Owens went to these and said,
[52:13.320 --> 52:19.320]  this is nicer than where my kids or my cousins would ever go to school.
[52:19.320 --> 52:22.320]  But imagine the patriots, our listeners are in these Walmart's building this,
[52:22.320 --> 52:26.320]  they're told keep quiet, and they're calling in freaking out.
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.320]  Well, now we know Obama was triggering the whole thing.
[52:30.320 --> 52:33.320]  And it's in the AP report.
[52:33.320 --> 52:36.320]  I just sprung this on the last segment.
[52:36.320 --> 52:39.320]  This wasn't all preplanned, I just remembered this was telling the story.
[52:39.320 --> 52:46.320]  Were they admit, oh, Walmart's were converted in the last decade by Obama
[52:46.320 --> 52:50.320]  to these emergency centers because they were getting the UN centers built,
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.320]  funded by the globalist to get the first wave and then move them up here.
[52:56.320 --> 53:00.320]  But back then, Obama was being more reasonable and was going to say,
[53:00.320 --> 53:03.320]  at least we'll screen out criminals and ship them back.
[53:03.320 --> 53:09.320]  The last two years of Obama, he just said, screw it, let everybody go, flood the U.S.
[53:09.320 --> 53:12.320]  And so that's why they're like, Mr. Jones, here's the photo.
[53:12.320 --> 53:17.320]  Some areas are like for families, bunk beds, kitchens, everything.
[53:17.320 --> 53:20.320]  It's next to a soccer field. They're putting in soccer fields.
[53:20.320 --> 53:22.320]  They're putting a bar bar around that.
[53:22.320 --> 53:25.320]  And then they got jail cell areas and shackles.
[53:25.320 --> 53:27.320]  And I don't know what it is.
[53:27.320 --> 53:31.320]  We're like, that's where they'll separate the patriot men and ship us to the death camp.
[53:31.320 --> 53:34.320]  And then the women and children will be in this area.
[53:34.320 --> 53:37.320]  And we got FEMA documents, even admitted plans for that.
[53:37.320 --> 53:40.320]  With social security numbers, now they process the resistors.
[53:40.320 --> 53:43.320]  So they do have it as dual use.
[53:43.320 --> 53:49.320]  So when the Democrats call these concentration camps, it's because they have a dual use for that, for us.
[53:49.320 --> 53:56.320]  And so yesterday, I was rewatching that Candice Ellen's piece where we put video over what she said she saw with the AP.
[53:56.320 --> 54:02.320]  And it was like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[54:02.320 --> 54:04.320]  All the tumblers went into place.
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.320]  Because imagine you're an Info Wars listener and the military's running,
[54:09.320 --> 54:14.320]  and the Walmart refurbishing and saying, keep your mouth shut, you're signing non-disclosures,
[54:14.320 --> 54:20.320]  and you're putting in these security facilities that look like jails.
[54:20.320 --> 54:24.320]  Because they are people here illegally, and we got to process them.
[54:24.320 --> 54:26.320]  But 90% are being released.
[54:26.320 --> 54:28.320]  So they're not concentration camps.
[54:28.320 --> 54:30.320]  They're not death camps.
[54:30.320 --> 54:32.320]  But they could be.
[54:32.320 --> 54:35.320]  And who built them? Obama.
[54:35.320 --> 54:38.320]  Obama built these emergency centers.
[54:38.320 --> 54:40.320]  Trump saw them two and a half years ago.
[54:40.320 --> 54:41.320]  It's on record.
[54:41.320 --> 54:47.320]  He flipped out, got more funding, and said, clean this up.
[54:47.320 --> 54:51.320]  That's because Democratic contractors were stealing all the money and not providing the services.
[54:51.320 --> 54:55.320]  That's why there were kids sitting in their feces.
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.320]  Elijah Cummings was talking about four-year-old video.
[54:57.320 --> 55:05.320]  That's Barack Obama, just like the Democrats run all the cities like that because they're stealing the money.
[55:05.320 --> 55:12.320]  Trump runs stuff, has kids sitting in their feces, like Elijah Cummings said, no.
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.320]  So this is a big bombshell development.
[55:14.320 --> 55:15.320]  This is a live show.
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.320]  But in post, have Marcos or somebody, I gave you guys the report, you found it,
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.320]  add some of the Walmart clips from 10 years ago, eight years ago,
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.320]  and then we'll add the AP saying, oh, these were refurbished Walmart's.
[55:28.320 --> 55:30.320]  Which again, they put fences around them.
[55:30.320 --> 55:32.320]  They've got docking bays.
[55:32.320 --> 55:33.320]  They've got jail sales.
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.320]  They've got family living areas.
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.320]  They've got kitchens.
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.320]  They look like a prison because they are dual use.
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.320]  They are a prison.
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.320]  A nice one, but still a nice gilded cage.
[55:46.320 --> 55:48.320]  We did our job again.
[55:48.320 --> 55:53.320]  We didn't know exactly what was going on.
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.320]  I later had some folks in the Army come visit.
[55:57.320 --> 56:01.320]  And they said, all we know is we understand that stuff can be used for bad Alex,
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.320]  but it's really just used for collapse of civilization, which I understand as well.
[56:05.320 --> 56:06.320]  And that's what they were being told.
[56:06.320 --> 56:07.320]  Hey, don't scare people.
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.320]  This is for collapsing border.
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.320]  This is for a migrant surge, which Obama was engineering with Soros and the UN.
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.320]  The military is just there in plain clothes, making sure everybody keeps their mouth shut.
[56:17.320 --> 56:18.320]  I get that.
[56:18.320 --> 56:19.320]  I'm not saying they're villains.
[56:19.320 --> 56:20.320]  In fact, they're not.
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.320]  But they had all the intel at the time and did not give it to us.
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.320]  And so I ran around going, hey, I've had like 10 different contractors on.
[56:30.320 --> 56:33.320]  That say they're building damn prisons and they're not lying.
[56:33.320 --> 56:38.320]  And I've had them visit me with tears in their eyes scared with their wife in the parking lot coming in,
[56:38.320 --> 56:39.320]  giving me videos.
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.320]  They shot going, am I going to get hurt?
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.320]  Army's running this.
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.320]  All I know is it's what you said.
[56:44.320 --> 56:50.320]  And I'm going, I don't know what the hell's going on.
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.320]  That's the way the stuff clicks now.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.320]  Just everything's coming into focus right now.
[56:55.320 --> 56:57.320]  Isn't that amazing?
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.320]  I want to take a lot of calls to and I want to have even scratched the surface.
[57:03.320 --> 57:04.320]  There's so much news.
[57:04.320 --> 57:06.320]  It'll make your head explode.
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.320]  But I'm going to try my best next hour.
[57:09.320 --> 57:11.320]  Please don't forget without your financial support.

[57:14.320 --> 57:15.320]  We have the banniversary sale.
[57:15.320 --> 57:17.320]  It's an extension of last week's mega sale.
[57:17.320 --> 57:18.320]  Water.
[57:18.320 --> 57:19.320]  Some of the water filters have sold out.
[57:19.320 --> 57:20.320]  A lot of their stuff is selling out.

[58:19.320 --> 58:22.320]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[58:22.320 --> 58:25.320]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car
[58:25.320 --> 58:28.320]  or paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn.
[58:28.320 --> 58:31.320]  Every time you stand up to leftist police, every time you tell the truth,
[58:31.320 --> 58:36.320]  every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive,
[58:36.320 --> 58:39.320]  the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[58:39.320 --> 58:42.320]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[58:42.320 --> 58:46.320]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist.
[58:46.320 --> 58:47.320]  Stay with us.
[58:47.320 --> 58:48.320]  We'll be right back.
[58:48.320 --> 58:49.320]  We'll be right back.
[59:18.320 --> 59:22.320]  In the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[59:22.320 --> 59:24.320]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[59:24.320 --> 59:28.320]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[59:28.320 --> 59:33.320]  or billionaire sugar daddies who have been able to control and manipulate what news it views
[59:33.320 --> 59:35.320]  the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[59:35.320 --> 59:38.320]  And the infowars audience has broken through that.
[59:38.320 --> 59:43.320]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[59:43.320 --> 59:50.320]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:26.320]  Now I've already covered a ton of news in the first hour, but I need to drill down into a lot of this.
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:35.320]  And I also need to carry out some of the things that I've already been talking about.
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:39.320]  And I get this posted in FullWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:41.320]  So I'm going to go work on that right now actually.
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:49.320]  But when we come back in the next segment, I am going to get into the latest on the mass shootings
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:51.320]  and how they're trying to start a civil war.
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:54.320]  And it's starting to get some purchase.
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.320]  It's starting to get subtraction.
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:58.320]  And we've got to stop this.
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:00.320]  It's extremely serious.
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:05.320]  And then we're going to get more into Kashmir and that proxy war that the U.S. is now in with China.
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:11.320]  And just how incredible this time and point is in human history.
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:14.320]  But I want to air this John Bowne report.
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:25.320]  FBI deems conspiracy theorists the new terrorist because this was all said right before this event took place.
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:34.320]  And right after I said they're planning to frame Q movement followers with events because you can clearly see the cutouts and how this is working.
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:37.320]  I'm not saying anybody that's part of the Q thing is a bad person.
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:02:06.320]  But here's a John Bowne report.
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:36.320]  That is the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups involving illegal, harmful or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures.
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:40.320]  Beware those that question the manufactured narrative.
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  The military industrial complex is watching you.
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:59.320]  Sierra Nevada Corporation, an aerospace and defense company in conjunction with U.S. military at Southcom, is conducting surveillance tests across six Midwestern states using high-altitude balloons according to documents filed with the FCC.
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:11.320]  The Guardian reports the Pentagon claims the balloons are intended to provide a persistent surveillance system to locate and deter narcotic trafficking and homeland security threats.
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:20.320]  The surveillance was authorized to be carried out from July 12, 2019 to 3 a.m. Eastern Standard Time September 1, 2019.
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:26.320]  And they are currently surveying South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois.
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:31.320]  The balloons are connected through a mesh network, which allows them to share data.
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:44.320]  Possibly using a video capture system called Gorgon Stare, a surveillance system comprised of nine cameras capable of recording panoramic images across an entire city simultaneously.
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:47.320]  Jay Stanley of the ACLU says,
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:55.320]  I think the American city should be subject to wide area surveillance in which every vehicle could be tracked wherever they go.
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:04:04.320]  We should not go down the road of allowing this to be used in the United States, and it's disturbing to hear that these tests are being carried out by the military, no less.
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:10.320]  There has been no response from the Pentagon, DARPA, Southcom, or the Sierra Nevada Corporation.
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:18.320]  None of the parties involved would say whether the Midwest vehicle data would be deleted, stored, or passed on to other federal or local agencies.
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:28.320]  Jay Stanley of the ACLU says we would like to know what they are doing with that data, how they are storing it, and whether they are contemplating deploying this in the United States.
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:34.320]  Because if they decide that it's usable domestically, there's going to be enormous pressure to deploy it.
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:40.320]  Even more disturbing is that Sierra Nevada Corporation isn't the only company doing the tests.
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:47.320]  Worldview recently did a dozen tests for a client they won't name, gathering data they won't reveal,
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:54.320]  protecting the privacy of the client while preying on the privacy of millions of average American citizens.
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:05:05.320]  Beyond Bound, reporting.
[1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:28.320]  Available in two refreshing flavors.

[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:31.320]  Congressional testimony by U.S. intelligence agencies that the United States has been completely penetrated
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:36.320]  by the Communist Chinese and is basically under their control to a great extent.
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:41.320]  Now this was all done by design by the globalist, and it's a big deal for the government to go ahead
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:44.320]  and start announcing it to lawmakers to prepare themselves.
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:50.320]  Many of the lawmakers who are in the committee are actually Chinese Communist agents fully compromised.
[1:06:50.320 --> 1:07:07.320]  Dian Feinstein, Chuck E. Schumer, many of the other senators, Wyden, Murphy, they're all on the payroll, literally.
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.320]  And that's why they're so damn scared, and that's why they want me off the air.
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:19.320]  But too late, too late, because if you talked about this, folks, they would come after you like a ton of bricks, but we did.
[1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:25.320]  And now it's all popularized, and others have the courage to speak, and you are screwed.
[1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:28.320]  So enjoy yourselves, big boys.
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:33.320]  Treason is quite a big deal.
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:35.320]  So good luck, buckos.
[1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:39.320]  You'll be lucky.
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:47.320]  You'll be lucky to go canoeing or maybe kayaking while you're in prison.
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:58.320]  Get some nice prisons with water sports, swimming in the ocean, swimming in the creeks, swimming in the pools,
[1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:05.320]  with bubbles and fishies, and a lot of beautiful things out there.
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:15.320]  Oh, but you're hoping the Chikoms can defeat America, so you've been given the green light to cause a race war in America.
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:24.320]  Now, seriously, all these Chikom media operatives, CNN, MSNBC, Hollywood on the Chikom payroll, they really are sick freaks.
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:29.320]  Lecturing Americans how we're Nazis and how America is bad and how we're evil.
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:38.320]  Well, they are on the literal military and corporate and financial mammary gland of the communist Chinese.
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:50.320]  That they fence American technology and money and investment through, which is engraved back on top of them.
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:59.320]  No wonder they're so scared because they've reached and gone so incredibly far.
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:02.320]  So what is their only hope?
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:19.320]  Their only hope is to cause a civil war in this country. Oh, and that's exactly what's in the report for the U.S. Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:34.320]  Studies and analysis of international threats and how the communist Chinese have penetrated the entire United States.
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:42.320]  They were given the keys to everything, but not anymore.
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:54.320]  And their whole ruse to get a success with the Russians is a distraction when Russia, like the U.S. cheaters back and forth under globalist control,
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:10:03.320]  with all the same attack on the family, attack on God, attack on the culture, attack on the borders, attack on the currency, all the same stuff.
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:11.320]  Russia has the same enemies that are in bed with China.
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:21.320]  So I want to go to your phone calls on the geopolitical insanity of this, the fact that the CFR and Trilateral Commission and their mouthpieces,
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:29.320]  like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and Atlantic Monthly and the Financial Times of London and the Foreign Affairs,
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:36.320]  are all saying the international order that we've always known is dead and that war is now going to start.
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:41.320]  And that's because you're triggering the Chai comms to start wars. They started it in the South China Sea.
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:49.320]  They started it in Hong Kong. They started it in Vietnam. They're at war with Vietnam right now.
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.320]  They've had massive battles going on. You just don't hear about it on our news.
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:59.320]  Just like the first two days when India invaded Kashmir, you didn't hear anything about it.
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:05.320]  It was no coverage because the system was shocked by it and was like waiting to get the word.
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:10.320]  But now you go to CNN, MSNBC, Trump's bad, Modi's bad.
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:16.320]  The poor Muslims are being ethnically cleansed by the Hindus.
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:21.320]  That's like saying the Jews were ethnically cleansing the Germans in World War II.
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:25.320]  It's ass backwards.
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:28.320]  But meanwhile, at the same time, what's happening?
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:36.320]  The former Fed chiefs issued stark warning. U.S. central bank must be independent.
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:42.320]  Even though the Federal Reserve Act has served much of our national sovereignty to private European banks,
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:49.320]  they still have the provision that the president could remove people from the board of governors of New York and put new people on.
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:54.320]  So President Trump is exercising that power, saying China's devaluing the currency.
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:59.320]  We've been making major investments with our treasuries in China. You've been setting policy.
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:08.320]  That's over. And then four former Fed chiefs because Trump's been removing three members of the board the last year.
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:12.320]  Everything you always wanted Ron Paul to do. Everything we always talked about.
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:17.320]  Take over the Federal Reserve. Abolish it. Well, it's just easier to take it over.
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:21.320]  That's the infrastructure. We're like Simon's twins with it now after 104 years.
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:27.320]  It's 1913. Hard to believe it's been that long.
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:36.320]  And so crawling out from under their rocks, the heads of the private bank consortium that hijacked this country in 1913
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:44.320]  that have sold out our power for their own personal power to China come out and say,
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:53.320]  well, the Federal Reserve shouldn't be for America. And what Trump's doing, whether it's very dangerous, who died, made you God.
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:13:00.320]  So, you want to know if Trump's for real, this is the biggest proof in the pudding you're ever going to see.
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:10.320]  CNN, four former Fed chiefs issues stark warning. U.S. Central Bank must be independent.
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:18.320]  And a parent public rebuke of President Donald Trump, Paul Volcker, that fossils around under Nixon.
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:24.320]  Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen wrote an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. Central Bank
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:29.320]  must be able to make decisions based on best interest of the nation.
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:32.320]  Not the interest of a small group of politician.
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:40.320]  Some of the Federal Reserve Act says the president's the only person that has veto over your ass. After 105 years or whatever it is,
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:45.320]  he's 106 years. Are you running us on the ground?
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:51.320]  And China? And unfair trade and devaluing their currency?
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:58.320]  And then you're going to tell us that you never raised interest rates on Obama, but you raised him a bunch under Trump.
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:04.320]  And now that Trump says don't kill our economy when we're in a trade war, you call, oh, that's not the interest of the country.
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:11.320]  As the Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan and all the big banks run around bad-mouthing the dollar and saying it's going down,
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:18.320]  America's going down, they're all cheerleading against America and against our president and the politicians they own tell us
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:25.320]  America was never great. It'll ever be great. America sucks. Take down the American flag.
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:31.320]  The border patrol are Nazis. We're killing the children. They're drinking out of toilets.
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:35.320]  And magically, two Antifa guys turned out both of them are Antifa.
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:40.320]  They tried to expunge it. Didn't work in Ohio or in Texas.
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:50.320]  Two mentally ill devil worshipers strolling and do all this and they tell you it's the American people's fault.
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:55.320]  Why are they always devil worshipers? Because that's who Democrats are.
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.320]  But here are these private bankers all telling us that the economy's going down.
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:11.320]  We're all dead ducks right in the middle of Trump removing us from the globalist position that was designing us for economic and cultural collapse
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:17.320]  and the demoralization. And there's no doubt Trump's doing it and there's no doubt that this is amazing.
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:25.320]  And there's no doubt what he did with India and what Modi did is super dangerous but India has lost more than half its territory.
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:31.320]  The UN tried to take a third of it but India said we'll go to war unless you leave it autonomous and then the Chinese rolled in.
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:35.320]  So the Chinese rolled in. The Indians rolled in to stop that.
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:42.320]  And that's where we're at folks. This is our World War start and we're in the middle of the beginning of World War 4.
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:47.320]  It's starting right there in Kashmir. You heard it here first. Stay with us.
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:16:15.320]  I'm going to give the number out. I'm going to hit the latest on the mass shooting of the Democrats blaming Trump saying you better not come to Texas.
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:20.320]  The heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:20.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:30.320]  You've found it. Public Enemy Numero Uno. If you have to be a communist or a mega-billionaire or anti-American scumbag, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:37.320]  Infowars.com and NewsWars.com are the verboten-forbidden websites you're not supposed to visit and you're not supposed to share.
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:42.320]  You're not supposed to listen to day-to-night, weekday mornings, 8 a.m. Infowars.com for its last show.
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:50.320]  You're not supposed to listen to Owen Schreuer, weekday afternoons, 3 p.m. Central after the broadcast. Either. You're not supposed to share it, definitely.
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:53.320]  You're supposed to sit down and shut up. Mark Zuckerberg said so.
[1:20:53.320 --> 1:21:00.320]  A few months ago, he said, don't share Alex Jones' name, his photo, or his websites in any positive vein, or he'll be banned.
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:04.320]  And since then, thousands of people have posted where they're told just that.
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:08.320]  And any Infowars.com or Alex Jones' photo is blurred out.
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:13.320]  The old Soviet Union used to do that, too, in newspapers. They go back and airbrush out people that have been disappeared.
[1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:17.320]  Very, very dangerous in Congress. It needs to act.
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:22.320]  But first, we've got to cut off the funding, the Chai comms that are doing it.
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:26.320]  Now, the fact that we've gotten the point that this is coming out is incredible.
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:36.320]  And just praise God and thank you, Jesus, and pass the ammunition because, figuratively, in the Infowar, because this is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:43.320]  And you see the squealing and the squawking and the freaking out and the chicken with the head cut off behavior.
[1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:48.320]  And that's because these criminal networks are having their money cut off right now.
[1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:56.320]  And for everything you see Trump doing, there is a lot going on behind the scenes and Trump defeated the witch hunt.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:01.320]  He was bought for over two years and now we're really starting to move in the right direction.
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:08.320]  He's doing some frightening things on guns with rhetoric, which is meant to take the wind out of their sails and kill their arguments.
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:14.320]  And then encourage them to say, man, all the guns, like Joe Biden said last night, will play that coming up.
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:20.320]  It's still dangerous, very dangerous game to intellectually seed anything to these people when it's all a fraud.
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:25.320]  But still, it's an amazing time.
[1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:31.320]  I want to get your take on, do you agree with me about this historical time the World War four has begun?
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:36.320]  It's an economic culture war. Do you think we're going to win this thing?
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.320]  What do you think Trump should do? What are you doing? What do you make of the mass shootings?
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:45.320]  What do you make of the private fellow reserve not doing what Trump wanted?
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:49.320]  So he started removing members of the board a few months ago.
[1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:58.320]  He's removed three nominated new people. And now the private fellow reserve comes out the former directors and say, you're not a good American.
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:02.320]  You need to stop exercising authority when it's in the Federal Reserve Act.
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:11.320]  But no president, no president, no president except Nixon kind of made some noises and they removed him quickly.
[1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:16.320]  Nobody's gone up against the big banks. Nobody.
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:21.320]  But see, Trump has an ace in the hole.
[1:23:21.320 --> 1:23:27.320]  The Pentagon, the thinkers, the people in the public, they know China was given the upper hand and we were sold out to them.
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:31.320]  So there's an ace of spades that this is treason.
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:34.320]  There's an ace of spades that we're going to kill our prosperity.
[1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:41.320]  It was one thing to be selling out in the Chinese for 30 years when we were all getting a bunch of money and the country was still doing OK.
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:52.320]  But now that we're the fat and Christmas hog, getting walked in to have our throat slit, a lot of folks that kind of turned a blind eye are going, why should we give up all our power?
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:56.320]  See, it's a separation of power issues. The founders knew this.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:59.320]  They knew bad corrupt men would get in government at some point.
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:06.320]  But if they all had three branches of government fighting with each other for power, no branch would ever get an upper hand.
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:11.320]  Some smart guys. Thomas Jefferson, pretty smart. Probably one of the smartest ever lived.
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:20.320]  And also head of the Illuminati, but then he got out of it.
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:23.320]  That's in George Washington's letters, too.
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:28.320]  You know what's so amazing about history is that it's all right there for everybody to see.
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:31.320]  It's actually all right there.
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:37.320]  And so I want to take some of your phone calls and I said yesterday I'll take like 10, but a bunch more came in and then I didn't get to four callers.
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:39.320]  So 10 only so I get to you.
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:41.320]  I got to the 10.
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:57.320]  I didn't get to the others and I apologize 877789 Alex first time callers, long time callers, whatever 8777892539 specifically on this incredible historical time that we're alive in.
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:06.320]  But remember, we said Walmart's building makeshift prisons that look like they have prisons next to family areas that aren't prisons.
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:08.320]  And now it's all in the news.
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:13.320]  There was a secret program under Obama to prepare for mass immigration that Obama was preparing with the U.N.
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:15.320]  And we were right about it all.
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.320]  Isn't that amazing?
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:22.320]  Trump to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio testing his ability to heal.
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:27.320]  It says the Wall Street Journal, his supposed friend.
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.320]  Same Wall Street Journal, you know, telling us Trump's doing a bad job.
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:36.320]  And oh, you've got Democrats saying you better not come here, Trump.
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.320]  Better not come here, Trump.
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:40.320]  Why? You're the reason this happened.
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:43.320]  They want to lie about Trump, put words in his mouth.
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:46.320]  No, he should go just like he's gone to other events.
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:47.320]  It's healing.
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:49.320]  A lot of the families are saying we absolutely want him here.
[1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  How dare the media say we don't want him here.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:54.320]  They're just trying to put salt in the wounds.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:26:04.320]  But here's a clip of Trump critic representative Veronica Escobar saying do not come to El Paso.
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:07.320]  I live in an extraordinary community.
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:11.320]  People have come together like never before.
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:14.320]  People are wrapping their arms around one another.
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:16.320]  We had two beautiful vigils last night.
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:20.320]  We are the epitome of goodness as a community.
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:22.320]  We welcome the stranger.
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:24.320]  We take care of the vulnerable.
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:27.320]  And that is who El Paso is.
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:31.320]  And I'm so proud to be a member of this community.
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.320]  Words have consequences.
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:40.320]  And the president has made my community and my people the enemy.
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:47.320]  He has told the country that we are people to be feared, people to be hated.
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:50.320]  He has done that at his rallies.
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:52.320]  He has done that through his Twitter.
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:56.320]  I heard earlier someone mention that he may be coming here.
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:04.320]  I hope that he has the self-awareness to understand that we are in pain and we are mourning.
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:13.320]  And we are doing our very best in our typical beautiful graceful El Paso way to continue to be resilient.
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:23.320]  And so I would ask his staff and his team to consider the fact that his words and his actions have played a role in this.
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  Enough of Veronica Escobar going on to say don't come here.
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:31.320]  Mexico again, 200,000 dead the last 10 years.
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.320]  Millions unaccounted for.
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.320]  Massive collapse and corruption.
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:39.320]  Coyotes raping 80% of the women and young children that come across.
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:40.320]  Sex slavery.
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:42.320]  Senate reports.
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:45.320]  Obama builds the emergency centers.
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:47.320]  Democrats run and get the money off of them.
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:49.320]  That's even been in mainstream news.
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:51.320]  The people pour across.
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:54.320]  We catch and release 90% of them.
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:56.320]  The others have criminal records are sent back.
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:58.320]  Our borders wide open.
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:02.320]  And then Trump simply tries to secure it and say it's okay to have a border.
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:05.320]  And she says being a nationalist at all.
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:06.320]  Disracist.
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:09.320]  I mean that's what they're saying about Italy's president.
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.320]  Saying that having a country itself.
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.320]  Believe it in your nation is supremacist.
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:17.320]  Like the Indians don't want to lose part of their country that you and try to take.
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  So they're taking it back because China moved in.
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.320]  China moved in with paramilitary.
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:23.320]  With Pakistan.
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:26.320]  They've been attacking killing Indians every day.
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:28.320]  So they roll in and say it's our country.
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:29.320]  No.
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:32.320]  Oh you're a Hindu supremacist.
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:37.320]  Meanwhile the Hindu guys look just like the Muslims.
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:41.320]  Because the Muslims used to be Hindus or Buddhists they just got converted to Islam.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.320]  Because Islam is taking over half of India.
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:44.320]  And that's not enough.
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.320]  The Muslims are bombing all over India.
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.320]  And India is supposed to sit there and take it.
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:51.320]  Like America is supposed to take a collapsing border.
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:52.320]  No.
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:53.320]  Trump's our president.
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:54.320]  He's going to the border.
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:55.320]  Which.
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:56.320]  And that's the way it is.
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:57.320]  Your call is coming up.
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:58.320]  Hi.
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:28:59.320]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:02.320]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:04.320]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:05.320]  I beat the IRS then.
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:06.320]  And I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:08.320]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement.
[1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:12.320]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:13.320]  I can help you too.
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:15.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay.
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:16.320]  Don't wait another day.
[1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:18.320]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:20.320]  Call 800 34 no tax.

[1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:38.320]  Every time you stand up to leftist police.
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:40.320]  Every time you tell the truth.
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:42.320]  Every time you keep the symbol of free speech
[1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:44.320]  and pro-human values alive.

[1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:51.320]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:52.320]  And now we've got a fighting chance.

[1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:31.320]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt.
[1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:35.320]  Inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:38.320]  Let it say you'll battle tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:43.320]  And again on the back it says America's back infowarstore.com.
[1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:45.320]  4,000 of these babies.
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:46.320]  And that's it.
[1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:51.320]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:54.320]  You're printed in the USA right now infowarstore.com.
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:32:55.320]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:55.320 --> 1:32:58.320]  The most banned broadcast in the world.
[1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:03.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:08.320]  The world is a dangerous place.
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:23.320]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:26.320]  If you are receiving this transmission.
[1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:30.320]  You are receiving the transmission.
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:34.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:34.800 --> 1:33:39.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:40.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:47.400]  Now we've reached the halfway point of the global broadcast, and I've only scratched
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:51.240]  the surface, but we're going to get to as much as we can.
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:56.180]  We have the War Room with Owen Schroyer today that's going to have coverage of Air Force
[1:33:56.180 --> 1:34:06.080]  1 stepping, landing, setting down, and then Trump going to the site of what happened and
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:10.640]  comforting those who lost loved ones and those that are injured in El Paso.
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:14.160]  And the Democrats are telling him that when he sets down, he shouldn't do that, he shouldn't
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:17.880]  dare do that, because they're just going to call him a Nazi and make up more lies about
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:18.880]  it.
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:22.360]  But Trump's not going to go along with that and let them put words in his mouth.
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:27.920]  Now, I've got a whole crew in there trying to get Dayton, Ohio coverage, and the media
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:29.880]  is not covering Trump in Dayton.
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:32.160]  They're just covering the protesters.
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:37.440]  And they're covering the protesters, I've got satellite feeds, of people in El Paso.
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:41.480]  That's how controlled all of this is.
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:44.480]  Don't let you hear what the president actually said.
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:48.200]  Just put words in his mouth, and that's what happens when they deplatform you.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.380]  And more and more, they're not covering his speeches, they're not covering his quotes.
[1:34:51.380 --> 1:34:56.280]  The corporate media is so scared, they are absolutely blocking what the president said
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:57.280]  in Dayton.
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.720]  But we're getting that video for you, and we're going to have it for you.
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:07.320]  But when he is there, they're going to do their best to not let you see him bring people
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:08.920]  together.
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:14.880]  All they do is give the little inflatable Trump baby balloon coverage, no matter where
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:18.800]  he goes in the world.
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:24.360]  We are showing you, again, satellite footage of some of what's going on, and also what
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  happened earlier in Dayton.
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:31.000]  We have to go through a lot of trouble to blur these events out, because there's so
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.440]  many cuss words by the Democrats.
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:38.520]  On the signs, and being said, you know, I never got to the Shashed Abbot so busy covering
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:43.000]  Kashmir and the fact that this global crisis is intensified.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.280]  We didn't get to the Mitch McConnell's house in Kentucky, with a bunch of people coming
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:51.880]  to his house saying, we're going to stab you in the heart, we're going to kill you.
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:56.760]  DrudgeReport.com linked to our article, we first broke it, and of course, Tucker Carlson
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:00.760]  covered it last night, he's had them come to his house as well.
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:04.920]  But what was crazy about the videos, that we have time later, I'll play, we have a guest
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:12.200]  joining us, is that they have small children with them, and the small children have signs
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:18.760]  saying F. McConnell, the murderer turtle as they're calling him, and they're in front
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:28.840]  of his house saying, we're going to stab you in the heart, we're going to stab you
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:31.720]  in the heart.
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:37.400]  And you just look at these scum, they're so full of themselves using what happened at
[1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:42.880]  the shootings, to then project it on anybody else out of 340 million Americans and say
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:46.480]  that people deserve to die.
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:52.440]  Dayton shooter, Connor Betts, is America's first anti-fuck killer.
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:57.280]  Main Street Media AP reports, Dayton mass shooter attended anti-fuck rally, armed with guns
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:00.640]  similar to one used in massacre.
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:04.760]  Turned out he was love Satan and couldn't wait to be in hell with Satan, and was in
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:10.560]  a new popular liberal movement where you sing about raping and killing women.
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:15.720]  It's the super hot thing with the left, women are involved in it as well, because degrading
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:20.560]  themselves is the best thing, celebrate killing babies as well.
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:24.160]  Dayton mass shooter attended anti-fuck rally, armed with guns similar to the one used in
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:33.720]  massacre was in a music band that celebrated defiling Christ and women, and raping women.
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:38.440]  Bernie Sanders campaign, don't blame us for Dayton, blame Trump for El Paso, even though
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:45.520]  the psychotic devil works per from Dayton was a huge penitentiary.
[1:37:45.520 --> 1:37:51.840]  Squad leader, AOC, Trump is directly responsible for the mass shootings in El Paso, that's
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:54.880]  right.
[1:37:54.880 --> 1:38:02.040]  Continuing 2019 data shows, 51% of mass shooters were black, only 29% were white.
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:07.640]  Paul Joseph Watson article, infowars.com, that's not laying blame on black people, still
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:15.840]  a very small percentage of black people that commit crime, but half of the mass shootings
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:18.640]  in this country is black on black.
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:20.120]  You know who kills black people?
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:24.760]  Black people, number one killer of white people is white people.
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:29.760]  We kill people we know, people were pissed off at.
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:32.880]  Mass is killing him.
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:36.600]  Another big article, the national review does an occasional good job, mass murder without
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:42.080]  guns and the fact that cars, planes, trucks, knives, baseball bats are way more common
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:46.560]  than guns, and that in areas like China and areas in Europe, there are more people killed
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:50.840]  with knives and hatchets and things than there are with guns and mass deaths.
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:54.520]  Yeah, some of these truck attacks kill over 100 people.
[1:38:54.520 --> 1:39:00.120]  So we go, we need to ban trucks.
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:02.320]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:08.640]  Ahead of a very interesting fellow joining us, my wife's a fan of his work and listens
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:12.160]  to it, so I've listened to it on some road trips and things, and I noticed when I was
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:16.200]  Googling him, he's a listener of the show and has, you know, the answer in 1984, 1776
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:20.640]  shirts and stuff, so he's got what on earth is happening dot com, Mark Pasio's been rescheduled
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.440]  twice, it's all a big crisis going on, he's a really smart guy, hope he'll be a regular
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.800]  guest getting into natural law and kind of his view on fake Christians and how the cult
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:29.800]  works.
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:32.520]  He says a lot of stuff that I think is really smart, we're going to get him to be on the
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:37.200]  show this next hour as well, so that's all coming up.
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.640]  Let's go to your phone calls now.
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:46.080]  We got Kenneth, John, Pastor Sam, Tracy, Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick, Brad
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:47.080]  and Kevin.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.480]  So I don't say first time callers, these guys get in, but they're all great callers, that's
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:51.480]  okay.
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:55.600]  You know, Pastor Sam's been calling in for 20 years or something, he's in El Paso, he
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:01.120]  says he's at the anti-Trump protest, what are you seeing Pastor Sam?
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.600]  All kinds of fat liberal chicks, sorry to tell for sure that they're chicks, but we are talking
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:11.680]  about thousands of milkshakes went into the makings of some of these protestors.
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:19.680]  I came up from Mexico for that, I'm really happy that Trump has pushed upon in Guatemala
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:25.240]  and then I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop and chaos breaks out all over the
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  world.
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:32.360]  You're right, Alex, the Chinese are furious, they're caused military attacks and all of
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  these...
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:36.680]  That's right, you're a pastor, a missionary, you've been calling for many years in Mexico,
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.400]  you've called in about the Chinese Communist Presidents and how they're trying to foment
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:42.320]  Mexico, all this stuff.
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:50.360]  Yes, in about the Communist President in Mexico and the fall of country after country, getting
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:56.240]  Communist presidents in, like the newest one in Panama, got elected with 33% of the vote,
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:01.680]  so he's the one in charge now, Nido Cortizo, and that's another country that's very unlikely
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:03.000]  that we can count on.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:09.640]  So Trump finally came in and signed this agreement with Guatemala and this is deportation is
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:11.140]  the law.
[1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:15.000]  Anybody from Africa, anybody from South America that goes through Guatemala and then sets
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:21.480]  foot in the USA, goes directly to Guatemala and that's why AOC is in Guatemala right
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:24.640]  now with Nancy Pelosi for a huge event tomorrow.
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.840]  That's right, they're in another country trying to break our border, you talk about
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:30.360]  treason.
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:34.920]  The whole Mod Squad is down there, the Broad Squad or whatever they call themselves, plus
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:40.840]  Nancy Pelosi, plus Norma J. Torres, the Guatemalan born California Congresswoman that I have
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.200]  broadcasted about before on your show, she was in an interview at least six months ago,
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:50.680]  it's up on my YouTube channel in Spanish, where in the interview it's clearly admitted
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:55.400]  that many of the migrants are from Venezuela and that's back when they were denying it.
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:42:00.240]  So they're all down there, they're trying to stop what Trump has done, but the fact
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:02.280]  is it is law now.
[1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:06.840]  That's right, let's be clear, Guatemala got paid off by the UN in Soros to set up giant
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:11.520]  refugee camps to stage people, to then flood and then go to the Democrat facilities built
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:17.080]  by Obama that Democrats literally own, rich donors own these camps that were put in the
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:19.480]  old Walmarts, they kept secret.
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:23.560]  And Trump's just trying to fix the problem and they're calling him a Nazi saying people
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:29.120]  drink out of toilets and AOC's donors literally, it's been in the news, own the facilities
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:30.120]  brother.
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:36.080]  Seriously, it's unreal if somebody does not believe it, just look at the newspaper, it's
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:38.960]  been Breitbart, she is in Guatemala.
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.000]  I know I saw that, listen, Pastor Sam, I've never done it, but we're going to launch
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.360]  that podcast with callers, get his name and number, he'll be one of the guys that does
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.360]  it.
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:49.800]  We're going to do it soon, but I've been a little busy, believe me, I'm trying to get
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:50.800]  it done here.
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:57.440]  I'm busy in a one legged man in an ass kicking contest, stay with us.
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:00.800]  You've been spreading the word, you've been praying, you've been supporting this transmission,
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:01.800]  you've been buying products from us.

[1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:30.480]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:35.000]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paintinfowars.com,
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  the side of your barn, every time you stand up to leftist bullies, every time you tell
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:44.360]  the truth, every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive,
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:47.400]  the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:51.600]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand and now we've got a fighting
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:54.400]  chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist.
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:58.200]  Stay with us, we'll be right back, but please take advantage of the sale.
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:00.680]  Howard Barnes, what has big tech become?
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:03.160]  Big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:07.600]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:08.600]  over two decades.
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:12.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.320]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:19.560]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:22.640]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:26.680]  big tech Golo Garks, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:30.960]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:31.960]  the Great Depression.
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:36.960]  The inforwer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:41.720]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:42.720]  free press.
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:47.120]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:50.880]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:51.880]  time it's not happening.
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:53.920]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:55.840]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:58.600]  And it is what you just saw.
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:02.800]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:03.880]  They are technocrats.
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:07.680]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:12.200]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:13.200]  with AI gods.
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:16.840]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:17.840]  third dimension.
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:22.040]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:24.320]  in our lives is our bodies.
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:29.600]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.920]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:39.640]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:44.440]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.440]  going to find anywhere.
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:50.720]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:58.360]  Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:33.440]  I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:38.320]  financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win and without
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:42.720]  you I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:44.000]  The enemy could win.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.120]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:47.360]  We're being used by God.
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:48.560]  You're being used by God.
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.440]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:53.440]  of my heart.
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:47:01.960]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:21.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:23.480]  Our Alex Jones here back live.
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:24.480]  You're a TV viewer.
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:30.440]  You see a live set theme coming into our news center in Central Texas from far, far West
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:32.080]  Texas, El Paso.
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:35.320]  Talk about a romantic looking town and area.
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:37.800]  It looks like the wild, wild West when you're there.
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:40.840]  I think you're in the middle of an old Western.
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:42.840]  I'm right over that border.
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:48.720]  It's the most dangerous city in all of Mexico.
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:51.440]  And Trump thinks we should have a wall there.
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:53.280]  Well, there is a wall there.
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.840]  It was there before he ever got in office.
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:58.720]  And Obama and all of them said the exact same things.
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:02.920]  Trump said, now that Trump's in, oh no, he's evil.
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:06.280]  I want to rush through your calls because there's a lot of them and I'm sure they're
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  all excellent.
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:12.960]  Just briefly, seriously, I don't want to say we're treading water because I've found
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.840]  ways to cut things and do certain things and do this and that is still funder operation.
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:21.720]  But man, if we had more money, we could sure hurt the globalist a lot worse.
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:26.240]  Plus, our supplements are the very best, our water filtration, our air filtration.
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:27.600]  It's all really excellent.
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:31.320]  The nonzuma, heirloom seeds, the shortwave radios, the t-shirts, the books, the films,
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:37.160]  the Betsy Ross flag shirts, all of it is at infowarstore.com and we're extending last
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:44.560]  week's big sale because they reminded me, they said, hey, the sixth yesterday is the
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.280]  anniversary of you getting banned to set the precedent for the Global Chinese Social Credit
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:50.280]  Score.
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:52.400]  You ought to make that point.
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:55.360]  Here we are a year later still fighting thanks for your support.
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:57.680]  Let me tell you, these are products you need.
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:00.320]  So get your Real Red Pill Plus 60% off.
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:01.320]  We've never done that.
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:06.440]  Even though it's a great seller, I want you to experience how amazing the stuff is and
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:10.400]  I'm not going to get it at everything in the Senate, but Real Red Pill Plus, Survival Shield
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:16.440]  X2, DNA Force Plus back in stock, it's massively discounted, Ultra 12, Turbo Force is amazing,
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:19.480]  the protein bars are back, the coffee's great.
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:21.600]  Just find out about each and every one of them for yourself.
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:29.520]  I had an earache this weekend because I didn't wash my ears out after I swam in the lake
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:31.960]  and it's the hot part of the summer.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:37.720]  I just went and found some cologne because I didn't have any alcohol, poured it in my
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:41.000]  ear, it only partially killed the bacteria.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.360]  I got home the next day because I was out at the lake and I found colloidal silver from
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:52.440]  M4WareStore.com, little quarter bottle we had left, dumped it in my ear within 10 minutes.
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:58.640]  The bacteria wore dead, the pain was gone and I'm not a tough guy, but I can handle
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:49:59.640]  a little pain.
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:04.720]  Well, maybe I'm a little tough, but the point is, is that I was taking Advil, it was hurting
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:13.680]  so bad that night and 10 minutes just, bye-bye dead, the cologne that has alcohol and it didn't
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:14.680]  do it.
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:18.840]  About half way out, then later it came back, the bacteria like powered through it.
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:26.240]  That silver hit him, double X's baby, dead as a doornail, M4WareStore.com has what is
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:28.680]  rated the safest, 30 parts per million.
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:34.080]  You can get it even stronger, I don't recommend you take that, you shouldn't ingest it.
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:40.960]  It kills bacteria and viruses for a reason, it's poison, it's good poison, but it's poison.
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:46.440]  So we sell what is the studied most recommended to be that good medium between 30 parts per
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:50.000]  million from the top lab of the country.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:54.400]  Like super silver wound gel, that is the strongest over-the-counter silver you can get.
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:59.800]  Do not ingest that if you value your kidneys and your liver.
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:05.880]  But let me tell you, it works like a ton of bricks on topical stuff.
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:06.880]  It's strong.
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:13.680]  Okay, let's go to your calls, John and Delaware, Kenneth, Tracy, Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot,
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:16.640]  Rick, Brad, who's been home the longest year.
[1:51:16.640 --> 1:51:20.200]  That would be John and Delaware, thanks for calling sir, go ahead.
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:22.800]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:24.300]  Yes sir.
[1:51:24.300 --> 1:51:30.840]  I just want to start off, I'm just, I'm absolutely disgusted and pissed off with these people
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:38.640]  and this stuff, with all this gun control stuff, and I just think that we have to find
[1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:47.840]  a way to get the real facts out there, you know, somehow, just with the amount of long
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:52.240]  guns that are used, you know, it's 3.7% these days.
[1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:53.840]  Oh, that's the whole other area.
[1:51:53.840 --> 1:51:59.600]  I get 200,000 dead in Mexico, thousands of mass graves right across the border now, Paso.
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:03.440]  He's dumped off at the police station all the time, reporters killed, none of it gets
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:04.440]  covered.
[1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:05.440]  Oh no.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:06.440]  Go ahead.
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:14.800]  No, I mean, Bado's out on the news saying that the United States, that we lead the world
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:22.960]  in gun deaths, and we have.6 per 100,000, you know, dying of murder.
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:26.160]  No, we're not even in the top 20 countries for gun deaths.
[1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:27.920]  I mean, my God, that is asinine.
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:31.760]  And they know that, what we have is a gang problem in certain areas, and we have about
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:33.880]  100 people a year getting killed in mass shootings.
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:37.760]  It's a tragedy, but the media hypes it, just like shark attacks.
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:42.080]  The average person, as I've said, is scared to death of getting out over their head in
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:44.760]  the water because they think sharks are going to eat them.
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:47.440]  And yeah, you might get bit by a black tip or something, it's not going to kill you,
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:49.080]  but it's still really rare, exactly.
[1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:51.720]  The statistics show more guns, less crime.
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:58.160]  Now, there's a slight uptick in mass shootings by white dudes who happen to be devil worshipers.
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:01.360]  I mean, did you notice it's come out that both these guys were devil worshipers, but
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:02.360]  it's all hidden?
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:03.360]  Right.
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:12.560]  Well, my question to you is, what can we do to just stop these people?
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:20.720]  I mean, I think maybe if Trump even came out and laid out the real statistics in this
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:26.560]  country with the gun stuff, I mean, there's got to be some way where these people, you
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:29.440]  know, all these Democrats, they go on all these shows.
[1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:33.320]  They know what they're doing, and Trump knows it's all emotional, so he didn't want to get
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:36.200]  a statistic fight, whether it was it'll sound like he doesn't care what the 20 dead.
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:39.600]  I mean, it was your mama or your brother that got killed by this guy.
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:46.560]  By the way, this guy is autistic, didn't know where he was, told police he went to Walmart
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:52.120]  to get food, they all report other shooters in solid black, didn't have any other clips
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:53.240]  on him.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:57.160]  And then he turned himself into police down the road.
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:53:59.960]  And that's why they didn't beat the hell out of him because they weren't even sure it
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.920]  was him when he walked up to him.
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:06.200]  So does any of that sound like it's legitimate to you?
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:08.880]  It's the same old story.
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:10.920]  It's the crazy looking guy.
[1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:14.760]  It's, you know, reports of one thing from the people that were on the ground.
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:17.880]  Then you hear a whole different, you know, a whole different spin.
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:18.880]  Sure.
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:22.840]  And they'll argue, they'll argue, well, always the first reports are conflicting.
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:23.840]  Sure.
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:26.760]  Well, they'll say like two shooters because different people saw the same guy.
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:31.960]  No, this is men in all black, blue eyes, shooting people.
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:36.600]  And he comes in with one clip and supposedly does all this, doesn't get caught there.
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:40.200]  There's no security at the biggest and most busy Walmart in America.
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:41.960]  Does anyone buy this?
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:44.240]  No, I sure don't.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:49.520]  I mean, and it's going to keep happening and they keep piping it up, they keep piping
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  it up.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:51.840]  We're up here in Delaware.
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:55.360]  We just bought a big gun band thing a few months ago.
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:00.880]  Now we already have some of our representatives after this, you know, calling to, calling
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:03.320]  to reintroduce it again this year.
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:07.960]  When it just all got voted down, we all went to the valleys, we put up and they're just
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:09.680]  using it and using it.
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:16.000]  And I just think that there, we have to find a way to just shut their argument down and
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.040]  just stick it right up their ass.
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:19.040]  No, I agree.
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:21.560]  God bless you, brother.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.360]  Let me just say this about all this and I'm not tooting my horn and I hate to give them
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:30.240]  ideas, but believe me, they're run by Alexander Soros that we've got the documents.
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:34.360]  That's who funds antifungal.
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:38.880]  If they're smart and these guys are nihilistic suicide heads, but the guy that attacked the
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:46.160]  guy's facility said he wanted to die three weeks ago, they will go and attack and say
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:47.560]  they're right wingers.
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:50.560]  Well, they first said the guy in Dayton was a right winger.
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:54.520]  No, he was an avowed lover of Satan.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:59.360]  He had lyrics about wanting to have sex with Satan and out of rape women and drink women's
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  blood.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.240]  I mean, I'm not going to read all this to you on air.
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:03.240]  It's bad.
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:08.840]  They took all the videos down, but he had a devil worship band about raping women.
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:13.600]  And drinking menstrual fluid and just stuff I'm not going to even say, I'm already saying
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:14.600]  some of it.
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:17.200]  And of course it was screwing kids and it's all the same crap.
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:18.200]  It's a spirit.
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:20.200]  Take one damn look at that guy's eyes.
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:23.360]  I said the first day, that's a devil worshiper.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:29.480]  I went on air Sunday and I said, that's a devil worshiper and he's a devil worshiper.
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:37.320]  You know what devil worshippers look like, weak little pieces of crap with demon eyes.
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:41.400]  He was a porno grind band that released songs about raping and killing women.
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:42.400]  Now there's the headlines.
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:45.200]  I might even going to read the transcripts of this.
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:47.400]  Look these people want to rape babies.
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  Okay.
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:49.400]  I mean, it's real simple.
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  They love Satan.
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:51.400]  They want to kill babies.
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:52.920]  They've told me this to my face.
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:53.920]  I go to Democrat events.
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:55.920]  They walk up and go, I love Satan.
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:56.920]  I'm going to kill you.
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:57.920]  I kill babies.
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:01.320]  And you're like, oh, they're just doing that to freak me out.
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:02.320]  No.
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:05.280]  We've infiltrated their groups.
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.320]  That's what they do at the meetings, they walk around and go, I like to screw kids.
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:10.680]  I like to poop my parents.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:16.440]  I like to, you're like, who the hell are these are demons, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:18.480]  And if you're not a demon, you don't get it.
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:19.480]  You don't understand it.
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:22.520]  And I understand you don't understand it because you're not a demon.
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.520]  These people are.
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:27.680]  And I haven't even gotten to the big story.
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:32.080]  They have that FBI guy that goes on TV and says that Trump is a white supremacy says
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:35.360]  Trump lowered the flags for Hitler.
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:36.960]  I'm not joking.
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:41.160]  That clip and your calls is coming up and then our special guest, Mr. Paschia.
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:47.440]  Hour number three straight ahead, infowars.com.
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.920]  Before I started working at infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com,
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:55.480]  but also the products at infowarsstore.com.
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.400]  And there's one product that's offered at infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:02.760]  supplements and that's DNA force plus.
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.840]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:10.000]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:15.440]  And so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:18.960]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:22.400]  So I started looking into DNA force plus, but it's expensive.
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:23.400]  Why?
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:25.520]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:29.520]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:35.840]  telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA force plus is still there.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:37.320]  It is the elite supplement.
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:41.200]  I get excited when DNA force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[1:58:41.200 --> 1:58:48.840]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA force plus at infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:53.720]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:57.160]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[1:58:57.160 --> 1:58:59.600]  This is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:02.800]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:04.440]  I didn't invent all this.
[1:59:04.440 --> 1:59:09.320]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:10.880]  simply trying to bring it back.
[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:15.120]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:19.080]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:22.960]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:27.520]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and infowars by buying the great products
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:31.920]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:36.520]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:40.440]  For myself and the whole info wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[1:59:40.440 --> 1:59:44.400]  done because without you info wars is nothing.
[1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:51.480]  You are the info wars and I salute you.
[1:59:51.480 --> 2:00:12.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:17.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:19.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:26.880]  It's alive, it's alive, it's alive.
[2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:32.320]  One year after their total war against us, they'll have been attacking us forever, but
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:36.640]  one year after their mega massive offensive, we're here.
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:37.640]  Still on air, thanks to you.
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:39.560]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.200]  Taking your calls throughout the hour.
[2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:45.400]  First visit of Mark Passio, a really smart guy, enjoyed some of his shows and research
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:48.640]  and I don't know how to research myself so I know a lot of it's very accurate because
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:49.640]  I know it.
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:50.640]  I've learned some stuff as well.
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:54.520]  So he's going to be riding shotgun with us and hopefully come out of town sometime
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:57.440]  and be in studio with us because I want to more and more want to get guys in studio.
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:00:59.120]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:00.840]  Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:06.880]  I'm also going to play this deep state FBI agent, former agent who just ups the ante
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:08.120]  every day without writing stuff.
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:14.680]  He says, Trump lowered the flags to have mass to hail Hitler.
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:15.680]  Don't believe me?
[2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:18.680]  I'm going to show you the club next segment.
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:20.040]  I'm going to go next with this.
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:21.040]  This is just getting insane.
[2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:29.360]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Kevin in New Hampshire.
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:30.360]  Kevin here on the air.
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:31.360]  Thanks.
[2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:32.360]  Go ahead.
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:33.360]  Hey Alex.
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  Hey brother.
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  Go ahead.
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:36.360]  Take my call.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:37.360]  Yeah.
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:38.360]  Take my call.
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:40.800]  First thing I want to say is thanks a lot for your smile shield X2 man.
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:45.640]  I try to take it every day so I better forget but every time I do, I feel great.
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:47.840]  Sometimes that actually works better than a cup of coffee.
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:48.840]  It's amazing.
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:54.720]  Well, I got to tell you, I got told by Dr. Group eight years ago, when he first visited
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:01:58.120]  here, he goes, listen, I'm working on this iodine, a special isolated type reaction
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  absorbent.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:02.120]  It's from, you know, nobody else has it and you take it, you'll go through a big detox
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:04.120]  and all this stuff, but it'll change your life.
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:07.280]  And I actually took it and lost tons of weight.
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:08.280]  My skin got better.
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:10.280]  I mean, iodine is the missing link.
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:13.080]  The problem is most iodine is chemically bound.
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:14.080]  It's toxic.
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:15.320]  It'll eat a hole in your stomach.
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:16.320]  This stuff doesn't do it.
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:18.040]  So thanks for the testimonial.
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:19.040]  Absolutely.
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:23.480]  Um, quick question before I get to what I'm calling about, are you guys going to be at
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.040]  the Manchester, New Hampshire rally on the 15th?
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.240]  We've got four reporters that rove the U.S. and they're at most events and I believe they
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:32.240]  will be there.
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:33.240]  We're trying to hire more.
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:35.120]  We've actually hired three more reporters.
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:36.880]  They're getting trained and ready right now.
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:39.840]  Got a bunch of expansions that are going to be announced very soon, including lawsuits
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:43.640]  against the globalist, new shows, and then a bunch of covert operations we're running
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:45.480]  and we can't talk about.
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:46.480]  Right.
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:47.480]  I understand.
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:48.480]  And that's awesome.
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:49.480]  I'll be looking for you guys.
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:54.360]  Brother, you are, you understand you are without you, you are the operation.
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:55.360]  You are doing this.
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:58.040]  So don't say, Hey, I thank you guys.
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:02:59.040]  Thank you.
[2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:00.040]  You understand.
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:01.040]  Don't get this ass backwards.
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.560]  Kevin, you are the reason we're here.
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:07.000]  All right, and I appreciate that, Alex.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  So here's my theory.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.080]  I was, I was both listening yesterday and I also played back just in case I missed anything
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:16.520]  your show from yesterday.
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:20.800]  And you're asking how do you think they're going to strike back with this proxy war we
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:21.800]  got with China?
[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:28.640]  Well, we know now, Alex, that the Chai comms are the ones behind Antifa and both of these
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:33.040]  shooters were Antifa that you had through the Confucius Institute radicalizing our professors
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.160]  and students and all Antifa are college professors and students.
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:42.920]  So do you think it's possible that they've already struck back or it was a preemptive
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:43.920]  I agree.
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:44.920]  I think China is behind us.
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:45.920]  I think it's synthetic.
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  I think it's synthetic.
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:50.640]  All the evidence is there and they've created this, this cult of hate.
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:54.000]  They've created this, this, this atmosphere, whether these people were under their orders
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.080]  or not, they were organically mind controlled to do this.
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:03:59.080]  Absolutely.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:04.000]  I mean, we know our own CIA is compromised by the globalist, which all connects back
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  to China.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:11.280]  And why do you think Obama gave the operation away the office personal management?
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:16.440]  He gave them all the files seven years ago so they could checkmate and blackmail everybody
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:20.560]  so they could give their own agents and the Chai comms the whole blueprint of the US intelligence
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:21.560]  operation.
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:24.640]  I mean, it's a miracle the country's even still here.
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:26.280]  Absolutely.
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:30.400]  And you know, I don't know how much stock you put in this guy, but I mean, he wrote
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:33.320]  a lot of good stuff and he did come out against you.
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:34.320]  He's dead now.
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  You know, he's a Cooper guy.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:40.360]  He talked about this, how they would be all beyond SSRIs and on that same page that it's
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:44.720]  now a meme now over the internet that paragraph of his book, Behold a Pale Horse.
[2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:47.120]  No, I think William Cooper did a lot of great stuff.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.120]  The A.T.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:50.120]  talked about the Chai comms, SSRIs, a lot of smart stuff.
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:52.200]  I was ever against Cooper interviewed him a few times.
[2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:58.160]  He just got jealous of the show and that's okay.
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:05:02.920]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:23.800]  It's Alex Jones, by the way, playing the song from the Motor City madman.
[2:06:23.800 --> 2:06:28.760]  Now a transplant to Texas reminds me it's time to get Uncle Ted back on.
[2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:30.960]  He says he'll come in studio.
[2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:31.960]  Let's go pick him up.
[2:06:31.960 --> 2:06:32.960]  North Austin.
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:33.960]  Drive his ass down here.
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:37.280]  He's amazing in person, Ted Nugent.
[2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:39.080]  I think we got the globalist in a stranglehold.
[2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:43.320]  Okay, so I've known about Mark Passy a couple of years, watching her stuff.
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:45.840]  My wife listens to it a lot and I was listening to it a few weeks ago in the car.
[2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:50.760]  I said, I got to get that guy on and then by the time I got a hold of him, Hall hell broke
[2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:51.760]  loose last week.
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:06:56.360]  I rescheduled him twice and I've canceled most guests, by the way, because obviously
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:06:57.960]  they're trying to trigger a civil war right now.
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:07:02.440]  But I wanted to get into natural law and I'm getting back on about his view on fake Christians
[2:07:02.440 --> 2:07:05.200]  because it's lined up with mine and he's just a smart guy.
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:08.960]  What on earth is happening.com and he's an independent researcher, public speaker from
[2:07:08.960 --> 2:07:13.600]  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the past 12 years, his work has been to teach the universe spiritual
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:17.680]  laws of morality upon which all human freedom depends.
[2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:23.280]  So it's a good point just to ask what is natural law and then just project it onto what's happening
[2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:24.280]  now.
[2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:26.360]  The Democrats are breaking natural law.
[2:07:26.360 --> 2:07:28.560]  They're at war with natural law.
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:32.960]  They're at war with the very reality of the universe like the French Revolution claimed
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:37.320]  it was to enlighten, but it was really trying to bring in a total dark age.
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:41.640]  And what does it do to natural law play this at the end of the segment to have former high
[2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:50.320]  level FBI agent, counterterrorism, come out, fig lazuzi or how do you say his name, every
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:57.440]  day it's a new thing and say that Trump lowered the flags to say how Hitler.
[2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:01.120]  And then what he does is he projects mental illness onto it knowing that the type of mentally
[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:05.320]  ill people out there who now don't have any consciousness, don't have any rudder, don't
[2:08:05.320 --> 2:08:09.880]  have any basis in reality, don't have any natural law, don't have any compass, don't
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:17.240]  have any ways to differentiate, now just look for fantasy land because oh, the flags go
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:22.640]  up on one day and they go down a few days later on eight, eight.
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:28.960]  That means how Hitler, because some weird obscure group said that in prison.
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:33.360]  And so now the FBI is popularizing not just mom and dad is bad, not just the American
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:38.120]  flag is racist, not just nationalism is evil.
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:45.160]  But now, now the word 88 is bad, you know, we got a crew member named Drew and he wears
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:51.480]  a Drew Pearson Dallas Cowboys 88 was Drew Pearson, a worshipper of Hitler.
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:57.960]  So it's this mind control of projecting onto everything that this symbol, which means everything's
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:04.280]  going well and scuba diving or in welding or in, you know, for astronauts, this means
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:10.680]  a okay, okay, well, that's now, you know, white supremacism, this attempt to attack
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:13.400]  language and to destroy language.
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:15.280]  Where do you think it's all going?
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:16.960]  So Mark Pascio, thanks for joining us.
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:22.400]  I apologize for rescheduling you, but it's been a crazy period.
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:23.400]  No worries.
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  I completely understand Alex.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:26.360]  I want to say thank you for bringing me onto the show.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:27.880]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:33.400]  What you talk about natural law is so simple, but also so complex.
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:34.400]  Why?
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:35.400]  Why?
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:36.400]  It's so important.
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:40.040]  Well, I mean, the first thing is I'd like to clear up what natural law is not because
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:45.160]  a lot of people have a, you know, mental definition that's quite different than what
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:47.000]  it really is.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:52.520]  Natural law is definitely not and has absolutely nothing to do with Darwinism.
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:57.680]  It has absolutely nothing to do with the so-called survival of the fittest or the so-called
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:03.760]  law of the jungle or what people often term as the so-called natural order.
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:07.680]  You know, these have nothing to do with what I'm referring to when I talk about natural
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:08.840]  law.
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:17.280]  Natural law is cosmic spiritual law of creation that is all about objective morality.
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:26.720]  It's a set of universal, inherent, objective, non-manmade, eternal and unchangeable conditions
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:33.080]  that actually govern the consequences of the behaviors that we choose through our own
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:34.720]  free will.
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:36.400]  That's what natural law really is.
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:38.040]  So it's God's law.
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:40.240]  It's absolutely God's law.
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:44.360]  That's probably the best term for it that it's been called over human history.
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:48.000]  This is God's law, not man's law.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.280]  And you know, freedom depends on whether we understand it objectively or not, whether
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:57.640]  we understand which behaviors are actually moral behaviors.
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:03.640]  Why is Satan or why are these evil people at war with natural law when it gives you
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:06.040]  freedom and prosperity and empowerment?
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:12.120]  Well, as you know, the highest level globalists and social engineers of our world are Satanists.
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:14.200]  They are Satanists and dark Luciferians.
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:17.820]  They are dark occultists, as I refer to them.
[2:11:17.820 --> 2:11:20.520]  And they want to turn God's law on its head.
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:24.280]  They want to reign in hell rather than rule in heaven.
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:30.960]  What they want to do is become the actual rulers of earth and turn earth into a prison
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:36.080]  and then rule over that prison because they don't want to abide by the laws of morality.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:37.500]  They want to be God.
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:39.000]  That's what Satanism is actually really about.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.400]  And that's incredibly key because they know other people are going to escape it and find
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:43.800]  natural law.
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:45.200]  That's why I call it a prison planet.
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:49.280]  They're obsessed with building a prison, a false reality, hoping they can trick us to
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:50.600]  serve them.
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:54.200]  That is absolutely what they are doing, without a doubt.
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:59.560]  And see, it all hinges on confusing people about what objective morality is.
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:04.520]  See, if people are confused about objective morality, then they can't bring their behavior
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:06.520]  into alignment with natural law.
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:08.000]  So describe that for people.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  That's critical.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:13.880]  Yeah, there's a law in the universe known as the law of freedom, as I refer to it.
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:20.640]  And it's very simply that as the aggregate or collective morality of a species increases,
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:26.440]  as we collectively become more moral people because we're aligning our behavior to objective
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:31.480]  right, meaning we are not doing actions that cause harm to other people.
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:33.360]  That's what wrongdoings are.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:39.040]  And rights, which very few people can even define, are actions which do not initiate
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:41.760]  harm or violence to other beings.
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:45.400]  Because people can't even give the definition of a simple definition of a right.
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:47.480]  That's why we're losing our rights, okay?
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:52.880]  So if we don't bring our behavior into alignment with natural law, that becomes a complete source
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:57.360]  of chaos and disorder in the world, and we eventually go into enslavement.
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:03.680]  The law of freedom is basically that as the collective morality of a species increases,
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.640]  their collective freedom as a species increases.
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:13.840]  And as the collective morality of a species declines, and we go into immoral behaviors
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:19.560]  as an entire race of beings, then we go deeper and deeper into bondage and enslavement.
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:23.680]  This is what I refer to as the natural law of freedom.
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:27.920]  And the enemy knows that, and everything is set up to trick people into that process.
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.120]  And when you become corrupt, you can see people spiritually lose that spark in the
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:34.360]  eye and become like dumb slaves.
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:38.040]  The Bible talks about they're giving over to great delusion.
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:44.760]  Without a doubt, and this is all about confusing people as to the actual behaviors that are
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:49.080]  moral versus the behaviors that are actually immoral.
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:56.560]  Most people have taken on the mindset of these dark occultists and Satanists by buying into
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:13:59.440]  what is known as moral relativism.
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:03.360]  And moral relativism is the destroyer of human freedom.
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:09.240]  It's the belief or religion, if you will, the ideology that objective morality doesn't
[2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:15.600]  exist inherently in the universe, and that right and wrong are actually subjective constructs
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:16.600]  of the human mind.
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:21.640]  And your brain says to computer, and there is no right or wrong, you're not really alive.
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:22.880]  Dogs really don't get excited.
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:23.880]  They don't have emotions.
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:24.880]  Of course they do.
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:28.040]  They're just teaching you that you're a robot because they want you to think you have no
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:30.200]  consciousness so they can program you.
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:31.200]  Exactly.
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:33.240]  They want to give us their mindset.
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:39.320]  Their mindset is this totally degraded, immoral mindset, and they want to spread that mindset
[2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:44.880]  through society because only when people buy into a lesser version of these high-level
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:48.440]  Satanist mindset can they actually be controlled by them.
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:53.480]  And I've also noticed when I've had the top Democrat Sumi and things, they really believe
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:56.480]  that we're evil like them in running scams.
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:14:59.520]  I've also noticed that that's how twisted they are.
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:01.280]  They really believe that all there is is evil.
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:02.280]  It's bizarre.
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:05.960]  Well, part of like what you said, it's about projection.
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:11.280]  The enemy always wants to project their own mindset onto other people and say that they're
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:16.000]  doing the same thing that they're actually doing and try to turn the tables like that.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.560]  And they're going to be able to get away with that as long as the public doesn't wake
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:25.400]  up to the dangers of moral relativism and learn natural law.
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:27.560]  It is not about.
[2:15:27.560 --> 2:15:30.640]  We are not the arbitrators of what right and wrong are.
[2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:36.520]  We should be discovering those principles as they exist in nature because they are inherent
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  to nature.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:39.560]  And all the occultists talk about magic.
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:40.560]  That's all a twisted form.
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.960]  If you really follow God's laws, the magic is immediate and it's not magic.
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  It's the way the universe works.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:46.960]  It's the keys to destiny.
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:47.960]  We'll be back with Mark Passing of What on Earth is Happening.com.
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:48.960]  I'm Alex Shows, Dimplemore.com.
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:49.960]  A really smart guy.

[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:00.840]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:04.600]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, and that if you go back five, six years ago
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:07.760]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:11.080]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were,
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:13.800]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:17.080]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:18.080]  shut us down.
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:20.440]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:21.440]  wonderful they work.
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:23.240]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:26.200]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[2:19:26.200 --> 2:19:32.160]  He claims they're supplements, no, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement
[2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:35.440]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[2:19:35.440 --> 2:19:39.360]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them, and all drugs are is the
[2:19:39.360 --> 2:19:43.000]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:44.240]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:48.160]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:49.800]  God's medicine chest.
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:20:07.120]  Time for our store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, you're
[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:14.840]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:18.640]  Okay, let's go right back to Mark Passio, who will have back again to to get really
[2:20:18.640 --> 2:20:23.680]  into natural law and why the system is trying to overthrow it because they can't rule unless
[2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:29.240]  they sabotage you and basically cut your legs off to your psychological spiritual cripple
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:30.240]  so they can rule over you.
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:32.000]  But I want to get his take on world events.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.520]  Some of your calls coming up Carlos Bill, chase the Patriot, Rick Brad, I promise for
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:41.520]  this hour ends, we'll get to you then coming up today in the fourth hour is Mike Adams
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:42.520]  of natural news.com.
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:46.520]  We might go 10 minutes in or so with Mark, if you can do it, Mike's always fine with
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:50.960]  that because I'm going to have plenty of time to talk to Mr. Passio of again the website
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:55.880]  what on earth is happening.com always just type in Mark Passio and go listen to what
[2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:56.880]  he's saying and doing.
[2:20:56.880 --> 2:20:59.480]  And the reason I like it is that I've done a lot of historical research and he's really
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:00.480]  a smart guy.
[2:21:00.480 --> 2:21:01.480]  He knows what he's talking about.
[2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:04.720]  So many other people, which I'm not saying this with pleasure, don't know what they're
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:06.280]  talking about.
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:10.800]  And truth is so on its face when you know it, but then you run into other people that
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:17.880]  have never discovered it or never even experienced God's laws, universal law, that they are at
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:18.880]  war with it.
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:24.040]  They get angry that you possess it and there's like a spiritual envy, I would almost describe
[2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:29.680]  evil or Satanism or the demonic forces is they're upset by the very existence of the
[2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:35.200]  spirit of natural law that I guess almost like a prism comes down from God and almost
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:36.200]  beams out from us.
[2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:40.760]  I don't mean that to sound new agey, but more and more I go to Democrat events.
[2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:44.480]  I've even gone there, you know, disguise with a cap on and whatever and not let them know
[2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:49.840]  and you hear these people and they they Democrats didn't use to act like demonic goblins 20
[2:21:49.840 --> 2:21:50.840]  years ago.
[2:21:50.840 --> 2:21:51.840]  Something's happening.
[2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:56.240]  People are either getting more demonic, more fallen or more awake.
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:59.080]  How does that fit into what's happening on the planet in your view?
[2:21:59.080 --> 2:22:05.040]  Well, I would say that there are spiritually fallen individuals that have really a very
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:09.880]  degraded sense of self and they're in a deep state of self-loathing.
[2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:14.960]  Only self-loathing people would want more control and violence in the world through
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:15.960]  government.
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:21.600]  You know, only self-loathing people become authoritarians and support authoritarianism
[2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:28.200]  and these people don't have a actively developed sense of self and morality and truth and they're
[2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:32.760]  very cut off and disconnected from spirit and that is the underlying problem.
[2:22:32.760 --> 2:22:38.800]  You know, I think what sets my work apart from many other researchers' work is that
[2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:46.480]  I don't so much focus on the symptoms of like what is actually going on in our world.
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:49.840]  You know, it's that my name in my sight is what on earth is happening, but it might be
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:54.480]  at more apropos to call it why on earth is this happening.
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:22:59.200]  See, I focus on the underlying causal factors within countries.
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:03.840]  And you're right because as a news show we have to cover all the crazy things happening,
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:08.040]  but it's important to realize the root of this is that there really is, just like computers
[2:23:08.040 --> 2:23:13.680]  have programs and computers have viruses, there is information in the universe that
[2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:16.680]  either destroys you or information that empowers you.
[2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:17.920]  That's exactly right.
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:23.800]  And you know, what they're doing is they are confusing everybody about what the actual
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:25.800]  difference between right and wrong are.
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:30.480]  You know, they're trying to tell people that, you know, vices are crimes instead of actually
[2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:35.480]  really understanding the true wrongdoings that we should not be enacting or initiating
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:37.480]  toward our fellow beings.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:41.560]  You know, the real focus on sins that almost everybody's involved in that aren't good,
[2:23:41.560 --> 2:23:46.480]  but aren't the fount of where it comes from, the breaking of the original laws from which
[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:48.000]  all the other vice comes from.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:52.200]  So because I've always inherently said that like not standing up against evil or killing
[2:23:52.200 --> 2:23:58.200]  a baby or being a coward or lying to people to get ahead, that's a real sin.
[2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:03.320]  Smoking cigarettes, you know, having whatever, I mean, you know, that's not good.
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:05.760]  But it's not good for you, but there are vices on that.
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:08.640]  They obsess on that because they don't want you to go address the big stuff.
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:09.640]  Yes.
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:11.760]  Those are vices at best, not not crimes.
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:16.680]  They're not actual transgressions against natural law because the transgressions against
[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:21.480]  natural law are those things that initiate aggression and violence against others.
[2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:22.480]  So list some of the things.
[2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:24.800]  I mean, the big ones that really break God's law.
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:25.800]  Yes.
[2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:31.400]  The real seven deadly sins that are transgressions against all of natural law are murder, assault,
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:36.680]  rape, theft, trespass, coercion, and willfully lying.
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:38.720]  And these are all forms of theft.
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:39.720]  If you really...
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:43.360]  Which willfully lying would be like a form of conspiracy, cooking up new forms of inventing
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:44.360]  evil.
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:45.360]  Yeah.
[2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:48.800]  Like, I mean, not telling someone there's a carcinogenic substance in something that
[2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:50.800]  you gave them to eat, you know, something like that.
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:55.440]  I mean, you're obviously, you know, holding back necessary information and knowledge that
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:57.280]  someone needs to know that if they don't know...
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:00.520]  So really, they're withholding them knowledge, the attempt to keep people in the dark is
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:01.520]  a big sin.
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:02.520]  Yes.
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:03.520]  And that's what these people are.
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:04.680]  They are occultists.
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:07.520]  And what occult means is hidden knowledge.
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:12.000]  It means hiding knowledge that people need to understand because if they don't understand
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.720]  it, it's going to open up a huge power differential through their ignorance.
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:18.080]  And that's what these dark occultists have done.
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:22.280]  They've wielded knowledge as a weapon over other people about how these laws of nature
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:24.840]  work.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:25.960]  And you just said it all.
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:30.560]  They are keeping us stunted like children so they can rule over a bunch of brain damage
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:31.720]  children.
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:33.560]  That is the ultimate sin.
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:38.780]  I give an example like, imagine if someone didn't know how to do basic arithmetic.
[2:25:38.780 --> 2:25:42.600]  How much would a merchant be able to take advantage of them?
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:46.400]  You know, they would convert that ignorance into their advantage.
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:50.440]  And that's when Christ pulled out the whip and overturned the tables and beat the Pharisees
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:55.200]  because they were making you pay 10 times more for a certain coin to buy the sacrifice
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:26:00.360]  and were engaged in a manipulation and ripping people off that were faithful.
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:02.240]  And it's all forms of theft.
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:05.080]  Every wrongdoing under natural law is a form of theft.
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:10.600]  If you break them all down, murder the theft of life without just cause, assault, taking
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:14.640]  someone else's well-being without, you know, the physical health of their body without
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:20.000]  right, rape, the theft of someone's free will, sexual association.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.240]  Theft is the taking of property that's not yours, trespass, the taking of security in
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:29.240]  another's dwelling place which doesn't belong to you to take, coercion is taking of someone's
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:33.920]  free will, the theft of free will which isn't yours, and then lying is taking necessary
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:36.640]  knowledge from people, withholding necessary knowledge.
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:42.960]  You could boil natural law down in its most simplistic form to one overarching principle.
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:44.040]  Don't steal.
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:45.520]  The theft is the ultimate sin.
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:48.280]  It's the ultimate form of wrongdoing against natural law.
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:53.640]  And we even see plants and things that live in harmony versus things that come in and
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:55.720]  don't live in harmony and that are destructive.
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:59.160]  I mean, you see this as above so below.
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:00.160]  Without a doubt.
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:03.800]  I mean, that's the principle of correspondence that this is going on across all scales of
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.920]  creation and that as our behavior, as we put our behavior out into the universe, it is
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.760]  going to be reflected back to us as the shared human experience.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:13.820]  You're a smart guy.
[2:27:13.820 --> 2:27:15.880]  Why do you think the globalists are so scared?
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:16.880]  Give me your honest opinion.
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:21.080]  On Trump, on info wars, on the censorship, they are, they really dread and I'm not trying
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:22.640]  to make ourselves the center of this.
[2:27:22.640 --> 2:27:23.640]  They fear.
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:24.920]  I get around senators and others.
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:29.920]  They shake in fear like, like, like, like, like, like we're a guillotine or something.
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:32.040]  Why do you think they're so scared?
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:38.640]  They fear any exposure of their criminal activity and of their complete deception and anything
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:43.640]  that brings people closer into harmony with understanding truth, they want to shut down
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:47.360]  because the works of evil are always done in darkness.
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:50.560]  They can't deceive people if people are in full knowledge.
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:55.200]  They want to maintain their power differential by maintaining their knowledge differential
[2:27:55.200 --> 2:28:00.720]  and as long as the main body of the human public remains in the ignorance that they
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:06.120]  are currently in regarding the laws of spirituality and the laws of morality that are embedded
[2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:07.640]  in nature.
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:12.240]  These criminal occultists who are really running the earth right now are going to be able to
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:16.960]  continue exercising their power differential over other people.
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:19.720]  That's why they don't want it exposed and that's why they're going to do anything.
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:24.720]  You agree with me that they're super scared right now, though they seem really scared.
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:30.240]  I think that they are worried about the possibility of this type of knowledge breaking out and
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:32.000]  becoming more mainstream.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.720]  I don't know if I would go so far as to say that they're shaking in their boots because
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:38.600]  they still have a lot of systems in place that are controlling this.
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:39.600]  Oh no, I agree.
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:44.600]  Their systems are in place, but their big master plan, the more they try to birth it,
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:48.040]  the more there's rumblings and earthquakes, the more they have problems, but they still
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:49.400]  steam ahead.
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:50.400]  Stay right there.
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:52.880]  We'll get into some of the contemporary stuff with you and take some calls.
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:55.320]  We're going to get back more into this later too.
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.520]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:04.760]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:06.480]  important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:07.480]  Bill Hyde here.
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:11.600]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:15.840]  system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:19.920]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:21.400]  bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:25.240]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:29.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.360]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:33.360 --> 2:29:34.720]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:39.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.200]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:45.240]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:46.240]  And the best part?
[2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:49.600]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:52.360]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:56.360]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:56.360 --> 2:30:01.240]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:02.240]  act.
[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:06.240]  And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still loved
[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:09.480]  our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:12.440]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools.
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:14.840]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:18.400]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:20.200]  up Mexican flags.
[2:30:20.200 --> 2:30:23.080]  This is the bizarreness of the America-hating we're seeing.
[2:30:23.080 --> 2:30:27.600]  So now it is a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[2:30:27.600 --> 2:30:33.240]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:39.120]  when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com.
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:43.560]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:47.840]  face all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide because more than ever, the American flag
[2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:51.680]  is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[2:30:51.680 --> 2:31:02.120]  Tyler, I got a plug for the Patriot points I get, I got $180 so far this year and I feel
[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:03.560]  like I'm stealing from you.
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:06.760]  I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[2:31:06.760 --> 2:31:09.440]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:10.440]  believe in.
[2:31:10.440 --> 2:31:12.720]  So I'd rather give that money to you and then get a quality product.
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:15.160]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:17.480]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:18.480]  I've lost weight.
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:20.000]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.800]  My kid, they use the toothpaste.
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:25.960]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:26.960]  it gets rid of his sore throat.
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:29.000]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:30.480]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[2:31:30.480 --> 2:31:34.840]  I want a good price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[2:31:34.840 --> 2:31:35.840]  50% off.
[2:31:35.840 --> 2:31:38.080]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:41.720]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[2:31:41.720 --> 2:31:42.720]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:46.680]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:50.400]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing
[2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:54.480]  50% off and then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money,
[2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:55.480]  but that's okay.
[2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:56.480]  Thanks for the support.
[2:31:56.480 --> 2:31:57.680]  You've been spreading the word.
[2:31:57.680 --> 2:31:58.680]  You've been praying.
[2:31:58.680 --> 2:31:59.680]  You've been supporting this transmission.
[2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:01.080]  You've been buying products from us.
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:02.840]  So it's the one year baneversary.
[2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:05.200]  It's store-wide, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping.
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:09.920]  It's double Patriot points on your next order and it's 50% to 60% off.
[2:32:09.920 --> 2:32:12.760]  Store-wide free shipping, 56% off, double Patriot points.
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:15.600]  And there's a bunch of other big specials on storeable food.
[2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:20.720]  Every sale at infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, takes you right to the site and you can find
[2:32:20.720 --> 2:32:23.760]  all the great products there and try them for yourself.
[2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:26.720]  And again, sign up for auto-ship and an additional 10% off.
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:29.720]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:33.600]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paint
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:37.520]  infowars.com on the side of your barn, every time you stand up to leftist pulleys, every
[2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:42.600]  time you tell the truth, every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values
[2:32:42.600 --> 2:32:46.520]  alive, the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:49.760]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:53.520]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist.
[2:32:53.520 --> 2:32:54.520]  Stay with us.
[2:32:54.520 --> 2:32:55.520]  We'll be right back.
[2:32:55.520 --> 2:32:59.360]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:15.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:18.840]  All right, it's Mark Pasio.
[2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:19.840]  What a great website.
[2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:27.960]  Coming to you live from the infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:29.960]  Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:35.480]  Okay, Mark, again, you can talk for 10 hours, you do great online conferences, my watch
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:36.480]  box and the DVDs.
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:41.400]  I've watched them and I want to have you come to Austin sometime and do a whole presentation
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:44.240]  here and I won't be here interrupting, I won't be radio and TV breaks interrupting.
[2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:46.680]  I've got a bunch of callers on a bunch of the subjects.
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:50.960]  You said you were happy to get into whatever and kind of apply your research and the way
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:52.360]  things are working to it.
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:55.680]  But I wanted to just bring this up real quick.
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:00.200]  The Bible says the wicked flee when done pursue one of my favorite Bible verses and they use
[2:34:00.200 --> 2:34:06.640]  that at the beginning of true grit, the remake of it that's excellent in my view.
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:11.080]  But there was a motorcycle backfire last night in New York.
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:17.080]  People totally panic like it was the end of the world and a gun hadn't even gone off.
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:22.840]  You pull up drudgerport.com USA Today has evacuated because someone thought they might
[2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:27.080]  have seen someone with a gun.
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:34.560]  Now this shows the hysteria of still maybe 100 people a year get killed in a mass shooting.
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:37.760]  Extremely rare.
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:43.360]  But still it's this perception.
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:47.960]  So fitting that into natural law, when people I've noticed are brought up in cities and
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:53.480]  haven't been out in the real world or haven't done a carpentry or hunting or done whatever,
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:59.520]  they don't have any smarts, even street smarts, and they seem to just take whatever mainstream
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:00.520]  news tells them.
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:01.600]  They're so soft.
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:08.280]  They're so domesticated that if I were to backfire, I wouldn't probably pay attention.
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:09.880]  But these people are so primed.
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:13.280]  There's mass shooters everywhere that when they're out in public, they think they're
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:18.520]  about to die, even though statistically taxis run over hundreds of people a year, I've almost
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:24.480]  been hit in New York by a taxi, but they don't have that common sense or natural law sense
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:26.400]  or differential.
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:30.320]  Whatever the system wants to project onto them, it's like they're almost a clean slate
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:31.320]  like they're soulless.
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:36.280]  And I don't want to say they're soulless, but it seems like they've already almost given
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:37.280]  over the ghost.
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:43.240]  How would you in your system of studying natural law, which I think so, a nice unifying field,
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:47.160]  Terry, how would you speak to that?
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:53.240]  Well, I would say it's absolutely true that they are domesticated and they do not understand
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:58.760]  the self-defense principle, which is one of the biggest aspects of natural law.
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:03.960]  There's two unifying overarching principles that one must understand if we're going to
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:06.560]  understand the totality of natural law.
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:10.080]  And that is first the non-aggression principle.
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:14.360]  The non-aggression principle just simply states that it is always immoral.
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:22.000]  It's always morally wrong to initiate violence and aggression against other sentient beings.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:27.600]  But we have to combine that non-aggression principle with the masculine aspect, which
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:29.640]  is the self-defense principle.
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:35.920]  And this means that we have the inherent right to defend our rights, to defend ourselves
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:41.120]  and our property against people who are coming at us with violence and aggression.
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:45.360]  So self-defense is an inherent human right.
[2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:51.800]  And what they've done is they have socially engineered the vast majority of people, especially
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:59.280]  people in urban environments, to not understand especially the self-defense principle.
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:07.640]  Generally, as people want to live in an environment that's not aggressive and violent, but we
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:12.680]  think there's exceptions to that rule of the non-aggression principle for people in government.
[2:37:12.680 --> 2:37:15.560]  And that's a big morally relativistic problem.
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:21.720]  But the people in urban environments in particular, really most of them do not understand the
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:27.400]  self-defense principle, which is we always maintain the right, the inherent human right
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:32.240]  to defend ourselves with weaponry against people who are initiating violence against
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:33.240]  us.
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:38.920]  And that's why the ownership of arms is absolutely so important and can never be given up if
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:40.480]  we're going to maintain our freedom.
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:43.680]  And shifting into the next subject, the left is everywhere.
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:47.240]  It's going to Mitch McConnell's house and they're going to stab him to death.
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:51.080]  I mean, I don't want to kill anybody offensively, but let me tell you, if I went to Mitch McConnell's
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.200]  house or anybody's house and said, I'm going to stab a senator, I should get arrested.
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:58.360]  They're at his house at midnight with little kids yelling and cussing.
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:01.880]  They're breaking that natural law if you would never bring kids to a gunfight, never bring
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:04.560]  kids to something or cuss in front of them.
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:09.160]  They're about overriding every basic norm that we laid down of chivalry, which I would
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:13.560]  say is a form of natural law being projected into man's law of, hey, let's not involve
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:15.560]  women and children in this.
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:19.560]  And then somebody's putting up flyers all over New York, DrudgeReport.com has the articles,
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:23.480]  M4's article saying, we're going to put Republicans in death camps.
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:25.160]  Well, that's just somebody saying that.
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:28.680]  Well, everywhere the Democrats are saying it's time to get violent.
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:29.800]  It's time to start killing.
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:31.360]  It's time to go after people.
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.040]  And then when some wound up white supremacists, we even believe that, kill support Hispanic
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:41.680]  people that then projected onto all Trump supporters, again, it's like a death of logic,
[2:38:41.680 --> 2:38:43.120]  a death of common sense.
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:45.160]  They're the ones constantly saying, let's be dirty.
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:46.520]  Let's not follow the rules.
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:47.520]  Let's get violent.
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:51.960]  And then when somebody gets violent, they flip out and go, oh my gosh, you can't declare
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:56.440]  a war, and then when it starts, say, hey, you're not allowed to punch back, which I'm
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:01.480]  not in any way defending, well, whoever did that in down there to those great people.
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:02.480]  It's evil.
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:03.480]  It's horrible.
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:09.880]  But even in the synthetic sea, they've created this idea where the left can attack, the left
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:14.200]  can censor the left hand path, but no one else can stand against it.
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:16.080]  It's like a protected group.
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:18.000]  And there was logic.
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:22.840]  And if you study it historically, this is how all authoritarian regimes actually begin.
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:29.560]  There's always some sort of violent political group that is positioned as the favored people
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:31.920]  of the party that is taking over.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:32.920]  The brown shirts.
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:38.240]  Yeah, this was the brown shirts or the Sturmabteilung in Nazi Germany.
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:42.080]  And then they had the Night of the Long Knives in which those people were double crossed
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:45.960]  and thrown under the bus, and then the SS came to power.
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:52.840]  So it's always a matter of these authoritarianisms, these authoritarians, I'm sorry, that actually
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:58.960]  like position the people in a position of authority up as their gods, prop them up as
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:04.480]  their gods, their priests in this priest class, this religion of authoritarianism.
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:10.960]  And then they find out that they're only going to allow them to serve their purpose for as
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:11.960]  long as they're able.
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:17.400]  There's always, whether it's fascism or communism, a useful idiot group that helps the evil guys
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:18.680]  come to power.
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:21.880]  And the globalists I've noticed, the Satanists always are very OCD.
[2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:23.160]  They follow exact plans.
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:24.160]  It's almost robotic.
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:25.520]  A, do you agree with that?
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:28.960]  And B, why do they throw their own minions under the bus?
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:30.640]  And then B, why are they so robotic?
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:31.760]  Or am I wrong?
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:37.640]  They are absolutely robotic and follow very stringent guidelines in their approaches,
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:43.960]  in their whole formula that they follow because they are trapped in the reptilian mind, the
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:46.920]  reptilian or reactive part of the brain.
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:49.800]  And this part of the brain does not allow for creation.
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:55.560]  It is simply fight or flight mechanisms and it sticks to the same plan as long as that
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:58.640]  plan continues to work, like repetition.
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:00.600]  And they don't really create.
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:04.320]  All they do is take things and twist them and distort them and invert them.
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:10.640]  And you know, they absolutely follow a script because unfortunately it has always worked.
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:15.520]  They haven't had to deviate from their plan because the public is still in a very deep
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:17.840]  level of trance and ignorance.
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:18.840]  I agree.
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:20.840]  We'll come back and we'll take calls and talk about how we get out of that trance in your
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:21.840]  view.
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:22.840]  But I know Trump's not perfect.
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:23.840]  We don't like Trump.
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:24.840]  That's fine.
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:25.840]  Give us your honest assessment.
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:29.040]  Why are they so enraged by Trump or are they not enraged by him?
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:30.280]  Is Trump a Trojan horse?
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:31.880]  No, they absolutely are.
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:38.440]  And I think it's because the last election represented archetypes, the mother authoritarian
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:45.240]  figure versus the father figure of the older man, heterosexual man.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:50.000]  And they know that they are trying to socially engineer a gender divide and started gender
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  war.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:56.760]  And this last election represented the whole concept of the two archetypal principles,
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:03.880]  the feminine and masculine, pitted against each other for control in society as far as
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:06.360]  the figurehead of the presidency is concerned.
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:13.680]  And when the feminine or Clinton lost that election, it was the perfect polarization
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:21.320]  divide that they needed in society to really create deep political polarization and hatred
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:22.320]  in society.
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:26.720]  And as if Hillary represents the feminine, as if, like you said, everything is twisted.
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:27.880]  That is not a woman.
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:32.360]  But to the leftists, obviously, you know, that this is their archetypal mother figure
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:33.840]  that they got behind.
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:38.360]  So are you hinting that there's a deeper plan, not that Trump's bad or a rig, but there's
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:42.160]  a deeper plan to create the global revolution by bringing Trump in?
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:43.160]  Let me see what you see about that.
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:45.960]  And I promise, Carlos Bill changed the page with Rick Brad.
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:46.960]  We're coming to your next segment.
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:52.960]  I haven't gotten to the FBI's and saying Trump's eiling Hitler by lowering the flags.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:55.640]  It's all coming up.
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:43:01.040]  Last night, I'm on info wars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:04.800]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:09.320]  A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:11.600]  snake superimposed over it.
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:15.800]  And on the back, America's back info wars.com, but what's better than just an American flag
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:19.120]  about a don't tread on me under the flag, say, don't trailing American flag.
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:20.120]  It's a perfect combo.
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:21.120]  So great minds think alike.
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:24.440]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  design.
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:30.000]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.280]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:35.520]  But it's a, you know, battle pattern flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:43.000]  And again, on the back, it says America's back info wars.com, 4,000 of these babies.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  And that's it.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:48.880]  The Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at info wars store.com be printed
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:53.640]  in the USA right now info wars store.com will be right back, the most banned broadcast
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:55.840]  in the world.
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:43:59.800]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:04.280]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:07.520]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:11.640]  That's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government.
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:13.360]  It is completely independent of all that.
[2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:19.080]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:22.920]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:23.920]  the country.
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:27.720]  They actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:29.240]  was the kind of press they wanted.
[2:44:29.240 --> 2:44:32.600]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:36.640]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:40.600]  what news and views the person is allowed to have or express or hear.
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:42.840]  And the info wars audience has broken through that.
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:47.640]  The that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:48.640]  and freedom.
[2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:52.560]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation law
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:56.640]  fair and libel targeting youth.

[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:08.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:38.840]  So, Figla Uzi spews more lies out of his mouth than an Uzi.
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:44.160]  I didn't even cover in the last few days just without rages statements about Trump winning
[2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:49.680]  a race war and Trump's Hitler but now he's gone even further and I just keep wondering
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:54.080]  how the lies are going to escalate because used to people got in trouble you know saying
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:59.360]  the world's going to end in 12 years like AOC or AOC or stealing two million dollars
[2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:04.000]  out of campaign money maybe she will get in trouble but in another bizarre performance
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:11.080]  this is on infowarstore.com on NBC news programming former FBI assistant director assistant director
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:16.080]  for counterterrorism Frank Figla Uzi claimed that President Trump may have ordered flags
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:21.320]  down and have staff not to honor the victims of the Dayton or El Paso shootings but rather
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:28.560]  to collaborate and celebrate Hitler now this is a very obscure thing that I barely knew
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:34.160]  about but some prison folks in like some kind of prison gang thing about 88 is in the alphabet
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:39.960]  howl Hitler but it's this bigger attack on language and words that Ingsock and George
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:44.360]  Arwell Eric Blair wrote about because he was actually a top propagandist for them Winston
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:49.360]  Smith is an allegory of him he wrote essays admitting this he said they want to destroy
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:54.520]  language and create emotional responses to it and then reduce the language after you've
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.960]  made the language toxic and so that's part of this process of just removing language
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:05.520]  and well I mean here's the clip now remember all these famous football players have had
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:12.760]  88 but I personally am not a huge football guy but I owned a Drew Pearson because Drew
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:16.720]  Pearson is a great guy is a great family guy has a great record as a comfortable player
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:22.360]  I like to you know emulate I'm years ago I had 88 Jersey and I was just teasing Drew
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:27.880]  that works in the office who's Hispanic last week because he was wearing a Drew Pearson
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:32.200]  obviously drew Drew Pearson and I said oh look you're a Nazi so we come and I said well
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:38.760]  the left now says 88 is Hitler he went oh I never heard that and then now in the news
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:44.920]  it's this week they're they're they're externalizing the method they're popularizing the demonization
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:49.840]  of letters and numbers and mother and father and the okay symbol this is part of a larger
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:55.080]  plan so no Drew Pearson's not a Nazi neither Trump but in this is even more esoteric or
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:50:00.400]  even more ridiculous or even more made up they're saying because he ordered him down
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:08.320]  on one day and to go back up on 88 that that is the howl Hitler here it is we have to
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:12.440]  understand the adversary and the threat we're dealing with and if we don't understand how
[2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:17.200]  they think we'll never understand how to counter them so it's a little things and language
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:23.200]  and messaging that matters the president said that we will fly our flags at half mast
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:30.440]  until August 8th that's eight eight now I'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:35.360]  but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that's being demonstrated
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:39.960]  by the White House the numbers eight eight are very significant in neo-nazi and white
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:46.400]  supremacy movement oh my god why because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:51.760]  and to them the numbers eight eight together stand for howl Hitler so we're going to be
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:51:01.360]  raising the flag back up at dusk on eight eight that's why Trump's daughter is married
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:06.080]  to an orthodox Jew that's why he moved the embassy back to Jerusalem this is the biggest
[2:51:06.080 --> 2:51:14.920]  load of BS but it's this FBI agent that is invoking this and that is now making the symbol
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:19.880]  that they're taking over every symbol mark passio what do you think's behind it well
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:25.160]  I think symbology is very important to understand and what he's referring to there is gematria
[2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:31.040]  or some type of occult or hidden symbolism exactly you speak extensively how they communicate
[2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:34.800]  with us yeah but it doesn't mean we're into it but but but they're communicating with
[2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:40.080]  it you can't take a pattern patterns are very important to recognize but you can't apply
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:44.000]  them the instances where they don't actually apply you have to apply them where they really
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:48.600]  do apply and I think that is a tremendous stretch it's it's sort of ridiculous what
[2:51:48.600 --> 2:51:54.440]  he's trying to apply it to their will be one thing if Trump was actually a Nazi maybe then
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:52:00.160]  but I mean that's the normal times to take a flag down for what four to seven days so
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:04.440]  true I mean I don't know what to say anymore I just see as you know anybody that doesn't
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:09.520]  agree with the narrative coming out of the authoritarian left is going to be applied
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:14.560]  to Nazi this isn't a communist technique straight out of Stalin's playbook to attack anyone
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:18.800]  that you know opposed to communism that was my next point because there's the leader of
[2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:23.440]  Italy for saying we're nationalists is a Nazi why are they using a Stalinist or Maoist
[2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:29.120]  handbook because to this point it has worked you know the people haven't wised up to it
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:33.800]  they haven't really studied what socialism is they don't understand that it's control
[2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:38.880]  of resources in the hands of the state and and distribution of them as they will see
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:44.000]  fit and that's how they can control people they haven't historically studied communism
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:48.600]  and what it has produced societally so I don't know where we don't know that we haven't
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:54.600]  been through it let me ask you this then because I forgot the question for the break your real
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:52:59.560]  gut level on Trump I mean I think he means well he's done a lot of good we see nationalism
[2:52:59.560 --> 2:53:04.160]  spreading but at the same time I do see the division that they've used him to create it's
[2:53:04.160 --> 2:53:09.700]  not his fault that I agree that there's some larger alchemy going on here I think they
[2:53:09.700 --> 2:53:16.320]  studied it actuarially actuarial studies they want insurance yeah like insurance companies
[2:53:16.320 --> 2:53:22.560]  high level fight financial companies they run a lot of complex variables through supercomputers
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:26.680]  and obviously intelligence agencies do this all the time to predict human behavior through
[2:53:26.680 --> 2:53:32.400]  trends through current trends and you know I think they saw the type of political polarization
[2:53:32.400 --> 2:53:36.480]  that would occur if they allowed Trump to take the presidency and that's why I think
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:42.160]  he was actually put in there I don't necessarily believe that he's evil himself I just think
[2:53:42.160 --> 2:53:47.320]  that he's not enlightened he's not he has to really wake up to a higher level of true
[2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:51.560]  enlightenment and spirituality if he did I think maybe he'd be a motivational force
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:56.440]  for good if he really understood natural law at a deep level so you know that's sort of
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:01.560]  my personal take on that I try to say this what did they think running Hillary because
[2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:04.600]  I know they ran it through supercomputers they really thought she was going to win at least
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:11.960]  one faction but I agree there's another faction that definitely wants us power to come up on
[2:54:11.960 --> 2:54:18.160]  top not even so much for the people it but but it sees us as basically it's like sore
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:24.200]  on it hands out the rings of power but it's got the one held back they ran Clinton because
[2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:30.480]  they knew she would be the totalitarian sprint you know but some factions prefer the totalitarian
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:36.440]  tiptoe as David Ike likes to call it it's getting from you know a state of you know
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:42.280]  alleged freedom to a state of total lockdown in society very slowly so that it's like the
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:47.560]  frog in the boiling plot of a pot you know allegory that if they do it slowly over a
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:52.600]  period of time people won't recognize it and I think what they saw what with the whole
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:59.080]  Clinton versus Trump thing in the last election is it would create such overwhelming polarization
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:04.600]  in society that when the pendulum swings back the other way in a future election they're
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:09.360]  going to be able to take it in the direction that they want in a much let's go further
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:13.080]  down that route because I think that's a I'm not saying that's the current reality but
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:17.600]  that's possibly what's been going on at least at some levels in a possible future being
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:22.760]  looked at Hillary was advised by some of the nastiest Satanist and globalist out there
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:26.640]  who I know don't associate with Trump and don't like him but there are people up even
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:33.280]  above them she kept saying to the network she controlled only give Trump attention and
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:36.600]  ignore everyone else because she thought he was the easiest to beat now she was being
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:41.120]  advised by people that knew damn well he had more caress by this pinkie than she had in
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:49.680]  her whole body and so and then once she finally figured it out by the inauguration or by the
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:57.200]  nomination in July 2016 it was too late but yes there was you call the hand of Providence
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:03.000]  or maybe the black hand of the new order but the definitely there was a hand moving there
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:10.880]  I agree I think they they position this like a chess strategist would position themselves
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:15.800]  several moves ahead and I think again you know I'll reiterate that I think it was really
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:21.680]  done to create this social divide and social polarization that we're seeing political social
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:27.000]  polarization is at an all-time high almost to the point of it feels like a pressure cooker
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:32.200]  out there in society especially in urban environments and I think they saw that that was a very real
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:37.120]  possibility that they could create and that's how these strategists these social engineers
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:42.440]  play their their long-term game it's an amazing time if you can do 50 more minutes we'll take
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:47.800]  some calls you got to go you got to go what's on earth is happening com mark passio I I

[3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:15.520]  take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:17.800]  alex jones a lot of people can say hey we think trump got installed there was massive
[3:00:17.800 --> 3:00:21.120]  election fraud against him i don't think it's bad to ask that question because there's always
[3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:26.720]  different factions and groups but i can tell you nobody's telling me what to say and i've
[3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:30.680]  talked to trump many times and i've gotten information to trump and i've seen him act
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:35.320]  on it and that's why they're pissed as he's really trying to be the president now i agree
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:38.520]  there are people that thought okay let him get in it'll create such a civil war that
[3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:45.000]  will get our hegelian dialectic out of this but i've experienced trump after i talked
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:50.400]  to him go and say word for word the next day i've experienced getting reports from him
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:58.360]  from law firms and you name it and seeing him take action so i think trump overall is
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:02.280]  for real but i think it's legitimate to ask the question how is the power structure going
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:08.160]  to try to use the climate he is creating or they're trying to create with him against
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:16.800]  him for their greater agenda but i have mark i have witnessed trump literally be the president
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:22.560]  actually be in command actually do real things but at the same time sometimes i see him the
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:27.800]  last person he talks to is kind of what he goes with yeah i'm i'm watching his behavior
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:33.560]  cautiously regarding the whole censorship issue i think that's going to be very telling and
[3:01:33.560 --> 3:01:40.120]  i i think like i'm definitely i'm not happy regarding some of the things he said regarding
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:46.240]  gun control and regarding gun control so you know i will watch it cautiously optimistically
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:55.440]  at best i agree okay let's go ahead and talk to what you just mentioned rick in indiana
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:00.440]  rick is concerned about red flag laws in trump go ahead sir yes it's a great honor to speak
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:05.360]  with you alex i again i i am calling about the red flag gun control laws and i would
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:09.480]  say to our great president who's done so much for the american people be careful what you
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:14.920]  ask for president trump the difficulty with these laws is who decides what is mental illness
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:18.680]  it's kind of like who decides what is hate speech on the big tech platform it's the democrats
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:24.200]  they're going to say yeah yeah and it's possible that if enacted and enforced with equal justice
[3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:29.160]  the red flag laws president trump has called for for all u.s. if you're a devil worshipper
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:34.640]  saying i want to murder people in hundreds of places and yeah yeah yeah but they could
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:39.880]  be used to unconstitutionally in president donald j trump's own second amendment rights
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:43.560]  now let me explain that no you're right they've already been saying twenty second amendment
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:47.840]  so yeah the twenty fifth amendment hope this big hope they said they said he's mentally
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:53.600]  ill okay now let's look at this look at the red flags against trump and the warning signs
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:58.520]  there were seventy thousand seven hundred sixty five met mental health professionals
[3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:03.080]  who signed a petition titled mental health professionals declared trump is mentally ill
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:08.000]  and must be removed april twenty first twenty oh my god there's your headlines would red
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:12.800]  flag laws remove trump under the twenty fifth amendment right right april twenty first twenty
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:18.520]  seventeen uk independent newspaper headline reads donald trump has dangerous mental illness
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:24.760]  they psychiatry experts at at the yell conference that listen to what somebody spoke said now
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:30.200]  don't get me wrong trump's a great president and i don't believe any of this but these
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:36.920]  highly decorated distinguished agreed medical experts came out and they said the president
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:42.000]  was paranoid and delusional and it was their ethical responsibility to warn the american
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:48.360]  public about the dangers now let's let's be let's get real i mean when the average guy
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:54.240]  goes in the court okay it's not going to take seventy thousand mental health professionals
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:04:00.360]  if you have one that says that you're mentally ill even if it's totally untrue for any other
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.640]  citizen sure he called it accelerated he called it accelerated due process there's no such
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:09.960]  thing so it's true they're saying red flag law the president under the twenty fifth
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:15.360]  amendment remove it from office and now here he is saying oh look we already have the baker
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:18.480]  acts and other things this guy saying i'm a devil worshiper i want to go to hell i'm
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:23.000]  going to kill a fascist he's an antifa he's saying i'm in a terrorist organization i'm
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:27.680]  going to kill people he certainly could have been examined but no now he does this now all
[3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:31.280]  of us lose our due process and you're right the democrats are saying they want to red
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:36.560]  flag law the presidency with the twenty fifth amendment great point thank you sure passio

[3:05:45.320 --> 3:06:10.920]  head to infowarstore.com today you are listening to an infowars.com frontline report if you
[3:06:10.920 --> 3:06:24.440]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance red flag laws are 25th amendment
[3:06:24.440 --> 3:06:31.280]  remove the president laws the whole psychiatric system is left us run 90% of it the old Soviet
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:36.920]  Union used that to oppress people so here's Trump saying oh yeah we need to get people
[3:06:36.920 --> 3:06:42.160]  under these red flag laws when these guys are running around openly saying what they
[3:06:42.160 --> 3:06:45.920]  are going to do on facebook twitter they are going to kill people with guns and nobody
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:50.360]  stopping them the existing laws deal with that almost all these shooters have been in
[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:54.520]  the psychiatric system and all these drugs so you want to put a book in on what you were
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:55.520]  just talking about.
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:07:01.600]  Yeah I've done two pretty extensive presentations called the true meaning and purpose of the
[3:07:01.600 --> 3:07:05.960]  second amendment in which I break down the second amendment extensively and explain
[3:07:05.960 --> 3:07:11.680]  how the right to keep and bear arms is an essential property of natural law principles
[3:07:11.680 --> 3:07:17.040]  namely the self defense principle and that's why it says shall not be infringed it's very
[3:07:17.040 --> 3:07:24.440]  unambiguous and clear that that is an absolute and any gun control laws are not only unconstitutional
[3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:30.280]  according to you know the constitution itself if you even accept you know constitutionalism
[3:07:30.280 --> 3:07:35.680]  as the supreme law of the land but it's against natural law it is against our own inherent
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:42.840]  right that we have under God's laws to protect ourselves namely from a rogue government that
[3:07:42.840 --> 3:07:46.920]  has gone criminal and is trying to take our rights away that's why it's the right of self
[3:07:46.920 --> 3:07:49.360]  defense should never be infringed in any way.
[3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:52.840]  And that's exactly how you talk to Trump well we'll put an article out we'll put this video
[3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:57.920]  out I guarantee you we'll get to him because Trump knows he's not supposed to look at
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:04.880]  him for so he looks at it daily I'm told hey Mr. President the 25th amendment is a red
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:10.760]  flag law on you so remember due process and and and watch out the Pandora's Boxes you
[3:08:10.760 --> 3:08:11.760]  open here.
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:16.600]  Mark Passio is our guest really well-spoken historical speaker a smart guy on natural
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:21.960]  law not the survival the fittest social Darwinism but the real natural law God's law let's go
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:26.720]  ahead and go to Carlos in Canada then Bill and Chase and Brad we got to move quick here
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:31.400]  Carlos let's talk about the huge situation of the proxy war going on in India taking
[3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:38.840]  back its own country from from Pakistan and from China in my view but Carlos is called
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:41.920]  many times he's a smart caller what do you think?
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:47.320]  Well if you will allow me for a second because your your guest brought up an important point
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:52.320]  this FBI agent that made this association I want to debunk it right off the bat because
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:58.000]  it is really evil for people like that who are really conspirators okay real conspirators
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:03.800]  to do this information on on otherwise uninformed people you could have said very easily if
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:10.960]  you look at the clock right now in Japan it's the 8th Thursday the 8th the 8th in the United
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:19.160]  States will be the 9th on the 7th on the 6th sorry yesterday at 815 in the morning US time
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:31.240]  100,000 people were afflicted at 815 in the morning by nuclear blast 100,000 out of 350,000
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:37.120]  lost their life approximately 80,000 lost it in the first 11 seconds subsequent to that
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:43.760]  the rest were increased to almost half of the population of Hiroshima and Nagasaki so
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:48.560]  he could have spun it that Trump did it to commemorate bombing Japanese precisely and
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:53.200]  if the flag is half mass even if he wasn't intended to be so why don't we look at the
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:58.040]  positive side of things and he lowered them for the Japanese but that they exactly it's
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:03.760]  how they just distort everything instead of just straight messaging that's right also segue
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:11.040]  to that Pakistan and India are nuclear powers right now Pakistan is in no position to fight
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:21.640]  a war with India India is suffering from terrorism being assisted in that area under article 307
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:29.920]  of the Indian Constitution it granted Kashmir powers you know self-governing powers but
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:35.360]  if the governing powers are going to be used to promote terrorism in what is essentially
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:43.600]  a majority Muslim population this will affect all future development in the area especially
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:47.320]  if India is part of the bricks and it's part of I mean you sound like you're an informed
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:53.720]  on this but under that agreement Indians even that have been refugees can't move back if
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:59.120]  they're not basically Muslims that's outrageous that's right so it will be stabilizing it
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:05.800]  will be a head-to-head nose-to-nose confrontation but these are nuclear powers they're they're
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:11.000]  grown-up societies they're not foolish and I think you know again to these conspirators
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:17.760]  be careful because we're here trying to assess the truth not not not to engage in in fanciful
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:24.280]  thinking and in this case we pray that you know wiser people guided people not guided
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:30.000]  missiles will be the the ruling class in this area of the world because I think if we don't
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  we will be making very foolish mistakes I talk to your listeners like I would talk to
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:39.080]  my family you know and and I mean with all respect okay information is power and info
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:45.080]  wars is information challenging ignorance that's the way I see it well you're always
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:49.840]  a great caller Carlos a smart guy most experts agree this is the place of World War three
[3:11:49.840 --> 3:11:53.600]  or World War four if you call attack at start Mark Pascoe what do you think about the situation
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:59.960]  in cashmere it's a big deal I think that all of the globalists right now want to create
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:05.120]  as much geopolitical instability as possible that's part of their long-term plan of divide
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:12.840]  and conquer so you know it's not so much to analyze the very particulars of every single
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:17.520]  situation I agree it's all part of a larger proxy war their long-term thinking is what
[3:12:17.520 --> 3:12:22.120]  we really have to understand is that they want to create chaos out of which they can
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:28.320]  come in and then impose their predetermined solution of that chaos that's why they want
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:34.080]  geopolitical stability in all different regions of the world but again the people have that
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:41.360]  like the caller said very very well that this is about knowledge versus ignorance and an
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:46.200]  ignorant people can never be a free people Thomas Jefferson basically said that that
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:51.640]  you know if people expect to be ignorant and free simultaneously in a state of civilization
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:13:00.360]  they expect what never has been and what never will be that's right so Carlos you're at smart
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:04.560]  Bill Bill in Las Vegas you're on the air go ahead hey Alex the last time you had Lord
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:09.240]  Moncton on he said something that kind of struck a chord with me he said that the hell
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:14.480]  was starting to bloom on its own because of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:20.640]  and if you go back watch quantum of solace the second Daniel Craig James Bond film again
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:26.520]  it was all about control of water and it was control of water by a world-renowned developer
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:32.840]  of green technology Dominic Green and if you put that together with the last 10 or so minutes
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:38.280]  of the big short what was the guy who made the most money off the housing crisis can
[3:13:38.280 --> 3:13:45.160]  invest in next water control of carbon dioxide even goes up a little bit plants need half
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:49.920]  as much water on average right yields massively explode so they're really pissed that's why
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:55.480]  Soros and all of them are doing this thing to try to reduce water with the now declassified
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:13:59.960]  massive geoengineering project hey what do you make of that mark passio how they're just
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:06.120]  admitting now that oh yeah we are spraying the atmosphere I've been following the geoengineering
[3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:14.200]  agenda for over 20 years now and they are absolutely trying to affect the not only the atmosphere
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:20.480]  but the soil which these chemicals that they're spraying from these tanker planes come down
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:25.640]  to the earth go into the soil alkalis it because they're largely comprised of metals from the
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:30.240]  alkaline earth metal group on the period I worry Monsanto's got seeds it'll still grow
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:38.760]  in that oh sure you know so they want to affect the new nutrient quality and content of our
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:44.360]  food and that will weaken people by we're almost out of time I gotta have Mark back thank you
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:51.360]  Bill Brad in Texas real fast go ahead Brad hey Alex I wanted to say real quick I really
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:56.360]  agree with what your guest is saying because as a matter of fact I'm an orthodox Jew and
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:01.760]  I do Kabbalah classes every night and we discuss everything that you and the guest are talking
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:08.000]  about so I mean you guys sounded just like my rabbi Kabbalah is one of the traditions
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:12.320]  that I've studied for a number of years and I break it down on my show what on earth is
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:17.480]  happening quite often I actually just went through a series where I compared Kabbalah
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:22.360]  and Kabbalistic teachings to the teachings of the tarot so I get into spiritual teachings
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:26.960]  like that and if it's used properly and properly understood it's a powerful force for understanding
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:34.480]  natural law I mean common sense is is is universal the differences is the priest class and the
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:38.200]  church over people are trying to throw I'm out of time Brad I'm out of time chase the
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:41.960]  Patriot I apologize I'm trying to get to everybody Mark Passio what on earth is happening.com

[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:09.560]  world's history this is a digital AI enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:20.960]  info wars dot com this is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr president
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:28.480]  we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as a dominant
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:35.680]  independent anti-war pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization so they thought
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:41.560]  the first they come for Alex Jones then when people say okay take him off the air everyone
[3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:46.360]  else like dominoes would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than
[3:18:46.360 --> 3:18:50.760]  ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:56.080]  can take us down they'll take everybody else down before I started working at info wars
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:19:01.480]  I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and enforce dot com but also the products at info wars
[3:19:01.480 --> 3:19:05.560]  store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is
[3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:10.720]  the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now I remember when Alex first
[3:19:10.720 --> 3:19:16.000]  started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomeres support
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:21.160]  with your dna so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:26.520]  can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so I started looking
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:32.400]  into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:36.920]  I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomeres
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:43.280]  support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite
[3:19:43.280 --> 3:19:47.960]  supplement I get excited when dna force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so
[3:19:47.960 --> 3:19:57.960]  you should take advantage of 50% off dna force plus at info wars store dot com you're listening
[3:19:57.960 --> 3:20:27.400]  to the Alex Jones show I didn't get to a bunch of it I think I think I'm just going to stay

[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:15.640]  this piece though Robert Barnes was on national television our lawyer and he did fall suit
[3:21:15.640 --> 3:21:19.760]  against the Covington folks that did that he told me privately this other suits going
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:23.560]  to be dismissed and I'm not going to tell you what he told me but he was dead on let's
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:28.080]  just say a lot of stuff going on but his real suits have been filed we've got our suits
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:32.000]  getting filed very soon we're about a month behind but that was a month ago it's it's
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:35.680]  next week of the week after and we're not litigious but it's it's it's got to be done
[3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:39.760]  and that's why our fight is your fight we need financial support because we're swinging for
[3:21:39.760 --> 3:21:42.880]  the fences here I don't know how it's going to end but if they want to fight they're
[3:21:42.880 --> 3:21:47.440]  going to get one but here he was so I saw this PC he put on Twitter a few hours ago
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:52.840]  I said why don't we add video for folks so they can see what he's talking about being
[3:21:52.840 --> 3:21:58.280]  true so we've just augmented him live on this television program here it is when we
[3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:03.560]  say Google manipulation I mean what exactly does that mean Tulsi says that Google didn't
[3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:07.880]  run her ads after the first in debate at a time when she was trending Google said that
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:12.560]  was a mistake as we mentioned but give us the sways that Google can in fact manipulate
[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:18.160]  to the elections so what happens is Google basically manipulates which stories show up
[3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:21.680]  so I'll give you a real live time example of how that's happening right now people at
[3:22:21.680 --> 3:22:28.280]  home could go and search say Alex Jones prominent info wars dot com a media broadcaster a big
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:33.000]  on on the political right and with swing political constituencies if you go to duck duck go or
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:37.760]  you go to Bing and you search Alex Jones you'll find info wars in a mix of articles if you
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:41.920]  go to Google you won't even find his main broadcasting station info wars instead you'll
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:46.400]  just find a bunch of negative hit pieces so this is just the little way they can do so
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:50.000]  Alex Jones influences maybe three to four percent of the vote but that can be enough
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:53.480]  to swing the elections in the upper Midwest they could do the same thing as the other
[3:22:53.480 --> 3:22:58.080]  people who are amplifying Donald Trump or their conservative message or a Tulsi Gabbard
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:23:03.040]  and her anti-war anti-established message they can do it to anybody anywhere anyplace
[3:23:03.040 --> 3:23:08.600]  any time because right now there have been no legal remedies for this true election meddling
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:12.280]  between big tech and big media when they collude together.
[3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:16.760]  That is powerful we're going to put that up on info wars dot com sorry Mike I said I was
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:21.240]  throwing it to you then I took over go ahead my friend that's pretty powerful info no just
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:25.640]  saying that that was attorney Robert Barnes info wars attorney really explaining exactly
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:31.560]  how Google can control the outcomes of elections with selective mental focus I didn't mean to
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:36.560]  take it from you there Alex but you know selective mental focus is how Google will try to steal
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:42.160]  the next election and so what they're going to do is they're going to encourage Democrats
[3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:47.680]  to go out and vote but not not conservatives so anyway I've got a lot lined up here Alex
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:53.800]  are you should I just jump right yes sir you take over my friend okay all right it's great
[3:23:53.800 --> 3:23:58.440]  to join you welcome info warriors to the the Mike Adams segment of the fourth hour here
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:02.360]  on the Alex Jones show I really appreciate all your support and your support of info
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:08.480]  wars store and also know that I always come prepared when I do this show which is roughly
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:14.320]  about once a week or so I always come prepared because I want you to understand what's coming
[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:19.120]  I do a lot of deep analysis and looking at trends and looking at the playbook of what
[3:24:19.120 --> 3:24:23.280]  globalists are doing and today I'm going to give you I think a lot of practical information
[3:24:23.280 --> 3:24:28.360]  about what you can do to prepare for what's coming but first the analysis of where this
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:34.920]  is going now red flag laws let me talk about that for a second Trump is at least voicing
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:40.520]  some support for red flag laws but that might just be you know saying he's supporting it
[3:24:40.520 --> 3:24:47.480]  now but he won't really sign a bill on that nevertheless the idea of a red flag law is
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:55.160]  so incredibly dangerous to our republic for this very reason once it is passed either
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:25:01.760]  at a state level or a federal level if it is passed leftists will claim that anybody
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:07.400]  who wants to own a gun is mentally unstable and therefore anybody who wants to own a gun
[3:25:07.400 --> 3:25:11.640]  should not be allowed to own a gun because of red flag laws so you see this is a catch
[3:25:11.640 --> 3:25:16.320]  22 if you want to own a gun you're obviously mentally unstable and should not be allowed
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:19.600]  to own a gun and the only people that should be allowed to own guns or people who don't
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:27.080]  want to own guns this will be the talking point of the delusional left but I say we
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:34.600]  the people should have red flag laws for journal terrorists why can't we remove from power
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:39.960]  through some red flag means a journalist or so-called journalist that goes out there and
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:44.800]  lies and says that all Trump supporters are white supremacists or that all white people
[3:25:44.800 --> 3:25:51.720]  are bad or that all gun owners are bad those people are abusing their positions of power
[3:25:51.720 --> 3:25:56.960]  in a dangerous way and if they're saying that gun owners should have their guns taken away
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:01.960]  shouldn't journal terrorists who are pushing hatred and pushing violence and celebrating
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:06.600]  antifa shouldn't they lose their platform I mean really if we're going to have red flag
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:11.400]  laws here let's go after those who are the most dangerous in society and that's not
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:16.880]  law abiding gun owners who are just they just want self-defense against violence they want
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:22.640]  to stop violence but journal terrorists i.e. these radical left-wing journalists they want
[3:26:22.640 --> 3:26:28.400]  to promote violence so if we're going to have red flag laws let's go after those who are
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:35.960]  actually a danger to this society and also Trump says he might support expanded background
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:41.800]  checks okay that's great let's have background checks for all members of congress let's have
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:47.400]  background checks and drug tests and let's look into the backgrounds of people in congress
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:53.280]  who have met with communists who are influenced by communist china let's look at the backgrounds
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:58.320]  of these people and how they've been radicalized to hate this country let's look at the background
[3:26:58.320 --> 3:27:03.300]  of ilhan omar because there's a fascinating background of marriage fraud and immigration
[3:27:03.300 --> 3:27:08.400]  fraud and campaign finance fraud let's look at the background of aoc and others you want
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:12.880]  background checks all right let's make it universal starting with congress how about
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:17.880]  that drug test those people and by the way while we're at it let's have a red flag law
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:22.040]  that says if you're if you have Alzheimer's or dementia and you're senile and you're on
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:26.920]  Alzheimer's drugs you don't get to serve in congress anymore how about that Nancy Pelosi
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:32.800]  gone Diane feinstein gone if you use if you've lost the capacity to function in a normal
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:39.240]  cognitive way why should you be deciding laws for our country and how about red flag laws
[3:27:39.240 --> 3:27:44.520]  for states that are allowing illegals to vote let's have a red flag law that says if your
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:50.040]  state ie california allows illegals to vote in elections then your electoral college votes
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:56.160]  don't count that's right eliminate california from the electoral college until they have
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:28:02.560]  voter id laws so that only legal american citizens can vote in their elections we should
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:07.060]  also nullify california senators and members of congress because they were elected by illegals
[3:28:07.060 --> 3:28:14.400]  voting with the advocacy of the state of california now of course i'm kidding about a little bit
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:18.840]  of that it's never going to happen but that's the argument here you want to have red flag
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:25.640]  laws you want to have background checks okay let's background check democrats and their
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:31.200]  corruption let's have red flag laws against the journal terrorists and the corrupt criminals
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:36.280]  in the deep state let's make it really universal don't just target conservatives and trump
[3:28:36.280 --> 3:28:40.840]  supporters let's have laws and background checks that affect all these people who are
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:45.840]  trying to destroy america much more straight ahead here on the alex jones show this is

[3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:45.000]  in this fight we're being used by god you're being used by god this is providence so i
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:51.000]  salute you and i thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:55.080]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:30:59.080]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:02.720]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago
[3:31:02.720 --> 3:31:06.200]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about
[3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:09.920]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:13.360]  on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like
[3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:16.680]  hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:19.600]  to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work
[3:31:19.600 --> 3:31:24.320]  and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:30.280]  claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement
[3:31:30.280 --> 3:31:33.760]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then
[3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:38.040]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:41.720]  to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs
[3:31:41.720 --> 3:31:45.640]  work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want
[3:31:45.640 --> 3:31:51.240]  you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five
[3:31:51.240 --> 3:31:57.920]  three three one three nine robert barnes what is big tech become a big tech or big babies
[3:31:57.920 --> 3:32:01.480]  that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[3:32:01.480 --> 3:32:05.400]  of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades
[3:32:05.400 --> 3:32:09.440]  and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent
[3:32:09.440 --> 3:32:12.640]  free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public in the audience that
[3:32:12.640 --> 3:32:17.480]  care about this has to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:21.320]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent
[3:32:21.320 --> 3:32:25.280]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:28.720]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the
[3:32:28.720 --> 3:32:33.600]  info or his audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world
[3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:38.120]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of
[3:32:38.120 --> 3:32:42.520]  an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working
[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:46.240]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then
[3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:50.040]  the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[3:32:50.040 --> 3:32:57.360]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what you just saw you're
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:18.760]  listening to the alex jones show you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones
[3:33:18.760 --> 3:33:27.440]  show with mike adams joe biden says he's coming for your guns he wants federal agents to go
[3:33:27.440 --> 3:33:34.240]  door to door and confiscate your legal firearms at gunpoint this came out during an interview
[3:33:34.240 --> 3:33:41.680]  with cnn's anderson cooper today and he said bingo when anderson cooper said you mean you
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:46.520]  want federal agents basically to go door to door and confiscate guns i mean i'm paraphrasing
[3:33:46.520 --> 3:33:50.680]  that's essentially what he said and joe biden says yes that's exactly what he wants so
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:57.160]  let's have no illusions the democrats if any of them get into power they are planning to
[3:33:57.160 --> 3:34:03.080]  go door to door essentially with guns in your face either shooting you or arresting you
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:08.920]  or maybe just mass executing you that's what the democrats seem to want if you don't turn
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:14.360]  in your guns your legal guns meanwhile the criminals will have all the guns you know
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:17.560]  in the world because of course they don't follow the laws and they're not going to turn
[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:24.440]  them in and so on and so forth so this is at the same time that leftists are now posting
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:30.440]  posters and flyers in new york city now that call for death camps for trump supporters
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:35.560]  death camps for trump supporters so these two things go together and by the way those
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:40.800]  flyers have been posted on the vehicles of a gop staffer that has now been reported i
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:44.960]  don't have the name of that staffer but that just came out a few minutes ago before i went
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:50.880]  on the show here live so of course they want to put you in death camps but to do that they
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:56.560]  have to take your guns first right because of course the radical left is following in
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:02.280]  the footsteps of adolf hitler and as you know if you've studied history at all you know
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:07.600]  that adolf hitler passed a gun control act i think i think it was 1933 it was the big
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:12.880]  gun control act that he passed to take away guns from his political enemies making it
[3:35:12.880 --> 3:35:20.200]  all the easier to round them up and put them on the railroad cars and ship them off to
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:27.840]  concentration camps and zyclon b you know gas ovens and that's exactly what democrats
[3:35:27.840 --> 3:35:36.080]  the radical leftists want to do to trump supporters in america today so have have no illusions
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:42.800]  you're not just fighting for a political outcome here if you support trump and you support
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:47.400]  the constitution you support the bill of rights you're not just fighting for a political situation
[3:35:47.400 --> 3:35:53.280]  you are at this point from this day forward you are fighting for your very life you are
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:59.920]  fighting for your survival and by fighting i mean i mean defending america defending
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:08.000]  your life defending your right to speak you are fighting for your right to exist and note
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:17.200]  that twitter has now allowed a former cnn journalist to call for the eradication of
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:24.800]  all trump supporters along with the conway there and twitter thinks there's no problem
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:32.600]  with that quote the eradication of all trump supporters now think about this if you say
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:37.040]  if you were to switch that around let's just say you called for the eradication of all
[3:36:37.040 --> 3:36:41.960]  obama supporters or the eradication of all transgenders let's say oh my gosh you would
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:46.920]  be accused of massive hate speech and genocide you would be the worst person in the world
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:52.920]  there'd be stories about you nationwide but if you call for the eradication of trump supporters
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:59.160]  you are celebrated by twitter you are celebrated by facebook you are celebrated by google which
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:06.520]  just proves that the radical left has become now in favor of death camps they are in favor
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:11.560]  of death camps they want death camps for all trump supporters they are openly calling for
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:16.840]  it this is a former cnn journalist that's openly calling for this eradication this is
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:21.520]  what they want and joe biden says they're going to go door to door and put guns in your
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:25.880]  faces with federal agents and they're going to essentially either take your guns or shoot
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:33.000]  you in the process this is no longer just a guess of what the democrats want this is
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:37.600]  their game plan and they now openly admit it i'm going to give you a couple of practical
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:44.840]  things here that you can do so if they come for your guns then the government has become
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:50.160]  an orwellian tyrannical authoritarian society and according to the founding fathers it is
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:56.720]  your duty to resist that tyranny in fact to overcome that tyranny to defeat that tyranny
[3:37:56.720 --> 3:38:02.560]  that is your duty as an american and there are some ways to do that that you can start
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:09.000]  to prep right now using legal means i'm going to cover a couple of those real quick here
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:14.120]  it is legal in almost everywhere in america to manufacture your own firearm for your own
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:19.280]  personal use and for your self defense and some of you may recognize this right here
[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:27.000]  this is a polymer 80 this is a shell of a polymer 80 handgun that you can you can purchase
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:34.400]  this polymer 80 shell and just using a drill a drill bit you can drill the holes in here
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:40.560]  for the pins this is basically a glock clone and then using a drill press just a simple
[3:38:40.560 --> 3:38:45.960]  drill press you drill off a few parts and you are manufacturing your own handgun and
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:52.800]  then you assemble it using a glock slide and glock slide parts and you have yourself a
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:58.840]  legal pistol and you can use this for self defense you can own it yourself you can make
[3:38:58.840 --> 3:39:03.800]  as many of these as you want for yourself you can't sell them to others obviously you
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:08.600]  you can't give them to others but you can make them for yourself it's legal almost everywhere
[3:39:08.600 --> 3:39:13.720]  but of course check your local laws i always encourage you to keep it legal now you should
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:19.560]  be doing this right now i've done this myself it works very well and here's a tip when you
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:24.760]  do that the gun won't cycle very well at first because the parts are quite tight so you're
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:30.920]  going to need this a mag magnesium and aluminum polish and what you do with this polish is
[3:39:30.920 --> 3:39:37.840]  you kind of you kind of smother this polish in the rails where the rails the glock slide
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:42.560]  has rails you know they go on the polymer frame you put this polish in there and then
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:48.080]  you fire about 20 30 40 rounds through there and what's happening is the 9 millimeter rounds
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:55.160]  are cycling the slide and polishing that down giving it that broken in kind of function
[3:39:55.160 --> 3:40:00.680]  clean off the polish you clean off the gun and then you now have a a functioning pistol
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:05.960]  after watching you're also seeing on screen there the defense distributed ghost gunner
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:12.920]  which is a system that can be used to automate the manufacture of these polymer 80 pistols
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:20.720]  as well as ar 15 receivers now i've used the ghost gunner for both functions i own
[3:40:20.720 --> 3:40:25.320]  a ghost gunner i think it's great and defense distributed by the way i think sent an email
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:32.600]  out this morning saying that they only have 120 of those machines left for for sale here
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:37.320]  in this year so there's not a lot of those machines available if you want one you might
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:41.840]  want to get one now because they're gonna be impossible to get but i've owned one for
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:46.880]  quite some time i've used that ghost gunner to work on the polymer 80 pistols but i found
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:51.920]  it's actually easier just to use a drill press for the pistols when it comes to aluminum
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:41:00.920]  ar 15 lowers as they're called or lower receivers the ghost gunner works very very well now
[3:41:00.920 --> 3:41:05.040]  i've been able to make it work with anodized lowers most people think it only works with
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:10.640]  raw aluminum but that's not true you can use it with anodized lowers all you have to do
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:19.000]  is dremel off six areas of that lower receiver and the six areas of the areas where the bit
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:24.280]  of that machine makes contact with the receiver to complete a circuit of conductivity that's
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:29.520]  how it it knows the x y and z positions of your lower receiver so that it can drill the
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:34.640]  pinholes you know the trigger a hole and you know everything in the appropriate place so
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:38.800]  you can put the trigger group in there and so on and it works great i'm telling you the
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:43.440]  ghost gunner work it's fantastic the reason i mentioned both of these things the polymer
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:52.600]  80 and the ghost gunner is because this is a legal way to manufacture firearms that are
[3:41:52.600 --> 3:42:00.200]  not on anybody's books somewhere and again follow all your local laws i always do i don't
[3:42:00.200 --> 3:42:04.840]  own any illegal weapons i don't own any automatic weapons nothing like that i keep it all legal
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:09.440]  but the founding fathers gave you the right to do this you should exercise those rights
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:14.720]  so that if joe biden god forbid were elected president and he were to send federal agents
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:19.680]  to your door and they put a gun in your face and say give us all your guns and you were
[3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:24.240]  forced to do that well you give them the guns they know about and then you keep the guns
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:28.960]  they don't because guess what the founding fathers already gave us permission to defeat
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:33.680]  to tyranny and you're going to need legal firearms in order to get that done if it goes
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:38.880]  to that point so follow the law but be prepared make sure that you have the gear that you
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:43.880]  need to defend your nation against tyranny much more straight ahead this is mike adams
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:54.600]  here on the alex jones show we'll be back after this break the globalist are hyper
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:42:59.400]  competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:03.720]  own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[3:43:03.720 --> 3:43:08.360]  gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods now we're fighting them
[3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:12.360]  hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one

[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:19.440]  to the alex jones show waging war on corruption it's alex jones with mike adams i have the
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:25.440]  name now at the g o p representative in new york whose staffers have been targeted with
[3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:34.760]  those death camp posters and flyers that g o p rep is named lee zeldin of new york republican
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:40.440]  new york and staff members are having their homes and cars targeted with death camps for
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:47.960]  trump supporters flyers so this is yet another indication of the radicalization of the lunatic
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:53.640]  left and how their agenda which they used to try to hide is now right out in the open
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:59.160]  this is really a milestone day where joe biden says yes he's going to send armed federal
[3:47:59.160 --> 3:48:05.760]  agents to your house door to door to take your guns at gunpoint and then a g o p rep
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:11.640]  in in new york has staffers you know threatened with death camps so it's time to ask yourself
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:17.660]  a question the question is if for some reason joe biden were to become president or some
[3:48:17.660 --> 3:48:21.360]  other democrat because of course google is trying to steal the election is going to be
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:28.280]  massive voter fraud in places like california new york are you willing to lay down your
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:35.600]  arms and go to a left wing death camp i'm serious it's time to ask yourself this question
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:40.680]  because if your answer is that you don't want to rock the boat and you just want to go along
[3:48:40.680 --> 3:48:45.160]  and get along then you might as well of course i don't mean this literally but you might as
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:48.160]  well just you know kill yourself right now because that's what they're going to do to
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:56.240]  you that's what they're going to do they want you dead so if they come for your guns understand
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:49:00.960]  that they are the criminals that they are violating the law of the land that they are
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:07.960]  inviting they are violating the second amendment and it is your job to say no no we will not
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:16.200]  go along with your third rike regime your death camps your zycon b gas chambers we're
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:19.760]  not going to give you our guns so that you can then come back and murder all of us which
[3:49:19.760 --> 3:49:23.280]  is exactly what the left wants to do i mean they put out a new you see that trailer that
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:27.920]  new movie where they're just running around hunting trump supporters and killing them
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:32.000]  i think and the netflix has a new series called dear white people that just basically says
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  all white people are kkk members and races and implies they all need to be killed i mean
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:44.160]  this is this is becoming dangerously insane but that's exactly the point and let me tell
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:48.600]  you the big secret about what the globalists and the left wing media are trying to do they're
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:54.440]  trying to get you a conservative or a trump supporter they're trying to get you to shoot
[3:49:54.440 --> 3:50:00.880]  first because they know what i've told you many times that in the coming civil war whoever
[3:50:00.880 --> 3:50:08.000]  shoots first loses they want to drive you to the point of you carrying out a mass shooting
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:12.280]  and i don't mean like a mass shooting run by an fbi recruiting some person to go shoot
[3:50:12.280 --> 3:50:15.640]  up some retail establishment because they're going to do that of course as many times as
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:22.200]  they can i'm talking about they want to drive you a real conservative they want to drive
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:26.960]  you to a mass shooting because they want to drive you crazy they want to weaponize you
[3:50:26.960 --> 3:50:32.920]  they want to get you angry and get you to act your job is to not initiate violence do
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:37.560]  not initiate violence even when you're manufacturing your own firearms for self defense like i covered
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:44.840]  in the last section that is to defend yourself that is to stop violence not to start violence
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:50.400]  not to initiate violence whoever shoots first loses they're trying to whip you up into that
[3:50:50.400 --> 3:50:55.240]  condition now if they can't do that if they can't get a bunch of conservatives to open
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:51:00.760]  fire first then they're going to stage it themselves so i would expect to see in the
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:06.720]  next big anti-fa gathering guess what going to be possibly a false flag event that would
[3:51:06.720 --> 3:51:11.440]  target and kill a whole lot of anti-fa people to be blamed on a conservative because they
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:17.480]  can't get conservatives to do that organically so they have to fake it i mean real violence
[3:51:17.480 --> 3:51:21.800]  fake narrative they have to whip it up they have to pretend you know or they they have
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:25.840]  an mk ultra person or a sock puppet person or what have you you know the story you know
[3:51:25.840 --> 3:51:30.280]  you know how this works but they're going to have to try to pretend that conservatives
[3:51:30.280 --> 3:51:36.360]  are opening fire now as all of this is is happening but the goal of the radical left
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:41.800]  is to burn this country down this is what they want mass violence on the streets of
[3:51:41.800 --> 3:51:47.160]  america they want people to kill each other they want blood running in the streets they
[3:51:47.160 --> 3:51:51.880]  want the economy to melt down they want the rule of law to collapse this is what they
[3:51:51.880 --> 3:51:57.440]  want because the left is so dangerous and so radical and so unhinged that in their
[3:51:57.440 --> 3:52:02.880]  minds they've decided hey if they can't run it they're going to burn it down you understand
[3:52:02.880 --> 3:52:07.160]  they want to burn this country down or rule it what are the other that you know they're
[3:52:07.160 --> 3:52:11.960]  fine either way they want to rule it like the globalist rule you know mexico they want
[3:52:11.960 --> 3:52:17.100]  to have the ruling elite and the impoverished disarmed masses with a bunch of drug cartels
[3:52:17.100 --> 3:52:22.720]  paying off the corrupt officials you know to the the traffic narcotics and traffic human
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:27.000]  children and you know whatever else they're doing across the border which is all sick
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:33.640]  stuff but if they can't have that if there's a country that's that's anything resembling
[3:52:33.640 --> 3:52:40.160]  freedom they want to burn it down and that is their goal so what they're doing now think
[3:52:40.160 --> 3:52:45.680]  about how they're blaming guns and they're calling for red flag laws but they won't look
[3:52:45.680 --> 3:52:50.400]  at the causes of so-called mental illness they try to blame mental illness but they
[3:52:50.400 --> 3:52:58.800]  never mention what SSRI drugs anti-depressant drugs which are the true cause of mental illness
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:04.840]  in so many of these young shooters in fact SSRI drugs have been linked to nearly every
[3:53:04.840 --> 3:53:09.960]  mass shooting in the last 30 years not a hundred percent of them but the vast majority and
[3:53:09.960 --> 3:53:16.000]  it's either young males who are either on those drugs or have recently stopped using
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:21.360]  them and then they suffer from side effects that include suicidal thoughts and thoughts
[3:53:21.360 --> 3:53:25.240]  of carrying out violence and by the way there's something that Trump desperately needs to
[3:53:25.240 --> 3:53:30.600]  know I don't have all the technical details on this yet but there is there is a genetic
[3:53:30.600 --> 3:53:38.840]  difference in young white males where they are unable to break down some of these SSRI
[3:53:38.840 --> 3:53:42.760]  drugs or similar medications they're unable to break them down because they're lacking
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:48.680]  a certain enzyme and because of this those drugs have a heightened response in certain
[3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:54.600]  individuals that have this particular genetic predisposition so how do we really solve that
[3:53:54.600 --> 3:54:02.120]  problem it's very simple you do genetic testing before you put people on anti-depressant drugs
[3:54:02.120 --> 3:54:05.280]  that's it's a simple thing you do genetic testing first you make sure they don't have
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:10.520]  this genetic difference maybe you call it a defect but you can't put people on SSRI
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:15.400]  drugs if they have this genetic difference because then their brains go crazy and then
[3:54:15.400 --> 3:54:18.880]  they think that they're playing out a video game you know like the Columbine shooters
[3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:22.640]  they think they're in an artificial reality in many cases and they're carrying out this
[3:54:22.640 --> 3:54:27.280]  shooting and their minds is not even real and when they come down off the drugs they're
[3:54:27.280 --> 3:54:32.800]  shocked and surprised at what happened because it wasn't even their conscious will to do
[3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:39.120]  what they have been caught doing on camera in some cases so SSRI drugs we've got to have
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:44.560]  a real discussion in this country about pharmaceuticals and about the mass diagnosis especially of
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:51.360]  young males with psychiatric disorders ADHD you know give me a break there's nothing wrong
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:56.240]  with the brains of most of these kids until they get put on these psychiatric drugs and
[3:54:56.240 --> 3:55:00.840]  then when they turn into mass shooters because the psych drugs have been combined with the
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:05.120]  hatred of the left-wing media what does the radical left say oh it's the fault of the
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:11.520]  guns no no wait wait a second wait a second maybe leftists have never looked at a gun
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:15.120]  but a gun has a trigger that has to be pulled by a finger right you have to pull it with
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:20.120]  a finger the finger is attached to the arm the arm is attached to the shoulder shoulder
[3:55:20.120 --> 3:55:25.200]  is attached to the torso through the neck attached to the brain right oh the brain makes
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:31.520]  the decision to pull the trigger and the brain is on psychiatric drugs in so many cases
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:36.800]  with these young shooters that's the core issue here there's no finger that that pulls
[3:55:36.800 --> 3:55:42.120]  a trigger on its own without the brain being involved and if you don't believe me you know
[3:55:42.120 --> 3:55:47.280]  go go look around there are no headless shooters in the world headless mass shooters oh my
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:52.720]  god it's a zombie fest it's a horror movie the headless shooter no doesn't exist there
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:58.960]  are also no guns that break into walmart stores and shoot themselves you don't see guns running
[3:55:58.960 --> 3:56:04.800]  down the aisles of the stores oh my god there's an ak-47 with feet it's running the rifle
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:10.040]  is running it's reloading itself look it's aiming and firing itself never happens has
[3:56:10.040 --> 3:56:16.040]  never happened and never will happen it takes a brain to decide to pull the trigger when
[3:56:16.040 --> 3:56:22.600]  that brain is bathed in toxic medication chemicals you get violence because you get a brain that's
[3:56:22.600 --> 3:56:28.840]  dissociated from reality and then those brains are further brainwashed by the left wing media
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:34.800]  so you get massive hatred you get a weaponization of the psychology of the country and you get
[3:56:34.800 --> 3:56:41.520]  the left wing media's successful scythe being run on the entire country they want to weaponize
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:46.240]  people because they hate america they want to burn this country down and most of the
[3:56:46.240 --> 3:56:51.280]  left wing media gets paid by big pharma to promote anti-depressant drugs with advertising
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:56.280]  money so it's starting to make sense now you see how all the pieces really fit together
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:57:01.080]  but of course they say no it's the fault of trump really it's the fault of trump that
[3:57:01.080 --> 3:57:05.480]  all these psych drugs are being handed out like candy to all these young white males
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:11.440]  typically it's the fault of trump that the media is spewing hatred and even calling for
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:16.480]  terrorism and calling for violence how is that trumps fault of course it isn't and tucker
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:20.760]  carlson is right by the way it's a massive media hoax the claim that white supremacy
[3:57:20.760 --> 3:57:25.840]  is taking over this country so hoax just like the russia collusion hoax in any case you're

[3:58:50.040 --> 3:58:53.920]  air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i can tell you
[3:58:53.920 --> 3:58:58.720]  is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately
[3:58:58.720 --> 3:59:03.280]  to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat
[3:59:03.280 --> 3:59:07.920]  him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this
[3:59:07.920 --> 3:59:10.880]  it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other
[3:59:10.880 --> 3:59:14.320]  than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
[3:59:14.320 --> 3:59:18.560]  last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
