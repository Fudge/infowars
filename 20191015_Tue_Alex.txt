[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:34.580]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[01:04.740 --> 01:19.940]  Looks to be two explosions occurring precisely where the two riverside fires broke out that
[01:19.940 --> 01:22.260]  same night.
[01:22.260 --> 01:26.060]  Were these explosions caused by PG&E?
[01:26.060 --> 01:29.740]  Why isn't this a bigger story?
[01:29.740 --> 01:36.660]  On October 8th through Halloween 2017, the Tubbs Fire raged.
[01:36.660 --> 01:40.940]  Over 5,000 structures were leveled to ash.
[01:40.940 --> 01:49.100]  Pacific Gas and Electric, PG&E, was found responsible for 16 of the Tubbs Fires at a cost of over
[01:49.100 --> 01:51.900]  $10 billion.
[01:51.900 --> 01:57.540]  PG&E's response was to claim that the fires will continue, and rather than address the
[01:57.540 --> 02:02.620]  problem, they gave a dire warning that any future damages they are found responsible
[02:02.620 --> 02:05.780]  for will bankrupt them.
[02:05.780 --> 02:11.780]  And just weeks later, on August 31st, California State Legislature passed a utility bailout
[02:11.780 --> 02:17.780]  bill, which would simply pass the buck to the taxpayer and let PG&E off the hook for
[02:17.780 --> 02:20.660]  any future damages.
[02:20.660 --> 02:26.980]  Two months later, on November 8th, the Campfire Wildfire broke out, destroying Cancow and
[02:26.980 --> 02:29.380]  Paradise, California.
[02:29.380 --> 02:36.940]  Over 18,000 structures were destroyed, and at least 85 people lost their lives.
[02:36.940 --> 02:41.860]  After an investigation, it was found that once again, electrical transmission lines
[02:41.860 --> 02:47.220]  owned and operated by PG&E caused the Campfire Wildfire.
[02:47.220 --> 02:51.340]  The deadliest wildfire in California history.
[02:51.340 --> 02:57.500]  But thanks to state legislature, California taxpayers will cover the cost.
[02:57.500 --> 03:03.300]  On October 9th of this year, PG&E cuts off power to half a million homes as a precaution
[03:03.300 --> 03:08.660]  against sparking wildfires in Northern California.
[03:08.660 --> 03:16.660]  A day later, on October 10th, the Saddle Ridge Fire breaks out in Southern California.
[03:16.660 --> 03:22.500]  That night, satellite video shows what looks to be two explosions occurring, precisely
[03:22.500 --> 03:27.020]  where the two riverside fires broke out that same night.
[03:27.020 --> 03:29.340]  But nobody's talking about that.
[03:29.340 --> 03:35.660]  The news is blaming the sandalwood fire on burning garbage.
[03:35.660 --> 03:40.100]  Were these explosions caused by PG&E?
[03:40.100 --> 03:43.380]  Why isn't this a bigger story?
[03:43.380 --> 03:48.980]  My video that reported on the anomalies of the Campfire Wildfire was deleted by YouTube
[03:48.980 --> 03:52.140]  for being inappropriate content.
[03:52.140 --> 03:55.740]  It can still be found at band.video.
[03:55.740 --> 03:59.260]  But what is inappropriate about asking questions?
[03:59.260 --> 04:02.100]  Who is YouTube working for?
[04:02.100 --> 04:07.660]  There are many practical questions to be asked about PG&E, but there is also a very strange
[04:07.660 --> 04:10.540]  nature to these fires.
[04:10.540 --> 04:14.660]  They seem to destroy houses and spare the trees.
[04:14.660 --> 04:19.900]  They jump from house to house, and they jump to the freeway.
[04:19.900 --> 04:25.980]  They melt aluminum alloy and burn houses to powdery ash.
[04:25.980 --> 04:31.020]  The Rothschild Investment Group collects billions of dollars from PG&E.
[04:31.020 --> 04:37.460]  In an age of outcry against corrupt billionaires, why are the Rothschilds and PG&E being left
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.580]  off the hook?
[04:39.580 --> 04:43.820]  For California, be safe and Godspeed.
[04:43.820 --> 05:09.580]  This is Greg Rees reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:09.580 --> 05:15.300]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[05:15.300 --> 05:19.380]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian
[05:19.380 --> 05:22.940]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic
[05:22.940 --> 05:27.860]  immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then
[05:27.860 --> 05:30.020]  meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore?
[05:30.020 --> 05:33.620]  Well, Trump got that, and all these other populace get it.
[05:33.620 --> 05:37.860]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you could say
[05:37.860 --> 05:42.740]  the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[05:42.740 --> 05:45.500]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[05:45.500 --> 05:50.500]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people, and I beg God for
[05:50.500 --> 05:55.900]  the strength and the will to have the discernment to help me part of their defeat.
[05:55.900 --> 06:00.260]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years, and God is delivering because God is
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.260]  great.
[06:01.260 --> 06:03.380]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[06:03.380 --> 06:10.380]  And now let's move forward against the N.W.O.
[06:33.380 --> 06:56.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:56.100 --> 07:08.100]  I am your host, Alex Jones, on this Tuesday, October 15, 2019 global transmission.
[07:08.100 --> 07:19.820]  We are going to lay out stunning information here today for you.
[07:19.820 --> 07:26.860]  There is no doubt that we are in the middle of a deep state globalist coup, and they even
[07:26.860 --> 07:37.540]  admit that they are attempting to remove the president outside of even using impeachment,
[07:37.540 --> 07:49.180]  and they are preparing the general public for that.
[07:49.180 --> 07:57.940]  Now let's think about what that is going to signify and what is going to unfold when they
[07:57.940 --> 08:07.100]  attempt to do that and when they attempt to carry that out.
[08:07.100 --> 08:16.700]  It is on record that they intend to remove President Trump and Vice President Pence and
[08:16.700 --> 08:27.660]  put in Nancy Pelosi, and they admit that she plans to put Hillary Clinton as her vice
[08:27.660 --> 08:36.980]  president, then Nancy Pelosi will resign and we will have President Clinton going into
[08:36.980 --> 08:44.620]  the election next year up against some milk toast cut out Republican like a John McCain
[08:44.620 --> 08:46.820]  that they will run against her.
[08:46.820 --> 08:51.100]  That is why they plan to have Trump gone by this year.
[08:51.100 --> 08:58.020]  By the way, I am going to cut a special report this afternoon that I am going to push like
[08:58.020 --> 09:05.460]  nothing I have ever pushed before that shows CNN, MSNBC, the Atlantic Council, the New
[09:05.460 --> 09:09.860]  York Times, all of them admitting that that is the plan.
[09:09.860 --> 09:19.220]  We have played some of these clips and we have talked about this on air, but folks need
[09:19.220 --> 09:23.340]  to understand that this isn't pipe dreams, they are going for it.
[09:23.340 --> 09:28.420]  Now the good news is they failed in their last attempts to remove the president, but
[09:28.420 --> 09:42.020]  they intend to do whatever it takes this round to get that done.
[09:42.020 --> 09:47.220]  Yes President Trump has called up the Marines to deal with this, and yes there are things
[09:47.220 --> 09:53.740]  we can do to counter it, and yes it is illegitimate and illegal, but they are going to try their
[09:53.740 --> 10:03.980]  best to normalize this action and then to carry it out, and we know the steps they
[10:03.980 --> 10:07.420]  are going to take at every level.
[10:07.420 --> 10:12.460]  We have been on the job, and again I am not bragging when I say this, it is why they want
[10:12.460 --> 10:16.620]  us off the air, why they don't want you sharing the links.
[10:16.620 --> 10:24.900]  We exposed Fiona Hill, the fake mold, the fake whistleblower, two years ago as working
[10:24.900 --> 10:27.420]  for Soros.
[10:27.420 --> 10:31.020]  Over the weekend I shot an emergency report for Band-Aught Video and wrote two articles
[10:31.020 --> 10:38.740]  with Jamie White about how she was going to testify on Monday and was the cover for the
[10:38.740 --> 10:46.860]  other molds, probably John Bolton, and how she wasn't even working at the White House
[10:46.860 --> 10:53.100]  at the time she says all this happened, and that is critical because the leaking is illegal,
[10:53.100 --> 10:54.820]  even though it is fake info they are leaking.
[10:54.820 --> 10:58.820]  So I figured out how they do this, and I specifically laid all this out in the 10 and a half minute
[10:58.820 --> 11:04.660]  report Saturday, and now it is mainstream news, Fox News has picked it up.
[11:04.660 --> 11:10.180]  This dim impeachment witness, Fiona Hill, was not even working in White House at time
[11:10.180 --> 11:19.420]  of call, but was very upset with call, because John Bolton, the neocon, as I said a few weeks
[11:19.420 --> 11:26.460]  ago, is one of the whistleblowers, and now it is all confirmed she testified that Bolton
[11:26.460 --> 11:33.460]  said call the lawyers, put the info out, prepare to bring down Trump, and that is what
[11:33.460 --> 11:38.140]  Trump gets bringing a neocon viper into his midst, and putting it up to his breast like
[11:38.140 --> 11:39.140]  Cleopatra.
[11:39.140 --> 11:44.100]  I mean, it is just, and we screamed, and we yelled, and we freaked out, and they said
[11:44.100 --> 11:49.340]  two years ago, get Jones off the air, he is exposing our operatives in the White House,
[11:49.340 --> 11:56.540]  Trump was lied to, he trusted a general, and McMaster has brought in all these people.
[11:56.540 --> 11:58.260]  And John Kelly went along with all of it.
[11:58.260 --> 12:16.940]  They are a bunch of political career climbers, it is what they do, it is how they operate,
[12:16.940 --> 12:21.980]  and they are making their move, so there is this sense of urgency, because everyone should
[12:21.980 --> 12:26.180]  be very, very urgent right now.
[12:26.180 --> 12:33.100]  They thought they could stop Trump getting into office, then they thought that they could
[12:33.100 --> 12:38.380]  discredit him as a Russian agent and find surely some Russian connection to somebody,
[12:38.380 --> 12:44.220]  to discredit the election, impeach him, and then have Hillary reannounce and run for office
[12:44.220 --> 12:48.780]  and get what she supposedly deserved with that whole crew of deep state, John Brennan,
[12:48.780 --> 12:52.100]  Clapper, and the rest of them staying in power.
[12:52.100 --> 12:58.660]  That had the knot of the neocons, the knot of the whole system.
[12:58.660 --> 13:06.540]  And so we are going to lay it all out, how they intend to take the president out, and
[13:06.540 --> 13:12.060]  then what they are going to do once they remove the president, how they intend to mop up any
[13:12.060 --> 13:15.540]  resistance inside of the United States.
[13:15.540 --> 13:21.140]  But this is real, it is very, very frightening if they get controlled.
[13:21.140 --> 13:27.860]  But here is the good news, these people are criminals, they had been fully exposed just
[13:27.860 --> 13:31.380]  a few years ago, no one believed there was even a deep state, even though I was calling
[13:31.380 --> 13:35.740]  at the deep state 20 plus years ago, the permanent state, the shadow government.
[13:35.740 --> 13:41.060]  These are the terms that came out in the church hearings in the 70s, these are what the establishment
[13:41.060 --> 13:43.820]  calls themselves.
[13:43.820 --> 13:50.820]  And so it is quite a time to be alive, we are going to hit all of this when we come
[13:50.820 --> 13:59.420]  back, and we are going to lay it all out in detail.
[13:59.420 --> 14:04.420]  You have got my commitment to not back down and to not give in to the enemy attacks, but
[14:04.420 --> 14:08.860]  I need you to not back down and you to not give in and you to realize you are not a spectator
[14:08.860 --> 14:15.020]  in this fight, you are in the arena in the great animating contest for liberty, up against
[14:15.020 --> 14:20.860]  true evil that isn't just decay, as the Attorney General said, but is organized destruction
[14:20.860 --> 14:28.300]  of the family, of the individual, of everything decent by a true force of corruption.
[14:28.300 --> 14:29.300]  That's what it is.
[14:29.300 --> 14:33.620]  And from a political level, the chai comms and others just want America out of the way,
[14:33.620 --> 14:39.580]  so they have brought in socially destroying rot that is designed to make us weak and
[14:39.580 --> 14:42.020]  pathetic and stupid and lazy.
[14:42.020 --> 14:46.500]  But there is a spiritual element that is dominant in all of that, obviously.
[14:46.500 --> 14:50.140]  And so we are not going to take our country back without a fight, getting Trump in was
[14:50.140 --> 14:57.220]  just the opening salvo, it was just the beach head.
[14:57.220 --> 15:02.940]  Now the real fight is here, and when I talk about you telling people about the show, about
[15:02.940 --> 15:10.540]  band.video, about the live feeds, about info wars.com, about the articles, about the videos,
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.260]  that's how we get out now.
[15:12.260 --> 15:16.540]  That's how we always got out there, but it's not an uphill battle when you get excited
[15:16.540 --> 15:19.940]  and you decide to take action, you are unstoppable.
[15:19.940 --> 15:23.860]  You fly right over that mountain like an airplane.
[15:23.860 --> 15:28.460]  With God as your navigator, and justice and freedom as your maps.
[15:28.460 --> 15:33.780]  And it's all right here, ladies and gentlemen, all laid out before us so much more today.
[15:33.780 --> 15:37.420]  I was getting ready right up to the start of the broadcast, working on some big breaking
[15:37.420 --> 15:44.060]  stories, and I'm going to get calibrated and focused here as best I can, and we're going
[15:44.060 --> 15:47.260]  to lay out so much that's happened.
[15:47.260 --> 15:50.780]  ABC News obviously got caught in a huge hoax video.
[15:50.780 --> 15:54.580]  They say they regret their error, it wasn't an error, it was on purpose, the president
[15:54.580 --> 15:58.500]  is talking about it, red flag laws are worse than we thought, the uncompacitation has begun
[15:58.500 --> 16:04.220]  nationwide, the old hell's breaking loose, earthquake, huge earthquake, get LA, they
[16:04.220 --> 16:08.340]  say it's probably just a precursor to the big one, stay with us.
[16:08.340 --> 16:13.500]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:13.500 --> 16:17.740]  backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:17.740 --> 16:19.460]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:19.460 --> 16:23.420]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:23.420 --> 16:28.020]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:28.020 --> 16:29.020]  off the grid.
[16:29.020 --> 16:32.900]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.380]  bank of the Mississippi.
[16:34.380 --> 16:38.220]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:38.220 --> 16:41.980]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:41.980 --> 16:46.340]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:46.340 --> 16:51.980]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:51.980 --> 16:57.340]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over a thousand dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton
[16:57.340 --> 16:58.340]  of bonuses too.

[17:08.220 --> 17:13.180]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:13.180 --> 17:16.820]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[17:16.820 --> 17:21.860]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[17:21.860 --> 17:25.420]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:25.420 --> 17:29.900]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:29.900 --> 17:30.900]  across America.
[17:30.900 --> 17:34.820]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:34.820 --> 17:38.500]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[17:38.500 --> 17:39.500]  healthier I feel.
[17:39.500 --> 17:42.140]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:42.140 --> 17:47.300]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[17:47.300 --> 17:49.780]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[17:49.780 --> 18:00.860]  Remember your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online, hbextract.com.

[18:09.340 --> 18:13.300]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller,
[18:13.300 --> 18:14.300]  Chillforce.
[18:14.300 --> 18:16.780]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[18:16.780 --> 18:22.860]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress
[18:22.860 --> 18:24.220]  and relax the patient.
[18:24.220 --> 18:28.540]  L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[18:28.540 --> 18:33.540]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[18:33.540 --> 18:38.100]  GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including
[18:38.100 --> 18:39.780]  nervous system relaxation.
[18:39.780 --> 18:42.980]  GABA is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[18:42.980 --> 18:48.300]  Rhodiola rosea root extract, found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.620]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight
[18:52.620 --> 18:56.100]  against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[18:56.100 --> 19:10.260]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chillforce challenge at m4slive.com.

[20:30.660 --> 20:44.060]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:44.060 --> 20:45.060]  Is this country done?
[20:45.060 --> 20:55.300]  Well, I'm here to tell you, it is done if people don't realize what we're up against.
[20:55.300 --> 21:00.620]  This is a real, globalist operation that sold us up in China that was imploding our borders
[21:00.620 --> 21:05.420]  that was engaging in every form of propaganda and cultural operation to break this nation
[21:05.420 --> 21:07.500]  down and finish it.
[21:07.500 --> 21:12.540]  My God, Mainstream News says America is bad and shouldn't exist, white people are inherently
[21:12.540 --> 21:18.340]  evil, the family is bad, that is taught in colleges.
[21:18.340 --> 21:32.820]  Young children are being sexualized all over the place.
[21:32.820 --> 21:34.260]  And we just sit here and take it.
[21:34.260 --> 21:38.820]  I saw a powerful video last night, one of my friends sent me.
[21:38.820 --> 21:42.580]  This fellow's been on the Info War shows before, he's on our show Thursday.
[21:42.580 --> 21:48.500]  Steve Allen is a pastor, a lay pastor, he has a YouTube site.
[21:48.500 --> 21:49.500]  Think about it.
[21:49.500 --> 21:58.740]  And he put out a video titled, Is This Country Done?
[21:58.740 --> 22:03.540]  And then when he breaks all this down, this is what's really going on.
[22:03.540 --> 22:06.900]  This is what's really happening.
[22:06.900 --> 22:09.420]  And that's just who these people really are.
[22:09.420 --> 22:12.780]  So here is the report.
[22:12.780 --> 22:16.020]  We are at a time of unprecedented deception in this country.
[22:16.020 --> 22:20.020]  If you're a hardworking American that has a job and a family and you take your children
[22:20.020 --> 22:23.980]  to soccer practice or baseball or whatever you do, you probably don't have time to do
[22:23.980 --> 22:28.660]  any research or go online and find out what's really happening to this country.
[22:28.660 --> 22:32.100]  So when things happen, you will believe the lie.
[22:32.100 --> 22:35.940]  You will see the lawlessness happen before your very eyes and you'll think it's all
[22:35.940 --> 22:36.940]  right.
[22:36.940 --> 22:41.620]  If you watch Nightly News, you've been programmed to believe their lies, to believe that everything
[22:41.620 --> 22:46.300]  they say is factual reporting, but it's just the opposite.
[22:46.300 --> 22:50.700]  I said this before in a past video, but it's worth repeating again.
[22:50.700 --> 22:56.060]  What if I told you almost every single thing you've been told since you were a child is
[22:56.060 --> 22:57.260]  nothing but a lie?
[22:57.260 --> 23:01.780]  I know many of you, if not most of you, are thinking, Steve, you're crazy.
[23:01.780 --> 23:03.740]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[23:03.740 --> 23:09.060]  And if I would have had the same conversation with you 15 years ago, you'd be right because
[23:09.060 --> 23:12.860]  I had no clue about what I completely understand now.
[23:12.860 --> 23:18.940]  The deception by the so-called leaders of America goes back so far and is so deep and
[23:18.940 --> 23:22.980]  evil that I hope the American people never have to see at all.
[23:22.980 --> 23:27.980]  But they will see the dark side of those who have control of this country and have had
[23:27.980 --> 23:31.060]  it for decades in a very short time.
[23:31.060 --> 23:36.100]  Up until recently, most Americans have never heard the term deep state or shadow government.
[23:36.100 --> 23:41.580]  And if they did, they thought it was strictly something put out by a conspiracy theorist.
[23:41.580 --> 23:46.220]  By the way, that term conspiracy theorist originated from the CIA.
[23:46.220 --> 23:52.300]  In case you haven't noticed or you've been blinded to see this, this deep state government
[23:52.300 --> 23:56.500]  has been working overtime for the last three years to get rid of Donald Trump.
[23:56.500 --> 24:02.340]  He's been falsely accused of everything and continues to be falsely accused of more lies
[24:02.340 --> 24:04.340]  and fabricated narratives.
[24:04.340 --> 24:11.620]  I did a video less than a week ago about secrecy and lies because they are always the tools
[24:11.620 --> 24:12.620]  they use.
[24:12.620 --> 24:16.860]  And it's becoming clearer every day their next move in an effort to remove Donald Trump
[24:16.860 --> 24:19.380]  and Mike Pence from the White House.
[24:19.380 --> 24:23.500]  You can keep watching the Democratic debates if you want to, but it's almost as frivolous
[24:23.500 --> 24:29.540]  as watching an episode of Seinfeld or Wheel of Fortune because the goal for the deep state
[24:29.540 --> 24:33.900]  is to install Hillary Clinton as president this year.
[24:33.900 --> 24:38.180]  Keep this video and bookmark it and watch and see if this doesn't happen.
[24:38.180 --> 24:42.980]  Pay attention to her beginning to make more and more appearances on late night shows,
[24:42.980 --> 24:46.260]  you know, talk shows and shows like The View.
[24:46.260 --> 24:48.180]  You're going to see more and more of her.
[24:48.180 --> 24:50.820]  How are they going to do this?
[24:50.820 --> 24:54.220]  They plan to bypass the elections altogether.
[24:54.220 --> 24:58.900]  The deep state Democrats are trying to take down America and install Hillary Clinton as
[24:58.900 --> 25:03.300]  president of the United States before the end of this year.
[25:03.300 --> 25:07.820]  Here are the steps the deep state Democrats hope to achieve.
[25:07.820 --> 25:13.860]  Number one, fake an impeachment of President Trump and whip up media hysteria to gaslight
[25:13.860 --> 25:19.500]  the entire nation into thinking Trump is being impeached when it's all an act with
[25:19.500 --> 25:24.380]  no real vote in the house, no legal bearing and no legitimacy.
[25:24.380 --> 25:27.060]  Step two, they'll stage an arrest of President Trump.
[25:27.060 --> 25:31.740]  Vice President Mike Pence and his cabinet members for CNN's cameras to create the visual
[25:31.740 --> 25:35.060]  impression that Trump is guilty of something.
[25:35.060 --> 25:38.780]  After all, why is he in handcuffs?
[25:38.780 --> 25:43.420]  If you've noticed already, everything with the Democrats is theater.
[25:43.420 --> 25:45.520]  Everything is staged.
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.500]  After that, they'll swear in Nancy Pelosi as the president since she's next in line
[25:50.500 --> 25:52.460]  as the speaker of the house.
[25:52.460 --> 25:57.140]  Then Nancy Pelosi will appoint Hillary Clinton as her vice president.
[25:57.140 --> 26:03.300]  Then Nancy will resign as president, making the VP, now Hillary Clinton, the president.
[26:03.300 --> 26:08.580]  Step six, Hillary Clinton then appoints a new vice president, possibly John Brennan,
[26:08.580 --> 26:11.740]  to strengthen the deep state within her administration.
[26:11.740 --> 26:17.900]  From that point on, the mass arrest and executions of all Trump supporters gets authorized by
[26:17.900 --> 26:19.340]  President Hillary.
[26:19.340 --> 26:24.340]  And all businesses and individuals who don't comply with the authoritarian Clinton police
[26:24.340 --> 26:30.380]  state will be literally imprisoned in gulags or executed by Clinton's death squads, which
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.780]  already have plenty of experience from Bill Clinton's Arkansas days.
[26:34.780 --> 26:39.020]  This is how it can all be accomplished before the end of this year.
[26:39.020 --> 26:44.620]  If the Democrats manage to succeed in their insidious, deceptive plans before an American
[26:44.620 --> 26:48.220]  public that has been lied to from the beginning.
[26:48.220 --> 26:51.860]  Of course, the Democrats may be forgetting very important things that will prevent their
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.940]  plan from succeeding.
[26:53.940 --> 26:59.620]  Trump is the commander-in-chief and can order the military police to arrest deep state traitors
[26:59.620 --> 27:02.300]  and hold them for military tribunals.
[27:02.300 --> 27:07.020]  The U.S. Supreme Court now leans conservative and would likely hold emergency hearings on
[27:07.020 --> 27:09.780]  any such attempt by the Democrats.
[27:09.780 --> 27:14.540]  Tens of millions of armed Americans simply won't put up with a political coup run by
[27:14.540 --> 27:16.340]  deep state Democrats.
[27:16.340 --> 27:20.940]  Over one million pro-Trump bikers, truckers and trade workers would probably march on
[27:20.940 --> 27:27.460]  D.C. and flat out carry out citizens' arrests of Democrats and their deep state traitors.
[27:27.460 --> 27:32.020]  Millions of U.S. military veterans and former law enforcement officers would descend upon
[27:32.020 --> 27:35.580]  Washington in defense of the president.
[27:35.580 --> 27:40.940]  The Second Amendment was created exactly for this situation, for the purpose of allowing
[27:40.940 --> 27:47.060]  an armed citizenry, that's us, to engage and defeat a tyrannical government that abuses
[27:47.060 --> 27:48.060]  the rule of law.
[27:48.060 --> 27:52.860]  And God knows they've been doing that from day one of Trump's inauguration.
[27:52.860 --> 27:57.580]  The deep state is overreaching, but because they live in an artificial bubble protecting
[27:57.580 --> 28:02.580]  them with media disinformation, they're underestimating the backlash that will break out if they
[28:02.580 --> 28:05.820]  take out President Trump.
[28:05.820 --> 28:10.060]  Millions of Americans understand that any attempt to impeach Trump is itself an activation
[28:10.060 --> 28:17.140]  moment for an organic uprising that will defend our republic and defeat the deep state Democrats.
[28:17.140 --> 28:23.340]  Be prepared because the Democrats are desperate and they've reached the point where they'll
[28:23.340 --> 28:24.340]  try anything.
[28:24.340 --> 28:29.060]  The New World Order is going to be established when America comes into compliance with the
[28:29.060 --> 28:30.460]  U.N. control.
[28:30.460 --> 28:34.700]  This country's been sold out for decades, and now the globalists and the Luciferians
[28:34.700 --> 28:39.500]  believe it's their time to make the move against America and bring it under the control of
[28:39.500 --> 28:41.500]  the New World Order.
[28:41.500 --> 28:43.460]  Where does this leave you and me?
[28:43.460 --> 28:48.100]  Well, if you're a believer, if you're a true Christian, a follower of Jesus Christ that
[28:48.100 --> 28:53.340]  leaves you in a very similar position as the believers in China or Hong Kong or the Middle
[28:53.340 --> 28:54.340]  East.
[28:54.340 --> 29:00.100]  If you're powerful, the full video is posted up at band.video, Steve Allen on his YouTube.
[29:00.100 --> 29:01.100]  Think about it.
[29:01.100 --> 29:02.100]  Got online.
[29:02.100 --> 29:03.100]  A little bit right back.
[29:03.100 --> 29:05.780]  He joins us Thursday, but I'm going to lay out the next phase, the globalist takeover
[29:05.780 --> 29:07.660]  and how we stop it straight ahead.
[29:07.660 --> 29:12.180]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[29:12.180 --> 29:13.980]  without all the speculation.
[29:13.980 --> 29:19.220]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:19.220 --> 29:23.580]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[29:23.580 --> 29:28.100]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs
[29:28.100 --> 29:30.260]  who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[29:30.260 --> 29:34.900]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:34.900 --> 29:39.420]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[29:39.420 --> 29:45.620]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each
[29:45.620 --> 29:46.620]  month.
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.620]  Don't miss this one.
[29:47.620 --> 29:54.300]  And today call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388.
[29:54.300 --> 29:56.420]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[29:56.420 --> 30:01.780]  Call now 800-600-3388, 800-600-3388.
[30:01.780 --> 30:04.180]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[30:04.180 --> 30:20.340]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[30:20.340 --> 30:24.820]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone.
[30:24.820 --> 30:28.180]  Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser.
[30:28.180 --> 30:31.420]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[30:31.420 --> 30:34.900]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[30:34.900 --> 30:36.980]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[30:36.980 --> 30:39.260]  I suggest Band.video.
[30:39.260 --> 30:43.860]  You will now have Band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[30:43.860 --> 30:44.860]  to stop it.
[30:44.860 --> 30:48.980]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action you can override them,
[30:48.980 --> 30:53.180]  have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[30:53.180 --> 30:57.220]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[30:57.220 --> 31:01.860]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[31:01.860 --> 31:09.500]  Band.video.
[31:09.500 --> 31:14.500]  The globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and decades.
[31:14.500 --> 31:18.980]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover, the censorship, all of it.
[31:18.980 --> 31:23.420]  That's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because
[31:23.420 --> 31:28.060]  they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[31:28.060 --> 31:29.060]  Well, guess what?
[31:29.060 --> 31:32.420]  Thanks to you spreading the word, instead of fastly supporting InfoWars, we're still
[31:32.420 --> 31:37.420]  on the air and we're still fighting, so please keep spreading the word and keep buying the
[31:37.420 --> 31:38.420]  great products.
[31:38.420 --> 31:43.060]  We're running a massive sale right now, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 40 to
[31:43.060 --> 31:44.460]  70% off.
[31:44.460 --> 31:47.260]  It's called the everything must go special.
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.540]  We're selling out of everything.
[31:49.540 --> 31:50.540]  Who knows?
[31:50.540 --> 31:51.540]  We'll even be here in six months.
[31:51.540 --> 31:52.540]  Hopefully we will.
[31:52.540 --> 31:53.540]  Who knows?
[31:53.540 --> 31:54.540]  The country will be here in six months.
[31:54.540 --> 31:58.620]  I just gut level know we need all the funds to go into the future, so we're selling everything
[31:58.620 --> 31:59.900]  out right now.
[31:59.900 --> 32:01.180]  Everything must go sale.
[32:01.180 --> 32:03.540]  InfoWarsStore.com, please visit the store today.
[32:03.540 --> 32:09.180]  Again, it's the everything must go sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:09.180 --> 32:13.500]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars.
[32:13.500 --> 32:19.180]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[32:19.180 --> 32:24.580]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[32:24.580 --> 32:29.740]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[32:29.740 --> 32:30.740]  amazing as well.
[32:30.740 --> 32:36.380]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[32:36.380 --> 32:41.180]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[32:41.180 --> 32:45.460]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize
[32:45.460 --> 32:50.780]  that we're being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists are beginning
[32:50.780 --> 32:55.740]  to lose their war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some major
[32:55.740 --> 33:01.100]  fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all
[33:01.100 --> 33:03.060]  the poison they spray at us.
[33:03.060 --> 33:04.940]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[33:04.940 --> 33:12.300]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[33:12.300 --> 33:19.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:42.300 --> 33:55.980]  There's a lot of scurrying going on behind the scenes.
[33:55.980 --> 34:03.300]  There's a bunch of big articles about Jeff Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, secretly
[34:03.300 --> 34:10.100]  meeting with, quote, conservative leaders, and as soon as I saw that headline yesterday
[34:10.100 --> 34:14.660]  after I'd already gotten off air, I thought, before I read this article, there's one name
[34:14.660 --> 34:22.820]  I know will be on the list, and it was there, Ben Shapiro.
[34:22.820 --> 34:29.060]  Because we know who Ben Shapiro is, he's the never-trumper globalist operative, but I wasn't
[34:29.060 --> 34:36.100]  surprised to see Tucker Carlson on the list, and I haven't reached out to Tucker, and I'm
[34:36.100 --> 34:40.620]  sure it's off-record discussions, and I'm not mad that Tucker would meet with Zuckerberg.
[34:40.620 --> 34:45.220]  I've met with people like that before, and I don't think at the Zuckerberg level, but
[34:45.220 --> 34:50.460]  pretty close to it, and they're off-record discussions, but Tucker just gets more hardcore.
[34:50.460 --> 34:56.260]  Tucker's not going to sell out, and that's why they're coming after it.
[34:56.260 --> 35:04.340]  But the claim that Zuckerberg is hedging his bets with conservatives because Trump might
[35:04.340 --> 35:10.220]  take action is not really what's going on, so I'll give you the inside baseball on this
[35:10.220 --> 35:20.860]  next segment, but it ties into everything that we see in this climate.
[35:20.860 --> 35:29.140]  And I might tell you a Facebook story.
[35:29.140 --> 35:30.940]  I mean, that wasn't an off-record discussion.
[35:30.940 --> 35:37.420]  I guess I could tell that story, because I'm certainly not going to be getting any meetings
[35:37.420 --> 35:40.300]  with Zuckerberg now.
[35:40.300 --> 35:46.780]  That's funny.
[35:46.780 --> 35:53.540]  Right after I got told, oh, you ought to be nice to Facebook.
[35:53.540 --> 35:56.860]  You ought to go meet with some Facebook people in New York, then if you're nice, well, you
[35:56.860 --> 35:57.860]  could meet with, you know.
[35:57.860 --> 36:04.900]  I said, well, with who, and they went, well, you know who, and then all of a sudden, every
[36:04.900 --> 36:09.420]  video I was doing was getting like 5 million views, not even trying, and I went, okay,
[36:09.420 --> 36:11.660]  so this is an example.
[36:11.660 --> 36:16.500]  So I've talked a bunch of crap about Facebook, and they shadow banned me.
[36:16.500 --> 36:18.860]  That was funny, because, I mean, here's the deal.
[36:18.860 --> 36:25.780]  I'm not shaking my tail feather trying to get somebody to buy me as their whore.
[36:25.780 --> 36:32.180]  I'm not trying to have a rich sugar daddy.
[36:32.180 --> 36:38.900]  But I will take money if there's no strings attached, Zuckerberg, anybody else.
[36:38.900 --> 36:47.660]  But you see, I never built infall wars with rich men's money.
[36:47.660 --> 36:51.500]  I mean, I guess Matt Drudge is a wealthy guy, and he's helped infall wars by linking a lot
[36:51.500 --> 36:53.980]  of stories, but they're really interesting stories, and they deserve to be linked to,
[36:53.980 --> 36:57.540]  and I appreciate Matt Drudge being a troll blazer, but that's about the biggest booster
[36:57.540 --> 36:58.540]  we've had.
[36:58.540 --> 37:00.420]  I mean, it's been the audience that's done it.
[37:00.420 --> 37:06.220]  See, I said I'd get to Zuckerberg next segment, and I'm kind of doing it now, aren't I?
[37:06.220 --> 37:07.220]  You know what?
[37:07.220 --> 37:11.340]  I need this hour to cover the hot coo going on, and the Zuckerberg thing ties into all
[37:11.340 --> 37:15.900]  of it, so I'll just start that next hour, and I promise I'll do it.
[37:15.900 --> 37:23.060]  And Sargon Avacad is going to be in studio with us, and he's always informative and interesting.
[37:23.060 --> 37:27.740]  He's visiting the United States from Air Strip 1, so that's going to be happening.
[37:27.740 --> 37:32.140]  But I'll tell you, I did a lot of research last night this morning.
[37:32.140 --> 37:37.700]  I did a lot of preparation for today's show, and it's those type of shows where I come
[37:37.700 --> 37:44.740]  in here, and the stakes are so high.
[37:44.740 --> 37:45.740]  I didn't used to have this problem.
[37:45.740 --> 37:50.220]  I have it now, because we're so in the zeitgeist right now.
[37:50.220 --> 38:01.060]  But I can't come up with words to describe how real and how dire the situation is, and
[38:01.060 --> 38:18.660]  how ridiculous it is that we have to even debate the fact that the New World Order system
[38:18.660 --> 38:26.060]  is really bad, really run by some nasty people, and you don't want to live under these individuals.
[38:26.060 --> 38:31.460]  I mean, this is a bad place.
[38:31.460 --> 38:34.420]  You get on this train, it goes to a really bad place.
[38:34.420 --> 38:36.140]  We know where it goes.
[38:36.140 --> 38:42.420]  We've been there before, historically, we've seen where the globalists have taken nations
[38:42.420 --> 38:44.380]  they get control of.
[38:44.380 --> 38:46.980]  These people are really into evil.
[38:46.980 --> 38:49.140]  They're good at it.
[38:49.140 --> 38:51.660]  It fits them.
[38:51.660 --> 38:54.220]  It looks good on them.
[38:54.220 --> 38:56.420]  They like it.
[38:56.420 --> 39:04.180]  They're of their father.
[39:04.180 --> 39:07.740]  And so I do all this research, and then I just have these brainstorms, and by the time
[39:07.740 --> 39:11.460]  I get on air, it's just like, what?
[39:11.460 --> 39:17.020]  I've got a stack of more than 10 articles that I wasn't looking for of racist mobs of
[39:17.020 --> 39:21.900]  black people and Muslims beating up white people in the U.S. and Europe.
[39:21.900 --> 39:28.220]  I never even cover it anymore, 10 articles at least today.
[39:28.220 --> 39:34.060]  I've got ABC News caught in giant fake news, and it's just a blip on the radar screen because
[39:34.060 --> 39:39.220]  now we just know, oh, they do lie to us, but still it seems like we're going for impeachment,
[39:39.220 --> 39:42.900]  so that's what has to happen.
[39:42.900 --> 39:47.940]  And then all this weird anti-Christian, anti-white stuff the left is pushing, former ABC anchor
[39:47.940 --> 39:56.340]  Sam Donaldson that they pulled out of some fossil museum says Trump supporters have fixation
[39:56.340 --> 39:59.700]  for white Christian country.
[39:59.700 --> 40:08.220]  So they're literally saying, we don't like white, we don't like Christian.
[40:08.220 --> 40:14.020]  And you've got all the Fiona Hill stuff and the bombshell, that isn't a bombshell because
[40:14.020 --> 40:21.980]  we already knew this, that it's John Bolton that started it all and said that what he
[40:21.980 --> 40:30.020]  heard Giuliani doing, who was his rival, could be unethical, that's like Satan saying something
[40:30.020 --> 40:41.300]  could be demonic, or Satan reporting on Slimer, one of his lower little demons, it's ridiculous.
[40:41.300 --> 40:44.380]  And so I said, you have these people that weren't even there, that weren't even there
[40:44.380 --> 40:51.020]  when this supposedly happened, testifying so it gets around national security and whistleblowing,
[40:51.020 --> 40:55.660]  and then here saying what John Bolton supposedly heard and said so he can now be called by the
[40:55.660 --> 41:02.220]  committee for the neocons and try to sink a big torpedo into Trump because for the neocons
[41:02.220 --> 41:08.900]  and the Straussian School of Economics that admired Hitler, that's how you're a really
[41:08.900 --> 41:19.300]  big man if John Bolton can mount Trump's head to his bedroom wall because Trump committed
[41:19.300 --> 41:22.980]  the great crime of trying to stop all these wars.
[41:22.980 --> 41:33.940]  Meanwhile, the New York Times is running all these different headlines about how 50 nukes
[41:33.940 --> 41:41.820]  have been caught and are being held and have been hijacked and are being held hostage because
[41:41.820 --> 41:46.140]  of the crisis in Turkey.
[41:46.140 --> 41:50.620]  And then you learn they've been there since the time of Kennedy and you learn that advisors
[41:50.620 --> 41:54.260]  have been saying for decades, get them out, but somehow that becomes Trump's fault that
[41:54.260 --> 41:55.700]  those nukes are even there.
[41:55.700 --> 42:00.140]  It's just at every level, everything is turned into a deception, everything is turned into
[42:00.140 --> 42:01.140]  a lie.
[42:01.140 --> 42:06.420]  And then you pull back from it, it's all total lies and total theater.
[42:06.420 --> 42:11.140]  Bolton made it up that Trump was doing illegal stuff with Ukraine because in truth it was
[42:11.140 --> 42:20.420]  the neocons and Mitt Romney and others cashed cow with the Democrats.
[42:20.420 --> 42:26.140]  And then they turn it all around like Trump's doing something corrupt.
[42:26.140 --> 42:29.860]  It's just mind blowing, but here's the big takeaway.
[42:29.860 --> 42:33.500]  We're in the middle of an attempted coup against the election of 2016.
[42:33.500 --> 42:35.460]  They know Trump's going to win in 2020.
[42:35.460 --> 42:40.740]  They want him gone before then, so Pelosi, when she's put in, she's third in line will
[42:40.740 --> 42:44.820]  then bring in Hillary as her vice president, you know it's going to happen just like the
[42:44.820 --> 42:47.660]  sun came up and then she'll resign and Hillary will be president.
[42:47.660 --> 42:49.740]  You say, well, people will blow up and get angry.
[42:49.740 --> 42:51.300]  That's their plan.
[42:51.300 --> 42:55.900]  America in turmoil, civil war divided, that makes the chai comms, the E.U., the Hollywoods
[42:55.900 --> 42:56.900]  come happy.
[42:56.900 --> 42:57.900]  And that's their plan.
[42:57.900 --> 43:01.300]  They don't want a good economy, they don't want to control our borders, they don't want
[43:01.300 --> 43:05.620]  a good nation going forward, they want to wreck it and loot it.
[43:05.620 --> 43:08.500]  Are we going to let them do it?
[43:08.500 --> 43:13.220]  This is China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago, and they've been approving
[43:13.220 --> 43:18.620]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[43:18.620 --> 43:22.700]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged with
[43:22.700 --> 43:26.700]  Silicon Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[43:26.700 --> 43:30.100]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China will
[43:30.100 --> 43:32.020]  quote, destroy Trump.
[43:32.020 --> 43:33.020]  That's a headline.
[43:33.020 --> 43:37.220]  So, info wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[43:37.220 --> 43:41.700]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right, and that's why it's
[43:41.700 --> 43:46.060]  more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their chai comm masters
[43:46.060 --> 43:51.260]  by word of mouth and spread the word about info wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[43:51.260 --> 43:55.300]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded, that's where the tip of the
[43:55.300 --> 44:08.540]  spear is continually being forged, is infowarstore.com.
[44:08.540 --> 44:12.700]  China was already running the United States, you're like well China could never take it
[44:12.700 --> 44:14.340]  with the US, that's right.
[44:14.340 --> 44:20.180]  As the Roman historian and senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from
[44:20.180 --> 44:23.700]  without before it first falls from within.
[44:23.700 --> 44:27.660]  So, yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[44:27.660 --> 44:29.780]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[44:29.780 --> 44:35.700]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like infowars.com
[44:35.700 --> 44:37.260]  and band.video.
[44:37.260 --> 44:41.220]  So now you know why I'm so upset, now you know why I'm so angry.
[44:41.220 --> 44:45.980]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV, they're totally pissing angry, people are like why
[44:45.980 --> 44:46.980]  are they angry?
[44:46.980 --> 44:52.300]  Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[44:52.300 --> 44:53.820]  Are you going to get upset?
[44:53.820 --> 44:56.980]  Well, you're a listener, you're obviously already upset, but you've got to ring the
[44:56.980 --> 45:01.060]  alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset and then take action and let
[45:01.060 --> 45:04.780]  Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell
[45:04.780 --> 45:09.580]  America out to the Chicago's.
[45:09.580 --> 45:13.820]  I've been in this fight so long against the globalists that I forget sometimes we really
[45:13.820 --> 45:18.580]  came from nowhere and that we've changed the world together and just how important your
[45:18.580 --> 45:21.980]  actions and my actions are every day in this fight.
[45:21.980 --> 45:26.340]  And right now we're running a gigantic sale, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points
[45:26.340 --> 45:28.820]  and the everything must go super sale.
[45:28.820 --> 45:34.140]  And there are more than 50 items that are 50% off or more right now.

[45:40.500 --> 45:44.780]  X2, 50% off, Ultra 12, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[45:44.780 --> 45:51.180]  The list goes on and on, again, 70% off, Survival Shield X3, the good halogen.
[45:51.180 --> 45:56.300]  You can get the 71% off on Immune Wall and Super Silver when you get them together, 1995
[45:56.300 --> 45:59.380]  for both, Gut Fusion, amazing 50% off.
[45:59.380 --> 46:05.660]  The list goes on and on, it's all at infowarsstore.com, that's the umbrella site, infowarslife.com
[46:05.660 --> 46:09.420]  takes you right to the supplements, infowarsstore.com.
[46:09.420 --> 46:12.980]  Now is the critical time to keep Infowars on the air.
[46:12.980 --> 46:16.420]  Everything we've warned of is now being exposed and is out in the open.
[46:16.420 --> 46:21.020]  I want to be clear, it's not coming true, it was already true.
[46:21.020 --> 46:24.340]  I didn't predict all this, it was already going on.
[46:24.340 --> 46:29.460]  Now the Globalists are making their move with the Chai Coms, so it's naked, it's brazen.
[46:29.460 --> 46:32.180]  This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[46:32.180 --> 46:36.260]  It's like before World War II, the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany was going to attack
[46:36.260 --> 46:37.260]  them.
[46:37.260 --> 46:40.780]  Nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened.
[46:40.780 --> 46:45.760]  We're at that same point and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there warning
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.740]  everyone about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight.
[46:49.740 --> 46:55.420]  And thank God America and the world is waking up at the 11th hour, 58 minutes.
[46:55.420 --> 46:57.700]  But will it be too little, too late?
[46:57.700 --> 46:58.700]  That's up to you.
[46:58.700 --> 47:00.340]  This battle's hot, it's real.
[47:00.340 --> 47:05.820]  So spread the word and support Infowars today at infowarsstore.com, but whatever you do,
[47:05.820 --> 47:34.060]  spread the word about the live transmission.
[47:35.820 --> 47:52.180]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:52.180 --> 47:56.540]  We live in incredibly historic and dangerous times.
[47:56.540 --> 48:03.140]  Everything you do, every word of mouth, every phone call, every prayer, every member of
[48:03.140 --> 48:08.780]  Congress that you personally go and get in their face, tell them don't impeach Trump,
[48:08.780 --> 48:16.260]  stand up against the Chai Kong menace, Hollywood's our enemy, MSM isn't media, it's propaganda.
[48:16.260 --> 48:22.100]  Every time you do that, you override the bullies and the silent majority stands against these
[48:22.100 --> 48:23.100]  tyrants.
[48:23.100 --> 48:33.780]  DrudgeReport.com says it all, LeBron James vows to China.
[48:33.780 --> 48:39.060]  And what's so sick about this is all these different sportswriters last week at the height
[48:39.060 --> 48:46.380]  of the whole NBA furor came out and said LeBron speaks up for civil rights, he talks about
[48:46.380 --> 48:54.580]  how evil America is, how bad Trump is, how white people are bad except when they're buying
[48:54.580 --> 49:00.300]  season tickets, and they said surely China's killed 100 plus million of its own people,
[49:00.300 --> 49:04.260]  it's murdering people in Hong Kong, Hong Kong has an agreement, a treaty that China's not
[49:04.260 --> 49:07.700]  supposed to take it over, but they have, they're secretly arresting people, they're taking
[49:07.700 --> 49:11.340]  their organs, they're killing Buddhists and Christians and putting them in forced labor
[49:11.340 --> 49:16.700]  camps as well as Muslims, surely LeBron will say we have free expression.
[49:16.700 --> 49:21.900]  I said last week on air, I said LeBron is going to come out and grovel to communist China
[49:21.900 --> 49:28.460]  because he's an arrogant, soulless nobody.
[49:28.460 --> 49:35.180]  LeBron James is all about himself, a big brat, and corporate America is not corporate America,
[49:35.180 --> 49:41.300]  it's globalist America, and it wants people to grovel to communist China.
[49:41.300 --> 49:45.420]  LeBron James was told to come out and race bait, he was told to come out and support
[49:45.420 --> 49:50.460]  taking a knee during the national anthems, he was told to support Hillary Clinton and
[49:50.460 --> 50:02.260]  have events for her, he does what he's told, and so he viciously came out and blasted
[50:02.260 --> 50:13.380]  the Rockets manager, going farther than James Harden saying we apologize to China because
[50:13.380 --> 50:19.180]  his instinct is authoritarianism, you project on LeBron James that he's this angel, he's
[50:19.180 --> 50:28.860]  this wonderful person, I bet if he ran this country he'd be a warlord dictator, he's not
[50:28.860 --> 50:37.060]  fit to carry Donald Trump's jot strap when he calls Trump a monster and stupid and ignorant,
[50:37.060 --> 50:40.540]  that's what LeBron James does, he calls people dumb and ignorant, that's what he called the
[50:40.540 --> 50:45.060]  general manager of the Rockets, who I think is dumb and ignorant, he did the right thing
[50:45.060 --> 50:50.780]  and apologized, he did the right thing and came out and said that China mass murdering
[50:50.780 --> 50:56.620]  and killing people is wrong and that Hong Kong deserves its basic dignity, and when he got
[50:56.620 --> 51:02.860]  a bunch of heat on him, he said I apologize, that's stupid, that's wrong, you know what,
[51:02.860 --> 51:10.420]  he's a lot better than LeBron James, like we've got the video of LeBron James shooting
[51:10.420 --> 51:18.340]  his mouth off, we're gonna play a clip of that here in just a moment, but just think
[51:18.340 --> 51:29.140]  about Hollywood and professional sports in all of this scum, I don't care if they're
[51:29.140 --> 51:33.240]  white, I don't care if they're black, I don't care if they're a woman, a man, on average
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.900]  they just do what they're told and that's why Hollywood is promoting pedophilia, that's
[51:37.900 --> 51:40.940]  why Hollywood's promoting the end of the family, that's why they're promoting drug use, it's
[51:40.940 --> 51:47.020]  why they're promoting open borders and saying America sucks because they're paid to, guardians
[51:47.020 --> 52:00.020]  of the galaxy director who promotes pedophilia publicly and has pedophile-styled parties,
[52:00.020 --> 52:05.420]  he's come out, James Gunn and said oh, after Disney let me go, I had all these other big
[52:05.420 --> 52:11.820]  firms begging me, now I've got bigger jobs than ever, exactly, he knows how to behave,
[52:11.820 --> 52:16.620]  he knows what to do to get to the top of that rat hole because you think you're climbing
[52:16.620 --> 52:22.700]  to the top, you're climbing to the bottom, you're really going down a tunnel, but there's
[52:22.700 --> 52:27.800]  a huge backlash against the NBA, massive ticket sales are down, just like the NFL's
[52:27.800 --> 52:33.700]  down 40%, empty seats, we've been sitting in our crews to different NBA games to show
[52:33.700 --> 52:41.340]  what's happening and to hold up signs and be thrown out to show there's no free speech
[52:41.340 --> 52:48.380]  and there's almost no one there and even some of the zombies going in booed Owen Schreuer
[52:48.380 --> 52:55.580]  on Sunday and said leave the NBA alone, because see the NBA now is communist China, so here
[52:55.580 --> 53:12.860]  is, here's LeBron James, here's a clip, we all talk about this freedom of speech, yes
[53:12.860 --> 53:17.460]  we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that
[53:17.460 --> 53:22.500]  can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself,
[53:22.500 --> 53:33.140]  so I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl, but I believe he wasn't educated
[53:33.140 --> 53:42.140]  on the situation at hand and he spoke and so many people could have been harmed, not
[53:42.140 --> 53:47.860]  only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually, so just be careful what we tweet
[53:47.860 --> 53:52.860]  and we say and what we do, even though yes we do have freedom of speech but there can
[53:52.860 --> 53:53.860]  be.
[53:53.860 --> 54:03.260]  So that is total inversion of reality, LeBron is a Satanist, he's a practicing Satanist
[54:03.260 --> 54:07.580]  even if he doesn't know he is, I mean he just inverted reality, communist China doesn't
[54:07.580 --> 54:14.820]  have any freedom of religion, communist China literally has death camps and slave camps
[54:14.820 --> 54:19.300]  and people work 18 hour days in slave factories and they have suicide nets around them and
[54:19.300 --> 54:24.860]  Hong Kong is where people ran from Mao Zedong who was not elected and then who proceeded
[54:24.860 --> 54:30.420]  to kill 80 million people himself, since then it's another 35 million conservatively, the
[54:30.420 --> 54:36.020]  Chinese government admits that LeBron, but see you can talk about slavery with 2% of
[54:36.020 --> 54:41.500]  Americans owning slaves and so tell people hundreds of years later how bad they are so
[54:41.500 --> 54:49.620]  they all kiss your ass, you are disgusting and you stand up for the modern slave masters
[54:49.620 --> 54:56.660]  of the communist Chinese and then you talk about people are ignorant and people could
[54:56.660 --> 55:02.140]  hurt people with their speech, yes you have free speech but you can take it away if it
[55:02.140 --> 55:11.420]  hurts somebody, that's the new leftist mantra, LeBron caves to China, blast uneducated
[55:11.420 --> 55:21.700]  rockets GM, isn't that just cute, here's last week opinion, LeBron James undermines values,
[55:21.700 --> 55:29.660]  he's espousing most disgraceful moment of his career, that's today, but last week opinion,
[55:29.660 --> 55:35.100]  it's time for LeBron James to speak out on China regardless of Nike ties where they make
[55:35.100 --> 55:46.980]  their slave shoes, LeBron James no longer King James in Hong Kong as they burn his jerseys
[55:46.980 --> 55:59.620]  and apparel, so it's all a big joke ladies and gentlemen, why in the hell would you put
[55:59.620 --> 56:08.900]  faith in some guy worth, what's LeBron James worth, $400 million who then runs around constantly
[56:08.900 --> 56:15.980]  shooting his mouth off about how bad America is and how bad Trump is because that's what
[56:15.980 --> 56:22.660]  he's paid to do, that's what corporate America is, he's a bunch of slaves to China, there
[56:22.660 --> 56:31.800]  is no corporate America now, my memory served correctly, $450 million, Kaepernick's worth
[56:31.800 --> 56:38.980]  over $100 million, adopted by white parents, he's pretty much white himself and then he
[56:38.980 --> 56:44.300]  grows out the big bozo the clown haircut, I mean if somebody's got a real aphor, more
[56:44.300 --> 56:48.820]  power to you, but he does a big bozo the clown deal and then goes out and becomes this big
[56:48.820 --> 56:52.860]  woke black guy, at least he's a little blacker, a little bit more black than the founder of
[56:52.860 --> 57:02.580]  Black Lives Matter who isn't even black like Rachel Dozel, she's as black as Pocahontas's
[57:02.580 --> 57:10.540]  American Indian, total horse crap, you know they said Columbus got it wrong and everybody
[57:10.540 --> 57:15.260]  calling folks in the New World Indians because they thought they'd gone around the world
[57:15.260 --> 57:20.300]  and ran into India, really they ran into North America and South America and Central America,
[57:20.300 --> 57:27.240]  but you know genetically Native Americans are basically Chinese, they're most closely
[57:27.240 --> 57:33.780]  associated with Chinese, they're Asians, that's what Hispanics are, is a mix of Asian
[57:33.780 --> 57:40.060]  with some of the Spanish that came over had been invaded by Africa, so they were Germanics
[57:40.060 --> 57:46.100]  mixed with some African that's the Arabs coming in and then mixed with Chinese, so it's kind
[57:46.100 --> 57:50.780]  of which the Indians are the same bloodline but whites came into India, so Indians are
[57:50.780 --> 57:54.860]  part white, that's between Indians and Chinese, a little bit of history for folks, what's
[57:54.860 --> 57:59.220]  kind of true that they aren't Native Indians.

[59:03.940 --> 59:10.260]  your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny,
[59:10.260 --> 59:14.860]  has really caught hold, not just here in the US but worldwide, and President Trump's
[59:14.860 --> 59:20.340]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[59:20.340 --> 59:25.900]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[59:25.900 --> 59:30.740]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[59:30.740 --> 59:36.140]  been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[59:36.140 --> 59:41.300]  being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[59:41.300 --> 59:45.900]  war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some major fireworks out
[59:45.900 --> 59:51.580]  of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[59:51.580 --> 59:52.580]  at us.
[59:52.580 --> 59:56.900]  That's an attempt to demoralize us, we've got to remember that and stay focused and
[59:56.900 --> 1:00:03.900]  stay happy.
[1:00:56.900 --> 1:01:17.900]  You see Buddha judge saying, take guns, it's about power, only the state needs guns.
[1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:26.780]  The UN says that, that's what China says, they're just authoritarians, and so yes, China's the
[1:01:26.780 --> 1:01:31.620]  engine of this, and the laboratory, but it's the corporations that put Mao in and protected
[1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:35.620]  him and built all this up over 60 years, 70 years that have done this.
[1:01:35.620 --> 1:01:39.580]  First, it took them a good 30 years to get the Chinese in line and kill 100 million
[1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:43.380]  up and take them off the land and take their kids away and turn them into what they are
[1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:44.380]  now.
[1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:49.500]  Then the last 35-40 years since the conditioning went well, a couple generations, now they
[1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:55.380]  are the cancer, but it's being directed by the big corporations, the NFL, the NBA, that's
[1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:59.860]  all just propaganda, so they tell the players, take a knee, hate America, America sucks.
[1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:04.340]  Steve Kerr discovered last night, sometimes you don't have a choice, he was asked again
[1:02:04.340 --> 1:02:08.100]  about China, and this time he answered the question.
[1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:10.940]  Sure he said China has problems, but so does the United States.
[1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:15.580]  I mean, China is a racist ethno-state that sends religious minorities to concentration
[1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:21.500]  camps and executes political prisoners to steal their organs, but in America, they
[1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:25.940]  sell guns at Walmart, so really there's a moral equivalence there.
[1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:37.180]  It has not come up in terms of people asking me about it, people discussing it, no.
[1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:42.500]  China has our record of human rights abuses come up either.
[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:48.620]  People in China didn't ask me about people owning air, 15s, and mowing each other down
[1:02:48.620 --> 1:02:49.620]  in a mall.
[1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:51.620]  I wasn't asked that question.
[1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:56.780]  But then when Beto and others come out at the CNN events and they say, yeah, churches
[1:02:56.780 --> 1:03:03.260]  shouldn't be able, just like Europe does, just like Canada does, to read passages criticizing
[1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:08.820]  pedophilia, criticizing homosexuality, well they should have their exemptions tripped.
[1:03:08.820 --> 1:03:10.980]  Well, that's all a giant scam.
[1:03:10.980 --> 1:03:12.820]  Let me read to you the First Amendment.
[1:03:12.820 --> 1:03:15.820]  The Congress will make no law respecting establishment or religion or prohibiting the
[1:03:15.820 --> 1:03:19.900]  free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:22.980]  the people to peacefully assemble, and to petition the government of a redress of grievances.
[1:03:22.980 --> 1:03:25.500]  It's a lot bigger than just your personal speech.
[1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:29.540]  To the left, oh, they've got their speech to get government funding to put Elephant
[1:03:29.540 --> 1:03:33.660]  Dung all over the Virgin Mary in a state-run system.
[1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:37.780]  They take your religious symbol, use money to then invert it, and then literally piss
[1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:38.780]  on it and crap on it.
[1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:39.780]  That's a satanic ritual.
[1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:40.780]  That's a desecration.
[1:03:40.780 --> 1:03:41.780]  That's 101 Satanism.
[1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:48.740]  So when Beto gets up there looking like it from the Adams family, all crazy, he's speaking
[1:03:48.740 --> 1:03:50.460]  from this globalist system.
[1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:51.660]  He's just a mouth.
[1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:52.660]  He's a tentacle.
[1:03:52.660 --> 1:03:55.780]  You can laugh at him all day, but he means business when he says we're going to take
[1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:59.540]  your guns, and we're going to take your speech, and we're going to go in and take control
[1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:00.540]  of the churches.
[1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:03.540]  The churches got tricked in the 50s into being 501c3.
[1:04:03.540 --> 1:04:05.020]  Oh, you're still tax exempt.
[1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:06.020]  Just sign these forms.
[1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:08.820]  You're no longer a church, you're now a charity.
[1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:10.140]  Now they come in with regulations.
[1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:11.660]  Well, Trump removes those regulations.
[1:04:11.660 --> 1:04:15.140]  One of the best things he did, saying those are unconstitutional, but he already had the
[1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:17.860]  first amendment saying it to begin with.
[1:04:17.860 --> 1:04:19.700]  But the churches are already trained.
[1:04:19.700 --> 1:04:20.700]  That's why the churches are dead.
[1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:22.580]  They're no longer churches.
[1:04:22.580 --> 1:04:23.580]  They're just feel-good clubs.
[1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:27.180]  I'm going to tell you about human animal clones, or the market of the beast is already here,
[1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:28.540]  or the Chinese credit score.
[1:04:28.540 --> 1:04:32.340]  They won't even, most churches even criticize China because they might get in trouble.
[1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:33.580]  It's all about bowing.
[1:04:33.580 --> 1:04:38.140]  When you bow and no one stands up for anything, it's like that House of Straw.
[1:04:38.140 --> 1:04:39.700]  The wind of China comes through.
[1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:44.780]  The wind of globalism, the wind of Satan, the wind of the east.
[1:04:44.780 --> 1:04:46.740]  That's what the chikoms call their missiles.
[1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:51.980]  Let's revelation say Satan comes out of the east like a strong wind.
[1:04:51.980 --> 1:04:55.020]  Wind of the east, strong wind of the east.
[1:04:55.020 --> 1:05:01.180]  Our missiles, our technology, in the hands of them now, the great wind of the east coming
[1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:07.380]  at the west, revelation bringing fire, billions dying, the wind of the east.
[1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:11.860]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[1:05:11.860 --> 1:05:17.860]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage,
[1:05:17.860 --> 1:05:22.500]  the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sell-outs, these whores,
[1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:25.020]  he just tore them to bits.
[1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:27.660]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener, it's powerful, but if you
[1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:33.740]  see it, it's all at band.video, you've got the full press conference, we've got my boil
[1:05:33.740 --> 1:05:37.820]  down of how epic it is, it's all at band.video, and I just, you've got to share this with
[1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:41.660]  people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:45.140]  This was amazing, and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:50.660]  So InfoWars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening, and we're sharing the
[1:05:50.660 --> 1:05:55.900]  ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video, and I got to tell you, we've
[1:05:55.900 --> 1:06:00.260]  done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our
[1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:01.260]  thing.
[1:06:01.260 --> 1:06:02.260]  Well, now they are.
[1:06:02.260 --> 1:06:16.540]  We're out of band.video folks, check it out, there's a lot of new features band.video.
[1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:41.980]  Now, InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com has been harping on this since Sunday night.
[1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:49.500]  We first had an article out Sunday night on this, the great folks over at Gateway Pundit,
[1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:57.140]  they got a story out on it, and then I talked about it every hour yesterday because my goal
[1:06:57.140 --> 1:06:59.980]  was to get into the president.
[1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:08.180]  Now, if you go back two years ago, they brought in a new White House chief of staff, and it
[1:07:08.180 --> 1:07:12.460]  was in Politico and the New York Times, and in that case, they told the truth because
[1:07:12.460 --> 1:07:18.300]  I talked to people at the White House, and they said their main job is to keep InfoWars
[1:07:18.300 --> 1:07:31.980]  away from the president, because they go, the president really acts on what's on InfoWars.
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:38.780]  And they said the fake news is endangering the world.
[1:07:38.780 --> 1:07:47.380]  You can just type into a search engine, John Kelly bans InfoWars of the White House, you'll
[1:07:47.380 --> 1:07:49.060]  get Politico.
[1:07:49.060 --> 1:07:51.900]  Now, why do they ban us?
[1:07:51.900 --> 1:07:56.300]  Because the Secret Service and others bring stuff to Trump.
[1:07:56.300 --> 1:07:59.740]  I ran into a fellow out in LA, well-known individual, I'll leave it at that while I was
[1:07:59.740 --> 1:08:07.980]  there doing some podcasting, I was in the podcasting building over at Apple of all places, and
[1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:15.260]  he talked about, he had just gotten one of my videos to Trump on Air Force One the day
[1:08:15.260 --> 1:08:21.820]  before in LA, and then was I out in LA to meet with Trump, and I said no, I just happened
[1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:28.140]  to be out here to go on some of these podcasts like TI's, but that's not name dropping, I'm
[1:08:28.140 --> 1:08:32.780]  trying to explain to the audience why they want us off the air.
[1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:38.540]  Because no exaggeration, nine times out of ten, it's InfoWars that breaks the critical
[1:08:38.540 --> 1:08:41.660]  news that ends up changing history.
[1:08:41.660 --> 1:08:45.700]  And that means when DrudgeReport.com links to it, or you share it, or you call the White
[1:08:45.700 --> 1:08:56.340]  House, or you hand it over to the president, it has that effect.
[1:08:56.340 --> 1:08:59.700]  And so it meant a lot to me, but it also made me realize how much danger I'm in, because
[1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:04.900]  I already knew this, but to run into a well-known individual who'd been on Air Force One to
[1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:11.300]  get a turn and then briefly talk to Trump, that oh man, the Secret Service loves you,
[1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:14.740]  and boy, Trump really likes you.
[1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:18.900]  I know that, and that means the globalists really hate my guts, and they're trying to
[1:09:18.900 --> 1:09:21.100]  get me right now because of it.
[1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:25.900]  Because if they can destroy InfoWars, they know that grassroots intelligence agency,
[1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:30.380]  that organic resistance, will be knocked off.
[1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:36.900]  I mean, we had Roger Stone on two years ago saying, Fiona Hill's been brought in by McMaster,
[1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:40.660]  she works for Soros, here's the evidence, they're going to set Trump up and claim that
[1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:45.740]  he's done something wrong in Ukraine, that's their plan.
[1:09:45.740 --> 1:09:50.740]  Because Roger was in D.C. having meetings with White House officials, and he's set
[1:09:50.740 --> 1:09:51.740]  on air.
[1:09:51.740 --> 1:09:56.700]  He told, they're about to indict me, because I've warned the public about this on your
[1:09:56.700 --> 1:09:57.700]  show.
[1:09:57.700 --> 1:09:59.700]  That was when he came on the week after he first came on.
[1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:01.940]  But he said, I'm not going to stop.
[1:10:01.940 --> 1:10:02.940]  That was all real.
[1:10:02.940 --> 1:10:08.380]  They had people following him at that time.
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:14.060]  Now we said, on Saturday in the video we put out, that Fiona Hill had been gone from the
[1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:20.300]  White House for four months, when the phone call to the new Ukrainian president happened,
[1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:23.980]  and that she did not have knowledge of at first hand, like they were claiming.
[1:10:23.980 --> 1:10:28.180]  That is on Fox News today.
[1:10:28.180 --> 1:10:36.780]  Scroll down, it shows the Fox News clip from the Gateway Pundit.
[1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:40.460]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's why we're so important.
[1:10:40.460 --> 1:10:46.300]  And they're trying to put us in prison.
[1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:52.780]  I talked to individuals that I cannot name this weekend at length.
[1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:57.260]  And these people have never lied to me, and they said, Alex, you know what the lawsuits
[1:10:57.260 --> 1:10:58.260]  are about.
[1:10:58.260 --> 1:10:59.260]  And I said, well, I've got a good idea.
[1:10:59.260 --> 1:11:04.020]  Tell me, well, they think they're going to find tax evasion in there and put you in prison.
[1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:07.420]  Well, there's none of that.
[1:11:07.420 --> 1:11:09.420]  And they said, well, we know that.
[1:11:09.420 --> 1:11:10.420]  They don't care.
[1:11:10.420 --> 1:11:16.940]  They want to be able to parallel construct, and there is an order out, and I already know
[1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:22.940]  this, to try to put you in prison via the Justice Department, and you go, well, Bill
[1:11:22.940 --> 1:11:23.940]  Barrel stopped it.
[1:11:23.940 --> 1:11:24.940]  No, Bill Barrel's not in control.
[1:11:24.940 --> 1:11:30.660]  He's in control of the top, but it's Obama and Hillary and Bush senior and Bush junior
[1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.660]  people.
[1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:35.660]  They've been putting in for 40 years.
[1:11:35.660 --> 1:11:41.220]  And this person was not threatening me.
[1:11:41.220 --> 1:11:47.540]  This person was telling me that, you know, obviously, people are holding out in the government,
[1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:48.540]  supporting Trump.
[1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:52.820]  So are they, and that everybody's basically facing death or indictment, and then just
[1:11:52.820 --> 1:11:54.660]  checking in to make sure we're not backing down.
[1:11:54.660 --> 1:11:55.980]  You're not backing down, right?
[1:11:55.980 --> 1:11:59.100]  Okay, well, here's the fact.
[1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:03.900]  You know they're looking at killing you.
[1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:07.300]  And I'm not trying to be dramatic, but that's the kind of stuff I've got to deal with.
[1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.980]  And see, it doesn't make me feel sorry for myself, doesn't make me scared.
[1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:14.820]  It makes me angry, and it makes me want to stop these people.
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:15.820]  Not for me.
[1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:19.060]  And I wish I could say it was for me, because then I wouldn't feel so bad.
[1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:20.060]  It's instinctive.
[1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:21.540]  It's for my children and your children.
[1:12:21.540 --> 1:12:27.420]  I don't want to be ruled by these criminal scum.
[1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:32.460]  And I know that they're putting all these people in prison, and I know they're threatening
[1:12:32.460 --> 1:12:36.260]  everybody else, and that's why most people are rolling over right now, including the
[1:12:36.260 --> 1:12:37.260]  Senate.
[1:12:37.260 --> 1:12:41.260]  Truth is, Trump's done nothing wrong.
[1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:48.860]  And it makes me angry to see John Bolton knowing that Trump took that rattlesnake
[1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:57.340]  into his bosom, put that scorpion on his back.
[1:12:57.340 --> 1:13:01.060]  And exactly as we thought is now unfolding, they're all just going to lie.
[1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:09.140]  Johnson, Hill, Hill, probably John Kelly, because they all came from the swamp.
[1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:13.460]  They all got promoted because they were yes men, that were corrupt, that would do whatever
[1:13:13.460 --> 1:13:15.980]  they were told whenever they were told.
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:20.140]  And I'm not saying Kelly's even a dishonorable man, or that his son didn't die in the Marine
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:22.460]  Corps.
[1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:34.100]  But we know that he got bit to the deep state and all their threats, because they know how
[1:13:34.100 --> 1:13:35.100]  to talk to you.
[1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:36.300]  They know, oh, you're better than the president.
[1:13:36.300 --> 1:13:37.300]  You know better.
[1:13:37.300 --> 1:13:41.740]  You've got to keep them under control while they're siphoning off information, while they're
[1:13:41.740 --> 1:13:43.420]  setting everybody up.
[1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:44.900]  That's how this creeping death works.
[1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:49.460]  Cicero talked about we can defeat an enemy that comes to our gates openly at the time
[1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:50.460]  of Rome.
[1:13:50.460 --> 1:13:57.020]  Enemies within, that's who we've got to worry about, because that's who operates in stealth,
[1:13:57.020 --> 1:13:59.020]  like the plague, like a disease.
[1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:03.540]  When we come back, I'm going to get into Fiona Hill and play some clips, and I'm going to
[1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:11.780]  get into the giant ABC News hoax that we broke.
[1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:17.020]  Simultaneously others did as well, because Knob Creek machine gun shootout is on my list
[1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:18.020]  of places to go.
[1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:22.980]  I've always wanted to go to the once a year Kentucky shoot, where all these cool full
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:27.420]  autos get fired, and they have great times at night, and they have a lot of expositions.
[1:14:27.420 --> 1:14:30.660]  It's like Hillbilly Burning Man.
[1:14:30.660 --> 1:14:38.100]  But before Running Man, you know, the biggest thrill is White Lightning.
[1:14:38.100 --> 1:14:47.460]  They don't take Crips on LSD to quote the late great, Murl Hagger.
[1:14:47.460 --> 1:14:51.500]  So when I saw it, I said, that's Knob Creek.
[1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:57.220]  Well, ABC News thought you were stupid, and they played it and said, look, Trump's allowed
[1:14:57.220 --> 1:14:58.220]  the mass murder.
[1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:04.180]  Here's an entire city being blown up, and they cut, they zoomed in, where it looks
[1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:09.100]  like 5,000 foot red mushroom clouds are shooting up.
[1:15:09.100 --> 1:15:15.940]  They're really 50 foot red mushroom clouds, like back in the day before CG, like in Star
[1:15:15.940 --> 1:15:20.540]  Wars, Empire Strikes Back, they had like really, you know, toy imperial walkers and, you know,
[1:15:20.540 --> 1:15:23.540]  baby explosions and everything.
[1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:31.300]  But see, the reason the story is so big is, and now the president's talking about it,
[1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:35.260]  is because they just get caught and then nothing happens to them.
[1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:36.700]  They do this constantly.
[1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:43.180]  The New York Times put out photos saying, here's all the dead curd babies Trump killed, and
[1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:46.220]  then it was a 1992 earthquake photo.
[1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:50.420]  They knew anybody could just search that, search the image in 10 seconds and find it
[1:15:50.420 --> 1:15:51.420]  was fake.
[1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:56.860]  They don't care, because they're committed, and they just want an excuse when they remove
[1:15:56.860 --> 1:15:57.860]  the president.
[1:15:57.860 --> 1:16:01.900]  And we'll talk about how they plan to do that, what's going to unfold after and how we stop
[1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:02.900]  it.
[1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:03.900]  Stay with us.

[1:16:32.940 --> 1:16:37.420]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale

[1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:37.020]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:37.020 --> 1:17:40.940]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:42.500]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:45.460]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:45.460 --> 1:17:48.740]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:50.980]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:50.980 --> 1:17:52.300]  I can help you too.
[1:17:52.300 --> 1:17:55.300]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:17:55.300 --> 1:17:57.540]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:17:57.540 --> 1:18:07.620]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:14.060]  My phone has been ringing off the hook, constitutional lawyers, national talk show host, prominent
[1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:18.140]  guests I've had on over the years and they're all saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:22.780]  You've been obsessing on China since you got on air 20 something years ago and now it's
[1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:23.780]  all coming true.
[1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:25.100]  How did you know it?
[1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:28.540]  Because the council on foreign relations is the shadow government and they admitted the
[1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:35.380]  plan to transfer all power to communist China and almost everyone calling me says, yeah,
[1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:39.540]  and they banned you because you were saying all that and how Silicon Valley, Google and
[1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:43.620]  Apple moved over there and it's incredible and wow, you're vindicated, you're going to
[1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:45.820]  get back on the air now, aren't you?
[1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:49.860]  And no, if we don't defeat this takeover, you're all going to be taken off.
[1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:52.460]  In fact, you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps.
[1:18:52.460 --> 1:18:53.740]  They're making their move.
[1:18:53.740 --> 1:18:55.220]  They're coming for your guns.
[1:18:55.220 --> 1:18:56.620]  They're coming for your kids.
[1:18:56.620 --> 1:18:58.580]  They're coming for your right to religion.
[1:18:58.580 --> 1:19:00.420]  They are coming for your soul.
[1:19:00.420 --> 1:19:02.260]  Well, you know what they say.
[1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:08.260]  You got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China.
[1:19:08.260 --> 1:19:13.020]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:17.460]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian
[1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:21.060]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic
[1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:25.980]  immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then
[1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:28.140]  meanwhile, his tax exempt began offshore.
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:31.740]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populists get it.
[1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:35.980]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say
[1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:40.860]  the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[1:19:40.860 --> 1:19:43.020]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:48.620]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for
[1:19:48.620 --> 1:19:53.620]  the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[1:19:53.620 --> 1:19:58.380]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is
[1:19:58.380 --> 1:19:59.380]  great.
[1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:01.500]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:10.380]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:32.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war.
[1:20:32.260 --> 1:20:42.380]  The establishment is obsessed with me.
[1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:49.100]  I have had the phone ringing off the hook the last couple weeks with people saying, have
[1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:50.100]  you seen this TV show?
[1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:52.780]  Have you seen that TV show?
[1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:54.300]  They're attacking you on this program.
[1:20:54.300 --> 1:20:56.460]  They're attacking you on that program.
[1:20:56.460 --> 1:20:58.500]  They're attacking you on the news.
[1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:00.260]  They're attacking you in movies.
[1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:01.620]  You're in the Dick Cheney movie.
[1:21:01.620 --> 1:21:05.500]  You're in the, what's going on?
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:17.060]  The archetype that info wars represents is what the globalist hate, independence, strength,
[1:21:17.060 --> 1:21:21.260]  fearlessness, Americana.
[1:21:21.260 --> 1:21:24.340]  I'm probably not going to play this today because I want to do a special report on it
[1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:25.860]  in the era tomorrow.
[1:21:25.860 --> 1:21:31.420]  But my phone started ringing last night because it's a popular show called The Good Doctor
[1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:39.780]  on ABC that's got around 15 million viewers, mainly women.
[1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:46.300]  In fact, one of my daughters tries to watch it, my older daughter.
[1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:51.380]  And it's word for word things I've said on air.
[1:21:51.380 --> 1:21:55.820]  And then lo and behold, the directors and producers are in the news saying this is an
[1:21:55.820 --> 1:22:03.940]  Alex Jones archetype and we think he's dangerous, so we want to expose him.
[1:22:03.940 --> 1:22:13.780]  Now, it's word for word, what I say, but out of context.
[1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:28.580]  And with authority figure doctors sitting back and explaining how dangerous I am.
[1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:34.580]  So there are so many TV shows right now, like Homeland where I've been put in prison and
[1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:41.220]  they say it's Alex Jones, but you got to ask, what is all this really going towards?
[1:22:41.220 --> 1:22:45.300]  And that's the answer to the next question of how they're going to take Trump down and
[1:22:45.300 --> 1:22:47.980]  how they're going to come for you.
[1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:54.300]  Because you see, they archetypally see info wars and yours truly in their own words.
[1:22:54.300 --> 1:23:08.940]  I'm going to show you the article as the archetype of Americana and the enemy.
[1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:14.300]  They actually say in these articles, just type in the good doctor, Alex Jones, click
[1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:20.420]  news, there's a bunch of articles, and you can read them saying he's the enemy.
[1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:31.780]  Why am I the enemy?
[1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:36.580]  Because we talk about how they're hurting the children, how they're targeting the children
[1:23:36.580 --> 1:23:39.500]  and they are.
[1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:46.140]  And they don't want you to have your instincts reactivated to stand between them and the children.
[1:23:46.140 --> 1:23:48.340]  They want their prey.
[1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:49.580]  They want their quarry.
[1:23:49.580 --> 1:24:00.580]  But let's get back to what I said I get to Trump's ABC news airing fake Syria bombing
[1:24:00.580 --> 1:24:03.580]  video is a real disgrace.
[1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:12.460]  Yeah, yesterday evening ABC put out a little statement and said we regret the error.
[1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:16.380]  And I guess the New York Times regrets the error of putting out a photo from 1992 of
[1:24:16.380 --> 1:24:22.260]  earthquake victims in Syria, piles of dead babies saying Trump killed him.
[1:24:22.260 --> 1:24:24.180]  Now that's called war propaganda.
[1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:27.860]  Remember Remington, the famous painter and William McKinley getting us into the Spanish
[1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:35.380]  American War, William Randolph Hearst famously wrote later in his memoirs that he called
[1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:48.420]  up Remington, and he said, you give me the pictures, I'll give you the war.
[1:24:48.420 --> 1:24:49.900]  And so it's the same old thing.
[1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:51.060]  They didn't start lying.
[1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:52.060]  They've been lying.
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:54.380]  It's just worse now.
[1:24:54.380 --> 1:25:01.140]  New York Times editor, associate editor puts out a fake photo, he'll get an award for
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:02.140]  it.
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:03.140]  Blaming Trump.
[1:25:03.140 --> 1:25:10.740]  ABC puts out Knob Creek machine gun shootout that by the way, every year I've been watching
[1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:16.660]  it on YouTube for a good 15, 16 years, I've been sent VHS tapes of it 20 something years
[1:25:16.660 --> 1:25:18.860]  ago.
[1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:25.060]  So they showed Knob Creek from last year, spectacular hundreds of people videotaping
[1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:32.860]  it with their phones, taping it, they crop it, and again, it looks like a city's on fire.
[1:25:32.860 --> 1:25:35.180]  But it wasn't a city on fire.
[1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:38.180]  It was a shooting range.
[1:25:38.180 --> 1:25:43.380]  And they consciously did that and said, here are the images, here, play the Knob Creek
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:53.860]  for TV viewers.
[1:25:53.860 --> 1:26:05.020]  That is hundreds of people with tracer ammo shooting cans of gasoline at Knob Creek.
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:06.020]  That's all that is.
[1:26:06.020 --> 1:26:09.220]  And you see all the hundreds of phones taping it.
[1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:11.540]  But what did ABC News do?
[1:26:11.540 --> 1:26:17.740]  They cropped it, but you couldn't see the trees on either side, and where you couldn't
[1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:22.460]  see the phones, and they said, wow, this is great footage.
[1:26:22.460 --> 1:26:28.500]  Let's say this is what Trump is allowing as the Turks vaporize the city.
[1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.220]  None of it was true.
[1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:37.140]  But when you see it cropped, it looks like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:40.260]  It looks like War of the Worlds.
[1:26:40.260 --> 1:26:43.940]  It looks like Armageddon.
[1:26:43.940 --> 1:26:48.340]  Let's show the ABC News cropped footage again for radio listeners I'm describing.
[1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:53.980]  This video right here appearing to show Turkey's military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian
[1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:55.060]  border town.
[1:26:55.060 --> 1:26:58.860]  The Kurds who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS.
[1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:06.980]  Now horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish fact fighters on those very allies.
[1:27:06.980 --> 1:27:10.540]  And they aired it everywhere, and I had people walk with me in the street.
[1:27:10.540 --> 1:27:15.420]  I had been called a Russian agent in a while, but I did have somebody who walked with me
[1:27:15.420 --> 1:27:16.420]  in the street.
[1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:21.940]  I was at the store this weekend, and they said, you know, you got to be ashamed of yourself
[1:27:21.940 --> 1:27:26.500]  and what you're supporting with Trump, what he's doing to the Kurds.
[1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:29.300]  And I said, I looked at the guy, I said, let me guess, you're a veteran.
[1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:30.300]  He goes, yeah, I am.
[1:27:30.300 --> 1:27:33.700]  I mean, I could see, you know, your look, everything.
[1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:40.660]  I said, you're a Democrat, and he goes, yeah, let me guess, you think the Kurds are Christian?
[1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:42.140]  He goes, well, of course they are.
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:45.460]  I said, man, I've heard quite enough and he says, what do you mean?
[1:27:45.460 --> 1:27:48.180]  I go, listen, dude, I can't help you.
[1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:49.300]  That's Pentagon propaganda.
[1:27:49.300 --> 1:27:50.300]  The Kurds aren't Christians.
[1:27:50.300 --> 1:27:58.380]  You're a damn idiot, because he was, you know, bowing up saying shame on you.
[1:27:58.380 --> 1:28:00.420]  I shouldn't have called him an idiot.
[1:28:00.420 --> 1:28:08.500]  I just, I try to train myself not to get angry at people, but, you know, I just, I never
[1:28:08.500 --> 1:28:12.700]  expect it when I'm in a grocery store buying cherries and, you know, ice cream for the
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:17.860]  kids and whipped cream and some dudes tapping on my shoulder and, you know, bowing up and
[1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:21.980]  how you got to be ashamed of yourself and Trump, what you're supporting, what he's doing
[1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:22.980]  to the Kurds.
[1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:30.660]  Four-star Marine Corps general comes out and says, Trump's causing massacres, Trump's a
[1:28:30.660 --> 1:28:32.020]  warmonger.
[1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:37.060]  All these guys love the fake WMDs, the endless wars, all the garbage, they love it.
[1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:42.300]  They don't wear it, but oh, Trump tries to pull us out of there, oh, he's the devil.
[1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:47.660]  He's the worst guy, and these guys are all watching footage like that, and photos of
[1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:51.260]  dead babies that are from 1992, and they just want to feel good.
[1:28:51.260 --> 1:28:52.420]  They want to be idiots.
[1:28:52.420 --> 1:28:53.420]  They want to be lied to.
[1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:54.420]  They want to be morons.
[1:28:54.420 --> 1:28:59.620]  Well, most veterans see through it, and they're patriots, but leftist veterans, they want
[1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:00.620]  to be lied to.
[1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:01.620]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:02.620]  Stay with us.

[1:33:10.340 --> 1:33:25.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:36.740]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:36.740 --> 1:33:42.540]  So if you just joined us, ABC News says it's a mistake that they showed the Nob Creek machine
[1:33:42.540 --> 1:33:43.540]  gun shootout.
[1:33:43.540 --> 1:33:44.540]  That's right.
[1:33:44.540 --> 1:33:49.380]  In fact, we looked up that very video from last year, had over 15 million views just
[1:33:49.380 --> 1:33:50.380]  on one version.
[1:33:50.380 --> 1:33:56.020]  And if you watch the video, you see hundreds of people with their smartphones uptaping
[1:33:56.020 --> 1:33:57.020]  it.
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:58.020]  So that's just one version.
[1:33:58.020 --> 1:34:02.260]  So they went and got the video, they cropped it, and then said, look at this town, look
[1:34:02.260 --> 1:34:11.180]  at this city being vaporized by giant mega weapons, as if the Turks have death stars
[1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:14.100]  or something, just blowing up whole buildings.
[1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:16.900]  And it was really cans of gasoline.
[1:34:16.900 --> 1:34:18.140]  But that's who they are.
[1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:19.740]  That's what they do.
[1:34:19.740 --> 1:34:21.860]  And they're going to do more of it and more of it.
[1:34:21.860 --> 1:34:24.100]  You think Jesse Smollett was a bad guy?
[1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:28.660]  He just got caught staging an event.
[1:34:28.660 --> 1:34:31.100]  And almost all the racial attacks have come out.
[1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:33.620]  It turns out he's staged.
[1:34:33.620 --> 1:34:35.020]  That's what the left does.
[1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:37.460]  They're a bunch of actors.
[1:34:37.460 --> 1:34:39.340]  It's theater with them.
[1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:45.340]  And they're using theater to try to take down President Trump.
[1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:49.820]  So I want to thank the listeners Saturday and Sunday for getting our articles and videos
[1:34:49.820 --> 1:34:53.940]  out at band.video.
[1:34:53.940 --> 1:35:00.580]  With the headlines, meet Fiona Hill, the George Soros mole aiming to take down President
[1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:01.580]  Trump.
[1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:06.860]  And we explain how she didn't even work there then, how she then says she heard what happened
[1:35:06.860 --> 1:35:13.220]  to then give cover to operatives inside the White House, probably John Bolton.
[1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:20.700]  Well, she testified to that yesterday in Congress, precisely what I told you.
[1:35:20.700 --> 1:35:24.020]  Now, I'm explaining why they want us off the air.
[1:35:24.020 --> 1:35:26.300]  I've got their number.
[1:35:26.300 --> 1:35:41.660]  I really talked to people very close to President Trump Saturday for over an hour.
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:47.300]  But they were calling to see what I thought.
[1:35:47.300 --> 1:35:50.900]  And I was talking to them to see what they thought.
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:35:57.740]  And it was just like, we're committed, we're not backing down, Trump's not backing down,
[1:35:57.740 --> 1:36:00.020]  Trump's not going to resign.
[1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:03.420]  And we're betting on the American people and we're betting on the military and we're
[1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:06.820]  betting on due process.
[1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:12.580]  But the word is they are going to try to put everybody in prison that supports Trump at
[1:36:12.580 --> 1:36:18.380]  a high level, at a powerful level, at a level that has any effect.
[1:36:18.380 --> 1:36:22.980]  And if they get control again, they are planning a purge.
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:27.940]  Hell, they make movies how they're going to purge the Trump supporters.
[1:36:27.940 --> 1:36:28.940]  But this is real.
[1:36:28.940 --> 1:36:30.420]  This is what you see in other countries.
[1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:32.300]  It's here now.
[1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:38.020]  We're already in a civil war between the deep state paid for by foreign countries and corporations
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:43.860]  that have been looting America and the American people.
[1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:44.860]  And so it's paradoxical.
[1:36:44.860 --> 1:36:48.260]  I don't even want to sit here and criticize the president because he's under such attack.
[1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:52.220]  But then it'd be a lot better if he could get some action out of the Justice Department.
[1:36:52.220 --> 1:37:03.180]  Now we saw Bill Barr come out with a come to Jesus moment or he found the Jesus moment.
[1:37:03.180 --> 1:37:08.860]  He put his whole 45 minute speech up on info wars.com and banned off video.
[1:37:08.860 --> 1:37:12.060]  A few clips of it got millions of views, but nobody's put out the whole interview.
[1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:13.060]  We went and found it.
[1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:17.900]  I said, nobody had had no views, like a thousand views on some obscure YouTube channel.
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:23.380]  He fixed the audio blew it up because it was shot from, you know, 50 yards away and it's
[1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:24.380]  good video.
[1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:31.700]  What he says is incredible and he just lays out how there's a spirit of evil, a dark force.
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:34.540]  The left really wants to destroy America and civilization.
[1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:35.940]  They really want to hurt children.
[1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:40.980]  They really want to sexualize children and that it's purposeful.
[1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:44.700]  It's not decay.
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:46.220]  It's organized destruction.
[1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:48.400]  Those are quotes.
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:49.900]  So here's the deal.
[1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:51.020]  This is what's going to happen.
[1:37:51.020 --> 1:37:52.220]  Evil always builds up.
[1:37:52.220 --> 1:37:53.720]  It hides in the dark.
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.900]  Then when it finally tries to take over, it comes out and tries to intimidate with overwhelming
[1:37:57.900 --> 1:37:59.900]  force.
[1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:03.300]  If people bow, then Satan eats them.
[1:38:03.300 --> 1:38:09.700]  The devil goes about like a lion roaring, seeing who he may devour.
[1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:14.480]  I used to always see the Jason movies when I was a little kid wonder, why do the people
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:19.940]  fall over and climb on their butt with their hands on the ground screaming, no, no, no,
[1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:21.940]  please don't kill me.
[1:38:21.940 --> 1:38:25.580]  I mean, I would just keep running and running and running and I have run from something
[1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:27.260]  just as dangerous as Jason.
[1:38:27.260 --> 1:38:31.300]  I was a little kid that we used to go on the neighbor and ranch that had Brahma Bulls
[1:38:31.300 --> 1:38:35.020]  and my grandma would say, you know, you're allowed to go across the land over there,
[1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:39.980]  but not in the hot traps to go down to the big creek and swim with being some old neighborhood
[1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:45.380]  kids, but don't cross the shortcut through the Brahma Bulls and the hot trap is the
[1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:46.700]  electrified fences.
[1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:51.060]  Well, you know, when you're eight years old, you're still going to do that.
[1:38:51.060 --> 1:38:58.500]  The fun is going over the electric fences and having the bull chase ship.
[1:38:58.500 --> 1:39:02.820]  But see, you didn't know Brahma Bulls could jump fences, did you?
[1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:09.460]  And I had a me and my late friend, Brian, he died at 33.
[1:39:09.460 --> 1:39:15.460]  He made just me hospital infection side issue.
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:22.460]  We got chased about a good quarter mile by that Brahma Bull down that creek bottom because
[1:39:22.460 --> 1:39:24.460]  over the hot traps was the creek bottom.
[1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:25.460]  He went in there after us.
[1:39:25.460 --> 1:39:26.460]  Let me tell you, I didn't stumble.
[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:27.460]  I didn't fall.
[1:39:27.460 --> 1:39:29.460]  I was flying.
[1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:31.460]  I was jumping over stuff.
[1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:36.580]  In fact, I came back out of there out of that creek bottom and just like that bull did,
[1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:42.740]  I jumped another hot trap, they had bulls on the other side right over it, jumped right
[1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:43.740]  over that fence.
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:44.740]  Another like a bull chase.
[1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:45.740]  You make it do it.
[1:39:45.740 --> 1:39:49.860]  So I've been there, but I always see these folks in the movies, they fall down in the
[1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:54.420]  learned helplessness and they don't get me.
[1:39:54.420 --> 1:39:57.100]  And I used to think that was made up.
[1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.260]  I didn't think that happened till I grew up and I've seen people act just like that,
[1:40:01.260 --> 1:40:05.900]  where they fall down and they beg and they back away.
[1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:10.260]  When you act like that to the deep state, man, it's like some in the water with blood
[1:40:10.260 --> 1:40:16.300]  and fish heads for sharks or it's like slicing your legs up with razor blades and jumping
[1:40:16.300 --> 1:40:17.900]  into shark infested waters.
[1:40:17.900 --> 1:40:22.580]  I mean, you're asking for it.
[1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:28.100]  And there's this ridiculous learned helplessness everywhere that people think if they bow down
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:36.860]  to the system that they're going to somehow get ahead and maybe that was the case in the
[1:40:36.860 --> 1:40:37.860]  past.
[1:40:37.860 --> 1:40:44.620]  If they needed some yes men to sell America out, the selling out of America is done.
[1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:48.220]  There's nothing left.
[1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:52.780]  And so LeBron James is trying to find a new corporate master to bow down to the chai comms
[1:40:52.780 --> 1:41:00.180]  that again have killed four to five times what Hitler did.
[1:41:00.180 --> 1:41:06.380]  And so how this is going to work is they're going to bring forward all these fake whistleblowers
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:11.260]  who are really just political operatives who don't like Trump's policies and they're going
[1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:19.900]  to have people then that are called as witnesses to Congress who then identify who the witnesses
[1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:26.660]  are who are the original whistleblowers but who lied in their whistleblowing so they want
[1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:31.660]  to be called like they're a reluctant third party so that they don't get the political
[1:41:31.660 --> 1:41:40.700]  fallout of goring the president now that we're on the parallel of bulls.
[1:41:40.700 --> 1:41:42.300]  And that's all this is.
[1:41:42.300 --> 1:41:46.460]  And that's exactly what we wrote on Saturday and Sunday and that's what now happened yesterday
[1:41:46.460 --> 1:41:51.780]  on Monday and here are the headlines.
[1:41:51.780 --> 1:41:56.820]  Just a matter of time before President removed following impeachment testimony from Trump
[1:41:56.820 --> 1:42:02.940]  Ed Fiona Hill saying President Zach's national security advisor John Bolton reportedly urged
[1:42:02.940 --> 1:42:09.420]  former Russian advisor Fiona Hill to warn the White House about a campaign to pressure
[1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:16.300]  Ukraine directed by the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani describing the latter
[1:42:16.300 --> 1:42:21.900]  as a hand grenade that is going to blow up everybody.
[1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:23.900]  You believe any of that?
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:24.900]  Yeah, right.
[1:42:24.900 --> 1:42:30.140]  Meanwhile, Republicans can't get into the closed door hearings and no one can face who
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:37.220]  the other whistleblowers are because it's not it's John Bolton, it's Fiona Hill.
[1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:41.740]  So he tried to crash it and got thrown out.
[1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:47.100]  He was ejected from that secret meeting but here's our article from 2017, May 31, bombshell
[1:42:47.100 --> 1:42:51.220]  Soros Insider infiltrates Trump administration.
[1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:52.220]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:42:52.220 --> 1:42:54.220]  No next year's news today.
[1:42:54.220 --> 1:42:55.780]  So how do we counter this?
[1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:57.580]  How do we fight back against it?
[1:42:57.580 --> 1:42:59.220]  How do we stop them?
[1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:00.220]  I'll tell you how.
[1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:05.660]  I promise and I'll finish the Facebook story on the other side and Sargon of Akkad Sargon
[1:43:05.660 --> 1:43:06.660]  joins us.
[1:43:06.660 --> 1:43:14.620]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make up a hero film, once we have full control
[1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:21.620]  we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:26.620]  Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:34.620]  Band.Video is evil Americans whose Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China's
[1:43:34.620 --> 1:43:37.620]  China.
[1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:41.740]  Hey, I told you don't go to Band.Video.
[1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:43.740]  I'm watching you.
[1:43:43.740 --> 1:43:44.740]  Ha ha.
[1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:47.940]  Our system has been adopted worldwide soon.
[1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:52.740]  We will kill you if you don't do what we say, ha ha ha.
[1:43:52.740 --> 1:43:57.260]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[1:43:57.260 --> 1:44:05.940]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Band.Video or I have to hurt you.
[1:44:05.940 --> 1:44:10.220]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who have been forward.
[1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:15.940]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[1:44:15.940 --> 1:44:20.980]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide and
[1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:26.500]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:27.500]  amazing as well.
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:32.940]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas
[1:44:32.940 --> 1:44:37.980]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:43.420]  been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[1:44:43.420 --> 1:44:48.580]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[1:44:48.580 --> 1:44:53.820]  war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[1:44:53.820 --> 1:44:58.860]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:44:59.860]  at us.
[1:44:59.860 --> 1:45:01.700]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[1:45:01.700 --> 1:45:07.540]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:12.220]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:17.620]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:22.060]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged Silicon
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:27.820]  Valley to censor patriots off the air, Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi
[1:45:27.820 --> 1:45:30.980]  Ping, the dictator of China will, quote, destroy Trump.
[1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:31.980]  That's a headline.
[1:45:31.980 --> 1:45:36.180]  So Info Wars has been the paul revere of this operation.
[1:45:36.180 --> 1:45:40.660]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's
[1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:45.020]  more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their Chai Kong masters
[1:45:45.020 --> 1:45:50.220]  by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[1:45:50.220 --> 1:45:53.700]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.
[1:45:53.700 --> 1:46:07.100]  That's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com.
[1:46:07.100 --> 1:46:09.860]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[1:46:09.860 --> 1:46:11.780]  They think the West is dead.
[1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.740]  They think if they censor nationalist and patriots off the internet you'll just forget
[1:46:14.740 --> 1:46:17.380]  about us and then they'll be the only information out there.
[1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:19.900]  Well, so far that's not been working too well for them.
[1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:24.540]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:29.700]  and well at band.video and now we've added a lot of new functions and a lot of new hosts

[1:47:19.820 --> 1:47:27.220]  show welcome back i'm your host alex jones i'm gonna be hosting the fourth hour of the
[1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:48.460]  broadcast today i'm going to be hosting tonight seven to ten o'clock or so with will johnson
[1:47:48.460 --> 1:47:58.860]  and others with live coverage of the democrat debates this will be the fourth round of debates
[1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:06.420]  all happening now in one night it's in westerville and i was thinking yesterday about what to
[1:48:06.420 --> 1:48:12.620]  call this debate we've called it the clown show the last three times so i was thinking
[1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:18.540]  well it's it's really gonna be a political showdown a political shootout because they're
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:22.660]  really gonna be gunning for biden now that the establishment saying yes he's clearly
[1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:27.340]  had another stroke getting out of there which i could have told him four months ago five
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:34.380]  months ago we did they called it fake news anybody could see it so it's gonna be two
[1:48:34.380 --> 1:48:39.860]  things they're gonna be attacking biden viciously tonight i predict real fireworks this is actually
[1:48:39.860 --> 1:48:47.220]  gonna be an entertaining debate and they're also going to be doubling down on attacking
[1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:53.420]  the president and showing how much they hate trump and how they want him impeached it is
[1:48:53.420 --> 1:49:01.860]  going to be wild and in fact i think the going after trump is going to be more intense and
[1:49:01.860 --> 1:49:06.300]  their support of impeachment and the coup that's happening then you're even going to see the
[1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:11.860]  knives come out for biden but it's it's going to be spectacular so i said where is that
[1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:18.580]  in ohio and scott one producers goes it's a place called westerville i've already said
[1:49:18.580 --> 1:49:22.780]  let's call it the showdown in westerville i said let's call it the shootout they used
[1:49:22.780 --> 1:49:27.300]  to call you know the ut oklahoma game red river shootout they stopped calling it that
[1:49:27.300 --> 1:49:32.460]  because guns are bad no one's saying there's a real shootout back in the old days the outlaws
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:36.940]  used to have shootouts across the red river between oklahoma and north texas took right
[1:49:36.940 --> 1:49:45.620]  up there by dallas so we called it politically correct the showdown in westerville tonight
[1:49:45.620 --> 1:49:50.220]  extended debate coverage and how we're going to do it is we're going to pick the candidates
[1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:59.460]  we're going to listen to it's going to be kamala harris beto and maybe a few others
[1:49:59.460 --> 1:50:07.060]  they brought the congresswoman from hawaii back in it'll be biden pocahontas but a lot
[1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:10.380]  of these we're not going to even listen to when they're talking but we'll have live coverage
[1:50:10.380 --> 1:50:15.140]  on the tv satellite the radio satellite will take all the main feeds info wars dot com
[1:50:15.140 --> 1:50:20.020]  and put it out but the best place to find it'll be info wars dot com forward slash show
[1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:28.180]  or band dot video and you'll see the live feed coverage right there on the front page
[1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:33.300]  and again the chain reaction of you taking action in the election season and saying hey
[1:50:33.300 --> 1:50:38.180]  there's live independent coverage of this debate if you heard info wars oh yeah that's
[1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:42.380]  that site demonize everywhere yeah we'll find out what you're not supposed to hear at band
[1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:46.940]  dot video because you can share info wars dot com forward slash show but you notice
[1:50:46.940 --> 1:50:52.100]  info wars dot com barely shows up in google or even being searches news wars dot com shows
[1:50:52.100 --> 1:51:00.620]  up and so does band dot video so again that's a great way for everybody to share it is band
[1:51:00.620 --> 1:51:05.740]  dot video i want to get into solutions to fight back against these people but one one
[1:51:05.740 --> 1:51:11.220]  big one is just to be active i've been so upset by everything that's happening that
[1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:16.820]  i've done an hour and 50 minutes of broadcast and haven't plugged once and and you hear other
[1:51:16.820 --> 1:51:21.580]  talk show host they plug every break hey this segment brought to you by this hour brought
[1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:26.340]  to you by they do a 30 second or minute plug and that's what you have to do and talk radio
[1:51:26.340 --> 1:51:32.180]  to stay on air because most people tune out during the regular commercials and so when
[1:51:32.180 --> 1:51:35.480]  i talk about how info wars has been in the red quite a bit this year we've been back
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:40.820]  and forth it's mainly because i don't create inventive cool commercials and i don't talk
[1:51:40.820 --> 1:51:44.580]  about how great the products are enough and it's really that simple i just say hey support
[1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:53.060]  us these are great products get them listen to me folks the system knows that iodine causes
[1:51:53.060 --> 1:52:02.460]  higher IQs more immunity stamina libido energy you have to have iodine to live most iodine
[1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:06.780]  is out of the soil it's toxic when it comes out of the ocean in most cases it binds the
[1:52:06.780 --> 1:52:12.660]  toxins it's not as effective when you get it from sea salt but it's better than nothing
[1:52:12.660 --> 1:52:18.540]  we have the best iodine in the world totally pure deep earth crystal you buy stuff at the
[1:52:18.540 --> 1:52:26.940]  topical iodine and drink that will probably kill you pure iodine is seen as grass safe
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:31.940]  by congress and by the FDA because you needed to live but i can't believe no one else puts
[1:52:31.940 --> 1:52:40.540]  out real iodine we do deep earth crystal iodine and then i was talking to a medical doctor
[1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:46.500]  and scientist at the top lab just about two years ago they said listen your x2 is really
[1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:53.420]  good and they said we know you have the regular allowance that's supposed to be in there but
[1:52:53.420 --> 1:52:58.740]  listen that's when it's a bound iodine and not a real one you've got a real one and we
[1:52:58.740 --> 1:53:05.940]  really think you should lower the amount doesn't matter what the system says and you also should
[1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:11.900]  think some people can't absorb pure iodine other folks can't absorb iodine that's not
[1:53:11.900 --> 1:53:17.020]  pure so there are different types two other types of good iodine that are very similar
[1:53:17.020 --> 1:53:23.180]  to the pure atomic but have been altered a bit and that's what x3 is try iodine it's
[1:53:23.180 --> 1:53:29.420]  not to replace x2 it's apples and oranges but i'm going to tell you talk to your physician
[1:53:29.420 --> 1:53:34.140]  do your own research because yeah your body has to have iodine to operate and it makes
[1:53:34.140 --> 1:53:38.300]  your hormones it does everything but if you've never really had iodine you've been deficient
[1:53:38.300 --> 1:53:43.700]  your whole life and your body's using bad halogen to operate it can have some fireworks
[1:53:43.700 --> 1:53:53.100]  but i'm just telling you everyone should try real pure clean iodine there are some people
[1:53:53.100 --> 1:53:57.980]  that are allergic to some types of iodine that's not pure so and if you are one of
[1:53:57.980 --> 1:54:05.100]  the people you know so consult your physician the point is like vitamin c iodine your body
[1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:12.300]  has to have that to operate and the government found there was massive retardation low IQ
[1:54:12.300 --> 1:54:18.740]  the eugenicists thought that people in the midwest and people in the Appalachus and black
[1:54:18.740 --> 1:54:23.460]  people were retarded and that was their argument for wanting to sterilize poor white people
[1:54:23.460 --> 1:54:29.900]  and black people in the 20s and 30s and 40s Hitler got his ideas from us was because there
[1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:36.020]  were so many mentally retarded people because they weren't eating fish and they were going
[1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:41.180]  off fields that weren't left fallow there was no iodine this is mainline history just
[1:54:41.180 --> 1:54:48.420]  type in iodine low IQ or iodine high IQ you'll get mainline reports about the dust bowl the
[1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:53.460]  midwest how a third of the kids were being born with genetic disorders people had low
[1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:58.300]  IQs and and and so people from the east coast that's where the rumor that that people in
[1:54:58.300 --> 1:55:03.540]  the midwest were retarded came from because they came out west and by a generation or
[1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:08.740]  two all the fields had no iodine and there were literally mentally retarded people everywhere
[1:55:08.740 --> 1:55:13.820]  of all these different disorders that you have without iodine so the government started
[1:55:13.820 --> 1:55:23.260]  putting it in the salt by law just a cheap form of it and IQs exploded 15 points on average
[1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:31.740]  the goiters went away all these disorders went away that's just one example folks and
[1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:35.100]  if you go anywhere in the world and find people that have been farming the land too much and
[1:55:35.100 --> 1:55:40.700]  there's no iodine they'll have low IQs and every other person I mean you go to Appalachia
[1:55:40.700 --> 1:55:44.540]  folks still I mean it in a lot of areas a lot of good people there too but I mean you
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:48.580]  go to grocery store something go whoa what the hell is going on here you see all these
[1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:56.780]  genetic disorders all these mutants and it's there's no iodine folks that one thing me
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:56:01.740]  the people oh it's inbreeding everybody marries their cousin no that's not what did it the

[1:59:51.700 --> 2:00:13.540]  till dawn amp formula 3995 at infowarslife.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:21.620]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones you know there's
[2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:25.860]  a reason in every culture before it became an agrarian society sort of settling down
[2:00:25.860 --> 2:00:29.900]  and planting crops that people moved on they would run through the resources in the area
[2:00:29.900 --> 2:00:35.540]  they were in and then ancient agrarian societies would end up leaving where they had their fields
[2:00:35.540 --> 2:00:40.500]  because they would deplete the fields unless they lived on a river delta and then the rivers
[2:00:40.500 --> 2:00:48.340]  would periodically flood the growth belts with new silt from all the fish dying and going
[2:00:48.340 --> 2:00:54.380]  to the bathroom and all the plant matter and so that was a big deal I covered last segment
[2:00:54.380 --> 2:00:59.380]  I didn't mean to go off into an iodine rant but here's an article business insider how
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:04.260]  adding iodine to salt resulted in a decade's worth of IQ gains for the United States I
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:07.540]  mean I didn't intend to go into that last segment so they didn't have all the articles
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:15.780]  up did you know that they add iodine to municipal water in rural areas of China I've shown
[2:01:15.780 --> 2:01:20.660]  the videos from China it shows like a tank that's timored of iodine out in the middle
[2:01:20.660 --> 2:01:28.140]  of a small lake a reservoir and then it goes off periodically and puts iodine in the water
[2:01:28.140 --> 2:01:32.860]  because a large portion of the Chinese were having birth defects mental retardation and
[2:01:32.860 --> 2:01:40.980]  low IQ this is this is not rocket science so when I mentioned that earlier any rural
[2:01:40.980 --> 2:01:54.980]  community living generationally on land that does not get fertilized properly will develop
[2:01:54.980 --> 2:02:03.900]  massive health problems so many forms of cancer there's the New York Times they print
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:09.620]  that for me please China confronts retardation of millions of deficit and iodine I mean see
[2:02:09.620 --> 2:02:14.340]  this is so big here folks because I'm sitting here talking about how they want to take Trump
[2:02:14.340 --> 2:02:25.580]  out because he's good they took iodine out of the salt they started putting in the salt
[2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:30.900]  in the 20s they took it out by the 70s and people do you know I'm not just after talking
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:35.700]  about this stuff they want me off the air because every show whether it's Colbert or
[2:02:35.700 --> 2:02:41.020]  whether it's the good doctor or whether it's homeland or whether it's all these Netflix
[2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:45.860]  movies where they say it's about me they tell you it's Alex Jones then they have the guy
[2:02:45.860 --> 2:02:51.180]  commit crimes they always attack me and say I'm making it up that the children are being
[2:02:51.180 --> 2:02:56.620]  poisoned with vaccines I can show you stacks of mainstream news where vaccines are killing
[2:02:56.620 --> 2:03:05.100]  people or they're not effective or how we harp on the fluoride that is the bad halogen
[2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:11.100]  it's in the same area the periodic table as iodine iodine's what you need if you don't
[2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:17.900]  have iodine you will slowly die but if they put fluoride in its place or bromide or bromine
[2:03:17.900 --> 2:03:24.820]  you will die even faster because your body will suck it up the mother is deficient while
[2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:32.060]  she's pregnant the cognitive development of the fetus is impeded and the effects are irreversible
[2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:35.980]  to this day the world health organization estimates that only 50 million people suffer
[2:03:35.980 --> 2:03:40.420]  from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency and you wonder why people
[2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:45.460]  are so stupid they're not just not having the iodine they got fluoride on top of it
[2:03:45.460 --> 2:03:50.780]  in their water and what did the main line studies come out the American medical journal
[2:03:50.780 --> 2:03:59.380]  two months ago said fluoride is causing massive IQ reductions birth defects cancer but it
[2:03:59.380 --> 2:04:07.260]  doesn't matter the good doctor show on ABC last night said this is an Alex Jones character
[2:04:07.260 --> 2:04:17.020]  and we're taking on Alex Jones that's in news articles and then I'm a crazy person that
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:22.980]  doesn't want fluoride in the water and is warning you about vaccines see see how it
[2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:31.660]  works it's all funny to them but let me assure you the ABC producers aren't vaccinating their
[2:04:31.660 --> 2:04:37.500]  children and they're not drinking fluoride I will assure you that's for your children
[2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:45.700]  that's for you know something for you because these people are so fallen and so wicked and
[2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:53.740]  they're so spiritually short that they have Napoleonic envy of your grandeur and they want
[2:04:53.740 --> 2:05:00.940]  to pull you down with them well I don't want to see that happen I want to see that stop
[2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:09.300]  will you join me I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers when force your
[2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:14.980]  support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[2:05:14.980 --> 2:05:20.420]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US worldwide and President
[2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:27.020]  Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well
[2:05:27.020 --> 2:05:31.980]  he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[2:05:31.980 --> 2:05:37.020]  but tried in the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:42.460]  been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[2:05:42.460 --> 2:05:47.660]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose their
[2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:52.860]  war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[2:05:52.860 --> 2:05:57.900]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[2:05:57.900 --> 2:06:13.940]  at us that's an attempt to moralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and
[2:06:13.940 --> 2:06:37.340]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones all right folks alex jones
[2:06:37.340 --> 2:06:43.580]  here back live i want to get into solutions to stop the absolutely out of control tyranny
[2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:49.540]  that is taking place in the attempted coup by this multinational consortium against our
[2:06:49.540 --> 2:06:58.580]  nation we have sargon of a cod who's going to be in studio with us as well coming up
[2:06:58.580 --> 2:07:07.260]  there's so much i want to get into here today but the first thing that i want to play is
[2:07:07.260 --> 2:07:17.420]  lebron james caves to china blast uneducated rockets gm because you can't talk about that
[2:07:17.420 --> 2:07:26.020]  enough you really can't speak to someone who has grown up in the lap of free country made
[2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:31.140]  450 million dollars and then shoots their mouth off about how much the country sucks
[2:07:31.140 --> 2:07:38.860]  all day and how bad it is and then communist china that hands down is the most abusive
[2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:46.020]  murderous controlling group in the world and then he calls the manager of the rockets uneducated
[2:07:46.020 --> 2:08:06.660]  uninformed it's just the arrogance is beyond nauseating and sad it's the selfishness factor
[2:08:06.660 --> 2:08:16.540]  where these people are so selfish they're like stupid and because of sociopaths lebron
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:21.180]  james is definitely a sociopath they always they were telling you how virtuous they are
[2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:27.500]  and how good they are but always targeting things that aren't bad and then they're always
[2:08:27.500 --> 2:08:42.860]  defending things that are bad because these people are puppets these people are evil now
[2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:49.060]  i'm gonna get to that in a moment but some things have happened where i've been so busy
[2:08:49.060 --> 2:08:55.900]  covering the coup that i i constantly feel like i'm not doing something i'm supposed
[2:08:55.900 --> 2:09:00.540]  to be doing and my subconscious mind that's more powerful my conscious mind is angry at
[2:09:00.540 --> 2:09:10.340]  me and is saying jones there's something else you're not doing there's something else
[2:09:10.340 --> 2:09:14.900]  that we're not covering and it's just screaming at me screaming at me screaming at me screaming
[2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:20.860]  at me screaming at me and i intellectually try to figure out what it is and this voice
[2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:30.260]  has never been wrong and my inner voice is is is not angry with me it's pleading with
[2:09:30.260 --> 2:09:35.780]  me to the point of i just almost can't even do the show anymore i need to go away for
[2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:43.220]  a few days and i need to figure out exactly what it is i need to do because we've trailblazed
[2:09:43.220 --> 2:09:49.300]  a lot we've we've we've changed the paradigm we've done a lot of good but we have to catch
[2:09:49.300 --> 2:09:55.220]  the next paradigm the next side guys we have to be a thousand steps ahead of the enemy and
[2:09:55.220 --> 2:10:03.500]  i'm only a hundred steps ahead of them right now and that's not good and i routinely have
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:08.980]  epiphanies about how to bring the enemy down i don't pull over and write it down and i know
[2:10:08.980 --> 2:10:18.580]  that these are the answers to our predicament in our conundrum but let me just say this
[2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:29.180]  right now the big solution from 35 000 feet is god is real the devils real this is a spiritual
[2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:35.420]  battle and the globalists want to hurt innocent people and dominate society and culture and
[2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:41.540]  are psychotic and they don't mean well they're not just mistaken and you're not going to
[2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:47.420]  convince them and the decadence and largesse of free societies has created a lot of decadent
[2:10:47.420 --> 2:10:55.100]  evil corrupt people who now are being organized into armies to take political action against
[2:10:55.100 --> 2:11:02.500]  those of us that are moral and those of us that have connections to god because it's
[2:11:02.500 --> 2:11:13.860]  a spiritual battle and we are to be conquered and bound and basically tortured look what
[2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:22.780]  the globalists do to children look at how they inflict pain and suffering and debilitation
[2:11:22.780 --> 2:11:27.620]  i mean i hear the so-called medical shows that they have all over the news and on radio
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:32.380]  they're like don't take vitamins you don't need multivitamins they're toxic they're bad
[2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:36.900]  none of those studies are real none of that's true all the real studies show that people
[2:11:36.900 --> 2:11:44.420]  are chronically deficient and that IQs are dropping and cancers exploding because your
[2:11:44.420 --> 2:11:49.460]  cells don't have the materials they need to operate with so they'll use other materials
[2:11:49.460 --> 2:11:54.940]  to operate with and then they'll mutate to be able to operate i mean if all you drank
[2:11:54.940 --> 2:12:02.540]  was jack daniels your liver if it didn't fail would mutate to be able to process that and
[2:12:02.540 --> 2:12:12.140]  that that's called cancer i mean i mentioned this earlier i didn't mean to go there but
[2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:16.500]  i started talking about how in china they had tens of millions of people totally mentally
[2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:21.540]  retarded because they didn't have any iodine in the soil because they didn't wrote they
[2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:31.140]  wrote they didn't rotate the crops and then i had the crew print a bunch of articles where
[2:12:31.140 --> 2:12:39.380]  they admit all this and it just made me completely angry i mean the system knows that you're
[2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:44.860]  infertile and get cancer and have low IQ when you don't have iodine in utero and then after
[2:12:44.860 --> 2:12:49.420]  you're born it's even worse here's the headlines how adding iodine to salt resulted in decades
[2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:55.220]  worth of IQ gains for the united states business insider all the studies china confronts retardation
[2:12:55.220 --> 2:13:07.660]  of millions deficit in iodine new york times 1996 not your same new york times and again
[2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:13.300]  the system knows that the average person is massively deficient in iodine they know it's
[2:13:13.300 --> 2:13:19.340]  the missing link that without it you die a long excruciating debilitating death they
[2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:23.740]  know that a lot of a lot of the neurological disorders that are expanding getting worse
[2:13:23.740 --> 2:13:32.480]  are because people don't have this basic nutrient but they won't tell anybody that i've had
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:43.100]  medical doctors on tell steve wallick talks about this he found this all out was he was
[2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:50.980]  the chief medical guy at a major zoo and they hadn't had most of the animals were dying
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:55.380]  and then he found out they weren't giving him a multivitamin and then he found out it
[2:13:55.380 --> 2:14:03.940]  was specifically certain nutrients they were missing like iodine and copper and things
[2:14:03.940 --> 2:14:12.220]  like that and they know just like your car runs on a certain type of gas or an engine
[2:14:12.220 --> 2:14:18.940]  runs on a certain type of oil and then you don't have that and so we could talk about
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:25.380]  solutions here you know go take over congress you know go to their offices you tell them
[2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:32.020]  how the cow ate the cabbage or how the cabbage ate the cow pray for revival call talk radio
[2:14:32.020 --> 2:14:37.500]  file suits against mainstream media for lying to you but the biggest thing is just get active
[2:14:37.500 --> 2:14:43.060]  just get involved and realize how much trouble we're in and how serious things are and call
[2:14:43.060 --> 2:14:49.820]  congress the good members of congress and tell them we back you be men be strong don't
[2:14:49.820 --> 2:14:56.980]  give into tyranny or what's coming is far worse really it just comes down to man up
[2:14:56.980 --> 2:15:01.100]  and say you're not going to be conquered and you're not going to sell out to the threats
[2:15:01.100 --> 2:15:05.380]  because you didn't sell out for the money so now why would anybody sell out to the threats
[2:15:05.380 --> 2:15:09.420]  but people are calling each other calling you out the threats are really getting bad
[2:15:09.420 --> 2:15:15.380]  I'm thinking about quitting and I'm like no you better not quit you better hold the course
[2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:19.140]  will tell me what's happening yeah yeah that's happened to me too well you know it's going
[2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:24.540]  to be worse if you let them have their way that people folks like yeah you're right but
[2:15:24.540 --> 2:15:30.140]  those are the discussions going on with prominent people in this country I mean the stuff going
[2:15:30.140 --> 2:15:34.420]  on behind the scenes is just unbelievable and I'm not going to get into it on air for
[2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:38.620]  a lot of reasons but I think you can imagine what's going on I mean it's a it's a campaign
[2:15:38.620 --> 2:15:43.620]  of terror and I didn't really get to the big inch a lot of yet I'll get to it was Sargon

[2:20:28.740 --> 2:20:51.740]  carl benjamin aka sargon of a cod very popular writer researcher was what i guess a statistician
[2:20:51.740 --> 2:20:57.220]  researcher with the private companies in british government before he got politically involved
[2:20:57.220 --> 2:21:02.500]  now he's reached billions of views on youtube and their platforms sargon of a cod from the
[2:21:02.500 --> 2:21:07.500]  uk back in studio with us he was here about a month and a half ago and i was asking him
[2:21:07.500 --> 2:21:12.020]  what he wants to get into first and he's got a whole stack of info wars articles he's saying
[2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:15.780]  he'd like to break down but i first wanted to welcome you back in studio thank you very
[2:21:15.780 --> 2:21:21.820]  much and i want to just bring this up clearly the deep stage trying to throw trump out clearly
[2:21:21.820 --> 2:21:25.100]  they're trying to stop riggs it's the same group of globalists they admit that the financial
[2:21:25.100 --> 2:21:30.940]  times of london and other establishment mouthpieces and now they're bringing forward frauds against
[2:21:30.940 --> 2:21:35.580]  trump it's been proven to be a fraud the book john bolton the warmongering neocon turns
[2:21:35.580 --> 2:21:41.180]  out is the source of all this that's all confirmed we said that a few weeks ago it's just insane
[2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:46.700]  and they are telegraphing that they will remove him this time this is different the rhetoric
[2:21:46.700 --> 2:21:54.140]  is different they've got the some of the conservative establishment ready to do it if they're successful
[2:21:54.140 --> 2:21:58.580]  which if we don't get really politically involved and speak out and say no they may be they have
[2:21:58.580 --> 2:22:02.740]  a good chance if we don't put pressure on some of those republicans and democrats in
[2:22:02.740 --> 2:22:08.260]  those swing states if we don't do that the deep state is going to remove trump and i'm
[2:22:08.260 --> 2:22:13.580]  sure of it even if i don't call for rebellion or you don't call for rebellion which i'm
[2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:18.820]  not intending to do other people are going to and it's going to be explosive and then
[2:22:18.820 --> 2:22:23.420]  i think a few steps on the globalists the e u that's in competition with the us and
[2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:29.020]  the uk they're allied with the chai cons they said they are adabos they want a civil war
[2:22:29.020 --> 2:22:37.340]  or a societal kind of 1960s burning cities type crisis and that's why none of this makes
[2:22:37.340 --> 2:22:41.340]  sense if you want to have a good prosperous nation but the people running america say
[2:22:41.340 --> 2:22:46.420]  it shouldn't even exist to begin with same people run in the uk so i think that's why
[2:22:46.420 --> 2:22:52.820]  we're seeing this illogical cruising the western ship towards the rocks you're a smart philosopher
[2:22:52.820 --> 2:22:56.900]  smart historian sargon what is your view on what i just said and what is your gut on it
[2:22:56.900 --> 2:23:01.660]  um right so uh i i haven't been a statistician for the british government i just want to
[2:23:01.660 --> 2:23:07.340]  be clear um i'm just a guy who who well i got confused you said you work for over to
[2:23:07.340 --> 2:23:12.940]  a big i i stat steels and and and and no no no no sociological research for no no no
[2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:18.060]  no i i didn't i didn't say that i i used to just work at um the research councils just
[2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:23.060]  updating their website really wasn't anything particularly exciting um but the the the interesting
[2:23:23.060 --> 2:23:26.460]  thing at the moment i think i want to go back to that and we'll get to it okay because i
[2:23:26.460 --> 2:23:29.820]  looked that up i mean i'm not saying you're the president or the prime minister of tim
[2:23:29.820 --> 2:23:34.540]  buck too or something those research councils do the statistician research and work on them
[2:23:34.540 --> 2:23:39.980]  in england loves stats you you worked on stats and then yeah no no no but i i just um i just
[2:23:39.980 --> 2:23:46.460]  did website updating i was an it consultant tank okay good yeah um but yeah so um there
[2:23:46.460 --> 2:23:50.860]  were a lot of issues there that you you brought up um i do think that china is one of the most
[2:23:50.860 --> 2:23:56.140]  interesting ones at the moment because i see a lot of um left-wingers frankly a lot of the
[2:23:56.140 --> 2:24:01.060]  left-wing activists a lot of left-wing journalists essentially wanting to support china and tacitly
[2:24:01.060 --> 2:24:05.620]  supporting china whereas china is by pretty much any definition at this point a fascist
[2:24:05.620 --> 2:24:11.980]  state it's actually a command economy it's a dictatorship it's absolutely sensorious
[2:24:11.980 --> 2:24:17.980]  and if you look at what's going on in hong kong um various activists are turning up dead
[2:24:17.980 --> 2:24:23.340]  and strip naked floating along the river and these are just these are young people as well
[2:24:23.340 --> 2:24:29.100]  um no confirmed proof that this was necessarily chinese malfeasance but i think well as a top
[2:24:29.100 --> 2:24:37.100]  statistician what do we do i think it would be pretty ridiculous to suggest that this is not
[2:24:37.100 --> 2:24:40.940]  the consequence of the chinese government because it is actually millions of people
[2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:45.500]  processing in hong kong waving british flags american flags saying that china are nasties
[2:24:45.500 --> 2:24:49.820]  and they want freedom and i think that we do have an ethical obligation to support that and
[2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:55.260]  it's the the reason that this is so important is because on the flip side of it you've got
[2:24:55.260 --> 2:25:01.420]  trump pulling out of syria and the left at the moment going wild about how we're betraying the
[2:25:01.420 --> 2:25:07.900]  Kurds um this is the same left that constantly complains about us imperialism and had nothing
[2:25:07.900 --> 2:25:12.300]  to say about donald trump's pledge to pull out of the middle east and now that he's done that
[2:25:12.300 --> 2:25:16.620]  everyone's complaining so he's put in an unwinnable position what's he supposed to do
[2:25:18.460 --> 2:25:21.580]  you're right in fact i probably should have started with china i've been all over that
[2:25:21.580 --> 2:25:27.500]  today and i want to burrow into that first because this is a rosetta stone that just
[2:25:27.500 --> 2:25:32.780]  decodes everything here's communist china undoubtedly the most oppressive country to ever exist
[2:25:33.420 --> 2:25:37.020]  taiwan has a treaty that china shouldn't be taking it over and running it right now
[2:25:37.020 --> 2:25:41.820]  they are and then a few people in the league say oh this is terrible we should report hong kong
[2:25:41.820 --> 2:25:46.540]  the league turns on them lebron james turns on them and says they're ignorant why would people
[2:25:46.540 --> 2:25:52.780]  be cheerleading for an authoritarian state i can only assume it's political partisanship
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:58.780]  because they say well we're the socialist communist government of china and these people agree with
[2:25:58.780 --> 2:26:04.220]  that i think there's a distinct trend of anti americanism that underpins the whole thing as well
[2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:10.780]  i think um at the moment the there's been there's been a basic inversion of values as far as i can
[2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:17.740]  see the the nba players kneeling for the american flag but um standing up and and supporting what the
[2:26:17.740 --> 2:26:22.460]  chinese government is doing and all of these companies uh are not the the major corporations
[2:26:22.460 --> 2:26:27.740]  who are currently bending the need to china are not in my in my opinion ideologically invested
[2:26:27.740 --> 2:26:31.500]  i think they're financially invested because they're looking at a market of 1.3 billion people
[2:26:31.500 --> 2:26:36.300]  and saying well we'd like to buy into that so it's just pure absolute greed by the mid-level
[2:26:36.300 --> 2:26:40.380]  people but i would say on top the big corporations are part of the globalist system they help put
[2:26:40.380 --> 2:26:45.420]  the communists in power there and they like that command and control i don't know if they i don't
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:51.180]  i mean i'm thinking of corporations like apple uh the and you know the the silicon valley types
[2:26:51.180 --> 2:26:57.180]  who are google especially who have been cooperating because they want access to this giant market
[2:26:57.180 --> 2:27:02.620]  it's deeply unethical but they weren't in existence when china became communist so i wouldn't say that
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:07.740]  they put them in control but i would definitely say that they should be doing what the guys at
[2:27:07.740 --> 2:27:15.660]  south park are doing and they should be essentially flipping them off well if you go back and you're
[2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:20.300]  right apple didn't exist then apples move there officially they've given the code keys they're
[2:27:20.300 --> 2:27:25.180]  now basically chinese based google's helping them with their ai not helping us but if you look at
[2:27:25.180 --> 2:27:29.420]  the big corporations that helped put the seed money into apple and google and the rest of it
[2:27:29.420 --> 2:27:34.060]  uh the Rockefeller foundation and others were intimately involved helping put malin and double
[2:27:34.060 --> 2:27:39.660]  crossing shankai shek in 1949 right i'm not i'm not uh so well versed on chinese history as i
[2:27:39.660 --> 2:27:44.380]  should be actually so i'm not i'm not able to comment on that but it is genuinely disturbing
[2:27:44.380 --> 2:27:51.020]  that china is basically going to uh employ silicon valley to create the kind of dystopian
[2:27:51.020 --> 2:27:58.060]  uh technocratic order that all well essentially alludes to in 1984 this is something that should
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:03.100]  be resisted at all costs let's start over then with that because there's so much to get into
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:08.140]  and i want to play some clips and i agree we should start with china and i didn't open the
[2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:13.020]  phones up tomorrow uh so some people can call in about this subject because i already don't like
[2:28:13.020 --> 2:28:17.660]  lebron james for his america hating and you know supporting people taking a knee and they have that
[2:28:17.660 --> 2:28:22.620]  right i'd like to say it's a bunch of bull but then exactly they love the most authoritarian
[2:28:22.620 --> 2:28:28.860]  state in history it's the inversion and it just seems like there's such america hating or such a
[2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:34.380]  loathing of the west that whatever's different from us these people embrace even if it's jumping
[2:28:34.380 --> 2:28:40.380]  down a mine shaft they really seem to they it's their words not ours they're the ones who are
[2:28:40.380 --> 2:28:46.620]  saying that we we actually support what china does no borders no wall no usa at all you have the same
[2:28:46.620 --> 2:28:52.300]  thing yeah over in the uk we're right back we're gonna get into this and into the impeachment

[2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:37.500]  well carl benjamin sargon of a cove was just handled just a joke handling came up with
[2:33:37.500 --> 2:33:44.700]  billions of views on youtube other platforms he is an english liberal youtuber and as a
[2:33:44.700 --> 2:33:50.620]  million subscribers there's political philosophy the far left and the far right islam day to day
[2:33:50.620 --> 2:33:55.580]  politics of the uk i'd call him a gentleman but he's been attacked by antifub
[2:33:57.740 --> 2:34:01.180]  they've uh you know tried to silence him banned off twitter because he's effective
[2:34:01.980 --> 2:34:07.980]  and so he can really speak to lebron james literally bowing to china and saying that the
[2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:13.820]  manager of the rockets was stupid he's just shut up that you got speech but you caused the problem
[2:34:13.820 --> 2:34:19.260]  you're not educated on the facts which just like espn shows the chinese communist model
[2:34:19.980 --> 2:34:24.620]  of china showing the south china sea all belonging to them part of vietnam part of the
[2:34:24.620 --> 2:34:31.500]  philippines part of japan part of south korea they claim it all because they've got maps from
[2:34:31.500 --> 2:34:40.700]  a thousand years ago where they said it was theirs then oh so it's on folks and lebron james bowing
[2:34:40.700 --> 2:34:47.820]  down to all of it carl people are what three thousand plus arrest a year on average in the
[2:34:47.820 --> 2:34:52.620]  uk you're an expert on this because you've witnessed your friends being arrested you name it yeah i
[2:34:52.620 --> 2:34:58.140]  paid don't don't don't count dank you love killing it all these people and then meanwhile carpe
[2:34:58.140 --> 2:35:04.860]  docked him banned off twitter yesterday for sharing a meme uh of uh you know what was unfolding uh and
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:12.300]  also sharing some information dealing with uh the big scoop that the folks over at project veritas
[2:35:12.300 --> 2:35:19.340]  got now they put him back up because of pressure but what we've seen practiced in europe is now
[2:35:19.340 --> 2:35:26.060]  coming here and you were tying it in to what's happening with the mba and china please get back
[2:35:26.060 --> 2:35:31.820]  into that um i think in the united states you're probably insulated from this because your first
[2:35:31.820 --> 2:35:39.340]  amendment uh so don't ever let them take that away um but they the social pressure for not supporting
[2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:45.340]  china is weird and i honestly i mean it's it's such a developing story i don't even know what to
[2:35:45.340 --> 2:35:54.620]  say about it because i mean what what reason does lebron james give for being in pro china what i
[2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:58.140]  haven't been able to keep up with the story because i was traveling so what was the reason
[2:35:58.140 --> 2:36:03.820]  that gave for for supporting china i mean what did he say exactly well he said a lot in statements
[2:36:03.820 --> 2:36:08.300]  and then we have a short video clip but he basically said that the general manager of the
[2:36:08.300 --> 2:36:15.340]  rockets was ignorant and stupid for saying the fight for freedom stand with hong kong that's all he
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:20.940]  tweeted really yeah in fact let's go ahead and play a clip of what uh lebron lebron james actually
[2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:26.620]  had to say that's this causing a firestorm right now yeah this freedom of speech yes we all do
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:31.340]  have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can't happen
[2:36:32.860 --> 2:36:35.900]  when you're not thinking about others and only are you only thinking about yourself so
[2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:43.020]  i don't believe i don't want to get into a word word or sentence feud with daryl
[2:36:43.900 --> 2:36:50.940]  with daryl moray but i believe he wasn't educated on on the situation at hand and um and he spoke
[2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:57.420]  and so many people could have been harmed not only financially but physically emotionally
[2:36:57.420 --> 2:37:03.660]  spiritually so just be careful what we what we tweet and we say and what we do even though yes
[2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:11.900]  we do have freedom of speech but there can be what do you make of that i don't know why he's
[2:37:11.900 --> 2:37:19.100]  supporting china i mean there are so many reasons why it's bizarre that he's in favor of china on
[2:37:19.100 --> 2:37:23.260]  this i mean for a start like you say the the maps they had a thousand years ago that uh
[2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:28.860]  they allows them to claim things they the the chinese are quite ethno nationalist as in they
[2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:33.180]  they think that because people might be genetically similar to them then they should come under the
[2:37:33.180 --> 2:37:37.660]  purview of the chinese state that's very similar to what the nazis did that's that's what the complaint
[2:37:37.660 --> 2:37:42.540]  about the alt right is is that they're they're racial identity i'm glad you bring that up because
[2:37:43.340 --> 2:37:47.340]  let's just be clear and i don't need to name drop or you know i got black friends or whatever
[2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:53.980]  my sister's korean adopted she's awesome she's wonderful and in korea if your parents aren't
[2:37:53.980 --> 2:37:57.580]  married then the then the child is seen as a ghost child that's why they have a lot of children
[2:37:58.300 --> 2:38:01.980]  that you know end up being adopted over here so i love asians are great people
[2:38:01.980 --> 2:38:06.620]  communist china's killed more asians than anybody in history as you're saying and they're very
[2:38:07.500 --> 2:38:12.940]  ethno based in fact it's reported by many sociologists that the chinese on average the most
[2:38:12.940 --> 2:38:17.740]  racist group of people on earth but don't worry they can lecture us through hollywood that they own
[2:38:17.740 --> 2:38:22.460]  how bad we are because they know we care about that they manipulate us when as you said they're
[2:38:22.460 --> 2:38:28.460]  very similar to hitler at least their government yeah and uh no i i it's not us it's not overstating
[2:38:28.460 --> 2:38:34.620]  the case to say that either and there is a general attitude towards black people in china that i
[2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:39.340]  don't think lebron james would appreciate it's very negative they i don't even want to really
[2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:43.580]  repeat it because that's why if i ever get to meet mike tyson i was almost on his podcast
[2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:48.620]  but it didn't happen when i was out in la i'm gonna say hey mike but don't knock me out but
[2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:53.980]  you know mousy tongue didn't like black people so i mean what why you gotta tell what watch put
[2:38:53.980 --> 2:38:59.340]  hitler on the other arm mike you don't have to go that far back this is a common opinion about
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:04.620]  black people in china now that they're inferior and so it's very interesting how he's defending the
[2:39:04.620 --> 2:39:10.300]  honor of the chinese state i'm guessing that there's a lot of money at stake for him to be able to
[2:39:10.300 --> 2:39:15.260]  to be able to do this um but yeah they're completely against free speech they're happy with a complete
[2:39:15.260 --> 2:39:20.220]  surveillance state with the social credit score they are a one-party anti-democratic system
[2:39:20.780 --> 2:39:26.380]  essentially they're a fascist economy what on earth is he defending other than his own bottom line
[2:39:27.260 --> 2:39:33.420]  well that's what it is is that he's defending his bottom line which he could do that if it
[2:39:33.420 --> 2:39:37.660]  just be an authoritarian booster if he didn't constantly i mean i don't know if you follow the
[2:39:37.660 --> 2:39:41.820]  bronch James because you're in the uk but i don't know it trumps a nazi trumps the worst thing
[2:39:42.620 --> 2:39:49.420]  black lives matter cops are evil america sucks but then meanwhile he's made 450 million dollars here
[2:39:49.420 --> 2:39:56.060]  nobody's ever done anything to him but china literally has two million wiggers in concentration
[2:39:56.060 --> 2:40:02.140]  camps they kill buddhas they kill christian it's not debated and he loves them they are apparently
[2:40:02.140 --> 2:40:07.660]  harvesting organs from muslims at this point so you would think that a lot of people in the west
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:12.540]  who are usually quite concerned about islamophobia would have a few things to say about but nothing
[2:40:13.100 --> 2:40:20.060]  silence but what by the way i've had some people go oh you know that those are muslims put them in
[2:40:20.060 --> 2:40:24.700]  camps no the wiggers have not been attacking people they've not been doing anything they haven't
[2:40:24.700 --> 2:40:29.340]  been globalized the saudi arabians haven't gotten their hands on them they're like ancient muslims
[2:40:29.340 --> 2:40:33.340]  and the point is i don't care who they are just because muslims kill people and put people in
[2:40:33.340 --> 2:40:37.820]  camps sometimes doesn't mean we do it to them yeah it doesn't mean we stoop down to that level
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:43.020]  agree there's there's no justification for ethnic cleansing in the way that china is doing it at
[2:40:43.020 --> 2:40:49.740]  all uh this it's it's atrocious and then to be completely again i mean and the worst part is
[2:40:49.740 --> 2:40:54.540]  the people who want freedom in hong kong are being pathologized they're being told that they're
[2:40:54.540 --> 2:40:59.740]  bad people are being told that what they what they want and their own independence is is a terrible
[2:40:59.740 --> 2:41:06.060]  thing because of the nba's bottom line that's awful and let's go further as you know they have
[2:41:06.060 --> 2:41:11.580]  a treaty that for several more decades uh there was a treaty with the uh england that china doesn't
[2:41:11.580 --> 2:41:16.140]  get hong kong yes and so it's semi-autonomous they're violating all that yeah they're they're
[2:41:16.140 --> 2:41:22.540]  trying to they're trying to incorporate it into china well i think this is a big wake up moment
[2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:27.180]  for people that everybody knows communist china is very authoritarian and to have all the super
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:33.660]  woke black athletes that normally lecture us how evil america is falling down uh to you know rub
[2:41:33.660 --> 2:41:39.740]  the feet of china people are really like what the hell's going on here it's not something i would have
[2:41:39.740 --> 2:41:46.460]  expected to be honest and that there are quite a few um uh woke leftists who i've i've read articles
[2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:54.940]  and blogs by woke black leftists who've gone to south uh to asia to east asia and said i get treated
[2:41:54.940 --> 2:42:01.020]  like an outsider here because i'm black um there's no diversity there there's no representation
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:07.580]  they don't put black people on tv unless they're mocking them so i don't know why anyone from uh
[2:42:07.580 --> 2:42:13.340]  let's just be honest in in in china and places they they go to the basketball games as a freak show
[2:42:13.340 --> 2:42:20.060]  yeah yeah so it's all a big joke in asia they they have very very very negative opinions and we're
[2:42:20.060 --> 2:42:23.660]  not going to say what they say i don't want to yeah we're not going to say what they say on
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:27.900]  chinese tv about black people but let's just say good thing the black folks don't speak chinese
[2:42:28.860 --> 2:42:36.220]  probably but the i've seen the sketch with the you know yeah it's it's it's it's shocking frankly
[2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:40.700]  and i i'm someone who likes edgy humor but it's still quite surprising to me i mean there's it's
[2:42:40.700 --> 2:42:44.860]  not just blackface too folks they i'm not going to even repeat it on air because the left will say
[2:42:44.860 --> 2:42:49.180]  i'm saying it that didn't defend china because the lefts ally with china they are and they're on the
[2:42:49.180 --> 2:42:52.700]  payroll actually i don't know if they're on the payroll but oh no china owns the majority of the
[2:42:52.700 --> 2:42:58.460]  hollywood oh i wouldn't be surprised if i i think that the the concern about the market share is
[2:42:58.460 --> 2:43:04.460]  definitely the driving force here we'll be back stay weathered ladies and gentlemen i knew it would

[2:44:13.580 --> 2:44:17.820]  authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic
[2:44:17.820 --> 2:44:23.260]  community that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile
[2:44:23.260 --> 2:44:28.780]  his tax exempt again offshore well trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:33.420]  throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist

[2:44:45.980 --> 2:44:51.660]  and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat and i've been saying that prayer
[2:44:51.660 --> 2:44:58.060]  for 20 plus years and god is delivering because god is great thank god for his son jesus christ
[2:44:58.060 --> 2:45:07.820]  and now let's move forward against the n w now is the critical time to keep him full wars on the
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:13.740]  year everything we've warned of is now being exposed and is out in the open want to be clear
[2:45:13.740 --> 2:45:20.620]  it's not coming true it was already true i didn't predict all this it was already going on now the
[2:45:20.620 --> 2:45:26.300]  globalists are making their move with the chai comms so it's naked it's brazen this is the point
[2:45:26.300 --> 2:45:31.580]  when the enemy emerges it's like before world war two the polls kept warning that nazi germany was
[2:45:31.580 --> 2:45:37.260]  going to attack them nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened
[2:45:37.260 --> 2:45:42.620]  we're at that same point and we're all paul reviers who need to be out there warning everyone
[2:45:42.620 --> 2:45:47.820]  about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight and thank god america and the world
[2:45:47.820 --> 2:45:54.620]  is waking up at the 11th hour 58 minute but will it be too little too late that's up to you this

[2:45:59.900 --> 2:46:07.100]  com but whatever you do spread the word about the live transmission china was already running the
[2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:13.100]  united states you're like well china could never take over the u.s that's right as the roman historian
[2:46:13.100 --> 2:46:20.460]  and senator cicero warned a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within
[2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:27.420]  so yes they're coming for your guns all of them yes they're coming for your children they've already
[2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:32.860]  taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like info wars dot com
[2:46:32.860 --> 2:46:39.500]  and band on video so now you know why i'm so upset now you know why i'm so angry i saw the producers
[2:46:39.500 --> 2:46:44.940]  of south park on tv they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because they see
[2:46:44.940 --> 2:46:50.780]  all of their freedom their american freedom hard fought taken away are you going to get upset
[2:46:50.780 --> 2:46:55.180]  well you're a listener you're obviously already upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere
[2:46:55.180 --> 2:46:59.980]  until others they've got to get upset and then take action and let congress everybody else know
[2:46:59.980 --> 2:47:09.020]  that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell america out of the china's you're listening to
[2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:36.380]  the alex jones show all right ladies and gentlemen sargon abacad is here with us
[2:47:36.380 --> 2:47:39.740]  you writing shotgun i intend in the next hour
[2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:45.420]  double the phones up a little bit in the last 30 minutes but i haven't picked the topic yet
[2:47:45.420 --> 2:47:49.900]  maybe i'll just say if you have a question for mr benjamin that you can call in and talk to him if
[2:47:49.900 --> 2:47:55.660]  you're a fan of his we'll see you've got a whole stack of news there topics you want to get into
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:48:01.500]  and i'm glad you want to talk about this particular story because that's actually where i was planning
[2:48:01.500 --> 2:48:07.340]  to go next hour the war on masculinity and then separately paul wrote an article for info wars
[2:48:07.340 --> 2:48:12.940]  dot com yesterday that i meant to cover that i forgot you guys reprint it for me about forbs
[2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:21.100]  killing women to vacation alone in past soon held a conny network regions of pakistan i want to
[2:48:21.100 --> 2:48:26.300]  explain something any westerner going there has better than a 50-50 chance in those areas of being
[2:48:26.300 --> 2:48:31.660]  kidnapped and or murdered i mean even the pakistani military doesn't go in most those areas but then
[2:48:31.660 --> 2:48:37.020]  it shows this woman saying it's healthy it's fun it's safe and a picture of her meanwhile women
[2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:44.300]  are getting murdered all over and it's just weird fetish of saying oh no go to turk menistan usbekistan
[2:48:45.260 --> 2:48:51.820]  go to areas held by al-qaeda in africa where commandos don't go and so separately they're
[2:48:51.820 --> 2:48:57.660]  telling men don't be masculine but they're they're like telling women though somewhere
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:49:03.020]  that's going to get you killed it's totally safe what the hell's going on is a really good question
[2:49:03.020 --> 2:49:10.220]  isn't it there's there's there's a long list of people mostly young women who have been murdered
[2:49:10.220 --> 2:49:16.380]  traveling around the middle east on their own there was a woman who wore a bridesmaid's dress or
[2:49:16.380 --> 2:49:21.660]  a bridesdress who was murdered in turkey who was traveling alone there were two women who were killed
[2:49:21.660 --> 2:49:28.380]  in north africa i can't remember if it was morocco or algeria they were beheaded by isis militants
[2:49:29.420 --> 2:49:36.140]  and there have been numerous others and so for them to put it was a what it was a travel blogger
[2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:42.140]  who's a young lady and she has spent i think six months in the northern areas of pakistan
[2:49:42.140 --> 2:49:47.660]  where she's been traveling alone i don't know what the the chances of being killed on these
[2:49:47.660 --> 2:49:54.540]  expeditions are but i personally wouldn't consider it a safe thing to do as a man let alone as a woman
[2:49:55.260 --> 2:50:01.980]  wandering alone through some of these regions uh there was in i think i think it was um it was
[2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:06.860]  one of the ex-soviet states in central asia where they were on the bike ride that was on the bike
[2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:11.740]  ride there's so many examples you can't even yeah exactly there are genuinely a lot of examples of
[2:50:11.740 --> 2:50:17.580]  this and i think that that is actually quite irresponsible for them to recommend just because
[2:50:17.580 --> 2:50:22.220]  this one woman has had a positive experience uh doesn't mean well that's what i'm getting at
[2:50:22.220 --> 2:50:27.020]  is they they offer it and say it's safe it's great here it is forbs slam for encouraging
[2:50:27.020 --> 2:50:31.100]  women to vacation alone in pakistan and the reason i went there is
[2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:39.340]  that it it's the same psychology women should do reckless crazy things that men don't do but men
[2:50:39.340 --> 2:50:46.780]  well should wear dresses yeah and then this i mean i don't i don't know if this necessarily dovetails
[2:50:46.780 --> 2:50:52.780]  on the same subject but there probably is some kind of connection here um because there there has been
[2:50:52.780 --> 2:51:00.060]  for the past uh at least i would say 10 years but probably much further back a drive by radical
[2:51:00.060 --> 2:51:05.980]  feminists to erode the concept of masculinity uh they they've essentially pathologized and deemed
[2:51:05.980 --> 2:51:10.540]  it as toxic and so young boys who are acting out in class or anything like this this is
[2:51:11.500 --> 2:51:15.420]  a problem and this is what christina have some of the talk summers talks about in her war against
[2:51:15.420 --> 2:51:22.700]  boys book um they do seem to think of masculinity as a problem and so this is the next logical step
[2:51:22.700 --> 2:51:29.340]  on that the new masculinity uh because what they have to naturally do is find a a role for boys to
[2:51:29.340 --> 2:51:37.020]  fulfill if you're going to say well the traditional male gender role is uh aggressive toxic harmful to
[2:51:37.020 --> 2:51:41.580]  women and harmful to themselves then you've got to replace it with something because otherwise
[2:51:41.580 --> 2:51:46.540]  you're just saying where you have to become women uh but looking at the picture what's the difference
[2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:52.140]  he's i mean he is wearing something that looks like a cross between a sleeping bag and a dress
[2:51:52.140 --> 2:51:57.740]  and guys do me a favor pull the article up please here i'll show people that's genuinely gq magazine
[2:51:57.740 --> 2:52:04.940]  says new masculinity is men wearing earrings giant sleeping bag dresses and crying and you think well
[2:52:04.940 --> 2:52:09.820]  that's just the crazy you know hollywood folks uh no this is what's taught in school this is a drag
[2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:15.260]  queen story time this is you're gonna act like girls now traditionally and then women gamergate
[2:52:15.260 --> 2:52:20.460]  all the hollywood roles are the are the heroin commandos uh there's there is definitely a drive
[2:52:20.460 --> 2:52:25.260]  to a feminized man there's no no question of it and you can look at uh testosterone levels
[2:52:25.260 --> 2:52:29.500]  over time they're dropping they look at fertility levels which is in the which is in the plastics
[2:52:29.500 --> 2:52:34.700]  and in the there there are probably lots of reasons for it and that's one reason it's just
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:40.060]  accidental they want us to not be masculine and these chemicals are there uh honestly that probably
[2:52:40.060 --> 2:52:45.260]  is just a coincidence course no no no there probably is um a confluence of people who
[2:52:45.260 --> 2:52:50.460]  philosophically think that we should be more feminine and our kind of sedentary western lifestyle
[2:52:50.460 --> 2:52:55.500]  kind of puts iodine in their water they're not cues keep going up we make sure it's not in there
[2:52:55.500 --> 2:53:00.940]  that's interesting i saw you talking about that that's new york times this is all 1996 my goodness
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:08.060]  look at this oh we'll behave ourselves now yeah i keep going yeah anyway so they don't want them
[2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:13.660]  emasculating the frogs here buddy it's too late the frogs already emasculated their numbers are
[2:53:13.660 --> 2:53:19.180]  plummeting just like ours are well yep the western men die that that's that that's the real crux of
[2:53:19.180 --> 2:53:25.260]  the issue right this won't catch on until women find it attractive and that because that's the
[2:53:25.260 --> 2:53:29.580]  reason that tradition and they just don't no of course not they that's the reason traditional
[2:53:29.580 --> 2:53:35.340]  masculinity was as it was like if you think about it all all all the gender roles are are a way for
[2:53:35.340 --> 2:53:40.780]  a social species to facilitate relationships in order to produce families what men look for in
[2:53:40.780 --> 2:53:44.940]  women and what women look for in men there's a general yeah believe me women aren't looking for
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:50.220]  this guy well i mean i'm sure i mean i mean they might want to be trendy and take him out to some
[2:53:50.220 --> 2:53:56.220]  trendy place but nobody is having any success at those lonely soulless trendy facilities he
[2:53:56.220 --> 2:54:01.500]  doesn't look like a strong provider to me but i don't know but anyway no he doesn't look like the
[2:54:01.500 --> 2:54:06.300]  type of guy that uh is going to get up and take care of you when you got the flu at 3 a.m. yeah
[2:54:06.300 --> 2:54:11.900]  but the the buts the these matter because masculinity and femininity are essentially
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:17.660]  two sides of the same coin um one one gender role is designed to facilitate the rearing of
[2:54:17.660 --> 2:54:23.340]  children the other gender roles designed to facilitate the protection and supply of resources
[2:54:23.340 --> 2:54:29.260]  to the person or the to the children themselves so it's it's a team effort women like nest because
[2:54:29.260 --> 2:54:34.380]  they are nest well they they they do nest builds you know that's true they they women had a little
[2:54:34.380 --> 2:54:38.460]  nest done well i suppose they do yeah i suppose you could say that yeah and then and then we build
[2:54:38.460 --> 2:54:45.100]  the nest around the nest but you see like nest building behaviors in i mean you know the genetic
[2:54:45.100 --> 2:54:49.180]  yeah but it's not like humans just have these relationships that's what we do yeah i run
[2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:52.780]  rather than calling it genetic because that i mean i would say it's by a lot what's nature and
[2:54:52.780 --> 2:54:57.980]  nurture it's yeah absolutely it is nature though there is definitely a natural aspect to this and
[2:54:57.980 --> 2:55:02.220]  listen it's epic genetics too i mean you could take little groups little boys and little girls
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:06.060]  and try to make the girls do boy things and try to make the boys you cannot make them do it well
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:11.420]  this is this is why i was going against me because you what we're seeing now is a trend where women
[2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:16.300]  are essentially becoming the breadwinners of the house women are the majority of degree holders
[2:55:16.300 --> 2:55:22.540]  leaving university they're making more money general millennials millennial women make more
[2:55:22.540 --> 2:55:26.940]  money than millennial men and so the globalist plan is working but statistically the women are
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:33.900]  totally unhappy yes this is leading to women being depressed being lonely and being resentful of men
[2:55:33.900 --> 2:55:39.100]  i've read many articles uh from successful career women who are talking about why they split up with
[2:55:39.100 --> 2:55:43.500]  their house husband husband because they didn't find them attractive and they became resentful
[2:55:43.500 --> 2:55:48.140]  of the fact that they would come home from work and he would be essentially refreshed and smiling
[2:55:48.140 --> 2:55:51.820]  because he's playing with the kids all day whereas they're exhausted they've been in board meetings
[2:55:51.820 --> 2:55:56.380]  they've been out in the wars well yeah basically i mean who wants to do the job of a CEO you know
[2:55:56.380 --> 2:56:02.140]  70 hours a week constantly working they get home and your husband's there and he's fresh as a daisy
[2:56:02.140 --> 2:56:07.260]  and he's playing with the kids i'd get resentful you know yeah i mean i don't want to say i resent
[2:56:07.260 --> 2:56:12.220]  my wife but sometimes she's complaining i'm like you know you got it really damn good right exactly
[2:56:12.220 --> 2:56:17.100]  you know and these guys like bill burr said these guys you know they're living the dream you know
[2:56:17.100 --> 2:56:22.620]  you're playing out in the in the sun with the kids that's living the dream um and but the but this
[2:56:22.620 --> 2:56:28.060]  is the erosion of the female and male gender roles and the oh they're both stealing our roles
[2:56:28.060 --> 2:56:33.660]  as if we're being empowered but they're destroying a system that can support the traditional genetic
[2:56:33.660 --> 2:56:39.100]  nature and nurture roles yeah because the human habitat is being removed the in many ways yeah
[2:56:39.100 --> 2:56:42.940]  and i don't think this is necessarily good for children um but it's it's definitely not good
[2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:47.500]  for women and women are starting to discover this um one of the things that you can see and you can
[2:56:47.500 --> 2:56:51.740]  probably just list well that's what i've found is these professional women hit 40 and they are just
[2:56:51.740 --> 2:56:56.220]  racing around trying to get a husband absolutely and then and then they don't want the husband
[2:56:56.220 --> 2:57:01.660]  that makes her a taco and is a painter uh you know all day because that there's something she just
[2:57:01.660 --> 2:57:06.300]  doesn't want it because genetically she knows let's say it's bad to be a painter but you know
[2:57:06.300 --> 2:57:10.860]  i mean that's his job supposedly not really a good painter you know he's the artist and
[2:57:10.860 --> 2:57:16.140]  really he's just screwing young chicks all day and while she's off at work when it comes to um
[2:57:16.140 --> 2:57:21.980]  the financial uh the the sort resource gathering situation of couples women marry up and so you've
[2:57:21.980 --> 2:57:27.020]  got some a lot of women now who are looking for men of higher status than themselves but that
[2:57:27.020 --> 2:57:33.660]  but they got rid of men's status so well yeah but but most women aren't feminists only in your
[2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:39.660]  country something like 10 percent of well sure and of course that's just a ruling glass genetic
[2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:44.620]  system you you say sorry your spark i could show you all the documents where they engineered this
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:49.740]  in the family this is all a plan i i agree it's definitely the plan of uh radical leftist to

[2:59:35.820 --> 2:59:41.660]  are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video
[2:59:42.380 --> 2:59:46.940]  and i gotta tell you we've done great video work we've done great films we've done so much but
[2:59:46.940 --> 2:59:51.980]  websites are not our thing well now they are i'm so proud of band.video folks check it out there's a
[2:59:51.980 --> 3:00:07.900]  lot of new features band.video you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:07.900 --> 3:00:17.900]  you
[3:00:18.780 --> 3:00:23.900]  barl benjamin sargon avocad is in studio with us and he's bringing up some really good points about
[3:00:24.460 --> 3:00:32.220]  the new masculinity is an effeminate man who wears rainbow outfits the new femininity is a woman in
[3:00:32.220 --> 3:00:37.180]  a commando outfit ruling the planet and you are agreeing with me that this is engineered please
[3:00:37.180 --> 3:00:44.140]  continue yeah this is definitely an attempt by radical left academics to deconstruct the concept
[3:00:44.140 --> 3:00:48.780]  of gender because they are not served by it personally i mean one of the things you can always
[3:00:48.780 --> 3:00:54.780]  notice and there's a fantastic clip on good morning britain of the grid girls now if you
[3:00:54.780 --> 3:00:58.700]  don't know what the grid girls are these are these are very attractive ladies usually from
[3:00:58.700 --> 3:01:06.700]  working class backgrounds who used to go to the formula one racing and they would appear there
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:12.620]  to be glamorous and give the give the whole thing a kind of more glamorous appearance and on good
[3:01:12.620 --> 3:01:18.620]  morning britain they were confronted by a a dowdy radical feminist academic who told them that they
[3:01:18.620 --> 3:01:24.140]  have to lose their jobs for the greater good of women this was not something they were very happy
[3:01:24.140 --> 3:01:29.260]  with because they like their jobs very much their jobs are very well paid but their jobs feed into
[3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:35.900]  traditional gender stereotypes and you can't bring in the new masculinity if you're supporting
[3:01:35.900 --> 3:01:41.660]  traditional gender gender roles and so what happened they lost their jobs well because one
[3:01:41.660 --> 3:01:46.780]  person brought it up which you know is all staged let's pull up the grid girls go to youtube i remember
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:52.460]  seeing them we can always look at them again very healthy young ladies and i've also seen the nfl says
[3:01:52.460 --> 3:01:57.820]  they're going to start bringing some men in and get less women so again getting rid of women in a
[3:01:57.820 --> 3:02:04.780]  traditional powerful role uh you know in their prime i mean this is really run by a bunch of
[3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:11.580]  hateful women on top uh who runs the mothership of this thing uh radical man hating feminists are
[3:02:11.580 --> 3:02:16.380]  the ones who run academics but as you can see from the picture the these women are very very
[3:02:16.380 --> 3:02:21.260]  visible the point of their role is to be visible so it's representation for women it's very good
[3:02:21.260 --> 3:02:25.580]  jobs for women well they're saying beauty is bad because you're so young and beautiful you're
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:31.420]  hurting someone else existing uh yes they're making the dowdy radical feminists feel bad about
[3:02:31.420 --> 3:02:35.580]  themselves and that means these women have to lose their jobs uh it was totally unjust in
[3:02:35.580 --> 3:02:40.540]  my opinion and i think that it's totally unfair but so what we're making is old battle axes like
[3:02:40.540 --> 3:02:46.700]  our god um that we're definitely putting them in charge for some reason i don't know why but
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:51.740]  so once you've once you've broken down the the gender roles and said right men's traditional
[3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:56.860]  gender role is toxic you do inevitably need a new masculinity because at the end of the day
[3:02:56.860 --> 3:03:03.100]  people want to have relationships with one another and so they're trying to concoct a new way of
[3:03:03.100 --> 3:03:08.220]  appealing to i suppose millennial women judging by the the state of this so this is the new man
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:13.420]  people can pull the article up from news wars dot com let's show folks the new man very very
[3:03:13.420 --> 3:03:22.700]  handsome uh i have to say i i mean i would probably date him or her just look at that that's
[3:03:22.700 --> 3:03:28.460]  the new masculinity and so this essentially is designed to appeal to millennial women who don't
[3:03:28.460 --> 3:03:33.420]  like traditional gender roles traditional masculinity uh i something tells me he doesn't
[3:03:33.420 --> 3:03:39.980]  like uh girls he might i don't know um i really i really don't know and i mean you know queen
[3:03:39.980 --> 3:03:45.260]  elizabeth was the last person i saw that wore outfits not queen elizabeth the second the first
[3:03:45.260 --> 3:03:49.260]  yeah that's a queen elizabeth and that's an elizabeth an outfit he's missing the ruffles
[3:03:49.260 --> 3:03:54.780]  isn't he around is that's all he's missing is the white ruffle yeah but the the the question is does
[3:03:54.780 --> 3:03:59.500]  this appeal to most women because if this doesn't appeal to most women it's not gonna count well
[3:03:59.500 --> 3:04:04.620]  we've got some really smart amazing ladies in there when leon macadoo's back visiting she's
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:09.340]  gonna be uh she's uh rejoin rejoining the team soon we're here to tell you uh ladies do you
[3:04:09.340 --> 3:04:15.580]  like this guy maybe come in and tell us uh yep they do they say they say they're ready to leave
[3:04:15.580 --> 3:04:20.220]  their boyfriends right now you like this guy wearing the queen elizabeth outfit go ahead turn
[3:04:20.220 --> 3:04:27.340]  the mic on yeah go ahead uh yeah no no thank you i'll pass on that do you guys think i would look
[3:04:27.340 --> 3:04:33.340]  cooler if i wore like of that please no it's kind of a sexy outfit isn't it from the dark crystal
[3:04:34.380 --> 3:04:38.540]  i think i think please no it tells us everything we need to know so is islam right about women
[3:04:38.540 --> 3:04:46.860]  after all no it doesn't sound like they're right about women after all ladies when we come back
[3:04:46.860 --> 3:04:53.100]  we're gonna ask both those nice ladies if they want to tell us the type of man they really want
[3:04:54.140 --> 3:04:58.700]  what you all know is sardine oh well i think you're married though i can't have you i mean
[3:05:00.380 --> 3:05:05.420]  actually he's mine are you kidding i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers
[3:05:05.420 --> 3:05:12.780]  who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system
[3:05:12.780 --> 3:05:18.380]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide and president
[3:05:18.380 --> 3:05:24.220]  trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well
[3:05:24.860 --> 3:05:30.380]  he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but
[3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:35.260]  trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been doing
[3:05:35.260 --> 3:05:41.660]  an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because
[3:05:41.660 --> 3:05:48.300]  we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way
[3:05:48.300 --> 3:05:52.940]  and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves
[3:05:52.940 --> 3:05:59.260]  get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got
[3:05:59.260 --> 3:06:12.300]  to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:06:15.180 --> 3:06:22.060]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[3:06:22.060 --> 3:06:31.100]  you are the resistance
[3:06:35.660 --> 3:06:40.220]  all right i wasn't thinking to do this on purpose but i looked out through the broadcast window
[3:06:41.020 --> 3:06:47.100]  and i saw some of the ladies that work here but we also have the great leanne macadoo
[3:06:47.100 --> 3:06:50.860]  who've been with us like eight years on and off went to take care of her mom and grandma but she's
[3:06:50.860 --> 3:06:56.540]  back she's back in austin visiting and rumors are she might be doing a show with us at least weekly
[3:06:56.540 --> 3:07:02.540]  but i wanted to just on this radio and tv show not just leave it up to a bunch of men a bunch of pigs
[3:07:02.540 --> 3:07:06.540]  commenting on women but you've got these big corporations telling us don't have children
[3:07:06.540 --> 3:07:11.180]  don't have families uh men existing are inherently evil most of college graduates are women now which
[3:07:11.180 --> 3:07:15.580]  is great but women are now paid more than men in many areas because the system wants to get rid
[3:07:15.580 --> 3:07:20.300]  of the traditional roles for a larger admitted plan that doesn't mean that we don't want women to
[3:07:20.300 --> 3:07:25.820]  fly around in little you know silver jet packs but what we know is this right here ladies and
[3:07:25.820 --> 3:07:32.620]  gentlemen put it on screen for tv viewers please this is supposedly the new man the new gender
[3:07:32.620 --> 3:07:39.660]  role gq all of them pushing this constantly you katelyn Jenner uh drag queen story time
[3:07:39.660 --> 3:07:44.540]  little kids a new job uh they're telling them at public school elementary students on career day
[3:07:44.540 --> 3:07:48.620]  unannounced to the parents all over the country from austin to denver colorado
[3:07:48.620 --> 3:07:58.060]  uh male trans people men that act like women come and teach the kids about career day that
[3:07:58.060 --> 3:08:02.780]  you could be a drag queen which means a man dressed like a woman creepily around kids
[3:08:02.780 --> 3:08:07.100]  so i thought we just dragged leon macadoo she's just walking by i haven't even said hi to her since
[3:08:07.100 --> 3:08:11.660]  you got her leon come on over here yep well get you in there give us your view on this why am i
[3:08:11.660 --> 3:08:18.220]  getting called in on the trans man topic trans woman come on over here no no no this isn't trans
[3:08:18.220 --> 3:08:26.220]  this is why you don't just pop into the studio is this the new man do you like him i saw this
[3:08:26.220 --> 3:08:32.940]  picture and actually you know i went to an art an art exhibit in sarasota the ringling museum
[3:08:32.940 --> 3:08:40.060]  and they've got all of the um like the history of textiles and they had a bunch of men's clothing
[3:08:40.060 --> 3:08:47.820]  at the front uh japanese men chinese and it was this all like dresses i mean this is what they wore
[3:08:48.460 --> 3:08:55.420]  totally normal like that's men i think that's royalty where they're from well yeah the bigger
[3:08:55.420 --> 3:09:00.700]  your skirt was the more royal you were as a man so now they're teaching us how cool it is yeah
[3:09:01.260 --> 3:09:06.380]  so almost destroyed brad gets career when he did uh how you doing when he made that movie about
[3:09:06.380 --> 3:09:12.220]  Troy they said all men are soon gonna be wearing skirts and they weren't so um what do you think
[3:09:12.220 --> 3:09:17.740]  about the scottish though and they're killed right so leon you like it then you want to see us
[3:09:17.740 --> 3:09:22.460]  wearing dresses how would i look in a big dress well the most important thing i think do you want
[3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:29.500]  men who are wearing earrings giant sleeping bag dresses and crying i do not really no i well you
[3:09:29.500 --> 3:09:37.580]  know you don't want a man who's crying that's not attractive is there like a i used to date a guy he
[3:09:37.580 --> 3:09:42.460]  was in the military and so they train you do not you know there's no time for those emotions but then
[3:09:42.460 --> 3:09:50.060]  he had he lost a friend and so at what point are you able to like can you cry then yeah i think
[3:09:50.060 --> 3:09:55.580]  that there there is a time and a place for manly tears manly oh well here's the question yeah
[3:09:55.580 --> 3:10:00.860]  yeah he heard the communist china uh missed a few christians they didn't kill he's like damn it
[3:10:01.740 --> 3:10:06.540]  lebron james but i think uh the sort of thing that we're talking about is it sort of emotional
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:12.380]  incontinence isn't it people who can't control their emotions well i feel like yes yes and leon
[3:10:12.380 --> 3:10:16.700]  here's the question why do you think there's a war on masculinity at all why is there a war on
[3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:23.340]  masculinity or is there not a war on masculinity are the frogs gay there is definitely a war on
[3:10:23.340 --> 3:10:28.620]  masculinity yeah there definitely is and i'm not sure why but it's i think it's we've lived on
[3:10:28.620 --> 3:10:34.940]  our present day society for so long without war or without the need in the west to have those
[3:10:35.500 --> 3:10:41.180]  hyper masculine skills i mean we just you know it's like you don't need to go and fight a war
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:47.180]  right but i was thinking about that actually on the flight over here like if if if they did need
[3:10:47.180 --> 3:10:52.060]  to send people to go and fight a battle in saudi arabia i guess there's that's where they're
[3:10:52.060 --> 3:10:58.060]  sending people now um who would we send over they're still prepared look at the guy or just what
[3:10:58.060 --> 3:11:01.660]  about being a leader and not bowing what people tell you to do if you think it's wrong i think
[3:11:01.660 --> 3:11:06.300]  that transcends being male or female they don't want people that are authentic and independent
[3:11:06.860 --> 3:11:11.420]  and they claim all this liberalism is independent to this it's not it's about being part of their
[3:11:11.420 --> 3:11:15.660]  cult one of the things i've noticed recently um and you can probably find this with a very quick
[3:11:15.660 --> 3:11:22.380]  search is articles titled it's okay to die alone have you noticed that yes they're selling being
[3:11:22.380 --> 3:11:27.420]  lonely being alone yeah as if this is a positive thing but the the thing is i don't think it's
[3:11:27.420 --> 3:11:32.380]  necessarily a part of a plot but it i think it's a post hoc rationalization because they've what
[3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:36.460]  they've done is they've set up a system where people are alone yeah and and they're unhappy they
[3:11:36.460 --> 3:11:42.220]  admit that yeah but they've attacked masculinity and femininity and tried to undermine these
[3:11:42.220 --> 3:11:45.980]  and these were the methods by which people form relationships and have families
[3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:49.420]  and so without these you are probably going to end up dying alone so now you have to
[3:11:49.420 --> 3:11:54.540]  oh god i'm going to die alone in a tiny cubicle eat so now they make it sexy right it's fun at
[3:11:54.540 --> 3:11:58.860]  least try to justify it you know and it's one of those well keep riding shotgun some of the other
[3:11:58.860 --> 3:12:02.380]  ladies who's got a hair i can't see the wind somebody introduced themselves who wants to come
[3:12:02.380 --> 3:12:07.420]  on right now and give us a review hey it's rebecca right i don't want to call hey how you doing so
[3:12:07.420 --> 3:12:12.940]  so what's your uh what's your view on this do you find this guy for student address uh cool
[3:12:14.140 --> 3:12:21.260]  he is crying yeah no i mean i think likely and said i mean to what point is it okay for a man to
[3:12:21.260 --> 3:12:27.660]  cry or not to cry i think men should be tough but they should also be able to express emotion
[3:12:28.940 --> 3:12:35.020]  you know but no i think women are looking for a manly man we're looking for the typical alpha
[3:12:35.020 --> 3:12:41.740]  male any woman who says otherwise um i have a lot of evidence to show probably they're
[3:12:41.740 --> 3:12:47.660]  lying or not at least being honest with themselves um you know we can get emotional support from our
[3:12:47.660 --> 3:12:53.580]  girlfriends from family we can have a lot of those emotional conversations from other people men
[3:12:53.580 --> 3:12:59.100]  typically aren't super emotional in the the ways that women are and i think that's that's okay we
[3:12:59.100 --> 3:13:03.980]  can be different and allow those differences and what do you think's going on with the
[3:13:03.980 --> 3:13:10.300]  obsession of hollywood and then everybody with creating new roles doing getting rid of the family
[3:13:10.300 --> 3:13:14.220]  and that's an admitted goal why would they want to do that because they want to create a bunch of
[3:13:14.220 --> 3:13:18.780]  slaves a bunch of alone slaves in my view well well that's the answer right there they're they're
[3:13:18.780 --> 3:13:24.540]  looking to break down the gender roles if we can redefine the roles of men and women then we're
[3:13:24.540 --> 3:13:28.700]  completely lost we don't know what the heck we're doing we don't know what we're looking for and
[3:13:28.700 --> 3:13:35.420]  and it it shows the breakdown of the family and culture society kids being raised without a two
[3:13:35.420 --> 3:13:41.180]  parent household um they know they experimented within the black community what happens when
[3:13:41.180 --> 3:13:46.300]  there isn't a man in the house and so that's you know that that was a little microcosm to
[3:13:46.300 --> 3:13:51.100]  see what would happen we see what's happening there and it's just expanding out to the rest
[3:13:51.100 --> 3:13:55.580]  of society you should have her doing the show she's great oh no that's why she's here we're
[3:13:55.580 --> 3:13:59.820]  actually developed a show for her and savannah we're just getting the people hired and getting
[3:13:59.820 --> 3:14:05.660]  set up we're trying here but you want a show no you need one i better not but you're the
[3:14:06.460 --> 3:14:10.620]  what i think they're speaking to though is the corporatization of society so if you think about
[3:14:10.620 --> 3:14:16.300]  it like the the family unit is um a power base away from the state and away from and you owe
[3:14:16.300 --> 3:14:21.020]  allegiance to it well yeah exactly yeah it's yeah it's like i will i will kill for my family yeah
[3:14:21.020 --> 3:14:25.660]  you're loyal i'll kill for my kids yeah i mean just not i'll kill you i'll kill somebody i don't
[3:14:25.660 --> 3:14:30.460]  do that for anybody else i got friends i'd yeah i'd probably kill former they needed to help but
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:35.340]  my kids no thought you're dead yeah but the the point is it's a it's a it's a power base
[3:14:35.340 --> 3:14:40.300]  that you owe loyalty to that isn't controlled by the state or some other faction um and that that's
[3:14:41.260 --> 3:14:48.460]  a threat to the hegemony of the sort of corporate left they like the idea of individual like atomized
[3:14:48.460 --> 3:14:53.740]  individuals who have no other safety nets and so are reliant on the system that they're putting in
[3:14:53.740 --> 3:14:58.380]  place but that is good for them that is entirely in their interest you've got children right yeah
[3:14:58.380 --> 3:15:01.820]  do you ever when you're just loving them and thinking about how good they are your love but
[3:15:01.820 --> 3:15:05.740]  then you just feel this super aggression wanting to defend them and provide for me just like a
[3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:11.900]  strength yeah i mean it's just like man thankfully nothing's threatened my kids in the way that i need
[3:15:11.900 --> 3:15:16.540]  to get upset about but not directly but the whole atmosphere is after them buddy do you remember that
[3:15:16.540 --> 3:15:21.660]  that woman who stabbed the child in the eye yes in the industry that just think about that makes me
[3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:24.940]  i want to kill her it makes me a rationally i'm not saying i'm literally gonna kill her i mean
[3:15:24.940 --> 3:15:29.820]  yes he's stabbing little kids for for no reason in the eyeballs it's unbelievable and he tries to
[3:15:29.820 --> 3:15:34.060]  chop his nose off pretty much does yeah and tries to stab his eyes out i mean what the hell it's
[3:15:34.060 --> 3:15:39.420]  it's a it's a genuinely horrific video and it makes me a rationally it's a primal urge that
[3:15:39.420 --> 3:15:43.260]  they're trying to destroy that primal urge that you want to protect your family protect your
[3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:47.980]  children so they want to separate you and separate the children from having that security that their
[3:15:47.980 --> 3:15:51.740]  parents are going to be there for them bingo bingo bingo let's talk about why they're trying to turn
[3:15:51.740 --> 3:15:56.620]  our life force off we'll pull up the sickening video from georgia of the pig demon woman stabbing
[3:15:56.620 --> 3:16:01.100]  children in the face with pleasure i actually don't want to watch it again this is real well we'll

[3:21:23.340 --> 3:21:30.380]  well but we went down a very important rabbit hole the total war on the gender roles and i've got three
[3:21:30.380 --> 3:21:35.340]  daughters i want them to do whatever they want i want my son to do every once but i'm trying to get
[3:21:35.340 --> 3:21:38.620]  my girls like hey we're gonna get into politics don't you hey you want to be a you're really a
[3:21:38.620 --> 3:21:43.020]  great public speaker dad i don't want to do that i want to i want to design clothing or you know i
[3:21:43.020 --> 3:21:48.060]  want to i want to be a nurse i'm like no no you want to fight the new world order but then my son
[3:21:48.060 --> 3:21:53.580]  he's totally into it obviously but uh my middle daughter somewhat but uh beckham uh and of course
[3:21:53.580 --> 3:21:59.180]  leon leon macadoo back visiting with us uh what would you call this this whole situation leon i
[3:21:59.180 --> 3:22:03.820]  think more than hit the nail on the head earlier when she talked about they're they're turning off
[3:22:03.820 --> 3:22:08.540]  our basic instincts to stand up for our children to stand up for ourselves and why would the system
[3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:13.100]  want to do that they want to get sargon's reason for that right well there's nothing stronger than
[3:22:13.100 --> 3:22:17.740]  that primal urge that connection between the the parent and their child this you know a woman in
[3:22:17.740 --> 3:22:22.060]  her child uh we were speaking during the break there's a movie it's called the last keeper and they
[3:22:23.100 --> 3:22:28.620]  the way that their utopian society is set up so that they don't have any of those primal feelings
[3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:33.180]  the the minute the child is born they're just they're in these kind of birthing hospitals the
[3:22:33.180 --> 3:22:38.140]  mother never gets to take care of them it's the the children that are in their home aren't their
[3:22:38.140 --> 3:22:44.540]  actual kids so they completely separate this whole idea that your children belong to you they belong
[3:22:44.540 --> 3:22:49.420]  to this community wow never seen that you know that's the north korea the north korea tried that
[3:22:49.980 --> 3:22:54.540]  yeah right and like they can't leave the house without getting their you know their daily dose
[3:22:54.540 --> 3:22:59.980]  of whatever their medications are wow what's it called them numb them the last keeper you know
[3:22:59.980 --> 3:23:03.580]  that's that was the huxley u n plan while they made a movie about it yeah it's actually a really
[3:23:03.580 --> 3:23:09.740]  good movie then there's one that's chosen and he has the memories of humanity's past and so he's
[3:23:09.740 --> 3:23:18.060]  able to say i don't i don't think that's it he he has the um he has the ability to see the the pain
[3:23:18.060 --> 3:23:23.660]  that humans like they they've tried to check bridges in that yes okay i saw that i think i was drunk
[3:23:23.660 --> 3:23:29.980]  the giver the giver thank you the giver the giver it was a book and they made it into a movie oh sorry
[3:23:29.980 --> 3:23:33.660]  no i i just wrote i would you're describing it i was like wait i read that book that was so it's
[3:23:33.660 --> 3:23:39.500]  the giver the giver yeah very good movie but it's also like scary because you know that's
[3:23:39.500 --> 3:23:43.980]  actually they're telling you there because we all have ancestral memories and leaders have them
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:49.100]  particularly strong uh you know if they're good leaders and for my research and the globalists
[3:23:49.100 --> 3:23:55.420]  are trying to block our access to those carl yung type rituals you know he didn't invent any pointed
[3:23:55.420 --> 3:24:00.540]  it out uh that we do because those rituals are what activate the ancestral memory we're getting a
[3:24:00.540 --> 3:24:06.220]  little esoteric here you want to comment on that sargon um this is an idea that is as old as time
[3:24:06.220 --> 3:24:10.700]  like this is plate as republic that you're describing that all children will be held in
[3:24:10.700 --> 3:24:15.660]  common everyone will have an assigned role in society that will be born into this goes back
[3:24:15.660 --> 3:24:19.260]  over two and a half thousand years he was the first eugenicist yeah absolutely absolutely he
[3:24:19.260 --> 3:24:23.020]  invented eugenics well i i don't know if you could say that he invented well that word comes from
[3:24:23.020 --> 3:24:29.580]  the greek and plate as republic fair fair but the the the idea is as old as time and it's been the
[3:24:29.580 --> 3:24:34.620]  idea it basically like the the social planners you know they want to create a perfect society
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:39.900]  as if humans are ants and should be assigned to an individual role and have their lives curated
[3:24:39.900 --> 3:24:45.980]  and it's the it's looks a lot like china does now if you try doing this and i mean obviously there's
[3:24:45.980 --> 3:24:50.620]  you know they're not that far down the road there's still families in china but once you once you
[3:24:50.620 --> 3:24:55.500]  split apart the kind of well yeah but once you split apart the family unit i mean where do you go
[3:24:55.500 --> 3:25:00.060]  for your social support where do you go when you're in trouble the state exactly you've got no other
[3:25:00.060 --> 3:25:05.020]  choice and the state has no value for you right and you have no loyalty to your family unit that
[3:25:05.020 --> 3:25:09.740]  you'll be just like in communist china they'll tell on their family or they'll abandon their
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:13.260]  friends and family if it's going to take down their social is that because human life's always
[3:25:13.260 --> 3:25:17.500]  been chief to the chief to feudal lords and now there's so many of us we're not just cheap we're
[3:25:17.500 --> 3:25:22.620]  like garbage uh yeah i would say that there is a definite cheapening of the value of human life
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:27.340]  in this regard but don't worry lebron james will teach us how america's bad but he says common is
[3:25:27.340 --> 3:25:31.340]  china's good ladies you have any comments on lebron and we're gonna be dressed like this
[3:25:31.340 --> 3:25:37.820]  in a single unit housing eating our bug soup while wishing that we died alone by the way
[3:25:37.820 --> 3:25:42.460]  that's the future they're proposing that's what they're saying that outfit is too big for one of
[3:25:42.460 --> 3:25:46.460]  those capsule homes though i mean how would you well you could sleep in it too you could use it as
[3:25:46.460 --> 3:25:51.260]  your sleeping bag it's your bed that's your house that's your tent and we're and we're putting tubes
[3:25:51.260 --> 3:25:57.500]  up cows rear ends to capture cot to i say humans have to do it well i i mean i remember example
[3:25:57.500 --> 3:26:03.020]  from our current left remember melissa harris perry i think her name was um on news saying that the
[3:26:03.020 --> 3:26:08.220]  kids don't don't belong to this to the family we've got to break through the idea that kids belong
[3:26:08.220 --> 3:26:12.220]  to families they belong to the state right and and you see that happening with them pushing this
[3:26:12.220 --> 3:26:20.460]  transgenderism the lgbtq aip silent number five i love whatever uh they want to add to it hold on
[3:26:20.460 --> 3:26:27.980]  some people aren't even uh they're a spirit you just hurt their feelings i i mean whatever lunatic
[3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:32.860]  waters off the street has a new thing identify and then they just added all these now to webster
[3:26:32.860 --> 3:26:38.140]  dictionary so they literally are forcing it into our they're sabotaging civilization that's
[3:26:38.140 --> 3:26:43.500]  absolutely are and and i was just in california recently and i was sitting at a table next to
[3:26:43.500 --> 3:26:48.540]  these parents talking about how wonderful it was that little johnny was coming to school in a dress
[3:26:48.540 --> 3:26:53.660]  and how they're they're reading these books in in the schools now to teach kids how to
[3:26:54.460 --> 3:27:00.620]  be so more accepting of of the trans and the gay community and just obviously wonderful and how
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:05.020]  open minded this way and kids aren't thinking about sex i don't want heterosexuals coming and
[3:27:05.020 --> 3:27:09.100]  saying time to talk about what heterosexuals do to five-year-olds it's like you're a pervert i
[3:27:09.100 --> 3:27:15.020]  don't care who you are yeah there was the video with the the drag queen kind of doing this like
[3:27:15.020 --> 3:27:20.220]  striptease in front of kids and you're like you wouldn't let a woman do that in front of kids or
[3:27:20.220 --> 3:27:26.140]  a man or so why is it okay when it's it's just really weird it is actually bizarre but it seems
[3:27:26.140 --> 3:27:31.180]  as though they've pushed it so far to the extreme that the parents now are actually fighting back
[3:27:31.180 --> 3:27:36.220]  those that have absolutely girls in sports who are saying this is not fair and daria brought up a
[3:27:36.220 --> 3:27:40.300]  point we're not endorsing islam putting hoods over women's heads and cutting their genitals off no
[3:27:40.300 --> 3:27:44.620]  that's the other extreme but you've got that extreme over here with the left bringing that in
[3:27:44.620 --> 3:27:50.300]  but then you've got the left saying don't even protect kids uh it's just so radical it's where
[3:27:50.300 --> 3:27:58.060]  does it come from it comes from radical leftist ideologues in academia who view it right so you
[3:27:58.060 --> 3:28:03.260]  you had a thing here where was it it was um complaining about the idea of america being a
[3:28:03.260 --> 3:28:07.580]  white christian nation and i've been thinking about this a lot that's cnn saying isn't it horrible
[3:28:07.580 --> 3:28:13.660]  yeah cnn right because essentially what they're trying to do is apply reason to things that were
[3:28:13.660 --> 3:28:20.220]  not created with reason and as a historian david starkey pointed out that's destructive so if you
[3:28:20.220 --> 3:28:25.020]  i mean for example religion i'm an atheist i don't believe in god and so if i wanted to
[3:28:25.020 --> 3:28:28.940]  deconstruct religion i would take the bible and say well this is contradictory this is
[3:28:28.940 --> 3:28:33.660]  face uh false the these things are not true and therefore this book is not credible therefore
[3:28:33.660 --> 3:28:39.020]  the underpinnings of your religion are not valid and so your belief in god is faulty and that would
[3:28:39.020 --> 3:28:43.180]  be a way of me taking that away from you right and so if you wanted to do that with the state now
[3:28:43.180 --> 3:28:47.580]  you would say well if we're gonna have a rational state a state that's built entirely on reason not
[3:28:47.580 --> 3:28:54.540]  from the sort of human essence that we can't say that men can have babies um sorry say again well
[3:28:54.540 --> 3:28:58.460]  yeah you've heard them saying men are having babies they're not it's women that say they're men well
[3:28:58.460 --> 3:29:04.300]  explain to me when we come back we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen heart disease is on the rise

[3:34:15.740 --> 3:34:20.940]  of akkad aka carl benjamin or maybe it's aka the other way but now getting serious you were gonna lay
[3:34:20.940 --> 3:34:26.220]  out some major heavy info on us a whole theorem that i just jumped the middle of his winter break
[3:34:26.220 --> 3:34:33.900]  yeah basically um most of our civilizations are evolutionary um i mean if you if you look at um
[3:34:33.900 --> 3:34:38.540]  the history of england and this is where we get the idea of a bill of rights from a constitution
[3:34:38.540 --> 3:34:44.460]  from in the modern sense um these were evolutionary and then so the american system was revolutionary
[3:34:44.460 --> 3:34:50.540]  so it was set out in stone effectively um but the the society that was on top of this was
[3:34:51.420 --> 3:34:55.580]  the these things these were things that were created by reason um so i'm terrible looking
[3:34:55.580 --> 3:34:59.980]  at cameras now you're doing a great job you're saying this incredible evolution of the magna
[3:34:59.980 --> 3:35:05.660]  carter that gave us the model of so much what we have today please continue yeah but the the
[3:35:05.660 --> 3:35:11.100]  society that was underneath it was evolutionary so we you know we form families we have children
[3:35:11.100 --> 3:35:17.180]  and the this wasn't dictated it wasn't thought about in a grand scheme a grand plan it was just
[3:35:17.180 --> 3:35:20.860]  something that people did because it worked and they survival attributes yeah it was yeah
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:26.460]  absolutely it was something they wanted to do and now reason is being applied to those factors to
[3:35:26.460 --> 3:35:31.980]  those aspects of life so like why are men men why are women women why do men you know dress in a
[3:35:31.980 --> 3:35:36.700]  certain way and why do women react in that sort of way to that dress and vice versa and if you
[3:35:36.700 --> 3:35:41.420]  spend your time deconstructing this it is a destructive thing to do so you take apart the
[3:35:41.420 --> 3:35:46.700]  family you take apart the the independence from the state i mean look at the at the moment they
[3:35:46.700 --> 3:35:51.100]  there's a massive problem and you'll see lots of articles about this as well uh trans people are
[3:35:51.100 --> 3:35:56.700]  unable to get dates and find you know boyfriends girlfriends or whatever um but the answer but
[3:35:56.700 --> 3:36:01.180]  the the the the thing they're not talking about is what what were you expecting to happen you know
[3:36:01.180 --> 3:36:06.620]  the gender role is how we identify that we want to well they they they make them the victims when most
[3:36:06.620 --> 3:36:10.940]  of them are autistic and they are the victims we now know so the educators admit they're targeting
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:15.660]  them because they're they have mental issues and then what what i mean though what i mean though is
[3:36:15.660 --> 3:36:21.340]  this was an inevitable consequence of attacking sexuality and gender roles because if you if
[3:36:21.340 --> 3:36:26.620]  you try to under if you use reason to undermine these things uh then you are going to find that
[3:36:26.620 --> 3:36:32.220]  the people who adopt that framework are kind of isolated they don't fit into being men or women
[3:36:32.220 --> 3:36:36.540]  and so they they have trouble getting dates and they have trouble well a lot of folks are trying
[3:36:36.540 --> 3:36:42.380]  to get out of it and go back to their real agenda their real biology they're being told no no no stay
[3:36:42.380 --> 3:36:48.380]  in it you don't have any choice to get out now so i'll talk about a cult that was cooked up and
[3:36:48.380 --> 3:36:54.540]  then if you expand on that ladies jump in anytime here um if you expand on that six thousand the
[3:36:54.540 --> 3:36:58.780]  number was three that now that the six thousand the numbers are coming out died in just the u.s
[3:36:58.780 --> 3:37:03.980]  from gender-bending drugs i mean this is very dangerous i i haven't seen those figures but it
[3:37:03.980 --> 3:37:09.980]  it's it's it's definitely going to have a knock on effect and i said there were some hundreds uh
[3:37:09.980 --> 3:37:18.220]  they were reported to be um wishing to detransition and then you think of the the suicide rate among
[3:37:18.220 --> 3:37:24.140]  trans people is incredibly high because if you go through the surgery and then afterwards you
[3:37:24.140 --> 3:37:30.300]  think actually maybe i didn't want this it's a bit late well in the old days if you tried to cut your
[3:37:30.300 --> 3:37:36.540]  pecker off they put you in a mental institution they probably would have done yes so well i my my
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:42.140]  issue with it is that the whole sort of trans movement just kind of came up out of nowhere and
[3:37:42.780 --> 3:37:48.540]  it just is all of a sudden in your face they're having six hour long cnn how it's have a stock
[3:37:48.540 --> 3:37:54.060]  institute 1967 depopulation plan they're gonna shoot over well there was no there was no like
[3:37:54.060 --> 3:38:00.860]  beginning middle end phase it where where the majority of the population can get used to
[3:38:00.860 --> 3:38:05.420]  understanding people who don't identify with the body they were born into and like let's get used
[3:38:05.420 --> 3:38:10.060]  to that what is that they're being they're just being used immediately like no your kid says he's
[3:38:10.060 --> 3:38:15.500]  trans so we are going to give them these pills that block their their puberty blockers and we're
[3:38:15.500 --> 3:38:19.820]  just going to change them and give them the surgery they want to so they it's like there was no
[3:38:19.820 --> 3:38:23.820]  really they just become stunted i mean i mean because you get so many hormones at ten they
[3:38:23.820 --> 3:38:27.420]  don't grow anymore well no she so they don't tell them how about to turn you into a midget
[3:38:27.420 --> 3:38:32.620]  well no you're completely right and i think i think what it is is because um normally a social
[3:38:32.620 --> 3:38:39.580]  movement comes from the grassroots so it isn't well thought out it comes from an impulse you know
[3:38:39.580 --> 3:38:43.420]  we're you know we we want liberty therefore we're going to fight for our freedom that doesn't mean
[3:38:43.420 --> 3:38:48.060]  they've got a well thought out philosophical structure surrounding it right but this was
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:54.380]  developed by very very intelligent people uh behind the closed doors in academia away from
[3:38:54.380 --> 3:38:59.340]  the general public and what they did is they use reason to create a kind of framework of
[3:38:59.340 --> 3:39:04.700]  argumentation so you will say but men and women are this and they'll say ah but there are there
[3:39:04.700 --> 3:39:09.660]  are those people in the gray area between men and women who you can't account for with your theory
[3:39:09.660 --> 3:39:15.260]  therefore we have to adopt my theory which means men can become women children can have people and
[3:39:15.260 --> 3:39:20.700]  then so it's a cascade effect because the argument is effectively one there and so boom suddenly you're
[3:39:20.700 --> 3:39:25.580]  doing all this because they represent a group and they know that the west is all about uh
[3:39:25.580 --> 3:39:30.380]  liberal egalitarianism so they use our strength against us yes yeah yeah because the the ground
[3:39:30.380 --> 3:39:34.620]  the framework is already there because you know we're all like we want freedom right and we have
[3:39:34.620 --> 3:39:38.460]  our own definition of freedom but they haven't expanded definition of freedom you you don't
[3:39:38.460 --> 3:39:42.620]  you guys probably don't think we should be free from our own biology because that's some realistic
[3:39:42.620 --> 3:39:46.860]  but that's what they're trying well that's like o'brien is torturing winston in 1984 and he says
[3:39:47.500 --> 3:39:53.740]  we can suspend gravity you think that's a you think that's reality and mathematics but we
[3:39:53.740 --> 3:39:59.820]  can have people be so delusional that they actually just don't believe it exists yeah and so what what
[3:39:59.820 --> 3:40:07.660]  what i mean is so with they've created a very sophisticated structure of argument that you
[3:40:07.660 --> 3:40:12.220]  are primed to accept because you agree that the ultimate goal freedom is a good thing
[3:40:12.220 --> 3:40:17.340]  and so essentially you can't really resist it with the tools that you would normally resist
[3:40:17.340 --> 3:40:21.980]  such a thing because they're they're appealing to the the thing and really the goal is the state getting
[3:40:21.980 --> 3:40:29.820]  rid of uh children not being of age to make decisions and really they're just trying to emancipate
[3:40:29.820 --> 3:40:33.900]  children to the state and they can cut right to the chase and let your five-year-old decide
[3:40:33.900 --> 3:40:37.660]  they're another sex that the state stepped in they've already won because that's such an extreme
[3:40:37.660 --> 3:40:41.340]  example once they've got you to agree to that they've got the whole ballgame well and then
[3:40:41.340 --> 3:40:47.180]  all lifetime patience as well because that's something that you have to always take medication
[3:40:47.180 --> 3:40:51.580]  for because otherwise your body goes back to its default biologist you're going to need some
[3:40:51.580 --> 3:40:56.380]  psychiatric help it you go back to your default biology which is why people have a big problem
[3:40:56.380 --> 3:41:02.060]  with with trans in the military because you can't what if you are stopped from taking the medication
[3:41:02.060 --> 3:41:06.540]  that you need because you get captured or whatever it's all meant to sabotage this this this is
[3:41:06.540 --> 3:41:12.060]  exactly what i mean so they they're humans are not just beings of pure reason they are biological
[3:41:12.060 --> 3:41:17.660]  and so you have to accept that or you have to try and do something to emancipate yourself from it
[3:41:17.660 --> 3:41:22.620]  which is what you're saying but i i think that the the what you're describing is actually collateral
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:26.460]  damage i don't think that when they started doing this they were like we need to get the
[3:41:26.460 --> 3:41:30.940]  children dependent on the state but that is something that happens as a natural consequence of
[3:41:30.940 --> 3:41:36.620]  change of you've read revenue worlds yes written in 1932 yeah by all this actually yes
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:41.340]  julian huxley was the head eugenicist of the eugenic society really i didn't know that and then
[3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:46.940]  he went on to run the un how do you think they have sexless people chemically drugged at birth
[3:41:46.940 --> 3:41:52.460]  as the whole plan that's he wrote revenue world revisited where he said this is our real plan
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:58.940]  and you're not going to stop us i i agree but i think the the the the detail that the the distinction
[3:41:58.940 --> 3:42:03.500]  is in the day because i i'm not sure that those people are necessarily connected to the people who
[3:42:03.500 --> 3:42:09.100]  all this actually brother created the transhumanist movement after world war true and hitler yeah
[3:42:09.100 --> 3:42:12.700]  i'll have to look this up because i'm not familiar with oh yeah no this is their whole plan so they
[3:42:12.700 --> 3:42:16.380]  can get you to accept that a man could be a woman woman be a man then it's to get us ready for the
[3:42:16.380 --> 3:42:23.180]  robots and the cyborgs and then the human animal clones and the the the humanoids we're they're
[3:42:23.180 --> 3:42:28.220]  going to have rights but they're actually going to be genetically programmed you understand so really
[3:42:28.220 --> 3:42:32.940]  the corporations will finally have life because they're clones and they're and they're replicants
[3:42:32.940 --> 3:42:37.020]  other than and they use the term replicant in the 50s by the way that's not okay this this is going
[3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:41.340]  a bit further off the uh the beaten trail but you understand the whole trans movement was set
[3:42:41.340 --> 3:42:47.180]  their opening salvo is to get rid of the two sexes then they move in there's at least something
[3:42:47.180 --> 3:42:51.420]  that's why there was no middle road it was just like rather than being able to have conversations
[3:42:51.420 --> 3:42:55.420]  like this where we can wrap our brains around it it was just like there's a hundred things there's a
[3:42:55.420 --> 3:42:59.020]  thousand things because they're getting you ready for the rise of the cyborgs
[3:43:00.380 --> 3:43:04.380]  i wouldn't characterize a lot of but it's going to be started handed to the listeners and viewers
[3:43:04.380 --> 3:43:11.420]  who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist
[3:43:11.420 --> 3:43:16.860]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and
[3:43:16.860 --> 3:43:22.860]  president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:43:22.860 --> 3:43:28.940]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[3:43:28.940 --> 3:43:33.980]  but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[3:43:33.980 --> 3:43:40.300]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[3:43:40.300 --> 3:43:46.700]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in
[3:43:46.700 --> 3:43:51.100]  a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[3:43:51.100 --> 3:43:56.300]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to
[3:43:56.300 --> 3:44:03.340]  demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy silicon valley thinks you're
[3:44:03.340 --> 3:44:08.780]  the dumb jellyfish they think the west is dead they think if they censor nationalists and patriots
[3:44:08.780 --> 3:44:12.460]  off internet you'll just forget about us and then they'll be the only information out there well
[3:44:12.460 --> 3:44:17.340]  so far that's not been working too well for them thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly
[3:44:17.340 --> 3:44:22.540]  but the resistance to globalism is alive and well at band dot video and now we've added a lot

[3:47:46.860 --> 3:47:50.780]  okay yeah no i am familiar with this doesn't sound satanic to me at all i've watched some of
[3:47:50.780 --> 3:47:55.580]  mark dice's video larry del rey is my favorite yeah that's the only one that's the only context
[3:47:55.580 --> 3:48:02.620]  theme which i've heard you know i'm teleprompter free is it lana or lana lana lana hey you know
[3:48:02.620 --> 3:48:07.180]  i'm from texas i get to butcher stuff when i do it it's endearing and it's just in beabler
[3:48:08.460 --> 3:48:13.180]  his name is just in beabler now you know the thing is i knew his name was beabler beabler
[3:48:13.180 --> 3:48:20.460]  it is it but what is his name beabler beabler sounds french to me i don't trust it yeah
[3:48:22.700 --> 3:48:27.500]  you're a troublemaker hey let's get serious finish up with this you were disagreeing with me
[3:48:27.500 --> 3:48:32.540]  you're saying it's all accidental it's a worldwide total corporate push to cut our sons dingolings
[3:48:32.540 --> 3:48:37.020]  off i i don't think it's accidental we just know these are really nice people when i give us a
[3:48:37.020 --> 3:48:42.060]  really good right oh by the way they think pedophilia is okay too but yeah they they do think that in
[3:48:42.060 --> 3:48:48.620]  many ways i i i just i'm not sure about the causal nature of one to the next but i'm not saying that
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:53.180]  there isn't one i'm just saying i'm not well we always said after they do all this next it'll be
[3:48:53.180 --> 3:48:57.900]  you know pedophilia and bestiality and now it's here oh it's a lot they have articles going this man
[3:48:57.900 --> 3:49:02.220]  wanted to have sex with his neighbor's horse he's depressed you know he deserves it have you seen
[3:49:02.220 --> 3:49:07.900]  these articles now there are mainline articles it was like in like the grinwich news or something
[3:49:07.900 --> 3:49:13.740]  that this man wants to have sex with his neighbor's horse but he can't consent the horse can't consent
[3:49:13.740 --> 3:49:20.300]  so it's not right agreed yeah yeah no and it's also just like children can't consent
[3:49:20.940 --> 3:49:25.100]  to the sex change just because the school brainwashed them that's right because kids
[3:49:25.100 --> 3:49:30.300]  cannot voice consent their brains aren't fully developed they don't have all the decision making
[3:49:30.300 --> 3:49:34.780]  skills and it's just gross well i'm a libertarian i think if somebody wants to chop their stuff off
[3:49:34.780 --> 3:49:41.020]  they can do it but we shouldn't have to pay for it federally and a bunch of states make you pay
[3:49:41.020 --> 3:49:47.100]  for mentally ill people to chop their Johnson off no in san francisco the the city funded hormone
[3:49:47.100 --> 3:49:52.460]  replacement therapy um and there was many people that took advantage of that i come from a country
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:57.500]  with universal health care oh right well every dick that's chopped off in the uk i've partially paid
[3:49:57.500 --> 3:50:03.740]  for okay how does that make you feel not very good i'm not gonna lie i'm in austin they make you pay
[3:50:03.740 --> 3:50:09.340]  for abortions yeah i mean you know i don't have the money to move the office out of here i would
[3:50:09.340 --> 3:50:14.860]  if i had the money well they rent for what a dollar a month and then um now we're paying for all of the
[3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:20.460]  the travel they were not paying for the abortions per se but all the expensive that exactly we were
[3:50:20.460 --> 3:50:26.060]  paying for it so the state passed a law saying you can't do that it's immoral so they bypassed it
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:31.420]  right and and so basically they're they're trying to make it easier for people to be able to attain
[3:50:31.420 --> 3:50:35.340]  these abortions and and again i'm a christian i do believe in god that this is a lot of metaphysical
[3:50:35.340 --> 3:50:39.340]  stuff people can't prove and and and most the establishment say their atheists really aren't
[3:50:39.340 --> 3:50:44.780]  i believe that you're a real atheist sargon and i respect your opinion but even the attorney general
[3:50:44.780 --> 3:50:51.020]  came out and said the democrats want to destroy goodness for no reason they're a satanic force
[3:50:51.020 --> 3:50:54.860]  he goes i couldn't believe it myself but they really want to sexualize kids they really want to
[3:50:54.860 --> 3:50:59.660]  pull down america and he gave this big 45 minute speech basically saying we're facing devil worshipers
[3:50:59.660 --> 3:51:05.100]  now i can get your view saying there isn't really a secret force or whatever okay but but there are
[3:51:05.100 --> 3:51:11.260]  art types of really evil people yes i'm not saying there isn't even a secret force i'm just saying
[3:51:11.260 --> 3:51:16.700]  i'm not aware of the causal connection but that's that's just my ignorance i would even call that
[3:51:16.700 --> 3:51:22.460]  atheist that i'd call that agnostic or when it comes to god um yeah but i mean i think the
[3:51:22.460 --> 3:51:27.340]  important thing is that anyone can hold any belief they want you know i'm not really interested
[3:51:27.340 --> 3:51:30.700]  in i'm not you're not trying to police people yeah i'm exactly i'm not trying to take away god
[3:51:30.700 --> 3:51:35.020]  from people anything like that i'm more interested in secularism so even if you hold a religious
[3:51:35.020 --> 3:51:40.540]  conviction secularism is like yeah i mean liberalism leftist is it's the new religion
[3:51:41.260 --> 3:51:45.900]  yes the new state but what and i'm an atheist when it comes to the state being god yes like i'm
[3:51:45.900 --> 3:51:54.060]  very atheistic against the left so you're you're you want um you want secularism too you don't want
[3:51:54.060 --> 3:51:58.620]  them imposing their version of god on you yes but their secularism is enforcing their
[3:51:58.620 --> 3:52:03.980]  environmental god and they're go after little boys ding ding god i don't like that god no i
[3:52:03.980 --> 3:52:09.820]  i can't say i'm a big fan myself but uh i the worst part is right that in in any other in any
[3:52:09.820 --> 3:52:13.740]  other context many of the things they're asking for are not necessarily unreasonable because
[3:52:13.740 --> 3:52:18.780]  there are some a small number of people but they attach they attach reasonable sounding stuff
[3:52:18.780 --> 3:52:23.340]  there's a whole train of bs exactly it's it's where it goes that's the problem because i would
[3:52:23.340 --> 3:52:30.540]  like those people to not be emotionally damaged and bullied and you know i'm not bullying anybody
[3:52:30.540 --> 3:52:36.060]  i don't even care not you but you know that i agree that's you know that's something because
[3:52:36.060 --> 3:52:40.540]  i agree that polluting the earth is a bad idea i live on the earth i don't want to breathe polluted
[3:52:40.540 --> 3:52:45.420]  paying al gore carbon tax is not a good idea exactly but that exactly though in my local
[3:52:45.420 --> 3:52:50.540]  town um the local paper did a thing uh they surveyed people and found that most people were
[3:52:50.540 --> 3:52:57.180]  prepared to you know to pay higher taxes to fight carbon and i'm like come on you know there is a
[3:52:57.180 --> 3:53:02.620]  what what is the the local council in swindon going to do about car by the way england already
[3:53:02.620 --> 3:53:07.180]  shipped all its steel mills to india who has no environmental standards you cut your standards
[3:53:07.180 --> 3:53:12.300]  are better that puts net more carbon out none of it even makes sense except it's a power grab
[3:53:12.300 --> 3:53:16.620]  yeah it's it's it's ridiculous that they think they can pay taxes for the government to fix this
[3:53:16.620 --> 3:53:19.980]  because there's no what are we going to debate i want to open the phones up tomorrow by the way
[3:53:19.980 --> 3:53:25.020]  today we're going uh we're going to have leon with us tonight in studio uh you know uh bekka's
[3:53:25.020 --> 3:53:28.940]  gonna be behind the scenes running things she's welcome to be up up here with us i love it uh
[3:53:28.940 --> 3:53:32.780]  and we're also going to have all the other hosts we're going to be covering the democrat debates
[3:53:32.780 --> 3:53:36.460]  you wanted to get some into that what do you think's coming up tonight uh i imagine it's
[3:53:36.460 --> 3:53:42.860]  going to be done all in spanish they did that a few times ago i know i think they're going to go
[3:53:42.860 --> 3:53:48.060]  after biden big time but i think it's going to be mainly just attack trump who is the most for
[3:53:48.060 --> 3:53:52.300]  impeachment what do you ladies think i well i think they'll probably give the least amount of time to
[3:53:52.300 --> 3:53:58.860]  tulsi because they're threatened by her i i imagine we'll see a lot of diversion away from her and
[3:53:58.860 --> 3:54:04.220]  focus attention on biden and yeah to always attack trump it's just like that's all they do every
[3:54:04.220 --> 3:54:10.140]  debate it's just attack trump orange man bad so that's all it's gonna say and i think biden is
[3:54:10.140 --> 3:54:15.740]  is making the move to to say well none of my family is going to be taking a position in politics
[3:54:15.740 --> 3:54:19.660]  if i get elected now that you know hunter biden's been exposed and he's out so it's gonna they're
[3:54:19.660 --> 3:54:26.380]  gonna turn and point the finger at trump and how his family is involved in in in his administration
[3:54:26.380 --> 3:54:31.900]  so it's it's the elinsky tactic and you're gonna be co-hosting tonight yay i will be somewhere
[3:54:31.900 --> 3:54:36.460]  sitting on the sidelines eating popcorn watching the show i think but i'll be in here all right
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:42.460]  you promise to come on but you look like just drug you on here yes with no makeup lian you look
[3:54:42.460 --> 3:54:46.700]  great without makeup but we will it's not the cruise fault they know you'd be here so the lights
[3:54:46.700 --> 3:54:51.580]  only are quite aimed right for you guys but it was so well tonight we're gonna be i'm actually
[3:54:51.580 --> 3:54:55.820]  gonna make lian host tonight no you're not she's gonna be right here she's gonna run no that you
[3:54:55.820 --> 3:55:00.460]  actually run the show well you're gonna run the show with will johnson and then i'm just gonna
[3:55:00.460 --> 3:55:08.060]  be on the sidelines alex there's no running the show when you're around oh come on no no that's
[3:55:08.060 --> 3:55:15.900]  ridiculous you you realize i truly do not watch the news i like it's been about a year now i am so
[3:55:15.900 --> 3:55:22.460]  disconnected from this real world i bet you're happy i'm so happy i'm in a state of constant
[3:55:22.460 --> 3:55:29.500]  bliss well i i envy you because but you understand they're trying to literally destroy me and then
[3:55:29.500 --> 3:55:34.940]  they'd want to put me in prison so i have to keep fighting plus forever i mean imagine if they really
[3:55:34.940 --> 3:55:39.180]  wanted to make me their big enemy they've really figured out how to do it so to get back to your
[3:55:39.180 --> 3:55:42.700]  point i think that you're right about tulsi i think they're gonna totally marginalize her
[3:55:42.700 --> 3:55:46.380]  because she's the only democrat left i mean yang's not too bad but she's the one who's
[3:55:46.380 --> 3:55:50.380]  like the the sort of democrat who could have a reasonable conversation with republic she has
[3:55:50.380 --> 3:55:56.300]  crossover appeal yeah exactly you know she she actually is someone who is not saying crazy things
[3:55:56.300 --> 3:56:00.860]  and that's really rare for the democratic party at the moment i mean i love the position we're
[3:56:00.860 --> 3:56:04.780]  gonna open the borders and then give all the immigrants illegal immigrants free free health care
[3:56:04.780 --> 3:56:08.060]  it's like we don't even give americans free health care what the hell are you thinking what are you
[3:56:08.060 --> 3:56:13.820]  saying to be fair she does say some crazy things i mean she has come out um for abort abortions all
[3:56:13.820 --> 3:56:19.100]  the way up to full term she might have recently come back on that i mean she's for red flag gun laws
[3:56:19.100 --> 3:56:25.260]  she's for a lot actually a lot of the party platform she actually supports which um gotten into
[3:56:25.260 --> 3:56:31.100]  in in previous shows but she has actually she is really far left but she does have that cross
[3:56:31.100 --> 3:56:35.500]  appeal and that she comes across like oh look i'm a vietnam vet and in her language is such that
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:40.940]  she can pull people from the right i do think it's an illusion she's a vietnam vet she's uh
[3:56:40.940 --> 3:56:45.500]  she's active duty yeah she's yeah so she's going to dance she's got so he looks good
[3:56:46.380 --> 3:56:50.940]  hey seriously though so good for they make the red flag laws sound reasonable all over the country
[3:56:50.940 --> 3:56:56.300]  they found out that the school police officer was taking long breaks and not doing his job
